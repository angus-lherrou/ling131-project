L. one at\nFlorida not navy in a very real very him and he looks like a guy who understands this city and it's a different kind of leadership presentation I think than those optics really really fascinating I don't know who's watching what [laughter]\nI have let's say you know to to piggyback on what you're saying I was talking let some people who are fairly new to the state of Florida and living in Jacksonville and that was the one thing they said they were like well wow those news conferences with the government look very staged and this person was there and everything was here and everything was in place and I said well\nThat's how they're always done and you know for me and because we we've normalize it so to speak because we're so used to he speaks here and says you know what you know we can replace your home and your property but not your life you know today about it\n[laughter] you know that even thought of robotic and then the person to tell me why kind of bothered me as you know as a vet but that navy and he comes on with that and then you know you're a okay yeah\nSo I Am and I believe you were here for this one four years ago when the governor or staged his his grand opening second term uh announcing he's running conference at a local business here in Jacksonville and he had employees of the business behind him all staged waving Scott signs staged they were staying\nIn and you're all be there\nOn friday I hear you saying that like the unusual\nManufactured news events about his age manage one of the governor comes to town anyway you know even no matter what\nThey see the point I wanted to be a little bit more relaxed when that's when something's happening when there's a dangerous situation you don't always have to have it set the stage it's okay to be natural\nTrying I'm trying to imagine a lax Rick Scott\nWas after here because it cuts both ways going back to the governor's race for second got Andrew Gillum in Tallahassee yesterday he did um I started off with a chainsaw spent forty five minutes chain selling trees\nA camera crew from his campaign was they're filming a reporter asked and said well it's a public event he has a right to film but is Andrew Gillum guilty of using the storms of sort of furnishes reputation share your not yeah\nWell I think we see this all the time we saw locally with Irma I think we see it all over Florida I think we see it in every state that uh has horrible disasters\nAnd I don't you know we don't know whether the people tire of it or not I do think it has the potential to make people deeply deeply cynical yeah and we're cynical enough already\nHas a good point but I think the the idea of doing you know change song trees and using that in a commercial is staged in his goofy and is the world in which we live that that's where politicians do\nIt but there's always the issue that we don't we don't elect people based on you know a technocratic sort of um you know let me show you exactly what I did behind the scenes that doesn't work very well for commercial so yeah they chainsaw downed trees ... that is the type of thing that works in the commercial or at least has the potential of working when\nYou know a shot of the mayor or city in an office to just you know\nMonitoring the situation and you know said that's not good TV\nYeah and five four nine two nights we seven for your call them we've been talking about the Senate race a little bit already but I Want to work that in for real a governor\nScott has built his reputation was storm management however there are ... remembers a nursing home desk during Irma ... that\nThat sort of sex couple of days up at the governor has taken an interesting tackled the ... campaign he decided to basically the pause at the debate was supposed to happen next week on CNN\nUm he said Governor Scott looks forward to the ... will have no time for campaigning in the next few weeks as he focuses exclusively in recovery efforts for foreseeable future five four nights you chew nine three seven for your calls but I Want to talk about a ... campaign strategy here I mean sure it is a campaign strategy right to say I'm focused on recovery of not campaigning\nYeah well I mean I'm not sure that any of us understand what a governor does when it comes to relief and recovery and rebuilding\nA watch this for almost Thirty years as a ... so I Can't tell you what politicians to do in space um what's frustrating to me simply as a citizen on a boat or is the power of incumbency in print media yeah so I mean the amount of free media that the governor will get that his opponent will not yet\nBecause he's the governor and we're all paying attention to what the state of part is going to do going to say about relief and recovery in a\nBand or do I ... it's not like he's running and somebody who's not in office I mean you know so I think a squandered um times where he where he probably could have used that power of incumbency on his own\n... but frankly I think that Scott saying was postponed the debate was probably a canny move that the thing that politicians are we use fear is\nThat look a fiddling around burns and there is a um a value and basically ... saying you know I'm I'm going to go and governor I'm ... and whatever that is yeah I think a sure he said I'm pretty sure that there are people in emergency management who are actually doing the rebuilding and doing the\nYou know the ... side of things and actually you know helping people get on with their lives um other than change song country's politicians are not showing up to help you rebuild your house but I think it's probably a better luck than focusing on the politics\nBut we can't get to a place where a politician hopes for a horrific hurricane a month before a major election I mean that's disastrous for the electoral process\nSo I ... [laughter] yeah they're solving cynical but I'm\nSure having your own campaign advertising in the past myself I'll be thirty plus years ago somebody was pre planning and going you know the worst time for the hurricane season is October ... right before November ... contingencies just in case that said\nThere's no need for advertising all you had to do is look at Twitter yesterday and you saw Governor Scott was their TV stations and news media outlets were showing video of him on the helicopter tour he was out there without even having to lift a finger on the news of the governor out and working and looking was there\nFor good or for bad reminds me of the days when governor grand used to do work days and the news media would shoot it but I don't think anybody other than maybe one of his staff with a film camera was there to document that it wasn't a create an event for a later at it was because governor brand want it to get out there and meet people and it looked good\nIt didn't look good for reelection purposes it just looked good\nYeah and and actually you know this one is your take on this angel number to take a call you know ... Bush when he was governor he had eight hurricanes within the span of less than two years you know an Jeb Bush has been kind of the gold standard you know for hurricane response I mean is is Jeb Bush to blame for Rick Scott's posturing they're [laughter]\nBlame it on ... blame it on ... you're right it did start back then but I think it's some of the things that we've been talking about how Rick Scott\nCan continues that with the navy had than mentioned right you're going out yeah doing the things that anger showcasing that and going back to the power of incumbency of you know there are lots of things that Bill Nelson is out doing but is the media covering that\nNo they're actually selling okay because he's the governor he's the governor but then there are things that Bill Nelson is doing that as a senator he's a U.S senator that we're not doing so you know what partly asked the question could Jeb Bush would be to blame ... maybe ... ...\nNot what they're doing in photo ops I mean I Love mine continually goes back to the photo op that weren't Governor Scott ... click a fly an after the shooting landed\nA posed with Lenny Curry smiling with his thumbs up that's on the dead on her one of the things he did that while there were body and the more people warning\nAnd I think the smile by them up people in the morning shows and it's it's a tip that that really demonstrate their their willingness to abuse the situation or their own game the other thing I Will say about Bill Nelson he was interviewed shortly I Believe it was CNN\nAnd he said his job there and he clearly made the point that he was there to survey the damage determine what was needed in order and recovered recovery credit has\nTo go back to Washington and make sure they got what they need but that was his role there and that's what he was doing so he may not have been taking a photo op with this leads rolled up moving to break but he's they are doing what we speculated that senator\nYeah hey I have on it I think bunnies observation about how Nelson\nHow she reports Nelson's a response in his activity might be a huge um\nChange and how we practice American politics and older politicians seasoned a you know whether he's exploiting it or not I wouldnt pretend to say but the observation is here's my job I'm going back to Washington to see what I can deliver for the people are and and assets and that says\nIsn't that his role we've been talking about the roles of you know we've been talking about what the governor supposed to do with the mayor supposed to do and what is a U.S senator supposed to do you know is that that was his role like to do that to saying hey take it back to Washington here's what we need in Florida to lead to let his ... his colleagues now this is what we need here in our state\nAnd that's where the issue of those nursing home death I think it's actually important because if you look at the the doing of the job bad that's not the photo op it's actually you know the the safety and security of citizens and\nYou know have nursing homes are are having people die in them arguably because of state not action that's more of a condemning thing then um you know being able to stand up and say\nHey Dan I'm I wanted to come back to society nodding during the call when um the caller mentioned um the photo op uh slash news conference after landing shootings\nWell I Will tell you that that victim was the most grievously injured of the Thirteen who were injured on\nBecause as a game or to be shot in the hand ... right through damaging to fingers because we talk to them other afterward that\nMeans his job his career I Know you can minimize it's gamer but that's what his job was and now the question is can he returned\nAnd the mother had a news conference and I've I haven't seen a news conference like this forever at university that University Medical center at us ... Jacksonville with\nTwenty seven journalists from around the country and she held on very well about our son was doing but yes that photo had been pop earlier with everybody smiling and then later we find that he wasn't that happy\nNo and and and really you know this is something sure I Want to bring you in on this too because you know when when the mayor was posing mayor and the governor but the mayor was smiling broadly and you you saw that treat everybody the same all saw that tweet was that sweet appropriate\nWell I'll say it was political yeah I'm going to say politically appropriate um I think it probably depends on your perspective so if we're talking about politics is it effective I don't know [noise]\nYeah I mean it's it's definitely something that we're going to keep coming back to because the crime issue something that we talk about time and time again on this program about talk talk about his again now um Jacksonville city leaders um mayor Cory ... say attorney Melissa Nelson um they did interviews with friendly media outlets this week\nI'm One of them was to every day rejects T the grapes in quotes I'm Talking about the gang issue curry said where it's happening is largely gangs regarding street violence we're working and collaborating together to solve it\nI'm sure of what you said you have about one percent of our population you know maybe a hundred people and hundred people whose names we knew by the way we were involved these kinds of activities I'm Dan you you've covered this stuff every\nDay I put my head down every morning and it never comes back up I never surface because of the amount of crime in not just Jacksonville but what we're experiencing in northeast Florida clay county was a place this week where a lot of nasty things happened including what appears to be a serial\nBank robber not just grandma or grandpa who needed lunch money this guy was sentenced in twenty ten\nFor hitting banks across the southeast and now it looks like he's back out there again yeah I mean I've heard this from the sheriff before and the sheriff's office does have a gang initiative where they're trying to reach out to a gang members to stop them from going any further uh in their life and telling them that if they do step over the line we will be there to get you and they do arrest them\nBut I Will tell you that there are a majority of the shootings that we get on our emergency alerts are exactly is the the sheriff says they are gang related they are gangs masquerading as music studios as rap groups and\nThey get annoyed at each other and they take the battle to the streets I just wrote up yesterday a Fifteen year old boy shot in the back of a head on the west side\nBecause he was asked where if he knew where some lead was as he was walking with his older brother he said no I don't do that stuff and it was attacked and then shot while now gang or not that makes you stop and your ...\nGoing to say that that that is different than I think what people perceive when they hear his gang related I I think we probably still have some\nYou know decades old viewer in our minds of what what gang ... Seventy sitcom ... exactly and and and that that type of thing is obviously a um an area where violence as prevalent but I wouldn't call it out your traditionally gang related\nBorn of one of the more important things I think that came up in in even the interviews that they gave is this idea of\nWe have to deal with the children I think that that is one of the areas where Jacksonville has failed\nIf you go back and look at Michael Jackson journey the entire point of it was you get these kids you get them at a young age\nAnd and you change the trajectory of their life but the results aren't going to show up immediately and and as as a city maybe as a country we're not good with this idea of invested in children now to solve the crime problem Twenty years from now but that's really what what I think needs to be done time he had a caller\nAnd hope that that was talking about investments here he's been on hold for a long time and I I waited to get tuned 'til now Staley peace Scott called in a failure on first coast connector and tell us what's on your mind\n[noise] ... yeah so my main concern I agree with the lady or first call uh\nSome empathy is definite need it and the building and it's similar to need to\nBack that way and let the first responders do they need to do is full as happy people of my main concern is did you see the object Soviet is faking for under a grassroots lead us\nCeiling when it gets so has four hundred million dollars and they are not able to decrease class and it's been going over ... over ten years and my my main concern here is that the the the object Sylvia has no empathy\nFor decreasing class a gay keep putting the the issue on one side of the town when it's a city a situation here when it comes to crime but when it comes to uh having community grass roots leaders involved\nThe leadership uh uh keep the doors colds when you have meetings with the leadership right on me with a grassroots leadership\nThanks Dale didn't take another call I'm Willie from Murray Hill Marino a Willie you want to talk about banks go ahead [laughter]\nThe morning I'm going\nTo come so you know I'm sure a fellow at the top\nAnd I voted for him\nAnd the mayor was a just a touch though what the sold it for them to just sit it trying to say you know crimes on one side of the cow and if they would put more money like you said four hundred million dollars in the ... and ... and then\nThe educational system you wouldn't have a lot of this crime you know you create all these kids the building or oh let's\nJust say well why you know it's easy especially you know are in a trauma Jacksonville you know we're still a serious problem for especially Rob voting time to use it they just do black\nPeople do the black side of town when really you're not doing your job that you're not doing your job where we get somebody to do the twenty first century or you know\nRight along we can get so\nHey thank you I appreciate your call 'em you know Tim Angel I want to get you in on this because you covered city hall during the off and brown years um you were you dealt with that office in the big criticism brown one of the ways was crime he wasn't solving the crime issue we're three years out from now and brown\nOn the by so pile up in the streets are still talking about street gangs you've got you know William Scott Nelson there all the same generation and yet we're not seeing movement for these people ...\n... going back to that that issue of uh you know make it looking there was all through a political lines I there is an irony of the idea that Cory did run against brown and saying oh you know you didn't solve public safety and and now you have", "show_name": "The Florida Roundup", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "13"}
