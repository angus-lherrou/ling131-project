talk\nBut his stores corporate office wouldn't let him\nHe told me shoplifting is a constant problem he still kept his people stealing but now after the police come and arrest them the da says just to let them go with a ticket\nWhen somebody does end up in custody presenters prosecutors sometimes withdraw their case anyway the guy said one habitual shoplift there came back to his store and stole again so fast that he still had the cheese sandwich from jail and his backpack\n\nThis summer I ask ... office for some data I wanted to know eight months into his term what were they actually doing with the police still arresting people for prostitution and shoplifting and was his office turning all those cases away his press guy handed me some statistics about five minutes before I sat down with crafts and our for an interview\nSo I just got this um and I have other questions for you but I'm curious you know what to do\nWith this the first time your office has kind of got a tally of the cases you're accepting and declining in this way\nThis is these are the first metrics I have seen\nA we have a general sense of what we were doing because we pass certain policies that cannot help but pushes in this direction but these metrics or the first that I've seen and so for example they reflect the fact that we're no longer charging\nSex workers with crimes because\nSimply book review them for the most part is\nVictims are we\nOn the piece of paper I could see that overall ... office had declined to prosecute about seven percent of the cases the police brought them that means that the police had arrested someone in each of those cases and each time the da's office had said no let them go we're not charging them\nUnder the previous da ... around two or three percent\nTwo and a half percent explanation rate is a rubber stamp that means what ever the police want is what I Will do\nCrafts there's office is on track to charge about two thousand fewer we'd possession prostitution and shoplifting cases this year that's compared to what the da's office did in twenty Seventeen two thousand fewer cases [noise]\nSo what about all those people\nThe people ... trying to help by not putting them in jail\nDiane I Love you come\nWe're talking about what it's like in jail\nHi this is Amanda I met her in Kensington a neighborhood in North Philly people are selling buying injecting drugs out in the open I'm just going to use first names for the women I talked to there since they all had outstanding fines and warrant\nAmanda says she's been arrested twelve times for prostitution and told me the cops have sometimes been rough with her arresting are so many times also just seemed like a waste of resources I'm a I think on the whole prostitution thing\nI think it's a great idea with them not charging anybody with anything this is what I had expected to here then I ducked into the backyard of a recovery house a place for women trying to stop using drugs\nTo sit down with another woman named ... tell I asked you can't tell what did she thinks of crashing herds decision to stop charging most prostitution cases\nUm yeah I don't think that's a good idea\n[laughter] she didn't tell stopped using heroin and moved into this recovery house a few weeks ago but she's been caught up in shoplifting and doing sex work to pay for drugs for years she kept saying that Phillies opioid problem is out of control especially in this neighborhood\nAnd it's it's a big problem in all understand that people don't want to touch it and get involved but if we avoid it\nIt's not just going to go away it's not just going away\nJust does not charging shoplifting and restitution seem like avoiding the problem too\nYes absolutely yes absolutely absolutely they're condoning my bad behavior\nShane tell is very clear she is not saying jail is the answer but the idea of getting ignored by law enforcement as flawed as the system is that feels to tell like the people in power are saying we don't care what happens to you\nAnd saying well we just can't keep sending you to jail so here you go just\nTo living in like death you know it's cool just keep moving and how everything will be fine\nI told ... office which had tell said\nPress person sent me a statement saying they do want people like her to have a way out they see sex workers as victims who need help and the da's office can help them\nIf somebody's been convicted a few times before for prostitution crashed policy is to charge them and then instead of sending them to jail put them in a diversion program where they get connected to rehab and counseling\nBut Crowder office also said charging is really not the best way to help people like ... because that can leave them stuck with a criminal record bottom line it should be easier to get help without ever getting arrested or charged at all\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nCrafts are maintains that the other crimes have declining to charge specially marijuana possession just fall into the category of gum\nBy declining the prosecution of dumb we can put more and better police resources and prosecution of resources into the prosecution of serious

B. C. U. that's an historically black college or university\nFriends to say this but it's just the truth they came looked around the community got back in the car and left 'em because they say I I just I just don't feel comfortable I'm leaving my my son or daughter here and that's something that um it's a\nSobering reality hold them out of school altogether they the plan declined\nTo campus to enroll their students um and then looked around the community there's again no grocery no no no no no real easy to read it\nIt's just it's not conducive\nFor the kinds of experiences that that that young folks and parents warmth for um their their sons or daughters and so we do all that we can at the college to be able to provide a safe or an conducive environment\nIt's going to support their learning but we need more partnership\nFrom our business community and from other stakeholders around the city of Jacksonville to partner with us because we're educating our future um and so um if there wasn't an for an award his college you have to create one because of that institution and in that community are critical to the Fort progression of the entire community\nYou know it's interesting that we're having this conversation with you today about the kings record or about northwest Jacksonville on October first twenty Eighteen which marks the fiftieth anniversary of Jacksonville\nConsolidating its city and county governments as a matter of fact there's going to be a big bashed tonight downtown at the Jesse Ball deployment center\nHonoring the big event okay and so as we mark this fifty years of consolidation it's being touted as largely a success because back in the sixties or the idea was to streamline services reduce corruption and craft in the city\nUh and ... in Jacksonville was re branded the bold new city of the south when they did this ... the negative side to consolidation\nWas the the institutional racism that was embedded in it\nBasically neighborhoods north and west of the St Johns river\nGot the short end of the stick they were ... the leaders in the African American community that encourage black voters to vote yes on consolidation said so yes for this and we will get improved city services we will get better infrastructure in our neighborhood\nWe will uh finally see some investment in the court old course city well fifty years later oh wow does promises\nNever were realized after fifty years we still see neighborhoods suffering from a lack of investment\nFood deserts as you said many neighborhoods don't even have adequate sidewalks or sewer\nBasic things that a a a big city should for all citizens and so this is a big challenge for you as president of Edward waters college because as yet there is still not the political will in Jacksonville to write these rungs\nAnd to really get serious about fixing this problem and so as you mentioned you you're going to need the private sector to step up because politically speaking that the civic side of the ledger has not really delivered on that right over many years right any administration\nWell and and as you pointed out you know the history better than I Do um but it sounds as if it's certainly long overdue a bad investment and I think where we sit you know as an institution of higher education is to say that we are worthy investment\nInvestment it with water college will have a profound and very demonstrable impact on the community there when you talk about being able to invest in educating young people when you talk about being able to invest in\nUm the folks that are in that community is long overdue and we believe in an investment e W see will in fact result in a list of an entire community and so you know one of the things again that I'll be looking to do is to really get out\nAnd beat the streets or get to know the folks in our northwest Jacksonville community I'm very excited about uh the new leadership there are and we're excited to be able to\nHave to be a champion um for the three due to a ... area code and which we fit we know that there are many challenges there um but we are excited and when we're confident that we were going to get to support that we need from the business sector as well as the continued support from from from the city and state\nWe treat the show how well Dr face on leverage his youth and increasing enrollment at Edward ... college here thirty seven years old requiring that let you\nAre ...

B. C. is in today's academic world when kids come pick from so many different types of higher education\nTell me a little bit about the the emotion the psychology the tradition the history of of young um high school seniors as they make the decision of where they want to go to college and their parents way into why they choose and H. B. C. yeah well you know I I\nI could spend a whole day you talk about his to receive H. B. C. use\nBut I'll tell you what are more interested in talking about is our contemporaneous relevance right Tom and and and when you talk about the contemporaneous relevance of H. B. C. use you're talking about the institution that produce almost thirty some odd percent of all the bachelor's degrees given to African Americans\nYou're talking about the majority of African American doctors lawyers can engineers all come from historically black colleges and universities\nSo when you talk you know when I'm Talking to a prospective parents or student about\nAnd I used to be seen by aspect parents that will ... one is if you want for your child of course they want them to be successful and I say well you're looking at institution a and his two shouldn't be\nI Want you to ask them what's the experience so best suited at that institution\nConveyed demonstrate to you with some uh empirical data that says that if you come to my institution here's what it is that we produce and when you stack up historically black colleges and universities particularly for students of color\nAnd the success that they have in graduating students seeing them onto a graduate of professional schools and or preparing them for the world of work\nHistory and and the data see if the H. B. C. you do it better than anyone else\nNow with all of that said let's mention quickly before we let you go that you're kicking off your distinguished speaker series at Edward waters college on October Eighteenth with Nikki Giovanni\nHas out there yes we're very excited about that we just recently established a distinguished speaker series at the institution and so as you mentioned on October Eighteenth of the iconic Nikki Giovanni will be opening up the first in ...\nGet Harding yes um I haven't I'm reacting to another comment your panelists just made I mean he he writes later this country is very polarized but he said that people don't listen to either\nFox News or NPR and I found that very um concerning 'cause I don't feel NPR it's as polarizing our devices a news source as Fox News\nWell thank you for that I Would agree with that I mean clearly shape them limiting enemy clarify appreciate that what I'm trying to say is there's you know\nThere are people who literally only watch Fox News there are people who only watch and listen to more liberal things and I apologize to NPR for making them poll I\nI I think for the call and I and I hear your point both of you um you know we have a lot of loyal listeners isn't the only station they listen to and that's great\nBut I Would encourage people to get your news from a wide variety of sources I think that we should all tried to do that I'm OK let's make a note of a couple of other news and notes from the week\nAlso this week the owners of Chicago pizza announced they will open today at eleven am of course the business at the Jacksonville Landing had been closed since the August ... mass shooting that killed three people\nIncluding the gunman uh he took his own life tent others shot and survived there at the good luck have fun game bar but it's opening today so um [noise]\nThe Jacksonville ending moving forward at the same time the lawsuits are moving forward in the wake of this mass shooting as well it's really just I'm Still such an awful thing to have lived through and in downtown Jacksonville guys but at least the restaurant is opening back\nAnd I'm I'm for either one to go ride or I Will be there to cover that\nUm but I'll be interested to see I mean I'm new to Jacksonville but it sounds like the ... haven't been doing well recently um and I mean I I'm sure this is going to be it's already been tough for Chicago pizza but I mean now but they're reopening like how I was just going to affect their business you know\nOthers David ... [laughter] yeah it's\nBeen a while now but the landing on me between the ... with the fights with the city and the perception people have I mean that's all they hear about when the ...\nShootings like this there was last year we had went out for us as well in the middle of a ... in the middle of a walk so so that the best probably have and it's just\nA perception that landing is kind of old it's run down there's not a lot of stuff there it used to be the place you would bring friends and family when they came to our best to play she would bring\nTo again now where would you brown the St john's right center maybe or a river\nSide or the ... okay uh Amazon which in place thousands of people in town will now pay all of its workers a minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour that's more than double the federal minimum wage of seven twenty five an hour or so uh\nThis will also exceed by the way the Florida minimum pay per hour rate which is eight twenty five Amazon moving ahead with Fifteen an hour this is part of the national movement to increase the minimum wage so our local workers at least are getting a raise starting November\nFirst yeah ... has been under a lot of pressure from a you know Senate Senate Democrats in it you know Bernie Sanders particularly using independent but\nUm he's been under a lot of pressure with this I mean the richest man in the world the richest men in the history of the modern world um you know and can't pay its workers living wage or there's been a lot of pressure now\nNow what happens next just Wal Mart follow suit to the company the size of target follow suit that'll be the next thing but I think for a lot of these people in these jobs are very new to the first coast they've opened up four of the centers are and so um you know it's it's a good surprise for them I think\nThis is interesting at that new pay rate Fifteen an hour and Amazon worker who makes the minimum would need to work more than three weeks to buy just one share of the company stock\nSo that gives you an idea of the income inequality\nIn this country All right uh finally it's our look at the strange bizarre and just plain ridiculous from around the state this week luckily there's never a shortage of material but we are tied on time this morning because we are going to NPR at nine thirty so here it is for you right now a shortened only in Florida [noise]\nAnd this one happened in our neck of the woods did you hear about\nOnly in Florida is a man ran into a truck full of\nThat how you pronounce that I Do believe it out you know an al ... has happened in king's one Georgia when a police officer tried to pull over us feeding Mercedes that actually was full of stolen mail\nThe Mercedes made it into Nassau County and state agricultural station and it ran right into the trap of alpacas I'm not sure if they got loose did they run\nFor re are they okay yeah\nI've heard that most of them are okay if you're a little injured or what they were doing when we're alpacas down [laughter]\n[noise] the driver\nHe just left his Mercedes everybody was quickly captured and the Packers we hope or OK yeah hopefully we moved from socks [laughter]\nThank you David cotton Brendan rivers Kevin ... have a great weekend guys\nWell finally this hour it's a challenge asking you to see girls differently than ... than you will see the girls some it is coming up\nIt's a focus on girls that are particularly caught up in the criminal justice system we learned more from Dr ... president and CEO of the tourists bar Weaver Policy Center senior vice president Vicki bathroom and keynote speaker Dr Maureen Walker\nDr ... let's begin with you you are heading up this whole initiative which by the way is also sponsored by the Jacksonville system of care initiative this is the fifth time you've done this it's such a groundbreaking two day event what's on the agenda this year and why is this so important\nWhen we're excited especially excited this year because our theme is hope is what we do so it really is during this time when there is so much division\nTo talk about how we bring about hope in our community to really lift up the voices in the experiences of girls and young women and those used who identifies the male who are often left out of this conversation how left at home\nWhen we think about the experiences of young girls who come into the juvenile justice system we know that the pathway is often paid by prior sexual abuse and exploitation\nAnd when we think about the different movements that are happening now because of these young girls are often out of our community there behind razor wire they are invisible their stories are not always included in the dialogue\nWith the Dolores where we've or Policy Center what you do is try to change policy a doctor ... so that these girls a have a I guess a fair shake\nIn our society because often once they get into the system there isn't an awareness of the fact that they have experienced sexual violence is not right\nAbsolutely I think we think we see these girls as just problems in our community me we see them as just their ...\nThere isn't a lot of times we don't stop to look at what has happened to them what are the experiences that happen prior to\nWhen it why they're here why they're standing in front of a judge and I think what the Policy Center that's a really good job of stopping and listening to their stories understanding what's happening in having the community also pause and listen to what's happened and recognize\nThat a lotta times it's about mental health services and not locking these girls that it's a lot of times about the trauma they've experienced um and providing services to respond to the trauma versus locking these girls up in using our juvenile justice system as a mental health provider\nIt's five for nine to nine three seven to join us as we talk about the the the girl summit Dr marine whopper you're on the line you will be giving a keynote at this event what are you going to be talking about\nWell I Will be a I'm inspired by the by the theme that that the policy center's already chosen hope is something we do and I think it's important for us to talk about that now because it's very easy for us to think of hope at some sort of um [noise]\nA fence supple wish and I think as a culture when we start to look at ourselves when we look at the whole stories of people around us we start to find ways that we can contribute\nTo healing when we talk about hope we'll be talking about particular you know particular skills what can we do other than wish things were better how do we get involved in creating healing and reconciliation\nI'm In the places where we are hurting the most and I think given all that we're seeing right now we could see that there's\nArt everywhere right now so many of the systems that we've relied on to work aren't working very well it'll so it is for us I believed to try to create space is a sanity and gentleness and bravery and healing\nSo that we can create a kind of world that we want to be a part of and that we want to leave us a legacy to the our young people\nDr ... she's right in that this nation is hurting right now in the country is just the raw wounded at the moment particularly around the topic of\nSexual abuse sexual assault\nThe Supreme Court confirmation hearings have expose these deep fault lines in our society", "show_name": "The Florida Roundup", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "06"}
