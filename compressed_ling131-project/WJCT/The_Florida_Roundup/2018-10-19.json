K. A. G. see in Panama City joining us from the bay county emergency operations center\nThere in Panama City and update for the folks are the great folks in the panhandle here still suffering many days after hurricane Michael\nWell the race for Florida is agriculture commissioner sets up a real contrast between\nThe Republican and democratic candidate this hour we're going to speak to both of them and we begin with the Democratic candidate Nikki Fried of Fort Lauderdale she joins us now Nicky thanks for being with us now\nThe contrast between you and your opponent for the agriculture commissioner race a state rep Matt called well it it it couldn't be stark or\nYour opponent and not only is he a Republican but he's a seventh generation Floridian from a family of farmers he comes from an agricultural background you are a lobbyist based in urban South Florida and you're proposing big changes for the department of agriculture and consumer services\nOr one of the items on your list it's gotten the most ... most ink and attention is that you believe your department if you're elected should take on the responsibility of managing the state's\nNascent medical marijuana industry can you explain a little bit about how you would manage medical marijuana in the state and why should voters choose your vision over your opponents\nThank you again and you know I Do see a difference between the two of us\nOn and that's you know that sort of tired of the status quo on this agency in his apartment to huge Haley overseeing\nAnd not just agriculture here in our state that all of our environmental in our water policy and consumer services concealed weapons partying\nAnd at the Fifteen year practicing attorney I come with uniquely qualified on that I had somebody who is an advocate for our citizens and today I had a lawful I'm being passed public defender or somebody who took on the big banks are in foreclosure crisis\nAnd then I seven years traveling back and forth to Tallahassee fighting for public education for our foster care and yeah for medical marijuana and what we have seen at that time and time again Tallahassee jak isn't listening to the people we've seen confrontational and then they\nBy overwhelming numbers you know and then it wind dealing with the environment of teenage years ago and she was a medical marijuana Seventy two percent and Tallahassee and legislators and the governor's office has the\nRobot every step along the way and so when I invasion in you know everything and if I get elected on November ... is it how did you read that\nAnd that we have such a unique opportunities here in our state to make a difference and saving people's lives getting them all be getting them off the pharmaceutical drugs giving a better quality of life not so much time the last couple of years talking to patients all across our state\nAnd has been begging to have access because they want a better quality of life and you know I Know that you know how many how happy his fighting\nTo be a priority and changing the direction of the office I'm moving over ... department of agriculture on making anti I'm not so many patients have to go through\nTo the doctors have to go through that very high regulations to the amount of license is a dispensary\nI'm not just a few things that allow our rural community and in our patients have better access lower the cost to start working on getting health insurance is are hovering both the annual ... are just small thing but if we are trying to kind of move forward on that\nAnd we really are standing in a way of really helping so many of our Floridians who are suffering every single day would\nYou like to expand the number of dispenser ease the number of uh of nurseries that are involved in the medical marijuana system as it now exists in Florida\nOf the biggest Chinese uh what is what happened during the last election cycle is that they put a number of attacks on the amount of centuries retail shops that are allowed to be offering a her into the license on there is in our state and we have fourteen license holders and what that means is that\nYou would you like to expand that no you\nKnow I think that never known I support I think in the constitutional [laughter] I I think putting a cap\nOn the menu retail ... seasonal um because it really prevent access or a patient\nSo our soldiers are putting up to ... and the more urban areas highly populated area and so a lot of our rules are never going to have to centuries under this regulation do you support\nThe holidays that input zoning rules in place that have essentially banned the ability of dispensaries open\nNot a hostage seasonal as well um that prevents asset and so I think that what needs to happen which is what was in the previous says a lot more local control\nOur local governments that happened during the implementation which I thought so hard on is that they have an all or nothing approach either he cannot regulate them any more than a pharmacy or you know\nAnd what's happened is that so many of our local governments you dealt with a pill mill situation\nOr they had already had come in and demanded a change in that and not an irresponsible\nOnce a specific example you can cite that were that happened\nWe saw three hundred emails that were released right after the primary of interaction with the head lobbyist nana ray with the department\nWhere there was an individual numerous individuals who had been denied their concealed weapons permit and the n._r._a. un contacted a staff member or is that we demand within twenty four hours this to be changed and in fact it was and that it they're responsible and the fact that the race had so much influence on a disposition\nUm have to stop and my opponent\nUm has run and gun legislation has been he says that this is the\nUm ... its sole job is to support the second amendment and to and\nTo protect it and showed me that he will be more of the same if not worse than what commission of Portland has done in his office he had the ability and opportunity to make changes as a legislator and somebody who's been chair of the government oversight committee and chose not to and so while I Am somebody who you know I Am a\nStaunch advocate for the second amendment as an attorney\nAt a gun owner out of the concealed weapons permit and my job is to make sure that the citizens of our said are protected and our safety comes first\nMickey if you're elected would you change the process for a law abiding Floridian to apply for a concealed weapons permit\nThe only changes that I Would make is start the conversation of moving this process over to law enforcement and ... um other than that is making sure that we're getting our jobs and thorough background checks which is already part of the law so we need to figure out why the ball is dropped and figure out how we can made it move it over to law enforcement\nLet me ask you about the do not call list we're in the heat of the election cycle I'm sure all three of us are probably getting unwanted phone calls at home or if we still have home numbers or or cell phones\nUh this is an enforcement issue that lands directly in the office of the uh agriculture commissioner how would you and forced to do not call list that ... to ... that would represent ways that would reduce these nuisance phone calls and they\nCan get your hundred percent correct we all have you know thirty plus email or phone numbers that are blocked at our cell phones and the fact\nIs that half of it enforced on and there's been no repercussions for these companies for violating the law and so we need to make sure that we are beating up the regulations\nWe're actually going after these bad actors and there were also increasing our technology technology has changed they figured out ways around our technology and we need to put money and infrastructure into place\nUh to make sure that our technology has more advanced and then start actually going after these bad actors in shutting them down um because they are violating the law every single time we get one of these the\nOn you're talking about a new a new regulation new enforcement or are you talking about new regulations additional regulations that currently are not in place\nYou know it's unfortunate that the current regulations because they just haven't been enforced and that again is the technology side of things we have an updated our technology and software system in a very long time and do the bad actors I figured out a way around it and so we need to start being smarter than them\nYou know this is interesting this racist so interesting I think because people typically think of the agriculture commissioner as the person who oversees the state's farm product but it's a huge agency with thousands of employees that is also overseen\nConsumer services in you and your campaign of release stress as you said beefing up protection of for consumers this department inspects gas\nStations that even inspect roller coasters for safety you even would go in and ah you know be overseeing the inspection of grocery stores this is just a huge far flung department and so\nWhen you look at it this was the question I Want to ask her opponent to is this department\nToo big to unwieldy shouldn't should agriculture and consumer services all be in the same office uh does that make sense is should that be revisited because the on the face of it they are two very different things\nSo if you're elected you'd be on one hand overseeing agriculture and on the other hand\nThey're reviewing roller coaster to make sure that the that\nDon't go off the tracks you know a lot of voters really grasp that that how diverse this job is and how you would see that yeah absolutely\nI you know and I think that you have to crack you know they're out is is that first of all is thirty don't notice even elected position a member of the cabinet and you know it's part of the things that some of the board um and that that are overseeing our culture and everything else there were services\nSo it is a huge position and I think that there definitely needs to be some questions about how much responsibility in that but the reality is that these things are too important to not be under a cabinet position\nThat the type of things that we need to do to protect our consumers and make sure that we're the watchdog over bad actors in the corporate structure ah it's too important into central and so I think when you get somebody like myself who is in there and you're passing attorney gone after that after him in the past Vicki\nFreed the Democratic candidate for four to ... commissioner and consumer services Nicky thanks for being with us\nYou're listening to the floor to round up from Florida public radio\nA couple of reminders for voters one early voting begins in Florida on Monday\nElection day is just two weeks away it is a November six and of course you can also follow along this program and join a conversation on social media or handle on Twitter is at Florida roundup Mac Caldwell joins us\nNow he's the Republican candidate for Florida's next agriculture commissioner or Matt welcome to the floor to round up let's start here is the portfolio for the commissioner just too big given it's everything from rural cultures to the citrus industry\nWill appreciate you having me on I I wouldn't say it's too big but it's definitely a different than maybe a lot of people assume that you know at the agricultural piece really is enormous when you compare Florida to the rest of the country you know most states\nUh your commission that culture dealing with three or four major products here Florida we've got three hundred plus commodities\nWe've got four different soil types and a half dozen climate zones and nearly a dozen courts with all the logistics and pesticides these thoughts on all the import export business with central and South America\nA so it is an enormous responsibility there but then\nUh in Florida weird unique in having given the commissioner so many other responsibilities will change his auto repair surveyor security guards a pawn shops best control\nBut but it's simply the next us as a as a ... from what I've described on the trail it's the commissioner of dirty jobs if you work outside if you wash your hands uh you're you're in a really small business blue collar profiled and the commissioners officers\nAre watching out for making sure that to watch out for public safety and welfare and overseeing the the license for that goes along with\nYour opponent with wind to include marijuana regulation inside the department of agriculture and Florida would you support that\nOh well it's a great topic I actually helped co authored the medical cannabis bill and twenty fourteen before any of the constitutional amendments you know\nThe children suffer from seizure disorders or met the folks with chronic diseases cancer and such and ah I helped a go right that Charlotte's Web billed as it was tagged in twenty fourteen to to address that need\nA I'm certainly willing to work on it I've I've advocated for changes in federal policy that will make a this issue easier and really solve a lot of the the more controversial elements that are still a bit doubling us but uh it's certainly something I'm I'm Glad to be a part of and have been for many years now\nBut but would you wouldn't go as far as your opponent is that fair to say in terms of the ag commissioner directly managing this industry it's believe you take a more conservative position is that right\n[noise] well I Would say that I Want to see the the program managed effectively a department of health I think has demonstrated they're not\nUh over here uh to to help see this program be as successful as I think it should have been a one of the challenges is that the subsequent constitutional intimate and twenty sixteen actually provides for a permanent role for department of health that it's actually one of the\nProblems that we talk about on a regular basis on a you know legislating sue constitutional amendment and so uh I'm certainly open to having the department of agriculture serving the largest capacity you can uh in whatever way is going to get the program a effectively manage to implement it in the in the state of Florida let\nMe ask you as well you are a as it's been said the central casting candidate for this position era seventh generation Floridian you come from a family of farmers you know so much about agriculture\nYour opponent is an urban night a lobbyist uh so you come at this from very different backgrounds and so uh let me ask you what would you bring to the position is someone who's grown up in the agricultural world and also\nWhat would you say to critics who feel that you've been to industry friendly particularly environmental groups that have taken issue with some of your votes in the legislature [noise]\nWell it is ironic now I'm I'm the or the agricultural candidate some of my primary opponents of criticize me because I don't work\nOr on a day to day basis on a cattle rancher citrus groves\nOr we do have a family history in the state going back to Eighteen twenty six and\nA I have advocated for ... natural resources during my last eight years in the Florida House or the district I represent today is north Fort Myers Lehigh acres in Alva uh and it's really a great a mix of issues you know Elvis
