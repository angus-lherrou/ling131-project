J. C. G. public broadcasting in Jacksonville I'm Tom Hudson\nAnd I'm Melissa rice just ahead we speak with democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum about everything from health insurance to paying teachers fifty thousand dollars a year also Republican run to Santa's goes after Gillum on taxes and\nThe first debate between governor Rick Scott and Senator Bill Nelson turns nasty will it turn off voters\nLots to talk about this week in the sunshine state throughout the peninsula joined the conversation three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred or on Twitter at soared around ... it's all up after the news [noise]\nA Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage or Amazon by the way just came out and said they will be paying their employees that how do you propose to pay for these initiatives\nWell on on teachers um well we have laid out as a plan that would um make the corporate tax rate in the state of Florida comparable to that of our neighbors in Georgia and Alabama I'm uh with the third largest state all of America and the truth is is that in\nOrder to educate our kids right now the for the education system is ranked about forty is out of fifty thing quality are teachers on average make an average salary that is the forty fifth lowest out of fifty states with the third largest state in America\nThe question is is is is how is it that we're gonna continue to compete not only\nAcross the the fifty states but across the you know the ... the the world\nUh considering that we live in a global economy we have got to develop the future workforce and invest in our next generation\nNot only leaders but our next generation entrepreneur is a innovators I'm On the corporate tax rate only three percent of companies in the state of Florida pay the corporate tax rate now we're not asking to expand that in fact\nUnder my minister ration uh companies will pay less over my ten year than they paid under Rick Scott's tenure was simply saying is that if we're going to produce the workforce that we need we got to ensure that we're paying teachers what they're worth\nThat we're investing in our kids and that we re infused back into our public education system the kind of skills training that used to exist while I while college worked for me for my older brothers was woodwork shop mechanical electrical technical programs all of that ah allow those folks to get a skill that they could monetize go to work and get a good job\nAnd we basically exhausted that writ large across the uh public education system creating only the specialty programs for a few when we know that roughly half our kids on on their way to community college university and we got to support them\nAnd let me ask you about the fifty thousand dollar teacher pay initiative that you have is that across the board and would that be mandated by the state in other words it would be a policy that would be a set forth in Tallahassee for local school boards to have to follow in would that fifty thousand dollars to be the same and Deval county where my colleague isn't the same in Miami Dade County where I Am\nWell the dollar menus the same and both those counties hum and we all face and affordable housing crisis in both those counties in the counties all across the state to include rural areas of our state um\nWhat I Would say is we're going to work with the sixty seven counties and to make sure that we have a sustainable plan for increasing a teacher salaries are too above the national average so it's not\nSo we're not require the school districts to do\nWe are not going to disrupt what is a very active bargaining uh between the teachers are organized teachers' union in the school board so we can't disrupt that process\nIs one that's in place of well established but what we're setting is a North Star for where we want to go as a state and what we're simply saying to our policy is Florida can be better than average of ... at least needs to be at average when it comes to teacher pay but we can be better than average teachers should not spend their time mood lighting\nUp between being retail workers at night and then teaching our kids in the daytime it used to be an honorable middle class profession\nAnd we have slowly but surely a remove that distinction and designation from teachers and now we're having a hard time recruiting teachers and to this state\nA A N and maintaining the within the profession the way that I had the same teacher that my brother's before me had and and and and the older ones before that had because we're losing many of these dedicated committed professionals because they can't afford it anymore\nAnd let me ask you about healthcare mayor Gillum or you have a set on the campaign trail and on television and new ads that you believe that health care is a right not a privilege you've called for\nAn expanding Medicaid for more than eight hundred thousand Florida residents you want protections for pre existing conditions are in the area of health care or the contrast between you and your opponent run to Santa seems the darkest\nYou have charged your opponent or Mr dissent is with seeking to end protections for patients with pre existing conditions he's pushed back on that accusation a\nHow well you work with the legislature to expand Medicaid or and and expand healthcare coverage in Florida given that if you are elected governor you'll be working with a pretty conservative legislature\nYeah I'm simply going to ask the legislature to do the bidding of the people of the state of Florida not special interests\nAre not big insurers are the one in five people in our state are terrified of getting sick\nThey fear that one illness may put them in the poor house in bankruptcy and I'm not just talking about working poor\nI'm Talking about middle class families who get up every day to get out there and provide for themselves and their families I'm Talking about small business owners who are finding it extremely difficult to provide full coverage for their employees because of the the the the rising cost\nAnd so what we've said is that if we expand access to health care for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically maybe people in our state\nUh we will pull down six billion dollars from the federal government that right now is being distributed to other states because Florida has decided to put our heads in the sand when it comes to expanding access to a to Medicaid not only is it important to expand access for those who are uninsured one in five people in our state\nBut it's also important for small business owners and those of us who do have insurance because when we look at our premium increases year over year over year they're increasing without protection because the system has to pay for itself one way or another and right now those uninsured getting access to emergency rooms which is the most expensive and least efficient form of care\nI Am not accusing my opponent of anything that he himself has not said or done\nUm I don't believe in and and and and and and being dishonest and the course of these races is my opponent who voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act repeatedly and joined an obstructionist wing of the Republican Party in Congress to do so as my opponent who said the reason why we don't have to provide health care for all this because everybody has access to an emergency room\nIt is my opponent who was advocated for re ... uh requiring um I'm I'm a insurance companies not to have to cover people with preexisting conditions\nAnd let me ask you about that point Mr Mayor would you support a A R advocate or or or lobby the legislature if elected for a state law in Florida that requires health insurance companies to cover pre existing passion saw ...\nAbsolutely it is it is the federal status quo and not to be the status quo here in the state of Florida\nCancer patients folks with diabetes um even age in some cases in in the state of Florida a pregnant woman is a pre existing condition who among us would believe that you should be able to discriminate\nOr coverage for those individuals uh simply because of of of those conditions I mean Americans by and large all come to the table or with some form of of of of of of health issues and so we can't go back to where we once were that's what we've actually tried to eradicate from the system there is not kind of ramp and help the syringe individual\nMandate anymore for the Affordable CARE Act would you like to have an individual mandate in the state of Florida\nListen I think we've got to move as many people into the pool as possible to include a healthy is as well as the ... in that pool we have to share the low\nLow what'd you mandating that than require Floridians to have health insurance is what\nI'm going to require is that we work with the legislature to expand Medicaid are and what we want to do work with our insurance companies to ensure more people um it is unacceptable for Fifteen Percent of the people in this day not to have access to health care as governor I Will work diligently to expand access\nGillum uh let me ask you a strategy question are you surprised a lot of people in the primary uh expanding the Democratic side of the electorate\nUh putting together a coalition that seem to recall the Obama coalition that won the state twice\nOr the other day you campaigned in ... a print and serve it if corner of Florida and drew a huge crowd are pretty big crowd for ... for a democratic candidate that are caught a lot of eyeballs um but ... ... ...\nWhat is the challenge though for you going into November to turn out voters\nA given that your opponent or Mr dissent is is going to have a very motivated base as well uh yeah turn out voters and the latest polling in this race chose the two of you essentially tied and so not only is everyone in Florida watching this race the eyes of the nation are on this race so ah how\nDo you plan to go forward between now and election day\nTo turn out not only base democratic voters but how how do you plan to win over ...\nA after the socialist tag didn't seem to work\nUm the Santa says well Andrew Gillum is going to be the Democratic governor that is going to Institute the state income tax changes the bogeyman Republicans have played over and over again which promptly cause Andrew Gillum very next day to say no such thing there will be no state income tax and democratic governor\nAnd we heard it and I think the first part of this interview you haven't Andrew Gillum a confident\nA drum poll driven because the polls suggest in every single one he is a head he's sounding like a front runner he's running like a front runner and I think in this stage of the campaign thus far you see the dynamic say that we're for the first time the Democrats unlike in years past really seemed to have\nA great degree of wind that they're back going forward\nWe've got a lot of calls coming in about Florida issues especially red tide water quality the environment will get to those calls in a moment but Makin front and I want you to ah to talk about the impact of what has happened today on this Friday the cloture vote in the United States Senate regarding a judge Brett Kavanaugh's\nNomination to the United States Supreme court obviously a federal issue a but how does that affect the non party affiliated voter the one at every three voters and the state of Florida ... the ground game that is necessary to get to win in November ... about it\n[noise] I don't I'm\nI'm a little ambivalent about the impact of are becoming a ... a confirmation fight in a perverse way I think that ah when you're talking about intensity and you're talking about in turn out\nI think that if a Kavanaugh's confirmed isn't it appears he will be that the anger yes people will be Democrats and um and it might increase their intensity shooting fail the angry people will be Republicans and it might increase their um intensity and turnout\nI project my cell phone to this I you know I'm as everyone knows I loathe Donald Trump I think he's a clear and present danger to American democracy\nBut the chairman I'll Fight has placed me any unconventional an uncomfortable position\nOf being on the same side of him for the first time and I think if you\nLook at Bill Kristol and you know a lot of never Trump or around the country that had a similar effect now whether this will be important at the poll a I don't know but what dying Feinstein and the others on the committee and their allies in the press\nHave done is reminded\nThose of us who were focused on Trump and his defects about why we don't like Democrat\nFernandez excite either the bases anymore in Florida than they already were excited\nYou know I don't believe so principally because here in Florida when you look at how the senators are voting Rubio was voting along party lines on this as his nails and it's not like in a perhaps West Virginia or main when the Collins and mentioned votes might go opposite to what their parties are going to be doing that there may be an impact and and look I hate to be cynical about this but\nIt looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed tomorrow which would be October six\nAnd we're talking about what the election in November ... days from now when a new cycle last twenty five minutes or in Trump's America so I I think the the residents won't be as much a month from now as as folks like\nThe way it is today and if you're just sitting in a round the yeah and you agree with that Mac or at\nLeast this time next week nobody will probably remember who Kevin Oh it was because Donald Trump will move the carrier task force\nPoster rent or something [laughter] who can predict right uh if you're just tuning in the Florida round up is live\nFrom way down at the bottom of the Florida peninsula we're lived through the eyes for court or up in North Florida in Jacksonville over a west of us in Gainesville we are taking calls all around the state right now at three o five nine nine five Eighteen hundred as we talk about this tight governor's race\nBetween Andrew Gillum and Ron descendants with strategist smack Stefan of itch and Fernando a Monday\nLet's go to Bianca in Stewart she says she's a single issue voter Bianca what's your big issue\nThe issue is the river quality I live in the door and I'm right on the Indian River lagoon\nAnd my I grew up on the water my twenty year old sister had breast cancer along with Martin County having the highest breast cancer rate in the whole state\nAnd now I have a son who Everytime I take him to the pediatrician they asked me has he been exposed to the river I just don't understand how we live in a state\nSurrounded by water and we can't go near our beaches are close our children are getting sick by breathing in our dogs are dying by drinking water I'm just appalled and if that will be my single issue voters I'm voting Democrat and Republican whoever is putting this issue first I don't care\nAnd who and who do you see is putting the issue first\nOriginally I really kind of thought that they stand it was really putting that out there he would put that first he would say that that that ... what he wants to do ... Guillen is saying that as well but and I hear ... is he saying that because more and more people are saying that that's important to them\nI don't know and kind of leaning more towards the sand is on the governor's side I'm Brian ... is an amazing he is really fighting for the\nNew mayor congressman there you know yeah your congressman there okay I've got yeah thank you for that so Fernando Mac front on let's start with you these candidates are ... going after these voters who care so much about this issue\nWater in Florida whether it's river quality or the red tide that is looking shaping up to be one of the defining issues of this cycle which candidate can win the day on the issue of the environment because in this state the environment is the economy for non let's start with\nYou well you know once again to the point that the Mac and I made earlier given the fact that the Republicans own every single issue in Florida for better or for worse I think\nBoth Ron dissent is and in the case of the spillover effect to the U.S Senate race Rick Scott or on the wrong side of these issues we also see beaches literally being closed down all across the state of Florida\nNothing gets the goat of voters when they try and do the Florida thinks that they love to do fast and can't do it because of problems\nThat a lot of people end up I think correctly assigning\nTo a government mismanagement this case I Would hate to be the Republican of any contest having to defend the states environmental record right now\n... that the descent as his first policy or on issues that came out the first one was on the environment wasn't the economy wasn't jobs was in taxes\nWasn't a business development at the first issue paper out from the dissenters campaign a few weeks ago was the environment\nYeah it's it's his best chance to distinguish himself I'm from the past Twenty years and to I'm trying to\nGenerate some excitement it's kind of interesting um his criticisms on these issues or implicitly criticism of ah the Republican dominated legislature and governor Scott's I'm\n... years in office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "show_name": "The Florida Roundup", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "05"}
