outlets like BBC News for covering this story are crying foul it's been some very deep investigative reporting on this and publish some new information just this week\nBBC reporter John ... tried to gather some more information and speak to people at part of the camps here is a piece of his reporting\n[noise] ancient Jang Iran bring something here they don't want to [noise] [noise]\nFind these blue steel rules in a homeless is what China cools location or training center but it looks more like a prison\nOn the corner just outside the camp fence we stopped to speak to a family where do you guys doing it [noise]\nSome of the shows tried to stop this film buff enough to intervene\nThem speak she says I Oscar visiting [noise]\nMy dad he replies that I don't know how\nTo BBC is John ... worth reporting from ... getting China to BBC also reported discovering an enormous prison like site\nNear the city of Dublin sharing an hour from its provincial capital Ravi I Wonder if you could chime in on this particularly what we know now about how the people detained indies a voluntary re education schools are being treated\nWell I mean there's a whole bunch of reporting that his dribbling out of the last few months and I think the b._b._c. did an excellent job I'm In part because of the access or that they go to some of the people who would that but also because they had these satellite images fat\nThat showed that for an off to pitches of how much these\nDetention camps of actually expanded over the last few years which really shows that this is a growing project\nOr in in in for you know for the week where people and and what we now know is that a former prisoners from there have have been able to tell the world that they've been suffering physical and psychological torture in those camps entire families have\nHave disappeared from from that region and and a lot of this is part of the Chinese states quote re education programs as they're calling it but it turns out that it is something far more insidious far more worrying\nBecause of the conditions that they're keeping a lot of these people then it directly barring story that we can't get enough reporting on\nAnother story out of China that caught our attention that may sound funny on first blush but it's really quite serious according to the White House there are some good reasons for America to be worried about China here as vice president Pence speaking at the Hudson Institute in Washington this month\nChina has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections to put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president\nSo in light of that you might be interested in reports that China and Russia have been listening to President Trump's calls the once he makes fun and secured phone that stores his contacts\nPresident Trump dismissed the report in the New York times he tweeted the story is quote so incorrect I Do not have time here to correct it I only use government phones and have only one seldom used government cell phones story is so wrong unquote\nNow the New York times also reported that security officials were only moderately concerned because according to the times\nThe president was not spilling secrets because he rarely digs into the details of intelligence that he's shown and it's not well versed on the operational specifics of covert or military activities car and this is one of those stories and I know we're we got to move on briefly but\nThis is one of those that sounds light hearted but it's really quite serious\nI Know there's just so many points that are kind of depressing you hope that the president would take more close attention to the finer points in details of the intelligence he receives because it affects the decisions that he makes affecting how the United states deals with everybody in the world\nAnd then you know they had to have the president lash out at the New York times for being so wrong instead of maybe taking it seriously that perhaps there is a you know the threat here coming from the foreign nations that are adversaries that want to look him up\nDo being the primary issue not the you know you're not using her telephone correctly as being the primary insult\nIs very typical of the way the president has regarded stories in the media that paint him unfavorably whether that's deservedly er and deservedly in his opinion [noise]\nUm so this is all just kind of very familiar tropes and yet you're talking about very serious stuff if you have the two biggest adversary nations of the United states in the entire globe both listening in on what the president's privy to his privy to a lot he basically has more security clearance and anybody else that could be a very dangerous thing down the line if this continues\nOr story that caught our attention before we go the Titanic may set sail once again\nMore than a century after the first ill fated ocean liner say killing more than Fifteen hundred

I I Know you cover law enforcement and you cover these investigations can you tell us a little bit more about how they work in an investigation like this\nEspecially in a case like this that sort of a has many geographic parts with these these were going all over the place and of course the packages\nUm we're we're ah [noise]\nAh you know how to return addresses for the offices Debbie Wasserman Schultz through the Broward a congresswoman so\nOf course the next to this year but that is in New York to California so it's a lot of moving parts a lot of off a cooperation and for them to get DNA results back\nUm that quickly you know within days shows you that how seriously they're taking it because you know in a normal sort of run of the mill state case let's say on our DNA a might take weeks to come back\nUm so that shows you that they're really Russia they really\nMade this a priority\n[noise] three o five nine five Eighteen hundred ... joined the floor to round up from any corner of Florida ... Nick in Melbourne hey Nick thanks for holding you're on the air as well now go ahead Nick\n\nAll right Nick a if you're not there give us a call back lots of other calls though to get to wrestle in Boca Raton is with us hey hey Russell\nHow're you doing how are you good okay go ahead yeah go ahead\nWell while I I I was just going to comment um or maybe I'm stating the obvious but\nThe the crazy divided nature of of the political environment now psychological environment\n[noise] it it would support almost any weird conspiracy theory it's just like it could be people on those crazy crazy people on the left that are trying to make the right ... you know try to influence people think\nThat the way of doing something this areas or vice versa that could be\nCrazy is on the right to you know trying to make make it seem like it's so you know I'm basically to inflame the environment it could be Russia\nA middling I mean it's it's really weird that none of these devices exploded so that was either ... or ... but I I Would ... as being in ... the main thing that really really studying is that your virtual violent from a Republican\nLeader especially from a\nWell he was made a few comments about it but yeah I mean I I I should also led a folk snow that vice president Mike Pence was in Jacksonville yesterday to campaign on behalf of gubernatorial candidate Rhonda San is\nAnd while he was here he uh you know condemned uh these acts of terrorism and called for a a a robust investigation but but Russell I I appreciate what you're saying now let me ask you one more question you think do you using these devices didn't explode intentionally\nSo by that and don't think these were done as a way to sort of metal in our politics\nWell yeah I mean it's actually going but I my my mind even goes in that direction yeah\nIt's really symptomatic of what's going on here you know I\nI Am highly educated you know professor [noise] I don't I don't like biking is that I find myself going on these these ... but just a matter of what's loving the minds of knowing people\nAs to what's going on you know it's either as mentioned all said and explode or incompetence loads of them look but you know\nAnd I take your point I I think people because of where political climate is I think you're right that many Americans are\nSpeculating in all kinds of ways and I I appreciate you sharing your thoughts about that [noise] uh no that's wrestling that's Russell in Boca Raton\nWe will have to wait David as you said to just learn more from the authorities they're going to be giving a news conference in South Florida later on this afternoon meanwhile lots of calls here on the floor to round up fast as in Jacksonville ... go ahead\n\nHi Beth are you with us yes can you tell me [noise] yes go ahead Beth um yes I'm\nI'm kind of quest and we've been five I'm used to call the police or the FBI if we received a suspicious half what would make a pack of ... how did they know the forest [noise]\nYeah that's a great question thanks for that David over by a ... ... what do we know about how these packages were intercepted and what does constitute a suspicious package\n[noise] um well clearly they they all have similar um they all have similar markings after him over on bonds and we're a printed out the label so they can look for that um they have a bomb sniffing dogs\nThat I'm not a you know that can detect these types of devices so I Know they were doing sweeps last night um and uh so you know it's there's sort of a pattern and they're all very similar so but I have to be able to find them differentiate down from you know the average Amazon package\nAnd you know the postal inspectors I mean that that that ... that is that if somebody's taxes were found out I mean literally ... billion ... billion a day that's going through there so it's so it's no small task\nSure the Detroit I've actually had started off if and if you have been to the uh that describes a casino in in Hollywood that is their signature hard rock um location and it's big and it's beautiful and right now they're building this thirty story guitar shaped a hotel tower um it's amazing\nUm they actually started across the street it was a bingo hall I Believe it was in Nineteen eighty or Nineteen Seventy nine to the to December Seventy nine or ... or early eighties um it was just a bingo hall and they slowly grew this and they started picking up revenue obviously in Miami\nI'm you know have you have you have your retirement population so I got a lot of people that want it to a you know pass the time and enjoy themselves\nAnd that's looming generally had built up as they are gathered more patrons and also kind of I had some back and forth with the legislature and the parent noodles\nSo and now you have today is huge yeah mhm\n[noise] okay and it said three of five nine nine five Eighteen hundred as we talked gambling and dog racing on the floor to round up you the voter well make some decisions about that on your November ballot we want your questions and comments you can tweet the show as well at Florida roundup well\nThis is a high dollar fight then over the seminal tribe or against the para mutual and ... out of state betting operators\nIs this is this just a a a backdoor way for the existing gambling concerns to sort of protect their interest is that a fair way to describe this or not\nI wouldn't think so I think this is actually this is actually a remarkable move by the by the someone will try a which obviously has been feuding with the mutual for for at least the past you know I think since they're they're they signed a contract with the legislature in two thousand times\nUm the the tribe a obviously which has done very well for themselves and arch all the ... the the uh the medicine I'm Sorry was the Sherman who was um at a at a at an event that I was out with the tribe in July and he had said\nUm we were you know we were we came from the swamps um you know we had to do with all the strikes that was you know here we are to get lost her young um and now we're standing here in front of this beautiful hotel tower guitars too cheap tower here for all of you with the tribe wants consistency that try wants to know that their futures being protected so\nThey they want to make sure that the mutual can't grow anymore\nI'm so and then with the para mutual they see opportunities to grow but they don't exactly involve the traditional ... which are the tracks are seeing a decrease in revenue from the tracks whether they be greyhound's or our thoroughbreds uh they they want to be casinos too um but then you hear in the fight over\nYou know who gets to do what they try you know the legislature with the compact that they signed um the legislature said to the ... we're going to allow you to have exclusivity on casinos style games which are the the Black Jack the relapse slot machines [noise]\nUm but then the mutual is already a heck they grandfathers are eight eight eight of the casinos in a Broward Miami Dade to a lot they have the ... for them to have slot machines for the rest of the state cannot have them so that the tribe has this whole but again there's always been that fight 'em that the ... wants to grow and it probably doesn't want it [noise]\nUm so here we have it this is this amendment is basically the tribes saying this this this is their big wind isn't a Hail Mary this is an basically charging down the field as fast as I can\nAnd says that they can and if you're just tuning in lots of a ballot amendments will be a there when you go to vote in November sakes if you haven't already voted early one of them is amendments three and it has\nTo do with the gambling in Florida in a moment we'll talk about amendments search team which is closely related now that has to do with dog racing and Florida that's an even more intense emotional fight in some respects because it involves animals are amendment three need sixty percent of voters to pass\nLike all of the amendments and it would require state wide approval of casino style games like slot machines and the future so what do you think about that give us a call on the floor to round up three of five nine nine five Eighteen hundred Paul isn't Miramar hello Paul how are you go ahead\nMike horses just about the way they write or voter but I Want to go vote there was a little bit more information about these domestic but why is that word it one way to go like\nI I Know Paul it's so true there are a there are so many amendments and be they are very confusing Lee worded and I appreciate you pointing that out Eric's our keys and with political Florida I yeah you almost gotta wonder\nDo they are they doing this on purpose ticket [laughter]\nUses them just hoping that they asked because people not even sure what they're voting for that's the cynic in may but he's right I mean these amendments are complex they're confusing Lee worded there's a ton of them\n... only the most committed voters are going to really do their homework on these amendments so what about that well\nOne of the actually not to jump the gun on a mammoth Thirteen but obviously that amendment was challenged in uh in Leon county circuit court in a one of the one of the they ... they were to do with the the language of the amendment was was misleading and the and the and the title didn't match the actual language and\nThe argument that I Believe that the er at the state has look we only have Seventy five words there's no there's only so much room on the ballot\n'em to explain these amendments and that's where they it somewhat of an expectation that people would want to read up on it um and that's where you know people would go to you know read newspapers and whatnot but I Do agree with you even when I read I I have my my sample ballot that I got from all the un county supervisor of elections\nAnd that doesn't tell you it doesn't tell you nearly as much as you know what I Would know about it so I I almost cringe when I read it because it doesn't seem much and it is somewhat vague just ... I kind of mentions at the drive is going to be is a is not going to be affected by the amendment it doesn't tell everyone at you know everything so that's where I'm you know\nThat's where I obviously I go straight to the amendment itself but for for folks out there to pick up a can pick up a newspaper or a you know try and try and read up on a\nA lots of calls says we talk about these amendments three and Thirteen now amendments Thirteen is the other gambling amendments that you vote or will be asked to vote up or down\nOn election day it proposes a ban on wage ring on dog races and as we talk about that amendment\nOr with Eric Sarkozy in a political Florida we want to hear your calls because a greyhound racing in Florida is actually in a minority of states as even still dealing greyhound racing and we have a lot of calls about that let's go to Kelsey and ... now Hi Kelsey you're on\nThe air is wanting to a lot of worried about\nAnimals or it will be [laughter] but\nYeah a thank you for that question ah what does happen to the dogs I Know a lot of them are injured when they stop racing Eric isn't that right which is leading to some of the controversy around this\nThat's right I mean dogs do you get injured on an obviously an unfortunately dogs also also die of ... I actually toward a or one of the greyhound or the tracking Sanford was the same fertile land all kennel club\nAnd uh actually touring one of the kennels I'm ... I they they showed one dog that was actually you know do you know happy and and you know getting up and wanted to jump on me and they said well there's dogs\nIt's a returning it's going to a family in in Tennessee I was like a news retiring this is only like a year old is it oh it doesn't feel like racing anymore\nAnd I got confused like that it just doesn't feel like it'll their cages to my boss I don't feel like working you know they say they said well once the dog doesn't feel like actually you know it doesn't have the ... but I think they said it doesn't have the chasing it they they take the dog off and and the butter for adoption either the folks I talked to in San Fernando where they pointed themselves at these dogs were going to adoption agencies I think they said it was\nA Ninety six percent rate of dogs were actually getting adopted and they're there they were very protective of that and if and if one of her shows up in a shelter that they'll pull it out and make sure it gets adopted\n'em to the da da da da da da da da da you put out to pasture and and left you know left to fend for themselves or the ... or something so I'm you know it's it it didn't seem nearly as a ... a stressful as a as a first thought\nYeah and uh I Do know in some at some tracts dogs or had been\nHad been given drugs uh it's certainly a controversial topic as we speak with Eric ... than a political Florida about these gambling amendments one involving casino gambling one involving dog racing\nAnd if you're just tuning into the Florida around if we're just trying to educate all of the voters out there about what these amendments would do a and we want to know what voters and colors out there or think\nAbout dog tracks in Florida you know Florida is one of a a minority only a handful of states\nThat is still doing dog racing and due to a cork in the law the dog racing and the the gambling facilities are intertwined we're going to talk a little bit more about that on the show\nAs well and take your calls as we continue talking election stuff here on the floor to round up from Florida public radio\n\nOkay let's go to Cathy in Bradenton now Hi Cathy go ahead\nHi I'm a dog that terrible like Eric they live in pay is they are not taken out by um I talked to people who have adopted that might have friends that have it got it down I have friends that work and all\nThat where the doctor how many after the ... racing and the dogs are not in good shape it's high it's take God out of the rate that we need to stop using it Dr Martin at all I've been doing that red fruit and for a long time this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Florida Roundup", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "26"}
