Panama City what did you see around Panama City when you were able to finally get out of out of Yossi\nYeah so I mean when we first got out what kind of hit you which is interesting the first thing that you hit you as the smell of pine trees there were so many trees down in that area\nUm the EOC is kind of in that out most evacuation zone I'm so there was just a lot of trees a lot of neighborhoods on so many trees were down those roads were blocked initially we didn't even make it to Mexico beach we got is about as far as Lynn haven\nUm but you know the destruction was so widespread there regardless you know there's massive trees uprooted nowhere you looked was really untouched I you know I saw buildings with brick walls that look basically peeled off people's houses just trees through them all the way back um modular homes as you can imagine fared much much worse\nDoors to people evacuate in the area where they ah were were they ... you know moving away from that a coastline is you've got put in place the OC\nBy the time I got to the IRS the everybody was bunker down um and then when I got out I met people that you know chose not to evacuate and they just did what they could either they they were telling me that they they couldn't make it they had too many kids or they just thought that it wasn't going to be so bad I mean it really turned into such a massive storm so quickly\nUm you know I met families that said you know I've been through pitch Katrina through ... through other storms I'm but they told me this time after what they went through and just just barely holding on to their lives and they are going to evacuate next time\nBryan Norcross is a hurricane specialist for ... television in Miami formally with the weather channel he's with us here we'll talk about the the speed at which ah Michael developed in and came into the pan handle\nDoris we've heard some reports of folks that didn't evacuate because they couldn't find any gasoline or or provisions to get out what kind of preparations did you see before the storm\nYeah driving up a intimate county to that you see basically all the roads were clear apart from those gas stations that weren't boarded up you stop people filling up a about his last minute and then getting out\nFor us it took us to go through Georgia and then back down through Tallahassee into areas that were also really hard hit a no service and the gases scared so by the time we got to get Tallahassee we found some gas but\nPeople were still loading up even after the storm just trying to get out\nBlur stick with us or three zero five nine five Eighteen hundred talking about hurricane Michael what do you want to know or did you evacuated are you a a a curious and worried about friends or family in the panhandle what have you heard\nFrom a associates that may be living in or around the worst and hardest hit areas of Panama City three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred let's go to Tallahassee WFSU and the news director at her sister station in the capital city when hat or a Lynn a described estate response here in the book tours the two and a half days or so\nSince uh folks were able to kind of a ... the initial damage\nWell the responders are still trying to get out and to some of these outlined county is as you've just heard um it's really difficult getting out into bay county especially um roads are still heavily blocked as you now know the same is true for Franklin County I'm Greg is actually in Appalachia cola\nUm highway Ninety eight major artery currently washed out the state is trying to figure out\nHow to rebuild a giant chunk of that between east plan and care about that's about a thirty mile\nStretch right there um and it is coastal and its\nBuckled at parts of it are gone um and so the state is really focused on how to get the roadways back up and running and really had a gate crews on the ground um I actually talked to some people out and Panama City who said that today there are now starting to see\nUtility vehicles rolling in and both bay and Franklin at pretty much blocked people from coming into their areas only the first responders and only the utility crews\nUm where they trying to lead it and everybody else they've told to basically weights and so that's pretty much where we are now\nI Want to ask you about those utility crews but also ah for folks who may be listening in other parts of the state that evacuated the message from first responders is to stay away for now in\nThe Methodist to stay away from now um there's massive damage um the further out west you go from Tallahassee the worse the damage gets\n'em because again the hurricane did come unsure as soon as you get to Panama City um it's starting to look just really bad we've got aerial photos we had to actually helicopter accrue over there I'm from Florida State university because the\nPanama City campus is completely wrecked so they're ... they're they're telling people to stay away and the damage on the ground\nIs I mean it looks like a bomb hit it that's the best way I can describe it and that's from the images that I've seen that were given to me um by Florida State university officials I'm I'm looking at him right now it's it's really bad\nYeah for folks that have seen this devastation or Bryan Norcross hurricane specialist with W. P. O. G. television in Miami formally of the weather channel Brian uh when you see this video for anybody who lived in South Florida in Nineteen Ninety two uh it is a a very familiar scene of just utter devastation\nIt's reminiscent of that bomb went off kind of thing it's caused by different things in in South Florida the visuals that we have in our mind are really all wind storm\nWere hurricane from Hurricane Andrew when we looked at Mexico beach we're talking about mostly storm surge there they got wind and storm surge but it was the storm surge\nThat push one house into the next one and wipe the houses off those slabs of course they had houses sitting right on the ground right next to the beach to which would not be generally recommended in in coastal communities these days\nAnd then we'll talk a little bit about building codes and how the panhandle was situated to handle this or not lend let me ask you a about power outages and communications I mentioned five counties in Florida were entirely in the dark last night uh you mentioned uh some utility crews getting through what about communications and cell phone service\nA communication and cell phone service has completely down in ... county hum I have not been able to verify this but I have been told we actually have a tower and bay county and I believe that there might be something on our power and bake county\nUm that has fallen off and those air crews heading out to our tower in Bay county this is the if they can't get it back up\nThey county has no communication system they've been using sat phones and basically sending carrier pigeon to get messages out now and they're actually nine county I'm In north Florida right now that are at Ninety nine percent\nOf people without power you know it is the ...\nWith a W F T what were your experiences with communication is you are left bay county in the Panama City area in the hours after the storm and made your way through a back into a central Florida\nYeah I mean it was no better bay county there was maybe one bar of service sometimes occasionally and and at certain points it got worse\nUm for a lot of families that I met on the way out you know they had the same thing too they couldn't get in contact with their families just to let them know that they had made it through the storm here um so you know that that communication was down all the way through\nBut let me take a phone call from Sarasota Brent online for Brent go ahead you're on the radio\nThere thank you my name's Brett a driving or ... or ... or ... corporate drug generator\nGas or or or I could go on and I want to distribute those in the church is better in the area that I'm a pretty\nOpen to drive in the Arab wondering what the access a medium sized trucking there\n[noise] uh Lynn let me put that question do you I think I can is back open now is that correct\nI ten is back open but they are not you I'm anyone aside from first responders off of the ... the Panama City so I Would suggest if you are going to try and get there you're gonna have to take them alternative routes and that's true for a lot of these\nOf that heating up of the earth in quote that was from US Senator Bill Nelson\nUh Brian ... the science is still being collected on hurricane Michael certainly but what were the the conditions that fueled that rapid intensification it went from a depression to a cat for in less than a week\nSo which is not uncommon in the Gulf of Mexico by the way it's also not uncommon or near Florida Hurricane Andrew went from a category one storm barely hurricane to hitting as a category five and exactly two days\nSo in the waters around Florida we have deep warm pools of water\nIn the Gulf of Mexico if a hurricane goes over one of those deep one poll warm polls like Katrina did like read it did it will blow up it's kind of dumb luck\nNow having said that research in University of Miami shows that the Gulf is on average slightly warmer has been warming every decade slightly\nSo the increase in warmth of the water affects the hurricane but the fact is that Hurricane Katrina came along in Nineteen sixty nine at a hundred and Seventy five miles per hour was stronger than this and it was not even two hundred miles from where this one made landfall so these kinds of hurricanes\nHas happened over the years and the warming is on the on the edges but it is a factor\nKate signed a environmental transportation reporter uh W. while they're in a scientist will always say not to draw conclusions from any one particular weather event when it comes to climate and climate change but this report that came out this week\nFrom a un a group of scientists regarding climate change ah had some some dire concerns dire warnings globally what were some of the takeaways for you\nWell so this report looked at a threshold that\nBasically of one and a half degrees Celsius of warming and which is about to point seven degrees Fahrenheit and for some context we are currently we've experienced about one degree of one degree Celsius of global warming since I'm\nBasically that the pre industrial period so kind of like when the when the people the world started churning out more carbon interruptions but they're you know their transportation in factories and everything [noise]\nUm so the scientists looked at this one and a half degrees Celsius threshold\nAnd how close we are too ... meeting or surpassing that and what they found was that if current trends with emissions continue we're going to hit that number um possibly as soon as twenty thirty so just twelve years from now\nUm they gave a window between twenty twenty thirty and twenty fifty two\nAnd what that means is that\nThe world is going to start to experience potentially many more severe droughts heat waves you know the oceans will rise ... more ... more faster yeah faster yeah um and another big part of this report was looking at\nWhat we can do to\nNot have that happen the scientist they were like the window is still open for us to save ourselves by cutting emissions but it's closing very very quickly\nThis was a comprehensive a global look at this but what were the takeaway is for you Kate for Florida specifically\nSo one of the interesting components of this report is that the researchers looked at what if we keep global warming at\nA degree and a half Celsius rather than going letting it go higher than that to two degrees Celsius\nAnd what I found that was relevant to Florida is they looked at how many people would be affected by sea level rise at a degree and a half versus two degrees they looked at the coral reefs and they looked at people affected by a water scarcity and heat waves\nAnd they found that if we keep global warming at just a degree and a half of ... a degree and a half Celsius\nThat means ten million fewer people are going to be affected by sea level rise obviously that's a big concern for us here and that keeping it at a degree and a half instead of two degrees assuming that we will still have ... reefs left in the world if we go to two degrees Celsius wink and a half coral reefs anymore and you think about what that means for South Florida's fishing and tourism and our economy here that's really important\nYeah and coral reefs play a role with storms too don't they Brian\nExactly it to any kind of re factually under breaks up because of the storm surge and affects the storm surge the discussion of global warming and hurricanes as complicated because both\nExtra central threats to life in Florida right just like hurricane Michael is going to change forever what Mexico beach is in the panhandle and I have a dramatic effect on Panama City\nIn South Florida here there's no question that sea level rise is is a threat to life in this region\nBut next year or hurricane could come along like happened in Nineteen twenty six and\nAnd that happened a on other parts of the coast dramatic hurricanes like Michael like Andrew but over the commercial center that would change life here because it would drive businesses away a drive cruise lines away Dr airplanes away drive\nA people why they have to get their jobs and have to live and work and can't wait\nFor infrastructure to be restored for months and years so they are both\nUh threats and they're they are internal locked eventually at the current time we were actually independent threats and we have to think of them were\nWell and it's interesting to hear too I'm from\nPolitical leaders right now who are who are looking at both this IPC the report from the the scientist for the\nUm inner governmental panel on climate change and who are leading the states or the hurricane I spoke with state senator Jose Javier Rodriguez earlier this week and he was looking at king tide flooding around him or to Miami right\nUm and she was saying you know this I PCC report really highlights the need for Florida to have a unified state wide plan to respond to climate change but I think what we're hearing with hurricane Michael is the need for\nYou know looking at our resilience in terms of not just climate but hurricanes and the connection between hurricanes and climate because you hear about things like how prepared that area is\nFor hurricanes and for potentially storms that\nGet more severe more quickly and there are clearly gas\nWell and it's not even get more severe more click a quickly it's just have a real hurricane you know they just haven't\nHad any in this period of time that they've had massive developments yeah the fact is that Florida is a precarious natural environment\nIt always has been it always will be now we've built these tremendous cities and the huge communities in this precarious national a natural environment without state leadership ...\nOn how to do it in a resilient sort of way and that's fundamentally what's that\nWe are stuck out on the peninsula squeezed between two great bodies of water the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic ocean and or in the panhandle is well we've got phone calls on this issue three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred state wide here on the floor to round up you can also reach us on Twitter at Florida round up follow us there as well at Florida round up on Twitter will or begin this segment and\nWith Susan Susan you've been very patient go ahead\nHi I'm I've lived in Florida most of my life and even without the Ninety seven percent of the world scientists I'm sounding the alarm I have seen these storms and their frequency intensify I'm not just here in Florida that all the natural disasters that we're seeing across the globe\nAnd you have to really turn to try to blind I not to see the trend\nFollowing let all the scientists have been warning for years and I get pretty upset when I hear all the you know record this and hottest year on record in hottest December and worst storm and record store I'm ... and that is neat and not regularly making that connection for the public that doesn't know\nThat this is what we can expect as climate have intensified and I think that as as a as human beings I I don't understand how we can be so irresponsible not act as if this is the emergency that it is it whatever the benefit is switch to renewable energy\nOn and get away from fossil fuel burning it got to be less than ... billion if not trillions that we're spending on the storms and other people that are dying as a result of the disaster\nSusan I hearing I let me let me put that to a couple of a professional communicators are that are with us here right now I'm a ... weather forecaster\nA meteorologist and ... and environmental journalist what about the critique that Susan has Brian about ah communicating in her estimation that connection between these kinds of ah of disasters and then the broader picture of climate change so\nLet's let's separate or a couple of things one is if you thought about hurricanes in the Nineteen forties a category for hurricane hit a Miami Dade County Nineteen forty five a category for hit Broward and forty seven category for hit Monroe in forty eight category for hit to Palm Beach county forty nine strongest\nEver to hit the ... say they're Nineteen thirty five and ... and another category\nFor his downtown Miami in Nineteen fifty so it's not with hurricanes that were suddenly seeing a lot of strong hurricanes what we're seeing is hurricanes hitting this spectacularly developed environment whiz higher sea level\nNominally higher sea level it you know on the order of a foot compared to what it was\nA back when all these hurricanes started in the early twentieth century so that's one thing that makes saying this is a a global warming climate change issue quite so definite because in actual fact in our adult lives where all the adults listening", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Florida Roundup", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "12"}
