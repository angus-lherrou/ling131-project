I had to duck sometimes it was so bad you go to a trial you're unprepared your fumbling you're embarrassing you get correct and multiple times you failed to prove your case in any way\nThat is bad when your critics are embarrassed for you\nRight but here's the thing politically this did not hurt Kobach he went on to win the Republican primary for governor this summer by just if you vote here he is on the campaign trail\nI Want to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America [noise]\nI interviewed him this summer he told me that if he's elected he plans to keep on fighting this opposing voter fraud because the thing is is this is working for him\nEven though he was humiliated in court his federal commission was disbanded having achieved nothing the department of homeland security crackdown on cross check but he still may become governor of Kansas thanks in part to this crusade that he's lead against the problems that doesn't really exist\nThat is a record that speaks for itself say say thank you Alan it's my pleasure\nBecause that was Peggy Lowe of case you are in Kansas City\nEarlier this month President Trump was in Topeka campaigning for Kobach and I want to introduce\nGovernor of Kansas\nAt the same rally Kobach brought up\nYou guess voter fraud\nHe bragged about the voter id law he passed thing that Kansas has the most secure election laws in America he didn't mention that a federal judge turned that law\n[noise] this week's show was in partnership with Casey you are in Kansas City W.

K. A. G. see in Panama City joined us from debate county emergency operations center there in Panama City in update for the folks are the great folks in the panhandle here still suffering many days after hurricane Michael\nWell the race for Florida is agriculture commissioner sets up a real contrast between\nThe Republican and democratic candidate this hour we're going to speak to both of them and we begin with the Democratic candidate Nikki Fried of Fort Lauderdale she joins us now Nicky thanks for being with us now the contrast between you and your\nOpponent for the agriculture commissioner race a state rep Matt called well it it it couldn't be stark or your opponent\nOr not only is the Republican but he's a seventh generation Floridian from a family of farmers he comes from an agricultural background you are a lobbyist based in urban South Florida and you're proposing big changes for this department of agriculture and consumer services or one of the\nItems on your list that's gotten the most ... most end can attention is that you believe your department if you're elected should take on the responsibility of managing the state's\nNascent medical marijuana industry can you explain a little bit about how you would manage medical marijuana in the state of why should voters choose your vision over your opponents\nThank you again and you know I Do see a difference between the two of that\nI'm asking the state of Florida tired of the status quo agency in his apartment to huge Haley oversee\nAnd not just agriculture here in our stage that all of our environmental in our water policy's consumer services concealed weapon hurting and teen years practicing attorney I come with uniquely qualified I that I have been somebody who is an advocate for our citizens of the day I had a lawful\nI'm being passed to senator or somebody took on the big banks are in the ... and then I spent seven years traveling back and forth to Tallahassee fighting for public education for our foster care and yet for medical marijuana\nAnd what we have seen at that time and time again Tallahassee jak isn't listening to what other people we've seen competition on them and\nBy overwhelming numbers you know then it wind dealing with the environment of teenage years ago and she was a medical marijuana Seventy two percent and Tallahassee and legislators and the governor's office has a\nRobot every step along the way\nAnd so when I invasion in you know everything and I got elected on November ... how did you ever read that and then we touch unique opportunities here in our state to make a difference and saving people's lives getting them off being getting them off the pharmaceutical drugs given a better quality of life\nNot so much time in the last couple of years talking to patients all across our state and had been begging to have access because they want a better quality of life and you know I Know that you know how many how happy his signing\nTo be a priority and so in changing the direction of the office I'm moving over to department of\nAgriculture on making it you know not so many patients have to go through hoops to doctors have to go through that very high regulations to the amount of licenses sensory\nI'm not just the kind of using that allow our rural communities in our patients have their assets lowering the cost to start working on getting health insurances are hovering both the annual ... are small thing but if we aren't scientists ... on that\nAnd we really are standing in a way of really helping so many of our Floridians who are suffering every single day would\nYou like to expand the number of dispenser ease the number of uh of nurseries that are involved in the medical marijuana system as it now exists in Florida\nOf the biggest Chinese uh ... what happened during the last election cycle is that they put a number of tests on me and now as centuries retail shops that are allowed to be offered her into license holders in our state and we have fourteen license holders and what that means is that\nYou can only work I Would you like to expand that no you\nKnow I never know and I\nSupport I think in the constitutional [laughter] I think putting a cap on the\nOf retail five is unconstitutional because it really prevent an asset to our patients\nSo our soldiers are putting up to three and a more urban areas heavily populated area and so a lot of our rules are never going to happen centuries under this regulation do support\nSome ... that have put zoning rules in place that have essentially banned the ability of dispensaries to open\nA decent on 'em that prevent access and so I think that what needs to happen which is what was in previous at the laws in one level control our local governments that happened during the implementation\nOnce a specific example you can cite that were that happened\nWe saw three hundred emails that were released right after the primary\nOf interaction with the head lobbyist nana ray with the department\nWhere there was an individual numerous individuals who had been denied their concealed weapons permit and the n._r._a. un contacted a staff member or is that we demand within twenty four hours this to be changed and in fact a lot and that it they're responsible and the fact that they had already had had so much influence on this position\nUm have to stop and my opponent\nUm has run and gun legislation has been he says that this is the\nUm ... sole job is to support the second amendment and to and to protect it and shows me that he will be more of the same if not worse than what commission apartment has done in his office he had the ability and opportunity to make changes as\nA legislator and somebody who's been chair of the government oversight committee and chose not to and so while I Am somebody who you know I Am a staunch advocate for the second amendment as an attorney\nAnd the gun owner out of the concealed weapons permit and\nMy job is to make sure that the citizens of our state are protected and are facing comes first\nMickey if you're elected would you change the process for a law abiding Floridian to apply for a concealed weapons permit\nThe only changes that I Would make is start the conversation of moving this process over to law enforcement and ... um other than that is making sure that we're getting our jobs and thorough background checks which is already part of the law so we need to figure out why the ball is dropped and figure out how we can made it move it over to law enforcement\nLet me ask you about the do not call list we're in the heat of the election cycle I'm sure all three of us are probably getting unwanted phone calls at home or if we still have home numbers or or cell phones\nUh this is an enforcement issue that lands directly in the office of the agriculture commissioner how would you and forced to do not call list that has to ... that would represent ways that would reduce these nuisance phone calls and they\nCan get your hundred percent correct we all have you know thirty plus email or phone numbers that are blocked at our cell phones\nAnd the fact is that half of it enforced on and there's been no repercussions for these companies for violating the law and so we need to make sure that we are beating the regulations we're actually going after\nThese bad actors and there were also increasing our technology technology has changed they figured out ways around our technology and we need to put money and infrastructure into place uh to make sure that our technology has more advanced and then start actually going after the bad actors in shutting them down um because they are violating the law every single time we get one of these\nOn you're talking about a new a new regulation new enforcement or are you talking about new regulations additional regulations that currently are not in place you\nKnow it's unfortunate that the current regulations because they haven't been enforced and then again in the technology side of things we have an updated our technology and software system in a very long time and do the bad actors I figured out a way around it and so we need to start being smarter than them\nOr you know this is interesting this race is so interesting I think because\nPeople typically think of the agriculture commissioner as the person who oversees the state's farm product but it's a huge agency with thousands of employees that is also overseen consumer services then you and your campaign of really stress as you said beefing up\nProtection of Florida that consumers this department inspects gas stations that even inspect roller coasters for safety you even would go in and I know the the overseeing the inspection of grocery stores this is just a huge far flung department and so\nWhen you look at it a ... this was the question I Want to ask her opponent to is this department\nToo big to unwieldy should it should agriculture and consumer services all be in the same office uh does that make sense\nIs should that be revisited because the on the face but there are two very different things so if you're elected you'd be on one hand overseeing agriculture and on the other hand they reviewing roller coaster to make sure\nThat the that don't go off the tracks you know a lot of voters really grasped that that how diverse the job is and how you would see\nThat yeah absolutely I you know and I think that you have to crack you know the reality is that first of all is thirty don't notice even elected position\nA member of the cabinet and you know part of the tendency board um and that that are overseeing our culture and everything else that they were services\nSo it is a huge position and I think that there definitely needs to be some questions about how much responsibility is in it but the reality is that these things are too important to not be under a cabinet position that the type of things that we need to do to protect our consumers and make sure that where the watchdog over you know bad\nActors in the corporate structure is too important into central and so I think when you get somebody like myself who is in there at the junior practicing attorney and gone after that after seeing them in the past\nNikki freed the Democratic candidate for four to ... commissioner and consumer services Mickey thanks for\nBeing with us You're listening to the floor to round up from Florida public radio\nA couple of reminders for voters one early voting begins in Florida on Monday election day is just two weeks away it is a November six and of course you can also follow along this program and join the conversation on social media or handle on Twitter is at Florida roundup\nMac Caldwell joins us now he's the Republican candidate for Florida's next agriculture commissioner or Matt welcome to the floor to round up let's start here is the portfolio for the commissioner just too big given it's everything from rural cultures to the citrus industry\nWill appreciate you having me on I I wouldn't say it's too big but it's definitely a different than maybe a lot of people assume that you know at the agricultural piece really is enormous when you compare Florida to the rest of the country you know most states\nUh your commission that culture dealing with three or four major products here Florida we've got three hundred plus commodities\nWe've got four different soil types and a half dozen climate zones and nearly a dozen courts with all the logistics and pistols these thoughts on all the import export business with central and South America\nUh so what is it a numbers responsibility there but then\nUh in Florida weird unique in having given the commissioner so many other responsibilities will change his auto repair surveyor security guards a pawn shops best control\nBut but it's simply the nexus is uh is is from what I've described on the trail it's the commissioner of dirty jobs if you work outside if you wash your hands or you're you're in a really small business blue collar profiled and the commissioners officers\nAre watching out for making sure that to watch out for public health safety and welfare and overseeing the the license for that goes along with\nYour opponent to include marijuana regulation inside the department of agriculture and Florida would you support that\nOh well it's a great topic I actually held co authored the medical cannabis bill and twenty fourteen\nOr any of the constitutional amendments you know I met the children suffer from seizure disorders or met the folks with chronic diseases cancer and such and ah I helped the co right that Charlotte's Web billed as it was tagged in twenty fourteen to to address that need\nA I'm certainly willing to work on it I've I've advocated for changes in federal policy that will make a this issue easier and really solve a lot of the the more controversial elements that are still a bit doubling us but uh it's certainly something I'm I'm Glad to be a part of and have been for many years now\nBut but would you wouldn't go as far as your opponent is that fair to say in terms of the ag commissioner directly managing this industry is able to leave you take a more conservative position is that right\n[noise] well I Would say that I Want to see the the program managed effectively a department of health I think has demonstrated they're not\nUh over here uh to to help see this program be as successful as I think it should have been a one of the challenges is that the subsequent constitutional intimate and twenty sixteen actually provides for a permanent role for department of health that it's actually one of the\nProblems that we talk about on a regular basis on a you know legislating few constitutional amendment and so uh I'm certainly open to having the department of agriculture serving the largest capacity can in whatever way is going to get the program a effectively manage to implement it in the in the state of Florida let\nMe ask you as well you are a as it's been said the central casting candidate for this position era seventh generation Floridian you come from a family of farmers you know so much about agriculture\nYour opponent is an urban night a lobbyist uh so you come at this from very different backgrounds and so uh let me ask you what would you bring to the position is someone who's grown up in the agricultural world and also\nWhat would you say to critics who feel that you've been to industry friendly particularly environmental groups that have taken issue with some of your votes in the legislature\n[noise] well it is ironic now I'm On the er the agricultural candidate some of my primary opponents criticize me because I don't work\nOr on a day to day basis on a cattle rancher citrus groves or we do have a family history and the state going back to Eighteen twenty six and\nA I have advocated for ... natural resources during my last eight years in the Florida House or the district I represent today is north Fort Myers Lehigh acres and now the a and it's really a great a mix of issues you know Elvis still one of the
