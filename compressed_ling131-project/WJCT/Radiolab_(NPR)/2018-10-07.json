I I decided to do it and I go and the cabin I came here yeah and that's a very useful to distinguish these different kinds of actions but it doesn't mean that the experience civilization\nCaused the action and it doesn't mean that ... behavior doesn't exist it costs the same and every action that we experiences vote entry is shaped by a whole history of previous violent reactions um that we've\nExecuted during our lifetimes about social and cultural context of a developmental and and even our evolutionary heritage indeed all of these factors play in to every action that we do whether we experience it as ... well not\nSo interesting about consciousness is is that what makes us us right like like that's what makes us human but there are a lot of people in the world who who believe that we are not that far off from like AI becoming conscious right and and behaving in responding thinking as when you do\nThat's right I mean but I think that belief is driven by a couple of factors one factor is just this this cultural phenomenon ... we've had this throughout culture of of robots developing\nIntelligence and then becoming conscious ... he is right and we see this for me just read this time and I to be she does it Blade Runner I'm In in very different ways you know I Love Blade Runner I'm a bit frustrated by the Terminator view of of ... technology and robots we see this in a beautiful film ex max and which I think really interrogate the philosophical issues behind this\nIn a huge interesting way but yet that this cultural trait that intelligence and consciousness go together and that I Will develop a win is at some point um the other factor that's playing into it and this is the one I think is perhaps a bit more\nDamaging is water I come to coat it punishes entrepreneur ... and this isn't the idea that we ... we think well what's special about as we were trying to find out what's special about us maybe it's not that we have a soul and other animals die and\nWell maybe it's that we're intelligent maybe we have minds that is somehow different an order of magnitude different from the minds of other creatures or or of objects its intelligence that sets us apart and makes a special and we were so conscious\nSo does this tendency we have to associate these two things together I well you know we're intelligent\nAnd we're conscious so intelligence and consciousness should go together\nBut actually that really doesn't have to be the case you certainly don't have to be very intelligent in order to experience pain and suffering and so we can imagine that that plenty of\nOther animals that may not school very highly on our very human centric measure of intelligence but nonetheless have they been conscious experiences\nSo to me these things why against the idea that that a guy is headed on an inevitable trajectory towards being conscious but yet it's certainly possible that the near future we'll see as being able to build up the fact that give the impression\nOf being conscious and that to me picks out a very interesting space in the future what will happen\nTo our interactions with each other and with other animals when our environments ... to buy things that give the appearance of being conscious of being intelligent but for\nWhich we have no way really of knowing whether they are not sending their confidence in saying that they are conscious [noise] is that going to change the way we behave the things that are actually\nConscious I think that are definitely a worry\nAnd al ... is a professor of neuroscience at the University of ... you can see his full\nTalk dot com\nA thanks listening to our show this week what makes us I guess if you want to find out more about who was on it go to Ted got NPR dot O.

I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today too [noise]\n[noise] we're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something Hi [laughter]\nOkay I think it's a good thing where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah certainly getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nSo I don't think as I was taking in the team at this woman came up to me who is hosting the event name is ... around I I Try to do something\nTall black woman long dreads piercing have allies in relation to violent\nAnd I don't I don't know Marlene story I don't\nI'm Marlon is three at my age I'm thirty in the morning and he was mentioning about an hour\nOf community control where he's supposed to be home by soil\nIs on probation for drug charge been caught with some painkillers so he ran in immediately the cop car followed him and eventually Marlin blip ... hit him on\nHours for five hours yeah yep Kris loves the\nNeighbor's got out to the team and we sat and late at four or five hours\nUntil they were able to get the copper mine was pronounced dead [noise] into 'cause when I talk for a little bit and buy a\nOr just walked around thirty induced myself to people who were you guys from in Florida ...\nOh you're from Tampa okay so we just made the drive and I don't quite know what I was expecting I guess I just thought it was you know going to be a local event for this one person but as I started to meet people I started meet people from all over from Tampa from Palm Beach whereabouts in New York I mean there were people from all over the country is Flatbush, Brooklyn Chicago Georgia and\nYeah it's my son in Oregon\nI started seeing these people who win the T shirts and shit and then you have to do with the big picture of a young black man's face or\nA name that they represent ... watch out\nThere was one woman with a picture of her son's eighth grade graduation photo on her shirt is a cap and gown\nAnd read he was fourteen years old when he was killed he was buried in the same\nAnd his down then another mother\nThis going on for years so I have maybe about ... ... where the name of a twenty three year old son Rodney Mitchell on her shirts at one with the graduation speech I have the right than black and yellow one I have this Jamaican color what I have a black and white I have ...\nSure after shirt after sure and I think by the time like forty people showed up and they're all these different shows I I just realized like\nOh this is not just a thing for one person this is a network\nLike almost everyone there had lost either a cousin or a brother or a husband\nEven even daughter to police violence and in fact when I spoke to one of those women you just heard at one with the graduation Clemens twenty three year old son Roger Mitchell he was shot and killed by ... eastern traffic so we're actually going to get into that story later but she told\nMe that I've met about four hundred other mothers they'd reached out to me and I were a hundred oh yeah really yeah through like traveling around through Facebook of ... other mothers who've lost their children wow [noise]\nSo I was just seemed like a fraction of this community center got the scales surprising rate and the other thing for me was how you see these stories pop up thirty seven year old Alton Sterling forty year old parents ... I'll be the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come out and man\nHo ho ho\nFor like two days you see them on television that big bad dude was my\nThat big bad dude\nThen they kind of recede\nThey're gone I guess what I thought it you know probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then [noise] you know they go back to their lives whatever like whatever that means\nBut instead it's like oh no what happened is they get like folded up into this network\nThe proof of those ... that will\nAnd so at the community center there was a moment of prayer where the forty to fifty people sat down at these big brown dining tables users\nOnce upon a time of all the ...\nHolidays are all harmless or is it hot dogs to your local\nListings for low for the students\nAnd so after the prayer Christel House back in the room for everybody to eat so everyone stood up\nThen by just totally changed in somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big picnic tables and they didn't mind just a high\nWhich were met this woman I mean the only comment I was looking for early don't you just described for me what we got on the table 'cause I'm just ah what kind of have you had to put some I mean the table right now so I think you have you have your own\nWhat about you got your aims you get your Britain you've got your baking you've got your coffee you got everything you want to have to\nOld are they going to get him a show in Geneva reveal I'm the mother Sandra Bullock in case you don't remember [noise]\n... she didn't\nSenior bland it's pulled over in a small town in Texas the cop runs or information comes back to the car but not your cigarettes please\nLoan it right out of the car and I have the right thing to do that do have a right now I Will remove him get her a mold for\nFor our movie I'm giving you a lawful order [noise]\nYou know\nI wanted\nThem and you know mentally singer gets out of the car or fail you know you don't often it's\nMuch\nSandra was eventually taken in jail for days later in that jail cell she was found\nDead hang with the plastic garbage bag the death Israel to suicide and sings family disputed that ruling\nYou got everything you want to have to get\nGoing to get him a show in Geneva reveal I'm the mother Sandra\nComing from I don't want to let you or your food I one thing I Want it after you come to come to events like this before Oh yes sir quite a few of us in Missouri last\nWe tried to support it many mothers that we can because it's important\nTo me is that what it is it really just like a word Yes sir it's a good point because that mother who has lost their baby needs to be able to see somebody else looks like them\nIn the same situation that they are as opposed to someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about something better than I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talked to these women\nYou get the sense that their their experiences is really unique\nSort of law it's up to lose somebody that cancer I've lost a friend that cancer recently in fact\nIt was a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person is killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged and\nSo it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right\nDay too was Daytona lend me three\nMay third Daytona Beach Daytona Beach about everything\nAnd what happened was we went to the same with these women mostly black who have lost people to police violence and I'm time sitting across the table from an African American city councilman Daytona Beach and I told them what I've been working on I told them some of the numbers we learned and he said you really need to meet our police chief\nShells is seen as Mike ... or just yeah just I'm like okay he's a police chief of Daytona Beach [noise]\nKnown for a while to rock a spring break scene [noise] ah they have bike week to trust five hundred thousand bikers from all over the country\nThe permanent population there is like sixty two thousand people and over that six year period they've only had four police shootings and that's low yeah first say like that that's really low\nI Need to break down ... points to see and in fact while we were there by race of tickets at a rest\nGet with that is a system print out these spreadsheets there were others there the stats they get to do the math and these ... it's actually kind of fascinating 'cause if you look at them you know and just go right down here and you can add 'em up for things like aggravated aggravated assault theft shoplifting a speeding\nOr arrest ratio and our ticket ratio basically mirrors our city in terms of racial demographics yeah we're we're roughly a sixty forty shitty sixty percent of white ... percent African American\nAnd so when you look at these numbers that's pretty much what you see ... tickets for speeding about sixty forty arrest for theft about sixty forty that's the way we are supposed to in theory approached law and so what are they doing differently well a whole bunch of things first of all\nWhen all these these incidents were occurring in or\nAround the country with ... and everything else we did a ration policing mandatory training for the entire pd and basically what we wanted our officers to do is number one to learn the history of the country was history of the country is that we are racist nation number I Want to look at it started with moving the Indians\nOff of their land for manifest destiny\nOr when you look at Jim Crow laws when you look at the civil wars yoga slavery when you look into it Bull Connor for example\nOf turning the dogs and fire hoses loose on civil rights marchers so it's important for officers to understand that that you may go into an African American community and you may think an accent talk away where you think you're being respectful and understanding but in reality you're not\nBut let's not for a moment think that there isn't biased in in policing because they're spies we all have biased in is a an the trick is it and I don't know what to trick at a I don't know of any of us know how to contain that how do we stop that bias from coming for when you make a decision\nAnd I think in a you know I've read a lot about implicit bias and now it seems like um it's like it just feels like a kinder way to stay here like a fear of a black person and that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job as a cop when\nYou look at some of the shootings record on video and I and I think of the poorer school janitor who lost his life in Minnesota the clinic steel shooting yeah there's a guy who told the officer in no uncertain terms I'm a good guy\nI have a gun permit you can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer\nSo with the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason that officer threat level with a baby in the car and I got a guy in his ... his kid his girlfriend according stomach gun from an older\nThis is this is an easy car stuff for some reason in and the reason is because of the color of the main skin all those things never registered black Irish shippers by his pocket and I should\nAnd and I would like to tell you and all my years in policing I Would like to sit here and be not even tell you\nThat we don't you don't want people and the twenty eight year practitioner law enforcement a second generation cup I'm appalled at what I see on those videos I cannot believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control\nSome of them I understand what's going on I mean wrestling underground for your life and you and and you know there there are times that we have to use deadly force but the incidents in South Carolina the incident Minnesota I mean are you kidding me looking at what are we doing\nI mean how do you how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they're not already operating at this level of heightened fear or this perceived threat\nIn my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound you have to train using it real life scenarios\nThat take that extra split second before you fire your weapon and I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people\nAt a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had a ... trained on how to keep your finger on the site plate the weapon not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody and you would have thought it was Armageddon oh my God they're gonna get killed on reality\nWhat he did was each slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second to make a difference that blood given I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your knock shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been that the color of my glass coming out of my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that she would come back to again and again is this idea of time in certain situations slow down\nWhen you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down like whatever you can do you've covered just creates in space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between saving your life in somebody else's life another interesting thing was Ben Ben found that that also through some of the reporting with other police chief\nIs the idea that simply cheese don't like to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds and in part because everything that there was this the text allowed\nSo we know how to communicate is like this and then when when they look up and go to talk to somebody and and I'm curious about whether the drive through at McDonalds and they could piss off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nIn fact been told me that he talked to a different police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the Academy of past years\nHave never been in a physical fight which the problem because when they get into a fight their hearts fetch the race in the muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and then way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapon to uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on you know so that then says that that's why I'd read she told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bounces or for chip what he said from just\nMy little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the policy\nBasically you know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nHere's you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff but we they bought Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day\nYou have to get to know people who are Asher and so to make this point to where it got up walking down the hall to another office\nHad sent me down on the computer the sound comes out of us ...\nShowed me this video to video starts\nIn silence and if the body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as you said is a partner both cuts are white also it's night so [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people he was off his meds if he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly they park neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nFrom this shirtless black I don't you dare\nThat's the kind of talking him a cop or anybody can end this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards the cops once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I gets closer and closer and closer and finally the couple in the body can't pulled out occasionally the other officers out it was added a frame is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching a protein\nAnd he gets within like ten feet of the cops and then\nHey hey hey [noise]\nThe guy would find campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he has over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central for cuts and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot warning sign your best shot you want to die I Want you want a guy you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police both can't kill\nA fan of our parents really want to\nBe to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un huh\nSo this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it does warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "07"}
