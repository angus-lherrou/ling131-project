{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "And so I was super outgoing um easy to talk to someone who was really you know inclined to make jokes and it was really just this continual way of almost saying to myself I'm OK\nI'm All right you know and it was almost this way of trying to convince myself that things weren't as desperate as they really are\n... and then I Would go into my room [noise] late at night and I would have thought so you know ending my life [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills\nWith a pen and paper in my hand I thought about taking my own life and I came to this close to doing it\nAgain this close to doing it and I didn't so that makes me one of the lucky ones one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump\nOne of the lucky ones Who Survives why survived and not just leaves with my story and my story is this for simple words I suffer from depression\nUnfortunately we live in a world where if you break your arm everyone runs over to sign your cast\nBut if you tell people you're depressed everyone runs the other way that the stigma\n\nTime as you were experiencing some of this you are trying to like lunch your career as a standup\nComic yeah in the absolute mecca of show business and Victoria, BC Canada yes totally so well wealth struggling with crippling depression you were trying to funny to um like people in comedy houses\nOh gosh yeah I Know it's just so cliche so many ways but yeah it is yeah I Know exactly I\nYou know look I think this is part of it too right is there's this big idea that kind of says you know everyone and who does comedy or anyone who's a comedian is this sort of sad clown and you know they have all these issues and you know and sometimes I Do feel a little bit stereotypical kind of living in to that idea\nBut for me you just got to think about it this way which is that when I was really recovering during that time might constant sense of\nFeeling better was watching comedy I was obsessed or you\nAre you comfortable like\nJoking about depression and mental illness or is there like a ... as like a pretty like draw a line at it I'm\nIt's difficult because I Would never want to make a joke that would seem as though it's demeaning those experiences but one of the most interesting things as we kind of put up these walls in our mind around certain topics right and we go we can't laugh at\nAnd when you were saying that what are you really say\nLike that's too serious to laugh at that is too important to laugh at and I really thought about that question for a long time and then realized\nBut that's one of the best ways into these conversations [laughter]\nWe all know what it is to hurt [noise]\nWe all know what it is a pain in her heart and we all know how important it is to heal the right now depression is society's deep got the word content to put a band aid over and pretend it's not their relatives there\nIt is there and you know what it's OK depression is okay if you're going through I Know that you're okay I Know that you're sick you're not meet and it's an issue not an identity because when\nGet past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others you can see the pressure for what it really is [noise] and that's just a part of life\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I mean it's almost like that pain is a source of material like it's\nLike it's like you have to have that pain to [noise] to have something to be funny out\nYeah and I think in my perspective on that\nWould be not even just to have something to be funny about to know why it even matters to me to look at it pass just oh that's you know a good laugh and just see what that really means to someone on a spiritual or emotional level\nAnd I think that we live in this world now\nThat is so serious in so many ways and we're so plugged into our technology and we're so plugged into these external realities that feel like they're constantly kind of knocking on the door of our mind and just begging for our attention and\nTo laugh is to find yourself back in the moment to laugh is to be free and so many ways\nAnd so for myself that's just something that I think about all the time and I try and bring into my work is just that's what I'm really here to do if I'm here to serve someone that's the way I'm serving them and that's what it means the most to me\nI had this moment when I was Seventeen years old and I can remember this so clearly\nWhere I was really actually myself this question of am I going to pursue this you know is this gonna be the path that I follow and I one day saw what what's the definition of laughter\n[noise] like I don't even know [noise] and I went and I looked it up in the dictionary and it said the definition of laughter is the tangible evidence of how [noise]\nAnd to me that changed my whole life because I'd just sweat yes like that's what comedy gave me was this tangible sense of hope this not just in a game from my problems but it's completely different reality in which I Would be so overwhelmed with the present moment with laughter that I couldn't even remember what\nThis struggle that I was experiencing on the day to day was\nAnd that changed everything for me [noise]\nKevin briel he's a comedian and author of the book boy meets depression\nHe can

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and today\nWe have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nSo our money goes to talked about the\nKind of resembled Mickey Mantle blonde hair blue eyes good looking\nI told him I says I just need back though that's it you\nKnow that was a lose lose case there's no money in it you know the prosecution had three eyeball witnesses had his car at the scene of the crime and they had his two week flight but he was guilty\nThen as I said I'm not going to try to prove you didn't do it I wanted to go on\nAnd as soon as you defend navy Guerra murdered this kid the bug maybe it was because he had temporarily gone insane community he's crazy he really believes this I'm telling you that my ...\nAnd on top of that our money tells and listen to the skin with big case we pull this off for me it would take your while but eventually\nHe says I'm In ... now we're into a late August Nineteen Seventy three so we went up to the hospital\nWhen they got there they went up to ... them up on the fifth floor of the hospital police are standing guard they walked into the room\nAnd seen them in a while we agree to each other and we talk\nAnd just a picture this gym told me that the room they put Darwin was what he described as a training observation room which meant that it had a big window that ran alongside girls bed so they could keep an eye on and the cops are stationed right outside just\nWatching [noise] and according to the gym\nAnd I should say I've heard differing accounts about this but apparently the cops had brought in a ... to ... I\nI don't think you can do that right I mean that's not legal\nYeah I I think that's probably not okay but from the cops perspective they think that he's involved in a recent murder and a missing girl and they think that girl could still be alive so they want to know absolutely anything they can that's going to get them closer\nTo solving that murder and finding that girl but at the same time\nThe defendant has to be able to share absolutely every thing with the lawyers and know that they're in that safe space of that relationship\nBecause we have sixth amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself\nIf you checked freely ... attorney than you have no real justices\nAnd army in ... they need as much information about what Gary was done as they possibly can get so they can start to build their defense\nI don't like surprises I'm the kind that wants to know everything\nWas so so that as a lawyer you're in a strange spot here\nMhm he needed to get from Gary out his story and it needed to be just that me didn't want the cops in on it yet\nAnd you don't know of dirt\nTrack tuna rumor was so their\nTurn off the TV turn up the fans but a ... who's playing game show talking basically about anything but but the case has kept saying he couldn't remember he couldn't remember and\nThey're trying to convince him like you've got to talk to us if you're going to have any shot\nIt's like a Lynch mob both the police pretty much have you cold there's witnesses and Guerra knew he could be going to prison he could be going to prison for a long time maybe twenty five to life and pedophile imprisoned there has to be careful things get rough\nBut they tell him if you talk to us maybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity that was only two friends to help get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison that was the goal to have anything to say say no\nIt took several conversations to get good at this point but finally Darrell Puerto soul out [noise]\nAnd what he said how he said it that's that's waiting on the other side of this very brief break we'll be right back\nHi my name is based on that over and I'm calling from the Netherlands\nRadiolab is supported by ... an online service that lets people send and receive money internationally and their borders a cow less customers hold in concert multiple currencies at any time ... ... and the F\n...

J. C. T.\n\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab and just before the break we were about to hear Robert Guerra the man accused of murdering a teenager Cho his attorney what really happened\nYet and we're going to jump right back into that but uh if you're just tuning in now you should be warned that they are at what comes next is uh probably not suitable for the years of young kids are sensitive listeners so be warned that will go back to reporter benefit\nAt this point it was just ... in the room and he told him yes he had killed them ... and he also killed other people\nToo and the episodes when Darrow killed people seem to have followed a like a pattern you would get these intense headaches and you know become psychotic\nAnd do horrible things when it came to the details he tended not remember but\nCarol mentioned two particular girls who were then missing\nAnd whose parents had no idea where they were\nTwenty one year olds who pads and another girl sixteen year old only shock [noise]\nSusan pets was from Chicago She's a girl I mentioned\nEarlier cops are already looking for her hoping that Carol might have some information earlier that summer\nHer boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them had been camping and Susan had been gone ever since\nA leash a hawk she was a high school girl from Syracuse she had gone missing just a couple of days before Susan everybody thought she might have just run away but\nGuerra told the lawyers that he had killed them and where he had left their bodies\nOne odd thing about arrows description of the incidents she doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with mine nights\n... stay with my life\nLike it wasn't even doing the stabbing right like this is what do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself\nIs this true\nYou know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be\nA dream he had it could be a delusion\nIf you're going to go and um you know craft an argument and presented strategy you need to know\nUh what actually happened W walked out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go so they they slip outside they get in the car and we\nTake off to go look for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mind is up ... about an hour south of the hospital ...\nHead around ... and in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you rub ... it's a high but\nYou're scared you're concerned yeah fear ... food if you don't\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes they'll talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car\nAnd he said can I meet with you and talk to you in in our money agreed to it so he comes in\nTakes a seat and they asked them father father there anything you can tell me about my daughter I mean\nThe papers think that ... that Carol probably has something to do with her disappearances or anything at all that he's told you that that can help me\nBut I couldn't tell him anything and around he just he says no I Can't tell you there's nothing I can tell you\nBut I remember trying to reassure him that look kind of meeting shut up\nI can say is it's a state investigators and the prosecutor on the case\nThey could have some information for trying to give them hope we will bring you to conclusion I thought we would\nWe did so then when Mr pets leaves his Romani he loses it he threw a bunch of books for basically just you know destroyed his office\nJust trying to ... much\nThat I couldn't help them\nBecause he's looking right out this man knowing exactly well imagining what he's going through like our money had lost\nA brother his was much younger years four years younger\nBecause an air force pilot or three kids and in Nineteen sixty to his plane went down and he was lost at sea\nSo after that our money said his mother she'd be up at night crying she would like go to bed at night\nAnd my mother would wake up screaming fishy reading\nYou know she could liberal recover from it because\nHe can't you know you just you don't really know but you know it's\nSo I can understand that\nAnd that's you know that's partly why this was so hard for our money because when that plead deal fell apart that was his chance to try to get this information to the families when the police all through he didn't have any other options for sharing that information he was stuck\nWhat so what happens next so they have to go to trial and that means that our money and don't you have to not go down to try to present an insanity defense meanwhile our money\nHe said he couldn't sleep he was having nightmares wake up to thirty in the morning or the sweat running or you're better go sit at the kitchen table drinking coffee and just waiting for the morning paper to come\nBecause he was just a loan or that he was alone with the secret\nAnd he knew at that moment the police are\nTrying to find these girls he knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive you are\nYou're questioning yourself very\nYou're hurting people so you begin to wonder am I in the right profession you know you're looking for and you're looking for a way to give the information is you know ... call\nSure why didn't you\nKnow [laughter] if I'm gonna do it and we'll do it openly\nNo uh I don't know\nDid he ever did he ever break\nKnow according to him now you know in my mind was doing was thought was a proper ethical and legal Morrow moral\nThing to do and then\nIn December of Nineteen Seventy three five months after the girl disappear their bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other students bodies discovered by two kids are playing up in the mines Alicia um I guess it's I think a student from Syracuse University which is right next door to the\nCemetery is walking through and stumbled upon her and so she's discovered then too and then six months later in the summer of Nineteen Seventy four\nOpening day of the trial might be one of the most significant even though\nRobert ... trial for the murder of delta blue ski begins\nRobert Harris primary line of defense will apparently being not guilty by reason of insanity\nSo in order to make that case what they decided to do is is to put Darryl on the stand and he just get the facts and Guerra would\nTell his whole life story to a shock the jury's mind including all these murders and all these rapes to see those evil that this time he was nuts Sharon Smith\nChannels it's news in pleasant\nSo the trial opens um\nThe courtroom is jam packed prosecution starts they have a really good case that got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton County\nAnd then it's time for the defense to start their case to Belgium stands up and he calls his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand arrogance on thin and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible [noise]\nSevere beatings and abused by parents very little education basically gets\nSent off to a farm to work\nLike as an indentured servants when he's seven you know ... and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he started drinking blood I'm having sex with the animals\nAnd then he starts admitting to a series of rapes throughout his adult life and he\nAdmits the killing Alicia and Susan and what happens next and nobody's\nQuite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when Garrett was talking about Susan pets ... says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian Armani hold a press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told anyone\nAbout Robert does the ... because they had the duty to protect our clients secret\nReading or the ... here and they put into but\nEveryone is disgusted with columns written editorials written letters to the editor\nOr is just no way around the world you're going to convince your average non lawyer\nEverybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby some very good of a law and justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors laid off that our money and Dell jihad actually tried to use these dead girls as leverage for Guerra\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns in a game of law issues buzzer them\nOur money was getting death threats in the mail and I'd just as crazy phone call people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself I'm going to kill you get to at one point he finds a dead fish in his\nCar his wife ... Molotov cocktail in the back yard he started to carry a pistol my back he kept shock on in the car he kept on in the house so\nWe could sleep it was that was the worst moment to [noise] er some horrible for\nHis marble thoughts\nJune twenty seventh Robert ... rose convicted for the murder of Philip bump whiskey he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how ... how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nThen it is up to the grand jury itself in there and to ... to determine which charges they should bring against the two attorneys pretty\nSoon after the verdict our money and build you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or\nState public health law and the provision that says the body must be given quick in decent burial and on top of that\nWe're broke records the worms and we're ... we're we're we're we're ...\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarm and an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\nThey'll start drinking heavily abandoned his law practice moved to Florida or body tough it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or was like you know what else can I Do\nTo make the movie\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the ... old and the stress and pressure to ... to ...\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bars the Belgian or money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer to do this job\nOh I was a good lawyer\nI saw so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and build you did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "28"}
