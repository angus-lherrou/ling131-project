that are impractical for many of the problems people face worse our profession has shrouded law in a cloak of complexity\nLet me come back to ...\nTwenty Thirteen he\nDid reach the gates of that factory with a bucket of petrol then his head but he was arrested before he could follow through\nThen two years later he met someone I'm going to call them push push is part of a team of community paralegals that works for environmental justice on the coast Kush explains Ravi that there was law on his side\nWho is translated into ... the something Ravi had never seen it's called the consent to operate it issued by the state government and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions\nSo together they compared the legal requirements with reality they collected evidence and they drafted in application not to the court to to administrative institutions the pollution control board and the district administration\nThose applications started turning the ... the wheels of enforcement uh pollution officer\nCame for a site inspections and after that the company started running an air filtration system it was supposed to have been using all the law it also started covering the one hundred trucks they come and go from that plant every day\nThose two measures reduced the air pollution considerably the case is far from over\n... learning and using law gave levy hope there are people like push walking alongside people like ... in many places\nToday I work with a group called ... the number the helped convene a global network dedicated to legal empowerment altogether we are over a thousand organizations in a hundred and twenty countries collectively we deployed tens of thousands of community paralegals [noise] ... ...\nI mean it seems to me that this idea of of of helping to establish community paralegals can really\nMake change at scale at at at a big scale is just to create more and more and more and more of them like all over the world basically people are not lawyers but that are just as good as lawyers in terms of how they understand the law\nI Do think that that's that's part of what we need to do to achieve this transformation in the relationship between la and people is to open it up and to embrace the role of these sorts of intermediary\nPlayers I mean in healthcare for example we we never would think that all you needed doctors have a whole network of people you have doctors nurses midwives Lopez your community health workers\nAnd so the folks that we we focused\nAnd we we work with are sort of the equivalent of community health workers and called community legal workers\nAnd they can play this vital bridge role\nUm even in some of the toughest circumstances when people know invoke the rules [noise]\nThey can get traction some of the time not not that we went every time but they can get they can get traction in in in in really powerful ways\n[noise]\nI see the beginnings of a real movement but we're nowhere near what's necessary not yet [noise]\nAnd most countries around the world governments do not provide a single dollar support to paralegals like push most governments don't even recognize the wool paralegals play\nOr protect paralegals from heart I also don't want to give you the impression that paralegals and their clients when every time not at all\nThat cement factory behind ... village it's been turning off the filtration system at night when at least likely that the company would get caught right not filtered costs money Ravi what steps photos of the polluted nice guy\nLevy says the air is still unbelievable trying to squeeze justice at a broken system is like well these case hope and despair\nOr neck in neck\nAnd so not only do we urgently need to support and protect the work of beer for lawyers around the world\nWe need to change the system and sell\nThat must be so many examples in cases that you come across where it's just ... you don't when you you you you face these enormous odds and you face enormous sources and they and even though ... says on your side don't win how do you how do you stay optimistic about this\nI don't think there's another option I ... you know we we take inspiration from the kinds of long term movements that has managed to change things in various places whether it's the\nSouth African freedom struggle um or whether it's the struggle for freedom here in the United states it takes time it takes patients that takes perseverance takes creativity and um those are qualities that I see in the paralegals we work\nWith and watching them\nGives me hope yeah equip the people themselves to make those institutions more accountable more fair don't give up on democracy forge a deeper version of democracy in which was

I just told you good morning and so he um but I forgot to say good evening so oh okay\nSo great I mean we were just a anyhow [laughter]\nWe call Greg out because he had written this article for this great website called ... dot org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another\nBut there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about uh the failure to communicate I can tell you that story you're yeah so so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it as a translator but it's the word furious\nWhen did you hear in a serious like how can you help us okay I'm In my experience when you hear this where serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern\nIt actually almost never has something to do with your mood for serious tends to me is are you just\nTalking to me or you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me a bribe oh usually I Pretend misunderstand that they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um\nBut the story that I Want to tell you and\nGood afternoon everybody I'm I'm really pleased to be docked in Africa Secretary Kerry ... visited Ethiopia and city of enormous energy and just a\nFew days before carry visit nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and a Secretary Kerry was giving his press conference I shared my\nConcerns about a young Ethiopian blogger that I met last year a ... who ah\nWith age of his peers I've been in prison and I firmly believe that the work of\nJournalists weather is print journalists are in the Internet or media of other kinds it makes societies stronger\nYou know he said all the things that he's expecting to say said they believe that free speech and open dialogues important to the economic development of country pop up law but\nWe remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia\nWith this comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise be up yet and\nI'd be delighted to answer your questions I'm not sure how that's going to do that\nThen came time for questions he took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists are two more from the traveling press and to carry\nCredit or give his job and I want to give them a shot I Know it was very impatient sort of before he left the party and he was like you know what we're just going to try something different we are going to like call on an Ethiopian journalists oh I'm sure we got a fairly distribution yeah here Carrie pointed this one guy in the second row a young guy in his twenties boyish face wearing a moustache\nOf only two questions flu\nSaid I may have invited artist question of the day that\nBut one question for us focus\nSo let me she was a ... of raised double ... or not the names of liquor who's at Logan in these friends there uh in my\n... and this guy's like well every time a journalist is arrested us gives a statement about this by these things out of this keep happening every piece of repeating\nSo then he asked this question\nIs the lip service or audio seriously because of the double it's ...\nIt's just lip service or are you seriously concerned [noise]\nAt this point everybody is just not carry they're all looking at least journalists who obviously had to take considerable personal recipe in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state run TV station she's this guy's on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arresting journalists we really\n... ... ...\nTeri looks at him like well [noise]\nYou've got to be kidding\nWhere I stand up in public and I and I say something um\nI I Try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and yeah so so remember\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much is are you doing something preferably a Lincoln\nBecomes T versus shock there's less violence and\nThe right because it because you're looking at guys who may not exhibit the symptoms of shock necessarily but of overtime it becomes impossible for them to go on there's a wonderful film from World war two called let there be like\nThese are the casualties of this current trouble than mine\nMen who are damaged emotionally\nAbout guys with what they were then calling battle fatigue and the reason they were calling it that was because you didn't necessarily see it right away\nThen around Vietnamese as we realized you don't just see this on the battlefield you see it with guys who aren't necessarily directly involved in battle right and so the question became\nWhat's the source of it and she said well nervous exhaustion said the human nervous system could only take it for so long and then everybody's nervous system shuts\nDown hence the term operational exhaustion\nSo that's example again when you're trying to enrich it you're saying the guys aren't cowards and not in the state of shock they're behaving the way all human beings do and then you get more concerned about them and you say the real problem isn't there just their experience on the battlefield the problem is is that they're in a constant state of disorder\nBecause it lingers on long after you think it's over\nYou can't just get these guys into a hospital for six months and think they're going to be better there permanently you their post traumatic shock and then once you have a\nA a whole apparatus to deal with it then you become Pete DSD my point is just that it's perfectly possible that the language of euphemism grows and becomes more abstract as ... as people actually are becoming more empathetic to the people who suffer from it\nSunday you buy I mean he's he's basically turned Carlin on his head and he's made the landlord and Blinder words enrichment I I have I mean my only move would be to hit play on Carlin\nPoor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupy substandard housing in the inner cities [noise]\nThey don't have a negative cash flow position\nFired management want it to curtail redundancies in human resources area\nSo many people are no longer viable members of the workforce\nDon't became the landfill\nCar crashes became automobile accidents\nPartly so what do you\nGet a little boy\nThat\nHe can\nDo you do you do\nIn Yankee Doodle\nAgain do you do\nLesson number four imagine a lot of Coca Cola like ... ... ... if you'd be overcrowded now your truck [noise]\nPretty good\nThis is Emily Emily with us here I'm an artist\n[noise]\nSome of you may remember that a couple of years ago we did a story about Emily where she'd been hit by a truck\nGoing into a coma and her boyfriend at the time Alan or had brought her back my writing on her hands\n[noise]\nAll the stories we've ever done I think this one has gotten the most response and when we left that story Emily had emerged from the Komen begun to recover\nBut she was blind totally blind right yeah like no light any can nothing coming in now okay needless to say it was a very big adjustment\nI just know I just had to develop my own ways to navigate throughout the world and test myself and\nAnd being a visual artist she had to develop new ways to draw and\n... and if you ... it's hard enough you can feel the locks on the paper [noise] um yeah\nBut then one day in the summer of two thousand and twelve she gets a call\nFrom the White House school in New York City the lighthouse school yeah it's a school for the blind\nHer mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology\nI think they were doing this study for the FDA\nVery experimental and her mom signed her up long story short a Emily shows up the lighthouse school one day and walks into this room and a guy named ed\nGives her this thing he gets his device can you describe it I mean is it a big helmet\nNow it's not it's just say ... Ehsan glasses\nThough they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says because of right on the front to like on a bridge in the nose was a little camera going forward\nAnd then attach to the sun glasses was a little wire\nThat ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal\nThing has made a titanium\nAnd it's just like the size of a postage stamp and little bit decker though\nAnd explained or is it a little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes and what was going to happen is at the camera was going to convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square so he told her to take a little square plays it on your time put it right on the center of your tongue\nAnd caused him out so I put it on and they\nTurn it on 'em\nIt was like it started to take all imagine a lot of Coca Cola like a lot of levels on your town and always fight technically\nThe idea behind this thing cording to science writer Sam Kean author of detail of doing or surgeons is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes I mean it might seem like our eyes are doing the seeing an are you doing hearing and our fingers in ... in the teasing touching\nBut that's actually not how words each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerves and it is the brain that then convert those little glimpse into what you perceive as a site or a sound or smell now obviously\nSomeone who was blind the retina is not sending those signals anymore but what if there is another way to get\nSignals for light and dark and color into our brains\nAnd all of our brains there lots and lots of pathways going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain and normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist like there's a road there but it shut down in traffic can be on it but\nWhat if you could open up some of those rappers\nAges may I say with an eye for an hour and to our\nEmily says at first she had no idea what was happening she would just with all her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change\nEvery time I looked around he said\nOh that's a chair that door that's me\nActually mine and it went on like this for awhile et cetera ball in a square\nThat's higher than the nana and nothing's really happening for except for the perfectly feelings on her tongue but then there was this moment add had\nThis really long Styrofoam God and he last day in front of me he moved that I've been down in front of my face [noise] ... oh my God I suddenly she says she just thought it was like oh my God [laughter]\nIt just happened I I don't ... what does it look like in some of The Mind's eye it looks like\nA long white skinny stick\nCould you see the texture of the sticker um no\nI couldn't see ... I couldn't see in three dimensions it was a\nFlat and it's kind of light that kid's toy light right\n... like a black screen and little tiny white dots all arranged in a line\nTo Emily was allowed to keep the brain poor device for about a year and a half and during that time the lights\nBright resolution of it did get better as your brain learn to speak town it was\nAlso when I saw people living\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom and sent me showing her wearing the device and walking down the street she told me they usually you know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city\nEspecially at a town where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nSo I uh [noise]\nYeah I hardly ever notice and if people walking around me I feel like\n\nI can I hear the ... and the sound attack\nBut she says when you put the device on and put those sensor undertone the sidewalk [noise]\nCame alive I thought it was amazing I I didn't\nKnow that this many people around the state at the same time as me and now they're um [noise] they're all there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really soft ... ... anything that sounds nice soft wrong she says\nThat can move", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "14"}
