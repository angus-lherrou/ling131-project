country of\nMyself as chocolate peanut butter and noodles free any much\nProcessed food has a small dose of insects and in the not too distant future he says that we all might need to eat bugs\nHave necessity myself ... planes why on the stage human\nPopulation is growing very rapidly it will grow to about nine billion in two thousand fifty how are we going to feed this world\nWe have a third more mouths to feed but we need agricultural production increase of Seventy percent that's especially because this world population is increasing not only in number of rules for getting wealthier\nAnd anyone who gets real fear starts eat more means immediate effect is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production\nBecause other moments Seventy percent of our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock is not only the lens where the lifestyle is walking a feeding but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported we can increase it a bit\nAt the expense of rain forest [noise] but there's a limitation very soon unless you remember that we need to increase agriculture production of Seventy percent we're not going to make it that way\nBecause much better change from means to insects [noise]\n\nDC in fact not only is a good alternative to meet but as the future of food\nA sort of thing um\nAnd insects are an excellent filter in there\nBecause they need much less a land than producing regular life stalk and\nLifestyle is so inefficient because for one kilogram of beef that you will get on your plate\nYou need about twenty five kilograms of feed insects are doing a much better job you need only about two points to get a ... a feed for one kilogram of crickets a meat so if we are going to be forced to produce food in a more efficient way\nSwitching from regular meat allies talk to insects is a very logical thing to do\nThat is a big if of course out of this if insects produce meets that is a good quality what I've been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein affects a victim and it's very ... in fact it's comparable to anything that we eat as meat at the moment and even in\nTerms of calories is burned with one kilogram of rice has has the same amount of calories than dogs are six big match [noise]\nSo we have to give you the idea of eating insects as some might think well they're not the other vegetable\nWell they are\nThere and for nursing the ... the produce them maybe by two thousand twenty you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect as your groceries\nSo why not eat insects you should try it yourself a couple of years ago we had Seventeen hundred and fifty people's altogether on a square in monitoring of time and the age insects at the same moments and these were still\nBig news I think suited will not be big news anymore when we're only been since because it's just a normal way of doing [noise]\nProfessor to get I see one\nPretty significant problem with all this what's the problem that you see it's gross disgusting how could you eat an insect\nUh yeah that's that's the thing that comes to mind most often an\nIf you really think it's very serious and you look as an insect you take a\nLocus or crickets and you take away their wings and the the legs and then you put that next to I'm an artist shrimp if you look at them they're they're basically to sing and even from a biological point of view they're very close relatives and so if you love to eat shrimp\nThen why would you love love to eat um locus which in some countries where all the the the sky shrimp\nI mean I so want to make this work in my life and then the lives of the people are saying but uh [laughter] but I Can't even I'm trying to be mindful and imagining biting into a look at and it's just I Can't get there\nWell then the for you at this stage is might be an alternative to eat\nPasta in which the crickets having grown up and are there the distributors into the Boston we want to hear anything out again it's a ... with cricket meal\nI understand that it takes a while to sort of get over this that's one of the first sushi wasn't being on the markets in the United states eating raw fish was not something\nWell accepted you know\nYou can eat sushi anywhere yeah so there's all kinds of foods that may be an issue might not have all these rights but still make it\nSo if if actually you know let's say we can get over this sort of cultural a version and the last two or eating lots of insects and let's say we just ate so many insects that really reduce our consumption of chicken and beef and pork and you know ... what would happen\nI think we would have a ... will be able to sustain everyone we're animal protein ... and ... ideally be also so that we would eat less meat but there will be good if we at least for the most part of its brand new meats and\nWith this I think what we would see is that our dinner table would be much more than ... and I think you should look at

I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that content because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that who don't but we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must not lead us is on the radio yeah so you got kids with the you may want to make one oh no yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand eight joy how bout with a song yes please type [noise]\n... we got to the only way you could objectively said that the baby in the mother were engaged in breastfeeding is if the baby's lips were touching the woman's nipple\nSo they included what you could call like an attachment claws but as soon as they got that rule in place [noise]\nLike you would see you know a twenty five year old woman and a teenage looking boy right and like what the hell is going on there\nOh yeah it gets really weird if you start entering into like child age and it wasn't even going to bring that up because it's kinda gross\nLike breastfeeding porn is that things are there\nIt's like ... and so this team they realized they needed to have a new to the rule that are allowed for breastfeeding but also had some kind of an age cap\nSo so uh so then we were saying okay once you've progressed past infancy then we believe that it's inappropriate but then [noise]\nPictures would start popping up on the screen and they'd be like wait is that an infant like where's the line between infant and toddler\nAnd so the thing that we landed on was if it looked like the child could walk on his or her own then too old big enough to walk too big ...\nThat can be over ... yeah that's like a year old in some cases yeah\nAnd like the world Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until you know like Eighteen months or two years which meant there were a lot of photos still being taken down\nWithin you know days we are continuing to hear reports from people that their photographs were still being targeted but\nI used to offer a statement you know that's where we're going to draw the line of duty budging on policy and keep in mind through this whole episode is is perhaps the next big thing and the Facebook dot com company was growing really really fast and it\nSeems like almost everyone in on it and in and they're just gotten to be a lot more content\nWhen we first of all I'm sure hoping for you know maybe four hundred and five hundred people and now we're at a hundred thousand so who knows\nHow isn't more people are joining Facebook every day ... million users so far the projection of two hundred\nMillion by the end of the era now ... Facebook than the entire us popular not\nJust within the United states but also it was growing rapidly more international\nYou know you were getting folks in India is fast and turkey\nGetting big throughout the EU so they have more and more content coming in from all these different places in all these different languages how are we going to keep everybody on the same page and so this small team at Facebook got a little bigger and bigger jumped up to sixty people\nAnd then a hundred and they set out to create rules and definitions for every\nHuh can we go through some sort of the ridiculous exam\nSleep less over here today so Gore Gore you mean violence kinda Gore yes so the Gore standard was headlined\nWe don't allow graphic violence and Gore and then the shorthand definition they used was no insides on the outside\nNo guts no blood pouring out or something led was a separate issue there was a an excessive blood rule to come up with rules about bodily fluids\nSeeming for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like what does a clinical setting mean and you know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat\n... at one of my favorite examples is like how do you define art\nBecause as these people are moderating they would see images of naked\nPeople that were paintings or sculptures come up and so what they decided to do is say art with naked in this can stay up\nLike it stays up if it is made out of what made out of metal made out of stone really yeah because how else do you define art you have to just be like is this what you can see with your eyeballs\nAnd so from then on as they run into problems those rules just constantly updated constant amendment yeah constant amendments\nNew problem new rule and other new problem updated rule\nIn fact at this point they they're amending these rules up to twenty times a month\nWow really take for example those rules about breastfeeding in twenty Thirteen they removed the attachment cloth so the baby no longer needed to have its mouth physically touching the nipple of the woman oh and in fact\nA one nipple and or aerial it could be visible in the photo but not to only one then twenty four team they make it so that both nipples or both aerial last may be present in the photo\nSo this is what happens in American War all the time it was very thing yes yeah\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law so\nCommon law is the system dating back to early England where individual judges would make ruling which would sort of\nBe a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges so the body of law was sort of constantly lashed out and face that fact [noise]\nLiterally every time this team that Facebook would would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight ... plop some things are going to show up to date that they weren't prepared for that and that's a rule had an account\nOr as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about this\nFor example sometime around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue of things\nWhich act [noise]\n... [noise] except\nAnd she comes upon this image in\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressing skin breastfeeding goats of baby goats and the moderator throws their hands up and says what gives this and we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was the thing it turns out it's a survival practice\nAccording to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought unknown way to help your herd get through the drought is to ah if you if you have a woman who's ... to have her nurse the kid the baby goat\nAlong with her human kit and so there's nothing sexual about it's just good for business shouldn't and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant\nIf it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue there but there's there's physical contact between the mouth and the nipple but [noise] but obviously\nBreastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants and so in that moment what they decide to do is uh remove the photo and there was an amendment an ass strict under the rules stating animals are not babies we add to that so in any future cases people would know what to do\nWith it but they were moved they they they did was it was culturally appropriate and the thing that people do and they decided to remove the photo yet that outraged individuals are editors foreign wheeler why\nWhy did we make an exception because because when a problem grows large enough you have to change the rules if not we don't this was not one of those cases the juice wasn't worth the squeeze and like\nIf they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was okay to breastfeed an animal and when it wasn't okay\nThis is a utilitarian document it's not about being right a hundred percent of the time it's about being able to execute effectively\nIn other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be one hundred percent just or fair we're just trying to make something that works [noise]\nOne two three four five six seven eight and when you step back and look at what Facebook has become like from two thousand eight to now in just ten years\nSinger tower came in LA and\nOf the idea of a single set of rules that work that can be applied fairly that's just a crazy crazy concepts\nBecause they've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to be able to\nCount I always say it's about eighty floors and\nThey've gone from twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere is a ... a source of content moderators itself\nAround twenty ten they decided to start out sourcing some of this work places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home in drawl as well as\nI mean I Would guess that there are people\nDublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where they get their stuff is just so used to treat everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people who for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on their screen every day wow what we're ... I'm just curious like what's what's that\nWell\nThat we found out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us\nAnd the correct answer was white men not black children\nNot even kidding white man wearing protective black children or not that's not a good look\nIt's racist something's going on here there is absolutely some sort of an interest bias or systematic issue at Facebook said\nI'm doing well thank you so much for being here\nNot long after sitting down with Marsha Facebook invited me to come up to their offices in California and sit down with that kind of just consider your name and your title and\nI'm Monica bicker and I leave the policies for Facebook\nMonica bigger is in charge of all of Facebook's rules including their policies on hate speech and so after like why would there be a rule that protects white men but not black children\nWe have we has made our hate speech policies\nLet me let me rephrase that are hate speech policies have become more detailed overtime but our main policy issue can attack a person or group of people based on a protected characteristic characteristic like race religion or gender\nSaid this takes a couple of decades to explain but the gist of it is that uh the Facebook borrowed this idea of protected classes a straight from us anti discrimination law these are the laws that make it so that you can't not hire someone say based on like their religion their ethnicity there a race\nAnd so on on Facebook you can't attack someone based on one of these characteristics\nMeaning you can't say men are trash nor could you say women are trash or because essentially you're attacking all men for being men or is it they all can I say Bob is ... you can say Bob is trash because of my sources explained to me the\nDistinction is that in the first instance you're attacking a category in the second instance you were attacking a person but it's not clear that you were attacking that person because they are a member of a protected category\nOh so Bob might be trash for reasons that have nothing to do with him being a man yeah he just might be annoying right okay so that explains why you take down ... why would you leave up black children or ... why would that not get taken up\nSo traditionally we allowed speech once there was some other word in it that made it about something other than it protected characteristic\nIn Facebook jargon these are referred to as a a a non protected model fire\nJust means literally nothing [laughter]\nGive us an example of this so traditionally if you said I don't like this religion cab drivers\nCab driver would be the non protected modify or because employment is not protected category and so what the rules state it was a when you add this non protected modify or to a protected category in this case the cab drivers religion\nWe would allow it because we can't assume that you're hating this person because of his religion you actually just may not like a cab drivers\nSo in the case of black children children is modifying the protected\nCategory of black mhm and so children Trump's black their child ... Trump's their blackness you can say whatever I Want about black children whereas in the case of white men uh you've got a you've got gender and race both protected you can attack them\nThat's just a bizarre rule I Would think you would go the other direction to eat the protected\nClass would outweigh the modified well they they made this decision as they explained to me because of their default was to allow speech they were really trying to incorporate or not to the American free speech tradition\nAnd so there's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend is a valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we say this is so\nBad we're going to take it down and in this case their concern was were all members of like you know at least half a dozen protected categories like we all have gender we all have sexual orientation and if if you if the rule is that any time a protected class is mentioned it could be hate speech\nWhat you were doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone on Facebook to potentially be hate speech then you're left with anything right\nNo matter where we draw the line there are going to be some outcomes that we don't like they're always going to be casualties that's why we continue to change the policies\nAnd in fact since marshes debacle they've actually updated this rule so now black children are protected from what they consider the worst forms of hate speech\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is into consideration but despite that there are still plenty of people that it's fun because you are a social network including Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough\nThere are not systematic efforts to eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech\nMakes sense well yeah because in sort of hate speech or or thinking about hate speech there's this idea of of privilege or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups should have more protection or because of being historically disadvantaged ... ...\nThe challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nTo thousands Japanese reinforced in the Nineteen forties cut off the side\nYou had Japanese soldiers tens of thousands of Chinese telling millions of Chinese during World War two\nAt the same time you had Japanese American citizens than a hundred\nThousand persons of Japanese ancestry for\nBeing put into internment camps and so we had to ask ourselves a question like\nAre the Japanese and historically advantage or disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story and this happened at the exact same moment so you've got to different places to different cultural stories\nIn ... when you have a website like Facebook this trans National Community they realized they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond\nThat there is no way to a ... way and consider who is privileged above who and decided therefore that we're not going to allow historical\nAdvantage or historical privilege or into the equation at all [noise]\nAnd I think it's very important to keep in mind here and American these moderators only have like four or five seconds for Republicans ... ... to make a decision ... limited in the evening news in those four seconds is there enough time to to figure\nOut where in the world someone is particularly given idea dresses can easily be math going back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a ...\nAnd Jill during our better on black children [noise] and on top of that we often don't know an individual's race strange people on the other categories or even less clear like sexual orientation\nAnd they they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did a lot of cat and we saw some times that it was just too hard for our reviewers to implement a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept\nAnd converted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe and when you've got to move that fast sometimes justice loses\nThat that um that's the tension here\nAnd I just want to\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy peanut paste but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently but it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white\nOr but when we come back\nThose rules bacon toppled so\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation in Hampton public understanding of
