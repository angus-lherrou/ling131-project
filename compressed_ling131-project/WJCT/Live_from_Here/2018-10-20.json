{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Uh I I I I Would I Do pull does not surprise me at all and I do believe as you say that this has been a they're quiet when I mean it's the deadliest epidemic on our country's history and it's been percolating for Twenty years and yet it's only you can really say only in the last three years when I was writing my book dreamland\nI found it very little echo out there are very difficult time getting people interested in this ah who didn't have anything directly to do with it it was very much reminded me very much of the early days of the AIDS epidemic everyone wanted to hide it didn't want to confront it you know and and and I I think what's happened is that this is\nA been left to fester and percolate all across this country now and a critical mass was reached a at a certain point so now it's become come out of the shadows but\nBut it's definitely a a a a problem that has not been recognized to the extent that it ought to consider how widespread how deadly um uh it's been\n... and Jeff I I Know that you feel that there's a a conversation about race that needs to happen when it comes to the way we view\nBoth the epidemic itself and the way drug abuse drug to use the drug crisis is treated 'em both in the the I guess what the news media and also in entertainment\nWe talk about what you think about that yeah you know it's fascinating to me that this is a quote unquote sound epidemic that this is something which could have touched one of four people and uh and yet nevertheless not be blaring across the headlines with the kind of urgency that we have historically associated with\nA drug drug issues in say the inner city right the the crack epidemic of the eighties and so on so forth and\nI think it actually it it informs the tonality of how popular culture looks at drugs I think even in this episode we see a very strong empathy with Roseanne the apps and Roseanne and her family this is really about talking about victims about people who suffered an illness\nAh and and vanished because of that or or been harm because of that\nBut when we seen or other kinds of depictions of of addiction and of of drug use and abuse and dealership\nAmong black communities Hispanic comedians invariably about the predatory influence of the drug trade it's about the empowerment of drug dealers and how it you know that sort of invasive force harms not just black and Hispanic communities but of course I Jason White ones as well\nAnd that I think that's a little bit of a problem and how this talked about siding\nWith them you know I wanted to ask you I Know you feel that this is the the quiet crisis as the as you have\nDescribed it as part of me wonders whether it's because it's in part it started out as a rural crisis and the rural communities particularly the rural media for example it's been had been hollowed out in the way that say local newspapers have been hollowed out and it just that is that part is it uh\nI Would say that's probably part of it I Would say to that that the people involved you know I'm a member of the medium or working reporter for many years and and uh\nAnd if you and if if the people who are most affected actively don't want to talk about it if the obituaries that they write our purposely I'm a obfuscating or actual fabrications if you can't find those people willing to talk\nIt is very difficult to to bring it to to light and that is really what does happen all across the instructors starts and\nStarts in Appalachia the rust belt areas spread now of course I think really ... the biggest place you find it really is in the suburbs uh um mostly among white people I'd say Ninety five percent Ninety plus percent um\nBobbing white people but I Would say that there's a lot of those folks are just as some horror that they never imagined happening to their families on so uh they are very very unwilling to have been I Would say until until the last three years or ... or unwilling to talk about it when you don't have\nPeople who are most affected I Know it was a media a number of the media if you don't ...\nPeople most able to tell the poignant story you ... it's very hard to get traction on it and also if you don't have the kind of a I covered the crack epidemic that was my first job as a reporter uh and journalism many years ago when the child Stockton a\nCalifornia I could tell you the the you could not avoid the crack epidemic not because so much with the drug\nAbove but because of the ... the gang involvement that you it's a drive by shootings bullets so a crippling young young children um I mean that was it was impossible to avoid the crack epidemic in this one\nYou've seen overdoses sky rocket really as crime rates all across the country have really dropped precipitously and that's that's also a new thing about this up\nA dumb what your point about obituaries it's one of the other interesting stories this week it was just a an obituary about a young woman\nOr you know such a cliche went viral but it did in part because her family was so explicit about what happened to her and it was very much a cry of heart you know to people saying you know educate yourself about this just before you go let you go we have about a minute left I'd like to ask you as our culture what would you like to see what would you like to see a\nAs ... in in terms of how we address this issue for from a standpoint of our art because anytime you know the Hollywood or the artistic any take something on people always accused him of glamorizing it or not really telling it on the other hand you know so what would you like to see in the minute we have left\nI mean I I think it's really interesting that the two shows that we perhaps most associate with the ... of the drug trade\nA over our our our generation a Breaking Bad is one in into wire is the other right and they're they're both shows that are an incredible shows you know really great storytelling but the Breaking Bad almost has a sort of black it has ... to it ah that\nBrings a different energy to the thought about you know what that crisis represent about the human beings within it and not about an infrastructure system or a phenomenon or something right\nI I feel like a lot of times we don't see that that more human individual prospectus when you talk about you know drug issues in in non white communities I guess I'd like to see more of that more texture and more humanity\nThat shift Yankees uh CNN contributor and Wall Street journal online columnist joining
