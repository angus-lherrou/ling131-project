{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "I was raised to be a tally in Portuguese white [laughter] daughter of Italian Portuguese or is in the United states and everybody in my life lied to me because\nThey believed that they were making the right choice [noise] basically my entire life was whitewashed and since I have found out at Nineteen I haven't tried my best to learn about the culture so um\nIt's just been a jury and tarred\nSo white parents rarely talked with which is about ... knew that right near the reporting we've done and there's so many of your responses show has a whole different set of consequences for transracial adoptees\nIt does in gene we heard from several people who said their parents tried to minimize if not completely erased their racial difference ... he was adopted from South Korea by white parents and she says she was raised in a white suburb of Buffalo New York\nMy sister they're blond and blue eyed kind of your all American classic beauties and my brother looks like my dad all my life my parents have told me I'm just like my brother and sisters but\nI wasn't and I'm not I have\nConstantly felt uncomfortable and my own skin and when I was young at night I Would pray to God that I Would wake up looking just like my sister's um my parents were definitely not ready or equipped to raise a child of polar um they didn't know how to or want to talk about race\nQuestion number two that we is about the what's missing from mainstream conversations about adoption\nWhat's missing is the voices of adult adoptees like myself and birth mothers that's Rebecca assume basically if these stories about adoptive parents who have had to go through various ordeal to adopt their children are raised them\nBut centering the conversation on one perspective when they're really three parties involved in every adoption as limiting the public understanding of perception of adoption\nThree parties birth families adoptive families and adopt these\nAdoptees though they grow up mhm their feelings about being adopted\nEveryone expects you to feel grateful but it's more complicated than that everyone expects you to appreciate a good life that you have but he's still so complicated times you know not everything is come ... those\nThat's Caitlin how she reached out to us for this episode so I called her up to interview her she lives in Eugene Oregon where she works for Holt International children's services which was founded in Nineteen fifty six and it's the same agency that her parents used to adopt her almost Thirty years ago\nI Am a Korean adoptee and I work in the post adoption services department of the agency a it's a brand new position it's really kind of a new innovative direction that we're moving to include adoptees in programming for adoptees what\nHave you done specifically to\nYou know address these issues that you're talking about these issues that adoptees and brought up to us is feeling isolated feeling like they never had a real chance to get in touch with their birth culture or what have you been doing in your job to make\nThese adoptees feel like they're not isolated made do you have a connection to where they\nI think what I've actually seen sharing is that it's not I think that there is this assumption that the longing is for birth culture\nBut a lot of the times it's a longing for like deep connection to people that are like you so I think that that happens in a couple of ways to do work that um I've done one is that we have adopted camp they started out as heritage camps\nUm but the realization happened that they're adopted from all over the world now in the U.S\nAnd so I we do something called cabin talk so there's a topic of the day and I remember the first year that I was account where we're sitting around and there is domestic adoptees and their wife adopted from China Korea\nEthiopia and we're all sitting around and everyone was just sharing their birth story\nAnd for us for stories are pretty traumatic stories you know for one girl it's like all I Know about my birthdays I was abandoned in front of a government building in China like that's extremely traumatic if that's your first known existed\nBut what was amazing about sitting in a circle is we went around the circle and everyone shared something pretty similar to that and so in hearing the stories that adopt he knows that she's not alone in that grief\nThese adoptees who I'm assuming are all youth right that are going to just yeah OK yeah nine to Seventeen they are just so hungry for a place where there are other kids were the exact situation that they're in and that all almost in in of itself that is their identity which I feel like we don't talk about yeah I agree\nI Would actually at a conference it was like the Korean adoptees Chicago to his annual conference but that was the first time in twenty nine years that I've ever sat in a room of entirely create an adult adoptees\nAnd it was extremely emotional and I just remember um\nDuring the closing ceremony one of the adult adoptees was on the stage and they made the remark that you know you guys are my homeland\nAnd I think that that really hit ... deep inside of me because it is just like we kind of feel or we can have that feeling like we're not really creating for all intents and purposes and we're always recognized as a foreigner in the states so where is where it our homeland as adoptees\nAnd for a lot of adult adoptees I think they might not any ...
