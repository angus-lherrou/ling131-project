{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "So let's see Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski is one of only two senators to vote across party lines she voted against Kevin uh Joe Manchin of West Virginia Democrat\nBeing the other he voted for Kavanaugh I was wondering if you've been covering not just her but you've also been covering the people who are trying to influence her vote tell us about that what do you think based on what you had been reporting influenced her thinking on this I\nThink she was very much um moved by all the women that came to Washington women in Alaska uh jumped on last minute airplanes got on red eyes and got up the next morning off the airplane without any sleep and you know went to lobby her and went to talk to her in a lot of them were\nUm sexual assault survivors Alaska has a sky high rate of sexual assault and\nA lot of them told their stories and um the ACLU sponsored a big group of Alaskan so a lot of them were lawyers and I'm name you know made their case especially about judicial temperament\nUm they actually brought the judicial code of conduct into their meetings with her and she said that on the floor so a lot of the um survivors and attorneys I talked to who met with Lisa Murkowski in the last couple of days felt like they heard their arguments and their stories in her statement at least to some degree\nAnd you also do a where the reporter who asked her if she had she herself had had a meat to moment which is something that a lot of reporters picked up on do you think that was relevant [noise] um\nHe was relevant I don't think it was you know it wasn't the direct cause of how she reacted but she and she didn't tell us much about her me to moment but the emphatic way that she answered immediately without thinking about it told me that she identified to some extent with\nAh the need to stories and that um that these stories must have really resonated with her more because she had that experience\nTo carry we're hearing so much about anger right that anger so much a part of our political environment now are you hearing that and what is it that people say they're angry about\n[noise] I Am hearing that I hear kind of short fuses and you know I've been doing the show for over a decade I can tell when people feel like they're kind of at the end of their rope\nUm and this is one of those types of fields chaotic and is ordered and we have a a bunch of highly competitive\nRaces in Minnesota and so the atmosphere already feels\nElevated and then you throw this Kavanaugh situation and to that and\nThe I think the anger is kind of hair trigger one wrong comment by one caller can trigger a big social media reaction or three other calls end of the show um you know and still with four weeks to go I I think people are experiencing this at a\nYou know at a at a kind of level that we haven't seen in our state again with a bunch of competitive races thrown in\nA Charlie what about you I Know that in the past when just when you were concluding your long stint as a talk show hosts ... and you you wrote about the anchor and frankly you wrote\n... with some regret about your what you saw it was kind of your role in stoking it and now that you've had a little bit of distance from it what what do you think is is do you agree that this is just a hair trigger a moment and everybody seems elevated what what's your take on why that is\nNo she's she's absolutely right that is very much a a hair trigger but when you can really see that\nOn social media is that I'm In it is you put it that way because just you know the slightest I'm wrong turn with the use of the wrong word or um any attempted nuance and and and you're going to be flattened on social media\nAnd I think that this is a reflection of the tribal ... of our politics and and the and the substitute of rage for argumentation you you really get the sense that no one any longer\nIs trying to persuade anyone would it change anyone's mind or the goals seems to be\nThe beat the other side or to make heads explode and I think that's about a culture that's been coming along time and it's really come to a head\nRight now I'm at this particular moment and um you know it's very much a a a ... maybe you know a a landmark in the in the Trump era where everything seems to be about you know smash mouth politics and the politics so but you know deny deny deny and attack attack attack\nAnd without much regard for the long term consequences to the culture or to the institutions that we're talking about\n[noise] and ... and here's where I'm going to have to ask you to speculate but we already know that\nYou know the president's already said that Lisa Murkowski is going to pay a political price for this therapy Leno former governor of Alaska a former vice presidential nominee\nTreated about this saying that Lisa Murkowski is going to pay political practice I Do have to say that you know my inbox often it's been filling up would fare interest groups from both sides of the aisle\nIdentifying either party who they say is going to pay a political process but but but tell me about the Alaska case in about ... Senator Murkowski ... what what is your sense of it\nUm my sense of it is that Senator Murkowski is more popular than champagne Len in Alaska and um that ah that President Trump might not have his finger on the pulse of I'm Lisa Murkowski's base among her base this is\nWas the position they want to try to take really across party lines are drawn to her base is a moderate Democrat to add Democrats this week tell me that she was the only Republican they've ever voted for and they expected her to do the right thing and they thought that she would listen to them and\nUm I think among among her base this was the move that they want to turn to make\nIt well we'll have to see I'm Sorry I don't have time to dig into this even more than I pack you all so much for\nFor the kind of rare calm conversation that we do\nSeem to be having difficulty having these days I Want to thank all of you for that lives risk it as a reporter with Alaska Public radio Charlie Sykes is an author a political commentator Harry Miller is the host an NPR News at Minnesota Public radio everybody think he lost so much for talking with us today thank you thank you\n\nFor Saturday That's all things considered from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin we are back tomorrow we thank you for listening and we hope you have a great night [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the logging meat is Brewing Company ... supporters of the tiny desk contest and working to help band reach more ears through bears more logging neatest dot com\nAnd from Jones Day in integrated partnership collaboratively providing legal services for more than a century forty three officers five continents serving clients as one from worldwide learn more at Jones Day dot com\nAnd from the national endowment for the arts art works\nIs there a glass of this American Life and coming to Jacksonville talk I costs seven things I've learned\nWere dealt a bunch of stories with videos waiting that never been on the radio\nSaturday remember ten\nAm worried a theater a ticket to Florida Theater dot com\nThe Proud Boys think feminism went too far and it's bad for men and women\nThe feminist mentality bodes very well for guys who just want to screw women and then dumped them when they become thirty five I think women have their head screwed on properly they realize that it's your so called sexist who have their best interest in mind\nThe new male chauvinists I'm next time onto the best of our knowledge frumpy art acts Sunday at three PM on eighty nine nine W.

northeastern Portland Maine to the Long Island sound fall is slowly emerging but the leaves starting to turn in the last summer's warmth lingering in the air\nBut the locals know what's coming and can be seen pulling out their snow shovels and practicing they're unhappy winter faces\nThe first person I ran into was John working at a hotel shining shoes he's eighty six years old and decided to spend his retirement by working at yet another job\nWhat else am I going to do is walk around the mall and count my steps that sounds like the way they torture you on a Turkish prison I had it down to the war looking for a lobster role and took a seat in an outdoor cafe overlooking the water\nI met a middle aged couple who were enjoying a drink in the sun from the playful way they interacted I thought they were on their first date but it turned out they've been married for eleven years and funny enough still like each other\nKerry and Brian met in Portland while attending a mini kiss concert\nMany

a giant beer belly dressed up in his very own kiss costume\nKerry said I like this picture because Brian looks like gene Simmons if he ate one of the guys from many gifts\n[noise]\nIt was time for me to take it over to get my rental car for the journey down the coast I was picked up by Sean he's twenty five and it's been driving for the past three years ever since he lost his job at the moving

show to give it a shot even though he's not sure how to do it or what might it might have country it is\nI picked up my midsize rental and headed down the coast along route Ninety five\nIt was a beautiful ride that ended at the Oregon points ferry across the Long Island sound to the far eastern points of Long Island\nAs we pulled out into the sea I was reminded of how beautiful the east coast truly is and the boats make me sea sick\nI hate boats I get claustrophobic\nLike being trapped we're nowhere to go that's why I don't go on cruises it's like paying someone to put me in a hostage situation [noise]\nHave you ever closed horizon held onto a railing for dear life and when you came to realize you were hugging a man from Bridgeport, Connecticut\nWhen we finally got to land I found a hotel in Riverhead New York and slipped off the nausea\nLater that night I went to a seafood restaurant and sat next to three white guys in their seventies who looked like retired fishermen\nThey wore faded jeans and washed out T shirts two of them at messy gray hair under tattered baseball caps and the other was his bald as a clam suddenly in the corner of the bar a woman started singing karaoke\nIt seemed weird in a place like this but a crowd quickly gathered around as she felt it out me and Bobby McGee the fisherman just scouts\nAnd she ended the strong applause one of the crusty old fisherman marched up to the microphone as if he was going to pull the plug on the whole affair\nBut then he grabbed him I closed his eyes pointed at the D.

phones and dancing along I look\nOver to his friends but they kept right on eating buffalo wing as if he does this all the time he entered into a standing ovation and shuffled off and before I knew what his bald friend was up there\nWithout taking his hands out of his sweat shirt pocket he bounces round head from side to side stopped\nAnd Bon Jovi living on a prayer began the entire bar lost their mind\nEveryone was screaming the lyrics with the IRS held high as this old dude rocked out with less emotion than a plate of oysters I never saw anything like it a very attractive waitress was hugging the tall fisherman and showing her phone case with a picture of David Bowie on the ball guy\nWas shaking hands with strangers as women squeezed him and kissed this had\nHave you ever thought
