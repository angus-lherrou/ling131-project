{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Has had pros and cons and if I was able to talk to President Trump today you know I Would I Would challenge him on that and I would encourage him to be more civil especially on Twitter but with that said you know with every president there or strength and their weaknesses and I would consider that one of his definite weaknesses\nIt's one of the reasons that I Try to speak up more for some of it because uh I think everyone should have influence including the president of the United states\nI think his tone has changed some I think some of his policies some of the things that have been enacted have been very good for the country but I think that's something that he specifically has to work on him so and I'm not afraid to say that\nI see what about you does that how does that sit with you what Chad just said yeah [noise]\nWell [noise] um chat and I definitely have differences [laughter] I\nAnd he um we talk about that quite a bit\nI Do not obviously support President Trump because\nAs I already told you I Am I'm blue in progressive he's um [noise] I don't support his policies and I don't support what I see us as moral shortcomings\nUm I don't know that Chad would go so far as to say that his incivility is a moral shortcoming but I that's what how I feel about it so chat and I have many very civil discussions and we are very different when we come down on on very different sides on on a lot of\nWhat makes what helps you to do that is it because we both live here and you're going to see each other at the grocery store or is it now has you just like each other now or I've I've never run into him at the girls [laughter] how to do that\nIt's because we both have a commitment to listening and when we sit down at the table with each other we come with an open mind really wanting to know what the other person thinks about\nAn issue and not trying to win the argument we know that we're not going to change each other's opinions on anything and that's not our goal our goal is really curiosity and open heart\nWhat advice does each of you have for people as we head into the home stretch of this election year\nMy first advise people would be vote I think we need to come to realize that we have started thinking of politics as\nWin lose or life in general as win lose that I have to be choose to to do well and actually where we have had the most progressive in civilization is when we have learned to work together to everyone's benefit\nI Wonder if this work that you're doing here has special resonance in part because you are in Gettysburg\nWhich was the scene of so much carnage earlier in our history and does that in a way of providing a counterpoint when you when you think about how many lost their lives here when this country was pulled apart and you're thinking well okay what what ... what do you think\nThat could be I grew up in the south and three of my great uncles fault and the war two of them died\nAnd I wonder when they came on not knowing whether the house was still the one came home not knowing when the house was still standing I wondered if they looked at all that had happened\nAnd they remember that Lincoln had tried to offer an out to free the slaves buying them back one state at a time as was done in many Latin American countries and I thought good grief where we nuts too which\nI think that when when we think about the fact that we're meeting at\nThe church called the prince of peace which was billed as a memorial of reconciliation between the north and south after the civil war I think that that says a lot about what our community stands for and work that we're trying to do\nDoes it have some special meaning for you\nBut this work is taking place in Gettysburg and on the way you were born and raised but does it provided a bit of residence for the work you're trying to come\nI often refer to myself as a rebel in Yankee territory and I say that you know the tongue in cheek but uh it it certainly does make a difference and I've said you know enough and talking with his car and Darcy I said if we can't talk about civility in Gettysburg and work and I\nAnd so um I happen to carry around oftentimes the civil war ... with me because that reminds me\nThat\nIt wasn't just about political strategies it was about the bullets that tore through the the the blood bone and flash of fellow Americans and\nI'm off also\nNot afraid to say and have confirmed as with many people that if we don't focus more on civility in this day in time we're moving closer and closer toward another civil war if we're not careful\nSome of the headlines that we see across the country um and a lot of it depends on whether you focus on the positives are focused on the negatives but there are a lot of really bad stories across the country and that's why it's been encouraging to be a part of this group and to kind of resonate the message of civility\nBecause it is very very important especially in this day in time we have a chance to make a huge difference and if we don't take that opportunity than we've really missed out\nOn the London Chad collie Darcy Myers and car Thompson they are members of the group politics back and civility we met up with them at prince of peace a fiscal church in Gettysburg,
