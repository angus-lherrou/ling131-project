T.\nHello and welcome to ISI PM radio a program of curated interviews with northeast Florida leading artist his makers and entrepreneurs I'm your host Tim driskell\nEmbracing all things narrative as her work in a world event under league higher Adam ... teaching artist and their practitioner applied behavioral science unit runs for change a practice that facilitates person leadership development created a scholar writing an active isn't to arson culture in\nA workplace people together an honest dialogue or cross cultural differences were vision of shared power empathy equity and belonging takes shape\nAnd she's nice guess was shown water broke in short\nSupply we are black women born into a society as in trench\nLoading and contempt\nFor what ever is black and female we are strong and enduring we're also deeply scarred\nNot you know I'm somebody being now named John Adams tour again if we go back to route\nTo can't say right was was not Toby core and so you know for a while we were taking on these new biblical names and maybe it was around like I Would say between the fifties and sixties within the black power movement that you saw people again try to re collect and give I think new\nNaming ground to their first names\nUm and then that just kinda kept of all the way you get into like the eighties you get into the nineties and not a you know like went to the the thousands of of of this living in Kentucky actually we're still struggling to find our our unity within our names um sometimes you don't want your name to be of a certain things or if you do\nI have a little bit more enthusiastic name once you get into the professional world you change it I'm not to give too much away there was a friend of mine and she had a you know a typical I Would say you know kind of black girl named ...\n... but yet I knew when she was professional that was not the name that she went by and that world and it was I was a little bit shocked at first 'cause I've constantly been show on\nBut I've not always worked within the bigger corporate landmines what that is but I constantly had to fight for people to pronounce your name correctly or to not add\nExtra in or today at anything extra on it like to pronounce the Asian of it is she'll wanna if it's not show wanna and being in high school during the time of you know in living color and Martin and having so many other people to now be influenced and to be able to see black life\nYou know I I I always struggled with\nHow people would say it where you know you had that context of who should ne ne was and what she looked like and what was attributed to her and if you had a black man playing a black caricature of a woman but for people who didn't get a win in on the joke when they would come to you wouldn't be like you know um [noise]\nWhat's up show wanna or you know the whole you go girl colloquial ... like it didn't feel authentic from our mouth\nRight and then it becomes a stereotype and buffoon hurry and all that kind of a thing and so naming is really important and and for me with with my last name is higher ... Adams people want to call me that Adams because they can say higher\nAnd higher ... German right do you know I Walk around with this French and German named combination\nAnd I tell people or Mrs Adams as my mother in law Mrs hires my mother I Am is hired or Adam yeah go vote [laughter] although it is not to separate names that is one so that's a real challenge for folks and I correct folk on a regular basis\nI think you have to again because then it makes them feel like they can be so comfortable with that familiarity so let's talk a little bit tighter Adams about a year the context of all your career facets I lose it a little bit before that you know you used to work in the financial world came out a little bit more about what you did an executive\nIn banking I worked in an area called change management strategies a it was with core states financial core which is now\nFolding under Wells Fargo and I'm ... years ago this was in the nineties and we were really large regional bank in the northeast and our um headquarters was in Philadelphia and I reported directly to the c._e._o.\nAnd our work really centered around looking at organizational culture\nAnd creating strategies for growth looking at our structure so I'm during that time in the nineties thinking went through a lot of mergers and acquisitions\nSo I Would do cultural assessments knowing from our bank of banks we thought about buying we did a lot of work in diversity leadership process improvement reengineering [noise] ah so there's a lot of training and poor relations employment so it was really around people strategies\nThat I'm incredulous just again just hearing all the factors that went into this one very job and I feel like you took in a great deal of what that is and you now extended it more to your creative life but you always had the creativity their absolute within what you were doing for\nWell the thing about it as I tell people I never held an incumbent job I think I had one job and my career was incumbency my my life began as a musician mhm and so um I play guitar and I was a guitar teacher studied opera and you know classically trained a list is too now yes songwriter all that good stuff composer\nSo when I went into banking I was to tar teacher and then went into training and retail I was a trainer and retail and\nI was hired by bank because they needed somebody to come in and create a leadership um experience for their bank they had trainers for tellers but they didn't have any other type of development\nSo I went in and created this whole thing from the bank and then from that point other banks wanted me to come in and start a new departments and so for me ah because my background was you know being an educator your music and\nAnd also I'm educator in retail I always thought about with the client or customer need and design that back\nSome very customer focused and looking back with the customer needs and building there from that back\nThat gave me a lot of cache and um [noise] created a tons of opportunity for me in corporations and so when I left banking I actually out sourced\nThe department that Iran as a third party business for the bank and undergo shaded a contract where I'm myself my management team and the bank were all co owners\nOf the business and I did that until that business was bought out by wacko via this now and we'll go and they didn't have that business model and so I bought a um a hundred percent of our shares and and I ran a profitable consulting firm for Fifteen Years after that\nJust before I moved to Jacksonville area I decided I did not want to\nHead up a corporate a consulting firm any more than I wanted to be an individual practitioners so I decided to come down here\nAnd now I Am a running narratives for change which is a social enterprise I'm using storytelling as a way to support women and girls to advocate for herself\nAnd for her tribe and using um the written and spoken and visual storytelling to do that so that's the emphasis on my practice now\nAnd let's let's let's let's break into a little bit like these narratives um\nYou just recently remarked on how you know you we were working within the financial institutions you you weren't you're not from Jacksonville claiming though you already did have a little bit of an awareness of the city\nAnd some contacts here but your family isn't from here now my husband and I like the fun of the transplant I call it I feel like you've you've definitely made 'em such an impact right off from the very beginning\nUm you've already served on a couple of very interesting boards and committees the work that you have done like you know within their does for change\nIs definitely permeating around the city you just had a very successful um\nTalk into presentation over at yellow house within talking about like upcoming work that you're working on so in addition to being this lyricist is financial wizard you know you're also this ah incredible writer and poet\nAnd had been expressing yourself within those ways and so we talk a little bit earlier about how um [noise]\nEven though you are right or you're you're still musician kind of number one at heart and so much of what you first have to feel um comes into a melody quite style before you start getting on the vibes of the words yeah it's like you and I both know words are\nIncredibly powerful and the way that they're implemented and put together in order to affect empathy or change in story and really the best story teller is who we remember it's it's not a lot of times that because of history\nIs it's always so honest truthful from everyone's perspective somebody just got the ability to tell the story and to have that be the conditional thing that we take up\nAs we're coming I'm into this landmine of of context and miss confusion with words and propaganda and fake news how do we take these narratives back and to explain them again within our own usage in our own mouth\nSuch a great question because people ask me a lot because I've been teaching creative writing now for about Seventeen years and and teaching creative writing a mutt really differentiates kind of like my teaching style\nIs to have people tell the truth we're so used to dressing up\nYou know to sell ourselves brand ourselves um to make ourselves look good for other people and so I I look at people's stories and I said okay this is my story so if I were to peel back in the onion\nWhat the guts of the story is you know tell me more about that\nAnd I help people pill back the onions until they can get to that kernel of their own personal truth and they know that there when the tears of their their choked up is maybe a story that they feel like they don't want to tell them they can't tell I said this issue baby you know nobody's forcing you to put this out on the universe\nBut you got to get it out of your body you can always dress it up for the universe but you got to get the story out of your body and when you can hit that kernel of truth\nTrust yourself to you're going to shape it in a way where you can tell you the truth and put it out into the world and for me that is a critical part of the work that I Do in there and this would change when I help\nThat has like you know Father's Day is coming up or probably about a ton of ... that would have already passed but a Father's Day and then they have like uh the baby's daddy think and I fell out of context and conversation people be like well that's not just\nA word that his own you know within the black community but yet on the front of the card they had you know the features\nOf what looked like people of African descent so it wasn't like they had five different baby daddy cards you had this car and it's very clear who you were marketing to his um so\nI think we can be angry about that but then when when when it comes time to speak in that tone and in that voice than if they don't ... don't don't you don't need to be up that upset but but there's there's room for anger and everything else too\nAnd their sentence has to do with the cumulative impact\nBecause it is the micro aggressions ...\nOf so many pebbles it's like if I'm On the beach of ... pick up a pebble there's another thing that's another thing that's another thing yeah so you know with my main you know the baby daddy you know size loudness which is supposed to look like I mean you just add up all the micro aggressions my\nHair yeah my speak you add up all the ... ... on the beach and then I got to tell you it's a huge huge rock yeah wow you know it's a huge huge rock so part\nOf this thing it's not just the the thing that we're talking about in the moment and the other creepy crawly rocks underneath that saying so there's there's so much more involved\nAnd if we ... where do we have these conversations true [laughter]\nMe I'm not going to set up part of why you know like I Want it to create this this this platform this podcast was because again I didn't feel like I was able to have\nAll these ... these ... conversations in a way that people would be able to get it over time like it's it's not just one thing there's a lot of multi facets and when you said that rock like I felt that way is just this\nTo really come into spaces and to own your identity and the authenticity of what that is\nThat's no easy feat and I'd get Iraq I I I commend you all the time I feel like\nYou walk around with this um with his bravery and the self confidence that I'm sure again like you know there are moments where you know you're not completely all the way your shoes but even still I\nFeel this light from you and the presence of being and I know that was hard work to to get to that point and it's also not let others shame you for it\nAnd make you feel a certain kind of way\nBecause you are coming into it with your whole identity\nAnd also sometimes having to be that person\nTo challenge others that when things get left out or when people want to change your words if you submit something and you said it in this way and then you come back and then they they put it like this I like that I Know that you even like that's not what I said correct to keep it to how I said it to you and\nWe don't have to let other people like because maybe they're afraid of what that looks like but then we're still not being real\nAbsolutely you know people want to control our words you meant to say this oh here's what I heard you say okay well that's what you heard him say let me tell you what I said and what I meant so that\nMy words can be clear that there for me and not from what you think I should be saying or what you thought you hurt [noise] and so it really gets real dicey and as you and I know words matter yeah and so you know I'm not saying I have never said where's I Wish I could take back because I have had those moments and for the most part\nThere words that I met\nAnd [laughter] you know there's very few words that I say that I don't mean ray but it's not like it's never never happened so and and we're all you know we're all in this growth process together one of the things that I always tell people and say you know what when we talk about changing growth\nThat is not pretty is messy yeah I was one of my clients up in D. C. um we call it I call it funk stank they crack up at that because like we've legitimize there were bumps thing\nI said look I said it's a dance is messy you gonna do three steps forward and two steps back I it's it's gross desperate growth looks like we got to give ourselves a little bit of grace\nBecause if we don't know they were were falling into this facade of of perfection which none of us have\nWe have to give each other grace because we're going to say things that are raggedy and messy as we try to learn about how to change ourselves and how to accept um these different says that we are exposed to everyday when we show up into places\nAnd so for me I Am unapologetically is at all the time what you see is what you get consistently um one of the things even people who don't like me over my career has said you know you've read I never was one for your style but you've always been very consistent so\nWhen somebody says you do the eggs I Know you do because you didn't do it for this that and the other and I know you didn't do it here and for me of a compliment\n[laughter]\nI Am very ... [laughter]\nWell you know I I've enjoyed our conversation doesn't far I Know we would continue to keep talking about how we keep disrupting these narratives [noise] you know I just want to thank you unapologetically YV E. T. P. E.\nIs here on the microphone and and it was in the salon and just for that encourage meant on grace\nAnd and and trying to do our best and also for giving ourselves at those moments when we fail and that we can continue to get back in the game\nAnd hopefully a to our ... who are listening I'm a good reminder of that we need to check in with one another\nUm and and and that's okay like you know the way you want somebody to be or behave or look\nIs not necessarily the way that they need to be and we have to be a lot more accepting\nAbsolutely we need to embrace ... sister from Celeste do\nWe do we do [noise]\nHaider Adam tighter messed it up tighter Adam I'll get it correct thank you um thank you again for coming on the show and talk with us we just appreciate your time and your value and for those of us who want to be more in contact with you how can they reach\nYou know ... me on Facebook and you can get me a narrative for change on Facebook and also the bones or leak higher ...
