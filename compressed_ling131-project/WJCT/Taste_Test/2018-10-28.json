I design from um assistant director as the ... from the English language department so long that I Can't even remember\n... yes I was like what was your [laughter]\nYes I was working\nWith students every day and now here I Am the city has just completely changed\nWhile well that is a dramatic change how how has it been for you how was the ... change in\nCase I was working at you and if at the time when we decided to open okay helping my mom as much as I can when she first decided to you know I'm open to shop on this I was there like after I got out of work and on the weekends I was with her every day\nAnd\nWhile I was working at U. N. F. all of his teachers and other you know\nMy other co workers would always come up to me and say boy\nI don't know where you shop but can you just take me shopping like cannot let you just a style me\nReally yes I Would get this like several times like throughout the day and I asked him like what is it like I ... I shop at the same place you do the town's center right for like ... what is it that makes you think that I Am different\nWho say well you're not wearing a typical like teachers outfits\nOh like ... lawyers outfit like you know color shirt buttoned down with like a pencil skirt was you know pumps their heels are well like a little blazer I didn't do any of that\nThat I stayed really modest and conservative because you know I was interacting with students all the time that I needed to present myself as a teacher\nUm and I had to be very very creative so I didn't really have like one particular brand or ... like shop that I Would constantly go I Would just want\nTo put my outfits together that's including like accessories\nNot just the clothes that I'll be wearing and my mom was you know as we were working in the shop I made an observation how people were not bringing old close to repair that is what I that's I first thought oh alteration a place where people get their close repair\nEighty to Ninety percent people were bringing brand new clothes they were literally walking in our shop with shopping bags with tax is still on them and asking us to\nTailor ... fitted\nReally and they were paying they were paying more\nThan what they just paid for it the costs of the tracks so this is a very interesting study mom these ladies I mean even like twelve and Thirteen year old girls they will come with address and say\nI Need this to be fit it looks perfectly fine but you know like the shoulders aside maybe the length of some you know ladies would have longer torso where they need something longer so we wouldn't be linked in it instead of making it shorter\nSo we want to get all these request and I pulled those two things together new clothes that people are getting altered and all of my friends and coworkers were asking me to style [laughter] I'm going to put this together\nRight and then open up a boutique where when people come in and shot with us they would get the alteration service not an additional service but it's all included\n[noise] oh yeah oh wow I mean that's really smart so you basically were\nYou saw the need mhm\nAnd then with your mother wants to make the transition yes and what was going on with you\nSo well it all happened very organically yes interesting so could you tell people who are not familiar with money um could you tell us about your brand like what kinds of things do you do what kinds of clothes you carry what does your study yes\nSo I only self what I Would wear when I go shopping for a mommy I look up the pieces and I asked myself what question joy where are you worried this if I say no to myself that I don't buy it and so\nMy style I like being very conservative modest I don't really like showing a lot of my skin okay um but at the same time I'm able to keep up with all the trends\nSo that's our luck and when I was working at U. N. F. one of the challenges was that I had his shop for two different occasions like one for work and then I ... I had to put another budget towards aside for a weekend and fun\nOK okay but I wanted I Want to be able to put one outfit and then make it possible so that I can still have fun with my friends on the weekends\nSo the pieces that I carry out money mhm they're worker prefer yet\nBy the same time you can make it super fun and turn it into evening and going out where [noise] that's Iran's oh\nWait okay I'm I'm a processing all of this as you told me so an outfit that can transform are you saying by changing a top with a certain bottom or songs were yes we make a transition yes from work mode in club\n[laughter] so I mean like let's not is another [laughter]\nI went I went to the clubs are above it yeah [laughter] let's\nSay you know there are those really like a blouse but some of the laws there like\nIt would only work for work I mean I don't I'm being very careful not to say some brands because you know we have to be careful but you know there are just some tough you just go in and everything you see it just work work work work work uh-huh but then don't you want to be able to make it where you can still wear it at night\nOr on the weekends but I was shot for those yeah that is very interesting yeah that's our brand\nYeah are there are there certain sorts of pilots that usually end up using in particular certain sorts of textures were like ... summer's materials in particular I enter onto\nUm materials so the people that I work with most of our um\nClientele there are in that Avondale that or tea or that same Margot um neighborhood where\nPeople want to look good they want to look stylish but I have a lot of moms they want to look up but be comfortable and there\nShe might be a mom with two three kids where she don't she doesn't want to wear shorts and a T shirt because she wants to be comfortable she still wants to be stylish on trend I make sure all of my fabric they're all reasonable and it's very important and that\nIt's ... [noise] [noise] okay\nUm so I Do have you know this list that I always stick with making sure that moms will say yes because I don't want moms flipping through dresses and say oh I Can't get that because it doesn't have line or I Can't get this because this is to see either I Can't get this because\nUm it's not good for my child he's much hot as rubbing on me all the time\nI see yes she's got a lot of a long checklist yes\nWow well have a question for you so I spoke to you briefly before so you came here ... years old from Korea with your family not speaking any English zero English [noise] that must have been a little rough [noise]\nYeah I I don't want to remember I don't want to record and you have to [laughter] to bring [laughter] what do you but I buried her trauma girl one story that traumatized me was when I was in Korea before getting on the plane my parents said\nJust twenty six letters of athletes that's all you need\nYou know so you know they've told you he told me that like okay so we're going to practice from a to Z okay I've repeatedly practice writing a to Z ad masters I got all the letters okay my hours ready like mom I got it\nI went to school my first day of school\nI Am trying to find all of these letters that I've been practicing from a to Z okay I came home crying telling my mom mom I Do not think you taught me to write letters because I only recognized one\nSo I have a question for you though you know there are a lot of people were very scared to get out there on their own and do their own thing and then then they're always talking about tomorrow and that tomorrow sometimes never comes yes you know you're having a discussion about your mom and her getting to a certain point in her life\nAnd it took that scare to to to get her to that space you understand what I mean you did it much much younger but [noise] does the balance though 'cause you're saying prepare get ready mhm but at the same time\nSetting realistic goals\n[noise] now that can be a very dangerous thing what has received a realistic uh you know most designed as an artist I Know are realistic at all and that's kind of like the sources\nOf [laughter]\nIt was like the source of the brilliance is that like most things don't make sense and mostly but gosh how do I so so how do you know when you're ready I don't know how you know you were ready\nOh so I knew that I wanted to open up a boutique somewhere within that area five points Avondale Murray Hill like all that area okay if I see a space yes I Will call okay\nIs it available how much is it yeah I Would get all the information down and door would close\nThat I wait for another like a year or two there's another space I knock again so the first location that open that was my fifth one that I Know they have finally opened really yes and then when I not that time uh-huh\nI was able to sign the lead within exactly seven days later that I knew wow this is going to open so\nYou know there are times where like whatever you're doing there's like a law is like a huge you know ... or like where you just can't jump over\n... there's a reason [noise] ...\nJust you know cause you're still putting yourself out there yeah Phil knocking on ... door\nYes but you're saying that it's a door doesn't open shuts on you that's just the message that\nThat maybe there are other things that you need to take care of okay ... uh-huh you're still focusing you still have that goal I still had a go of like\nI'm going to be a boutique owner okay yeah but not getting upset that is that an open but just waiting because it was this location was not the right location for me\n[noise] uh-huh I see and what was exciting when you opened um and I was familiar with the alteration shop but then I noticed then you moved\nFurther down I'm near one river pizza and then you opened up the spot and then I saw mommy sign and it's and then from that moment on\nI heard a whole lot about mom me\nYes because that's when we open adds a boutique full boutique yes\nAnd from the very beginning you hit the ground running it wasn't like you didn't seem like it took a while for people to figure out\nThat you were there you know there are a lot of businesses let me let me see if it's you know there are a lot of businesses that sit around they open up and people were kind of indifferent and they don't do much this is like it seemed like soon as you\nGot that thing going everyone was talking about you what's up with that I [laughter]\nI don't know like I said I'm always working on all the shots I don't know what's going on outside\nI have to say about if if that's true I think it's just a brand that I was able to corroborate it's something that they've never seen before\n[noise] and you feel like so when it comes to Brandon yourself especially for young designers we're trying to get out there what are the ... what are some of the definite don't so their mistakes you've seen some other younger designers make\nYour own business owners make that you can kind of more than about ... made some really good decisions Trey\n... stays true to yourself\nUm\nYou might get disappointed let's say this let's say project number one that didn't work out that he tried something totally different that's not even you and your bouncing\nHere and there than you are never being true to yourself\nSo I say branding is the key to any success and people ask why did you move out of your second location that quickly is because I went to pay more attention and\nCreate that brand the look so it's not even just about people coming in the shop to look at what I have but I wanted to present it as soon as they drive and park [noise]\nThat's why you're in that fancy house yes ... from the store front and then there's a standalone house yes fancy yard I was excuse me yes nicer walkway ...\nHold on our walk ... to this not just about when they come in and you know looking through the rocks at the moment they come in and pull in your sorrow yes creating the whole story\nWow so before we run out of time how can people reach you um where is the store located and could you tell us about online or social media were ... or social media\nUm it's among the ... one word and you can shop online at ... dot com and we're working very hard um [noise]\nUm I feel so bad I feel guilty that I'm not talking about my mommy girls of oh this is not to shout them out but I Would not be here without 'em all I have to have to say it's all like says ... more gay and a half Sally\nMary\nNatalie and have Stephanie all those girls were working very very hard to put this brand together yes she got a whole whole team yes I thought I was going to be working\nA low as soon as you know I left the U. S. mhm oh I'll be fine open to close every single\nDay but no like a month later I Need to help immediately yeah so here we are today\nWith all those people you said you're still in there all the time\nYeah because it's a small shop so when people come in because it's a local business do you want to see\nThe owner there they want to see who is behind to this you know behind the story\nSo I Try to be there as much as I can see if I'm not out of town ... on my business trips mhm that I Try to be there\nThat's impressive because you don't necessarily have to be there yeah but you feel like that old customer get out of experience that you feel like you should be there\nBecause it's yeah like you said it's part of the experience let's say she is just coming in to buy a gift but if I'm there\nI'd be talk and I show her this that and I never pressure any of my customers to buy anything I make sure they're comfortable they have their own space um but you know they might walk out finding a new ... new shirt that they have to add to their wardrobe so it's different mhm\nOkay are you on Instagram to or Facebook or a my personal\nOh I was in a booth with mom needs a boutique in mommy jak keeping up ... boutique and say okay and is there anything coming up in the future um we're in the summer now is there anything that can be coming up soon for people to look out for\nThat we have our annual fashion show I'm always being held either in April or early may we just got done I'm for that is one but um\nWell be I I Want to invite everyone in Jacksonville to join for our next fashion show in two thousand Nineteen\nIn two thousand Nineteen and once you start looking out for the advertisements and stuff for the end of January the end of January mhm start looking out because you're going to be planning your next big event\nThat's when we release our summer collection there'll be anywhere between eighty two hundred twenty styles that were released [noise] wow\nJoy thank you so much for allowing me to pull you out of the shop I\nThink I'm giving me some of your valuable time here I really appreciate it Indian anyone else you want to shut up before we wrap it up you know they were a guy yeah thank you so much for having me joy to leave the future is\nOut now it's produced by brought more gym through school and is a part of the central culture podcast network\nYou can follow me Dustin here would mean Rahm\nJoining us now from\n[noise] [noise]", "show_name": "Taste Test", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "28"}
