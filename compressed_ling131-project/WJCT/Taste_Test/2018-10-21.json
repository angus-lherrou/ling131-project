I'm going to open it and probably if you're nice I'm going to let you again and I'm going to be responsible for you why in the building right and then uh you get to see what everything so it's not like oh I don't know what's in that can get in there no you just have to know someone who's in there and um they'll make a way for you\nAnd get court or just you know like where we kind of you know move on to our next conversation but by the people also don't know it was like what does that stand for so of course yes oh a sense for corner of rose Ellen King has corner of roses I knew that anti\n... [laughter] I don't know [laughter] I Would I Would never want to set you up you know I felt like I Know she does this or not I would have been like ... I wrote it down and I'm\nLike so that that way for people who might be listening to who's still are not sure where this place is it's a really big building kind of like on the side of crossing the railroad tracks from the brewery that has a lot of the graffiti on the outside of it and again like you said some amazing\nArtist in there like you know um we ... you'd like left court maybe I don't ...\nIt might it might have been a year oh I don't I Hope as it ... I don't know like I don't know but you know we enjoy it so much of our time with being there and you know that create a space works for a lot of people and then sometimes it doesn't work for everybody but\nUm I feel like you know the ... and ... for lighter course or you're you're there for life to live and I'm always like so appreciative and really my humble beginnings started at court\nOr really started try try to think like how the interactions in the ways that we could be doing things and as we are now kind of coming up on the two year anniversary of I Would say\nLike one of the most momentous a exhibitions to kind of hit Jacksonville and like the last decade was the list exhibition absolutely list a contemporary\nExpression of African American I'm messing up his name like his list continues Russians of African American in our areas yeah ... yeah who\nWe just like the ... list list\nFor the short absolute um and so much of lift kind of began with like the combination of what kind of started over at the Ritz and what they've done before um and list was also inspired by what James Weldon Johnson yes it was one of our own Jacksonville son on the poem right like on the poem\nLift every voice and how that kind of has now been lifted up into the stratosphere\nAs the national negro anthem and you have a very interesting experience I think with that song and the fact that you're not from Jacksonville you were born in Atlanta\nI was born in Atlanta and I actually bought my son was still my connection with the song it's not even in Atlanta which is ironic\nRight right right not even in the southern city right now is ... is new\nJersey and um I went I was in New Jersey in the eighties and nineties um early nineties but mostly the eighties and um [noise] the ... I went to a predominantly black elementary school and I'm In ... predominant by town and playing from New Jersey shut out playing field plant over here\nUm is that uh it was actually one of those places that was a had experience of white flight in most of the ah why why a residence and moved out to the other ... other states are surrounding cities and so there was a ... ... what was left there was a\n... I'm developing a black population\nAnd then when I was there it was a ... Hispanics we're moving in ages we're moving in and so it was just a very interesting place to live and uh but I remember ... as ... as a child in elementary school uh the my first exposure to solve or to the ... we had um\n... and with the in the morning and also that was the only as a way I mean we actually song the song especially for ... assemblies and stuff like that and so it was I mean I didn't do this and if we can solve it didn't register me because I was in elementary school however I just I thought everybody did it\nSay so every school\nBut uh it it was important to us and then as I got when I moved that's why I said\nIn New Jersey\nBut you know Well James well John and his brother have history in New York New new yes they did come to New York and like you know start some things up there and and and we're living there and creating for a while because again Jacksonville had become a little bit more volatile file absolute for them and they had to of Scotland and kind of do that\nYou know move over into like the northern areas in order to be prosperous\nOne of the things that when I was researching the participants shows researching I'm James was jobs live and I I was I I never forget ... it really struck me about like no matter how a talented home how gifted how genius he was it was never enough and indeed it kinda it kinda speaks to even down to what\nYou know some people think you can um you can uh you can\nAccomplish your way out of discrimination and at that and he can repeat that one more time some people think now that you can accomplish your way out of\nDiscrimination so if you are if you're a graduate of university a good piece de or you're a doctor or lawyer you your immune from um some discriminated\nLike you're a black man says sadly not well it's a ... or something or you have to go and and it is a\nI'm oj phenomenal yeah not black I'm oj well [laughter]\nWell he I don't know if I don't think he thought that but he ...\nNo no no way he had to take a\nCall like I I think in a life mate given a um [noise] he was given an interview with a fair skinned lady\nShe was actually she was African American but she could pass for white\nJay's willing to jazz and yes and job and uh he ... he was downtown Jacksonville right right I uh she\nSome white men saw him and uh with her and that felt good lately white girl yeah they beat him like beat him down right everybody to let you almost killed him and he got himself to police department and uh he's ... he's already a lawyer he's already been representing the United states as a basket of some sort and uh\nThey may walls for me I mean they were very company and now they're um they're spaces even more accommodating yeah or it is they're very ... and I actually they I found that I'm On the I didn't know this but I was on I'm Still on the Web site listed as soon as the war of the word I pray for a minute where ...\nPermanent work there um that deals with the periodic table I'm a and the relationship between that and uh the big bang\nYou have a lot of unique I'm kind of intersections to me like well you know between your art and you're a science\nAnd then also uh I feel like you know the the interesting thing and you know one of the reasons that I got you won't hear is quite clearly you are a black woman\nOf you know [laughter] that that that could be an identity that you're five Viet associated with it but um we talk a lot about this in lake blackness in art and where that fits in and like you know looking at art and what his black are and what isn't\nA the challenge that I think you know a lot of time still that some parts of a completely equitable playing field\nIs sometimes the work that is in art history from black folks that can kind of put people on edge and make them feel like they don't know either how to present it or they're just you know off\nOr ... uncomfortable with the topic what whatever reasons to me that they want to say like this is why we don't want to showcase this work\nBut you do abstract where if you're not a figurative artist you know it's not any realism necessarily associated in your work but there is a lot of expressionism\nUh so so a lot of times you are still talking about these same kinds of issues that have a sect you you know as a person as a black person as a woman I'm and putting it into your art but people don't always have to\nKnow or see that unless you're vocalizing it\nDo you feel like that's some kind of way benefits you you know let's take the piece that you know you didn't list that was dedicated I'm to the experience of Sandra Bland Mm right and for those who hurt you and then you know we were able to see the physical pieces\nThen it became even more striking but people were able to appreciate that work and without even knowing that's where you were going but I think it was great that you did\nTalk so much about that how has that like how do you like that experience between like somebody who's actually drawing Sandra Bland possibly like you know dead and beaten on the floor for having to see that as opposed to your work that al ... differently was funny you say that because uh\nUm I ... I feel that\nYes some people were able to appreciate the work in a in a even a deeper level because there was abstract but also I think there was probably people that was turned off that it was abstract you know for sure I mean and you know you\nAs an artist you can do you can't make that work for the people you have to make the work for you but\nYou know the right people are going to see it you know your ... your driver's going to find it and respond to it and no one's ever not everyone is never going to lie everything you do and I I I told him I made peace with that long time ago so I don't really make work\nJust for the people I I ... it has to be true to me and for me I knew specifically on that show especially I knew everybody\nIn the show I knew there was going to be plenty representations that we're going to be a lack of they were like\nWell how can I can attribute I'm In a way this honest to me and valid and and in a way that would add to the conversation and I mean I did think of going up a realistic\nSpicy maybe using ... and I'm at because I've been drawing a lot more and I there's a whole body of work that's realistic does in the back in the wings but I but for this one I thought what will be forced and uh I thought that would be better for abstract to and I ... I think I'm a ... a fan of mark ... effort\nYou know how do you love them aren't brash and he's all about this uh this concept of social obstruction and when I found out about that I was like ... that's what I'm saying\nBut he's our you know he's he's a made man you know so he's going to go and and he's oh he's got a leading the way with that and uh and\nI think because I'm I'm a I feel like I'm a poet or with a visual poet um sometimes it's better to be a\nAbstract and poetic about something ... instead of being someone overhead because that message and live with heavy yeah heavy for our community and I'm the I mean when I say I mean all of our community not just like why or why people but\nAlso heavy topic and like I said that was going to be plenty representation so I think it added a nice tonality to the ... to have abstraction too so you can kind of you know you can hit people had some pieces did hit people in the head but then some pieces were like ... contemplate it\nAnd I think you need both of those and so I think that was dangerous with our ... African American ... civically I'm having to deal with this even back from the Harlem Renaissance was\nAsked right artist it during that period were always out in a way because some people even in the black community demanded are there was represent\nYeah yeah black people to me still have a little bit of a harder time with abstractions and really understanding them and cars and they're just I guess more he said he'd over the head with more figurative work it's like you know like they want to see like the elephant or when it comes to what people consider I Would say that the masses who are still not as educated about\nUm are in general it's like they think like the you know the the picture of like the AKA or like the black man like you know whole like the black woman and she's got like the earth woman her stomach and I've got nothing against any of those absolute printed images I think you know the artwork is also beautiful but they're so used to seeing that\nUm and those based in home life because we don't get as much representation to institutions which a lot of times you know or where you first get introduced to art as a child\nWhy are they too I mean I I mean it's supposed to think back to my home bring upbringing you know I'm I was raised as a mask is and uh\nBut I think in a in a black specially you got up it got looked like it was hard to do\nYeah yeah yeah you know really a valley right [laughter] right it's I mean even\nIt's even true in in other communities ... black community so it's you know it's easy to valid to value something that\nLooked like it was constructed interact hundred hours and some abstraction doesn't look like it took a hundred hours you know it doesn't look labor intense and we like labor intense oh yeah yeah I think most people do very mad and so but I I think one of the things in the black community in general and us and I'm generalizing is that it does not look labor intensive automatic when you turned off\nRight has looked like he really struggled\nBut among my work is actually very labor intensive but you know we say because of said you know the what he was driving for was the pay like a child but that was hard to do with his level of skill ... that's a that's a higher order thinking in a more complicated thing but I mean really ultimately when I'm Out there is\nHonesty for myself and the project that level of honesty to my to to my audience and uh if I Do that then I'm I'm pleased with work and are keeping the push myself technically as but also compare myself to honor and I am I being honest\nOr am I just do an easy thing it might be because they wouldn't have been very easy for me to be realistic but I Am for me personally it would've been a almost a cop out it would've I would've I would've been forcing that\nJust to be oh yeah so they are good or marketable or yeah or yeah marketable so most people is that some people use that stretching the same way but to me ... I I that's why I have to know myself and be honest with myself and so that was the honest I presented the most honest um best work in me at that moment\nWho are some of the I mean you already we're already mentioned like Mark but who are some of the artist of the past and of the president who have been inspiration like I Know a couple of year like you know high class like I Would say women and black women abstract artist do you mind sharing them a couple of with our salon he's\nFrom I guess let's let's let's educate them a little bit more if I got to the artist and the scientists in here oh my goodness oh who\nShould be a well run off right off the back of my top of my head was going to say ... yeah yeah yeah and uh you know she's not\nThat that was a beautiful works the color field theory I mean there I mean a lot of the artist in a in ... I mean I'm right now I'm thinking they have evolved literary artists like ... I mean I'm\nGoing to live in Brooklyn in from a lot of different inspiration and resources right now but I'm Micheline Thomas\nSo she she's yes living man Gillian ... you know just\nLooking at her eyes the page and I was very sad you know just all I was just very sat with emotion just like I Want to get close and feel and see her work she's killing and she's an artist again who is somebody who said as making major moves and still and I\nWas ever see an exhibition from someone or her caliber here in Jacksonville while you think that a building like you know even like ... just recently had a Carole Walker ... very small they had a mirror welcome and face and they have a ... and ... and they\nGet real show I think as long as they got ... and that was they had\nA um I think Michelle Obama maybe it was Oprah but she and her us um gemstone\nA ... a portrait or type of thing so that was I was shocked I was I was like oh God I mean most every now and they live in is just you know why can't we got on a consistent basis absolutely", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Taste Test", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "21"}
