Florida's palm coast to George is golden arch listen on your computer or mobile device it W. J. C. C. dot normal\nThe following program as an independent production and does not necessarily reflect the opinions are views uh W. J. P. T.\nHello and welcome to ... pm radio a program of curated interviews with northeast Florida glee artist he's makers and entrepreneurs I'm your host Tim drift school\nShe said why not fear in the math and history museum present Halloween movie right now what'd you don't play by Kelvin this universe of the ... food and drink a big place in the British towards building to the ... museum complex that some of you may remember Cal the previous guest show\nShe's the author of the day they produce immersive theater experience women's work were sold out all three of his book performances she joined me tonight with why not Peter founder and director Paul gathered to discuss the newest immersive gear experience that interview and more are up right after this\nAnd um I Try and just promote you know new plays all the time you know new place I Try and kind of share these pieces out there and say hey you know you're looking for some to read here's here's a good play check this out you know there's a great play called dry land by ruby\nRe shetler that we just read last week you know check this out so just you know stuff like that you know and so are people send me stuff and then I uh and then I added to my pile\nList yeah long to do well let's let's use that to segue into this new piece sure it was talking about this project Kelly tell us a little bit about what ... name of the show and then what it's about\nCalled Halloween moon rising and I also had a little [noise] a sub title on that ... Nineteen twenty eight because we are and he was really easy I mean yeah if you're a\nWe are in the history museum I Want people to know that it is based in the very place where we will be\nHaving the experience and but it is based on the history from our range and in that year\nSo what you're probably going to see our a cast of characters that are heavily heavily based on real people\nI'm probably going to alter things a little bit because we have to keep it mysterious it is actually an experience that the audience is investigating and trying to solve a murder over the course of the evening so if I were to base it entirely on history where this murder did that happen I'd be a little trapped\nBut it might be a little boring it might be a little boring right I'm going to have as an experience where I'm gonna put a lot of\nPeople in the room that you might have heard of vaguely ah for example you know the phrase the real McCoy he may not know bill McCoy the runner who that is based off of that he was infamous and it tore us a the most upright gentleman crook that you would ever meet in the Nineteen twenties so\nI Am going to bring him into the max although he's probably going to be the real Bob McCray and our piece to so I have a little room to play 'em Bessie Coleman a African American woman who became a pilots and then came to Jacksonville to star in the film the flying ... made at Norman Studios in the Nineteen twenties\nAnd then that tragically died in an accident while she was practicing stunts oh yeah things that people don't necessarily know that are absolutely amazing pieces of of history and figures that were in our area\nNot all that long ago and the grand scheme of things I Want to be able to bring them all into the same place on miss just night where some mischief will occur and that the audience gets to\nHelp unravel and bring light to to miss mischief nights civic night or is that well that's colloquially Halloween writer so I'm Still doing some research into what was Halloween known as in what traditions happened in North central Florida at\nThat time but the regional Halloween traditions of the Nineteen twenties and thirties are really fascinating to me because\nHalloween ... as we know where you go door to door any do trick or treat 'em is a more recent innovation than we might think it is\nSo miss just night is actually an older tradition where people would run around and steal people's out houses a steel signs and enforce businesses to buy them back the next day that sort of thing so there's a pall over the place that this is\nA night in Gainesville where things might happen but then of course we have a murder happened at the party where we are in attendance as opposed to just these regular miss just that we might expect and then we have to respond\nVery good unless I exercise very exciting I'm reminded me of a woman's worth that ran there was no\nReal murder no murder murder and yard work in one\nOf the uh the you know the the character the audience ... ... ... lives right interaction or even being led through the event so similar to how when we talked about women's work my what can the audience expect I've I've shown up she during ... address for periods amuse that encouraged me this is going to be occurring around mischief night in\n... yeah we should be already be encouraged to uh to attempt to be close\nRight well we haven't like we don't find it was all of the choices yet but we are we are considered the idea of of making your costume option right Ross are going to do some fun things where we kind of give um everyone everyone buys a ticket or that's invited mhm we're going to kind of give them special instructions about kind of what to\nDo and they get a real in the early ... because he wouldn't have got an email in Nineteen twenty eight if you were invited to the host party you were going to have something in hard copy so that there will be further instructions if you sign up to receive an invitation and\nWhat how if you want to receive an imitation how how do they go about doing that\nUh we are on the bright okay and um it costs fifty dollars to participate\nOn the week of the event of the price goes up to sixty dollars I'm One of the things that makes this event unique is the fact that we're our audience as a small intimate so we're encouraging people to get on there quickly and fill their spots because there's only thirty spots per evening so\nIt is a kind of intimate ton of a\nTon of unique experience with only thirty people um so um if this sounds exciting to you and you're interested in doing in being a part of the special event we encourage you to get on there quickly because it's going to fill up pretty fast\nFor you and what are the dates that people know when it gets her booking at a time\nOctober twenty fifth and twenty six that's a Thursday and friday evening\nAnd you know where to locate it 'cause I Know we've talked a north central Florida ... space is not just you know in in the in the swamps out there\nIs that the map of the museum in Gainesville\n... very good and I imagine website has the address is located\nLocated behind the main um library branch which is kind of right off university avenue it's pretty easy to find mhm um but as all of the information is on the website and we also have a lot to Facebook sites with\nThe same website as a one other ...\nWe have but we have we have even listed on the on the Matheson website and also the one of you to ...\nTo get there I ... I Wanna go back to just as an audience member of showed up I potentially shown up\nAnd similarly tired clothing if it was me I'm probably closer than where fats yet because I Am a little are quite get to the the ... but ah yeah roaring twenties but I'm going to the forty ... appreciate so I I have arrived I Will be like ... hotel the I'm asleep no more of a New York in that\nWe can sort of just wandered explore the spaces are more more guided similar to a woman's work\nSo it is similarly structure to women's work but I Would say that it's sort of moves in the opposite direction so with women's work we started out in\nA classroom setting and we moved on to a tour and then we ended in a more traditional ... act three and that's why we're going to start we're going to set the scene with the traditional ... as everyone is coming into the party um we will see you as a guest there if\nIt's prohibition but the alcohol will be flowing and that's included and the price of your own and we have the real the real gray the real Bob McCray right there\nBecause at that time frame also sort of overlaps with the Boardwalk Empire oh ... that's when a much mobbed Italian mob yeah oh\nAnd the Germans man ... yeah and um yeah ...\nFlorida has a literally checkered history at that time because the state left it up to counties to decide whether they were going to\nA comply with federal law and be dry counties um or if they were just going to not enforce as the newly passed amendment and go ahead and allow their ... runners to do their thing and all kind of business and right exactly\nSo um we have our ways and so we will be serving cocktails there is a promise that later in the evening our hosts famous fits will be making an appearance\nSo you will be greeted as the party guest that you are you will have an invitation and hands and you'll be seated\nI'm near the porch perhaps up on the porch and then asked some guests arrived late who are very big intriguing personalities or you will see the scene played out we will learn the mysterious ways\nAnd the obvious ways that all of these people that are arriving to the party are connected to each other and then\nYou will become a murder witness because right before your very eyes you will find a that one of the people that you watched arrive I is is no longer with us and physically they may be but in spirit more\nWe can have a murder mystery without a murder you had to wear body read out as this sounds ... sounds very exciting like a\nLike a live action clue which I think I'm kind of excited intrigued about how the inspiration voted oh excellent and then how much a audience participation interaction or do you encourage it was more of ... we walk we watch or is it a little bit more you know a good word for party guests are we interacting with the\nFrom there it gets highly interactive so that that one right and that's the more traditional ... find out who these people are what's going on you get your contacts act to we don't know who did it we don't know if it's safe outside so everyone is ushered into the Matheson house which is the third oldest house in the state of Florida\nSo we actually went inside the house and in small groups who will get to interview the actors in the show\nThey're playing those characters that are based on historical figures and will be trying to discern\nWhat was your motivation coming here tonight and what did you observed did anyone else do or say anything suspicious so audience members lab and then you have questions that they can ask or they can come up with their own and they are interviewing then we will go back into the main area of the ... museum itself\nAnd we will share what we learned in our small groups and we will also at the police will have arrived at this point so we have to put the booze away\nBut the police will be bringing new information for us it turns out everyone at this party has a history they've all got files they've all got record so we'll be pouring three of those using some of our ah research historians skills and finding out of some of our suspicions are a match with what the authorities know about these

with us he has a short film as in the Jacksonville film festival this weekend it's on Saturday Night as part of the early macabre a block of films it is a a it's a\nIt's a very fine very funny for a movie that had harkens back to some eighties stuff about true\nGentleman who ah too many ... are attempting to get to make themselves cool but accidentally ... a demon\nUh Chris thank you so much for joining me today hey cool actually well I'm Glad you're here and uh I ... I was talking earlier and I got to see your your film me some of the demon in Nashville and an eight eight it killed I mean the audience loved it I loved it after seeing and I reached out to you and say hey can we please\nPlay this at Jackson film festival because I think\nThe ... to enjoy a horror comedy would really really enjoy this uh somehow I talk a little bit just just to give us an overview of the movie without trying to spoil too much 'cause it is is about to shore me six or seven minutes so yeah give us a little synopsis of what the movie's about\nYeah you're right it is very short I think it's only like six yeah which is great but at the time we\nShot it in Austin a few days shoot 'em all in one location I used to um some after ... pretty short films are very good improv and the great chemistry um movies\nAbout\nA couple of guys who sell it even if that yeah\nBut they they don't have any I find out what happens and how they can get rid of them and and why is there um yeah I'm definitely influenced by the eighties um or songs specifically like one avenue is the men's and or\nMaybe even like you know one of the new nerdy friends like weird science or ... I'm In the ... or ... ... in the gate in humans so I I wanted to combine those two elements nerdy friends in the humans\nI think it was very successful I think that works that comes across very cleanly\nOh thank you and also the lifestyle and a new style is very driven by the age as well there's got to send score or they had a lot of red and blue lighting wants to shows uh\nUh yeah no I saw that and actually really all elements that movie I think are are pitch perfect for what you were going for and I think that's awesome and everything you're saying there's so many things I Want to touch on I Want to go back real fast to the actors you mentioned uh they're very good improvisational actors how much of the of the script was improvised\nI'm hard when you say is there is always like a line or two and a good provider like you're a window I noticed them a strip\nMost of it was there there was two parts that made it into the movie that were improvised can't really tell you I'm sure it was a there is\nThere's a part in the movie where they are doing it he's given a chance in and really some blood on the other guys for it and the chant part was ever buys\nOkay ... and actually that's yeah it's a very remote why we don't wanna spoil that joke really a great joke on the movie it so we won't do that but that is at the Aspen to know that they actually provide that 'cause it it's it all seems so natural and seamless where you could have told me all of that was improvised I Would have believed you\nA job well done with the with the with the writing of the jokes the jokes fly in the end of the timing the pacing there's two actors is fantastic how much rehearsal time as you guys have been there before during set\nA zero hour or so before okay great I'm hurt the main guy a losing LA and Carlos other after Lewis years we don't have time to get them together um the night before\nWe had to read through the two of them when we talk about it but those guys use do improv on stage will last\nYeah there in Austin okay I'm going to have a tree and they could play off each other really well\nI'm a nurse all the time we would have would be on a set while people are so they have lives we would kind of go in the corner and just practice things\nUm we did a lot of takes just to get things right um but yeah the the timing the pacing I think helps with with a than being so used to show their chemistry but also just the editing to being able to cut to different closer to the right time things like that\nActually we have a play the pacing and then a temple they really they play so smoothly uh I kind of like have you talked to that's where the inspirations in in ... I'm going to have been more too but uh we're to destroy specifically what what sort of spawned this idea\nLet's see well I wanted to my first Fisher and I was in the world movie okay and I really wanted to get some experience working with creature design and working with an actor in a full body costume because I haven't I haven't had that before\nWanted to be able to start with like working with the sketch artist going into like clay and holding face and I work with people who are doing that and I learned the lingo so I wouldn't\nStep on someone's toes when I made this feature I'm so and then like I said demons and and friends are\nSo I knew I wanted to make it even a movie and then it kind of like why is the name and their ... or was he doing how did he get there and they kind of went backwards from just wanting to work on something that had a full body creature\nSoup guy ... going off the or the demon the visual effects on him are really quite good between the eyes and then just the the ... the head makeup you're talking about sort of design process and what do you guys do what parts were visual effects like ah with with like motion graphics on what part was actual practical\nUm let's see so airs on the was the makeup effect supervisor he created the demon mask and when we started out with some uh sketches I made like a mood\nBoard of a bunch of different pictures of demons and characters that I like and then hum took it to my friend's Caleb and John Andrew some demons from that like they were kind of based on that mood for\nAnd then we gave it to air and he does ... clay and then we went over to his studio and they you know he would we would try different positions for the arms\nDifferent positions for the smile like does he have a knows he's not having to do so basically just getting visualize it was in making it in clay\nWas super helpful I'm Still in the face of the hands and feet were all practically nay using like a cool guy hipster costume we value in skinny jeans ... budget wise and also I wanted to look like the cool demon he um we made it pulled by\nStudents just up arms and a and a fee and then to see the visual effects where\nHe had actually Eliot new life in the in the math but we added some like Lance player in post okay\nSo it would look a little bit brighter and then we added um like a heat aura around and every time you see on screen so kind of things I mean between two worlds\nOkay very cool and I ask a curious because like we ... that make up was spectacular so I congratulate you lose the whole team for making that 'cause it it's it's a beautiful design and and\nHaving done work with some uh ... and ... and you know a re creating an arm for somebody saying that I was I was really impressed 'cause it looks really good looks really good\nI'm a fan boy this movie by the way they can't tell you and I really I really wasn't going to be a lot I'm ... I'm Talking about sort of just uh where where does sort of uh the the affinity and uh uh I guess love for demons come from like where does that from rich growing up watching the war movies or what sort of spawned your that direction for you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Taste Test", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "14"}
