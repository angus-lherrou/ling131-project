safety factors\nInto pesticide standards they also\nEncourage the air ... air pollution office just said air standards low enough that they protect children show the officer shot to protect children against lead against mercury or is it really covers a wide range of issues are that has the potential to affect children's house\nBy the way the pay is also looking to shut down its office of the science advisor tell me please about some of the potential outcomes of this decision\nWell the science advisor is like the office of children's health protection as a watchdog it provides advice chose the\nAdministrator and the senior staff it guide them to make decisions that are based on evidence and based on science as opposed to uh other factors such as short term political gain or or profit\nAnd if that office is dissolved then um I Would argue the EPA which is supposed to be a science based organization there's got to be flying without a writer\nSome would say it's about money it industry doesn't like these regulations it's costing them money\nYeah I'm various industries have pressed for many years to eliminate or at least weaken the office of children's health protection I have no specific knowledge that an industry has intervened here\nBut certainly these actions are part of a consistent pattern that reflects industries longstanding goal to eliminate or weaken the office\nI have to ask how angry argue about this\nI'm very angry I mean I'm a pediatrician I devoted my professional life to protecting children against environmental hazards I'm also a father and

climate thought or\nOn the line now from Atlanta Hi there Peter what's going on\nHi Steve the Trump Administration is preparing what appears to be an absolute luge fast for the coal industry as you discuss the Dr Landreth in one\nOf the big things that's in the works is a relaxing the rules on mercury emissions from coal burning power plants\nMercury is such a narrow talks and it's it's really bad it gets in the legs gifted to fish gets into pregnant women not a good thing\nIt's it's a clear cut health risk or the industry says it's a major factor in the decline of the coal industry since it would cost a lot to retrofit plans to reduce mercury emissions environmentalists than health experts say that those costs to the coal industry\nWould be mostly are set to the general public\nIn the form of production as healthcare costs\nAnd of course also having healthier people what else is going\nWell here's another one uh one would think that after the coal Ashville then happen from Hurricane Florence\nIt might be a really bad time for the industry to push to relax regulations on coal ash jumps those are the essentially toxic waste dumps of burn coal that exists next to many of the operating and also the close coal plants across the country\nUm by the way isn't Andrew wheeler the acting ... administrators or a former lobbyist for the coal industry\nFormer lobbyist for the coal industry uh this is the kind of thing\nHe would have lobbied for and now he's being lobbied and apparently applies in the industry toxic waste from a coal power plants would be exempt with what the industry and fasting from the very powerful clean water act they would also extend deadline set by the Obama administration\nFor cleaning up the coal ash message across the country\nOkay hey what are you from the history books today for us\nIt's go all the way back to October eighth Eighteen Seventy one the ... T go fire was\nOne of the biggest fires that day and arguably the worst fire day in American history two thousand people were believed to have died\nWhen the town of ... ego thriving lumber mill town north of Green Bay Wisconsin went up in smoke uh there was another fire across Lake Michigan and the town of Holland, Michigan that same night\nAnd also uh what is the most famous American fires the great Chicago fire happened that same night three hundred people died in that one\nNow of course back then they said that Mrs O'Leary had a cow that kicked overland trend that started the great Chicago fire what do we know today well\nBart Simpson might say that ... had a cow when she heard that she was being blamed for the whole thing they didn't have buses yet but uh she was thrown under the bus along with her cow there's a lot of skepticism\nA century and a half later that that was the cause of the Chicago fire there's also another theory out there that there was a meteor shower that time in early October\nAnd that media writes hit the ground in places like Holland, Michigan pitched ego and Chicago causing all those fires there's a lot of skepticism about that theory to more likely it was a notoriously dry autumn in the upper Midwest and it was a a also a very very windy night\nAnd that's what we've seen recently in California Thanks Peter Peter die experience with environmental health news that the H ...

on topics ranging from soil warming to atmosphere carbon exchange\nAnd now a researcher has created an art exhibit in the forest the work called him walk hospice is a joint effort between the college just an artist to tell the story of losses among the eastern hemlock trees once giants of the lumber business living under savannah Christians and went to check it out\nSee\nFirst glance Harvard forests looks like a typical New England forest birds chirping the branches above and the sun shines and perfectly clear sky\nBut look more closely and you notice all the hemlock trees are dead or dying\nAnd invasive species killing them off by sucking out their sap\nBeen lead their branches are strewn about the ground\nAnd the decaying Donald Trump's known as the lean over my\nPart of the forest houses in art installation project created by David Buckley board and\nHarvard fourth artists residents\nThe project is called hemlock hospice\nAs most folks know hospice care is end of life for him to term care and it's designed to having more dignified close to one's life but it's also intended to benefit the living so they can have a positive\nExperience as much as one can experience a loss of an individual or species or an ecosystem\nBoarding teamed up with Harvard for senior college just Aaron Alison for the project\nMostly I study how ecological systems fall apart and then how they put themselves back together again this ecosystem first fell apart more than three hundred years ago\nThis was an old growth forests when Europeans showed up in this landscape and the sixteen hundreds in early Seventeen hundreds so you had a big trees in very small people and\nThey didn't have chainsaw as they didn't have power tools but they had\nA lot of strength and a lot of willpower to make it something that we could use and\nThey very seriously cut down all the farmers\nOvertime though eastern forest including hemlock trees grow back\nAnd today there's actually more forest cover in New England and there wasn't the colonial days\n... modern trouble started in Nineteen fifty one when an insect called the hemlock Willie Adele Jed was introduced in Virginia [noise]\nLeads the way

one of their houses are that harbor forests as it would have been salvage from that\nAgain artist David Buckley board in\nTerms of the narrative this piece is really the prompts talk with the introduction of the insect so we'll talk more about insects introduced a nursery stock from Japan the fifties over the course of the last forty fifty years of school we migrated north with climate change\nYou know people often talk about climate change storms rising tide mega fires are all valid but this is just as a impact well it was kind of the slow creep or if you will\nBe a delicate has left awake if that had blocks from Georgia to Maine and will continue marching north as climate change creates habitats for it\nAlready it's reached southwestern Nova Scotia [noise]\nWe keep walking and find the next installations kind of pie in the canopy between two hemlock\nTrees so what you see is essentially a stylized tense and about thirty feet in the air on the side of it you'd see\nTwelve to Thirteen states represented and those are all the states in which the insect is now in in up and down the east coast\nBut Aaron says the tent holds a deeper meaning about the invasive insect\nWhen we use language like invasive species we are attributing agency to infect or the plant or the animal that is invading but in fact it really doesn't have agency the insect came on nursery stock that we imported\nAnd then the insect does what any immigrant would do it says I'm here I got a deep I've got to have a place to live in a place to make a better life for my offspring and so for me it's a good\nWay to talk to people to get them to think about what do we use really thinking about when you go after an invasive species or when you label something invasive species\nAnd says the installation say here to get both visitors and scientists thinking about these issues\nBack in two thousand for researchers tried to mimic the way it they'll just kill him locks to see how the ecosystem would respond\nSo we took chainsaw and knives and we cut rings around them the bark and into the woods to cut off the flow of south\nAnd in these two experimental plots we killed about two thousand trees and forty five minutes the results are\nPrinted on the side of a ...\nIt's a graph that reads lifeline of dying hemlock\nThe plummeting red and black lines at the amount of fat burning through ... trunk\nAnd the graph sits in front of us shows us the difference and sat flow between a tree that we didn't caught in a tree that we did cut and it's just like watching a an EKG if someone in the intensive care unit as their heart rate goes down\nAnd that got and thinking about the ethics at his work I like to try and\nUse this as a way to talk to my scientific colleagues about how you really have to think about what we are doing to the organisms and we study right\nKill these trees to understand how this forest will respond\nWe learn a lot by doing that\nRespect what we're doing we published our data that's how it gets out but we do have an impact on our forests in order to understand that\nAs he come to the end of the walk\nDavid and stopped in front of one at the last installations\nIt chose the future of this forest among the hemlock stump and next to it healthy blackbirds tree\nEcologist believe purchase a one day replace hemlock here\nThese woods will change and
