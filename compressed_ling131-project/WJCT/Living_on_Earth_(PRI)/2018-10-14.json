mentioned\nYes but a lot of time here\nAs a child with family woodworking flowers and um remember coming here with my mother and my aunts my sister and I would run around\nAnd what was it you were telling me about underneath system she's buried and all that line\nCough yes yes when they ... they took her to Argonne National lab and when they brought her back she was is in a ... and although one of my aunts she always thought that they never return the body\nSo there may be a lot of radioactive bodies here in the summers\nAre there are there was a gentleman his name was ... he had used to have a Geiger counter and he would walk around the cemetery and he could tell where each of the dial painters were buried because the Geiger counter would go off [noise]\nAnd it's a peaceful here and it's so pretty in\n\nOttawa, Illinois is a pretty town of about Eighteen thousand [noise] it's got to leave the main square\nSide of the first Lincoln Douglas debates [noise]\nMost of the radio dial painters lived their whole lives within these few square blocks [noise] they went to school in church here\nIranian dial factory shut down in Nineteen thirty six\nBut the building itself contaminated and radio active stood here for decades [noise]\nWell see I Lived\nDown the alley from the radio dial up\nAnd down in the basement where they had stored the radium they actually put a meat locker down there\nMany people bought me from the meat locker\nI can go around the neighborhood to families that lived in each and every house and at least one of my friends' parents have not both of them died of cancer\nThey did tear down the original radium dial in Nineteen sixty nine I was in high school and I would come home from school\nAnd the dust from the building would have seeped into my parents' home\nIt would be on the window sills we would have to vacuum we would have to wipe everything down\nThen after that one both of my parents die of cancer and I see other people in the neighborhood and they are dying of cancer it really makes me wonder\nHow could it not and guess what they did with the radioactive rebel they used it is still\nThey dumped and all over town\nAll the remains of the building which would have had a lot of radio yes\nElements of that building not only buried all over town but people might still have souvenirs Mm\nHere's another thing I find unbelievable\nWilder radium girls were dying\nOwner close up shop\nMoved three blocks away and opened up again\nBut under a different name luminous processes\nThey used a slightly different painting technique but the radium was everywhere\nOn workers clothes shoes fingers\nThey got cancer at twice the national rate\nStayed open until Nineteen Seventy eight\nWhen the EPA moved in there were radioactive hot spots\nAll over town Ottawa, Illinois became a Superfund\n[noise]\nYou know when I was a kid we lived up on the north side in where some of the areas that they\nJumped the waste\nYour neighborhood friends' houses are getting dug around with guys in spacesuits basically is what you thought when you were a kid um you know they're digging up the whole neighborhood but they're saying oh it's fine you can just still live there in the house while your whole yard and everything is going away\nAnd so a lot of kids through the years because of playing and all that they all had ill effects from it to\nHow many people in town do you think you know this whole history\nA lot of people don't ... yeah there are a lot of local people a lot of people that I've talked to in Ottawa and I got a lot of comments from people they did not know the story they have lived here their entire life you know people don't talk about\nFew signs that that may be changing though\nA new brewery opened up recently founded by for local guys who named it radium city brewing\nAnd there's a new statue in town\nRepresents a radium girl\nThere was a girl from mendota that had done a history project\nOn the radium dials girls\nShe actually spearheaded\nMy kids down here and whoever else visit because it's important that they know\nIt's not just our family history they should know what happened\nDo you feel betrayed\nDon't know if I feel betrayed I think they betrayed the whole community I think they betray that trust women I think they portrayed\nThe future of our community\nBecause it's still here and it's still a problem\nIt frustrating that the city is allowing people to build because it's the same foundation\nFor the new business going on right next door\nThey want to build a family business that's going to serve ice cream to the community\nThere is no way that I wouldn't allow anybody I Know do over there and purchase anything\nDarlene home and Kathleen ... their descendants as to the

C. dot org [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom public radio international business is living on her\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh has a long history of ruling on environmental issues but but the balance on the Supreme Court\nKevin of one of those judges that requires really clear explicit direction from Congress when it comes to rules would impose costs on American business he's quite Britain when it comes to interpreting environmental laws against broad protection and\nAlso just as a major hurricane hits us a new dire climate report from the United nations report fine that the challenges are not primarily technological they aren't even primarily economic\nThe real obstacle is a social and political or you'd get societies organized ... actually reinvent themselves to be independent of fossil fuels that are more this week on living on her vigorous\nApproach weighing is is in control solidly in control for at least a generation\nSo which environment related cases are coming to the high court in the near future and how do you expect justice Kevin out to vote to\nAnd those cases they have a very important clean water act case pending it's out of Hawaii\nAnd it involves the underground injection of sewage which then gets right into the ocean waters and the question is whether or not when you inject the waste into groundwater which then goes into the surface water does that require a permit the Ninth Circuit said yes\nThe county of Maui in Hawaii\nAs a a asked the Supreme Court to review it it will probably come up in the next what they call a conference of the justices coming up very soon and now that Kavanaugh's there he'll have a chance to vote to review it it's exactly the kind of case\nWhere the question is going to be how broadly do you interpret the reach of the clean Water Act you interpret it narrowly to mean there has to be a direct discharge of the pollutant to the surface water or can it also include an indirect discharge via groundwater so it's it's a classic case\nWhere you can expect Kavanaugh to rule against abroad interpretation of the clean Water Act\nUm what does the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh I mean in terms of the United states dealing with the threat of climate change global warming in the years that\nOh I think we have to be realistic if we're going to make any progress on climate change in the United states is going to have to come through the legislative process and that of course means a change\nIn the makeup of Congress both the house and the Senate under the current majority there really is no realistic hope I I don't believe\nOf meaningful action on climate change it it's going to take a major change in electoral politics in the United states we may begin to see some of that in the mid term elections in November frankly I Hope we do\nBut time is short and I don't think we can rely on the courts in the United states right now to deliver the kind of relief we need\nBut what can you tell us about the youth climate lawsuits against the federal government\nWell the good news on that front is that despite the desperate really efforts of the Trump Administration to stop the trial it is going to start on October twenty nine\nAnd it is going to take several weeks of testimony the plaintiffs in the Giuliani case our children's trust case have come up with a a stellar group of experts scientists economists technology experts\nSo they have a very strong powerful case to present we haven't seen what the Trump Administration is going to present by way of a case because they've been desperately trying to run away\nFrom this trial and not show up but I don't think there's any way for them to escape so we're going to see some pretty dramatic\nTestimony in a court of law solidify the need for immediate action and it's coming at exactly the right time with the elections coming up the twenty twenty elections right around the corner\nI think we're going to see for the first time a really robust\nCross examination tested evidence of of what exactly we need to do and how we can do it the important thing of course is not how bad is the situation but are there are solutions can we actually accomplish the things that we need to do and the answer to that is yes we can\nIf we get busy right away and work as hard as we can we can do it or say many many experts so the trial I think is going to be a show piece of what we can do and must do\nLet's say that um the youth climate lawsuit against the federal government prevails at the trial level what chances there that a ruling from the lower court saying that the government has to act would be upheld by the president Supreme Court we have\nWell I suppose conventional wisdom would say the odds are against that I think you could probably look at maybe winning in the Ninth Circuit but it's hard to see five votes for some of the theories that the youth plaintiffs are advancing that there's a constitutional right\nTo a sustainable climate the current state of the law is not what\nWe need and not where we need to be and it may well be\nThat this unprecedented threat of climate change will itself change the law is certainly a brown versus board of education moment in our constitutional history maybe the Supreme Court even as curves serve it as it is\nWould be up to that I I suppose you could say it's doubtful that it is but on the other hand nothing ventured nothing gain I think I met the point and a lot of frankly law professors and lawyers are at the point\nOf saying we don't have any other options you know we've got to push this argument as far as we can\nPossibly Porsche and hope for the best\nPet parental is a professor of from a law school and this fall a Fulbright fellow\nThanks so much for taking the time with us today\nThanks Dave enjoyed it\nWell it's time now to take a look beyond the headlines and we turn to Peter ... extra Peters an editor with environmental health news that the H. N. dot Oregon daily climate dot org on the line now from Atlanta Georgia what's going on down there in Georgia Peter\nHi Steve where we're going to talk about what's going on a few states away and North Carolina we've talked a lot about the aftermath of Hurricane Florence just because there's so much aftermath and today we're gonna discuss gallon at first\nYeah ... what's that said not to affectionate name for a particularly huge and ferocious mosquito species that turns up in the middle of the Atlantic this time of year they're\nHaving a huge outbreak after the reins associated with Florence a gallon at first give them more painful bite than other mosquitoes they're much bigger and they can't even drill down into cattle hides\nOoh ouch boy I don't know about that so what are they going to do\nOh there's been a bumper crop this year the governor of North Carolina authorized for a million dollars to combat the unusual mosquito outbreak and of course that means that the spraying pesticides\nSo great so you get the choice of what a a bite that can go through town hide or getting exposed to something isn't cause cancer\nOr boats what else do you have for us today\nWho's been much ado about sperm counts in recent years a market decline is showing up in studies of up to fifty percent human sperm counts are in developed nations over the past several decades the decline doesn't show up as much in non developed nations so what's\nThe reason here what's going on\nA there are several potential causes obesity is one lousy diets and the west a but there's a particular focus on the use in dispersion of the chemicals are particularly ... structures like BP a ... a the plastics at ...\n... so everywhere in the western industrialized nations on lower sperm calf\nYeah there's there's one place that in one study raining exception nobody knows why but for some reason in New York City a study said the sperm counts are not declining like they are and the rest of the western world huh what do you think New Yorkers are doing this different I'm bragging I don't know [laughter]\n[noise] hey what do you have for us when the history of all this week Tobar Nineteen eighty\nTwo and let's go back once more to North Carolina the birth of the environmental justice movement there was a month's worth of marches and protests in Warren County North Carolina they were protesting a plan to cite the state's first hazardous waste dump it's a predominantly black and poor county\nSo what happened in that the north Carolina put the toxic waste on there or not\nOr the protest came together with a icons from the civil rights movement from all over the country one of those icons Floyd kissing was from Warren County they came together and began to realize\nThat dumping on poor and minority communities across the country was commonplace governor Jim Hans responded to the protests by canceling plans for the toxic waste dump Warren County became the first the environmental justice movement was born\nBanks Peter Peter dies there is an editor with environmental health news that the agent that Oregon daily climate dot org thanks so much to talk to you again next time\nAll right Steve thanks we'll talk to you\nVery clever recreating dangerous masses and then almost as good as cleaning them up afterwards\nAnalogy which is the most promising one is what happened with the nuclear arms race where we haven't put the genie back in the bottle and something could still go wrong but we significantly reduce the risk of a large scale nuclear exchange to essentially bake the earth on inhabitable\nAnd so you know you could look at that as well [laughter] that encouraged me and I think yeah it is that human beings are smart sometimes that are able to see their mistakes and act collaboratively as countries in the same soup but get out of the soup\nMichael Oppenheimer is a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University

delicious are common across the eastern us but they are now threatened by a deadly fungal disease in some areas that can be hard to find one that's not already affected\nAnd that is why colleges that the Pittsburgh parks conservancy were so excited by recent discovery in a local park from the Allegheny Front Andy Cuba has our story\nThe forest behind the environmental center is lush but walk about five hundred feet long the Clinton hill trail and you come to a clearing\nYeah look Sullivan shocking when you first see it every open space you see they used to be a tree\nThis is just cook she coordinated volunteering landscape projects for the Pittsburgh parks conservancy cook worked on a restoration project in this area of the park all winter [noise] the original plan was to get rid of a giants fan base of honey cycle that had taken over\nIn this whole area you couldn't see anything it was just a really a wall of honey Sacco was so crazy\nThe honey cycle and the patch a forest likely escaped from someone's yard and they've been growing unchecked for about two decades but once cleared the park staff found a pleasant surprise ten strong full grown butter not trees cook stands and the clearing of points up to one\nHere you see a perfectly healthy better now that I've never seen before and that's the park's going perfectly fine and now what the lens the way they're supposed to\nYou rarely find a healthy but are not because of a deadly exotic fungus that creates a fatal disease called butter not tanker in some states eighty percent of the better not have already died the trees also known as white walnuts used to be widespread in Pennsylvania for us and they're not certain important food source for wildlife\nWhen butter not gets tanker it develops an oblong shaped abscess that loses the wounds eventually cut off the trees nutrient supply and a dive according to the park conservancy every butter not in ... park\nShow symptoms of the disease except for these newly discovered ones that's why it's such an important find\nThere's just so many threats to our native trees that seeing trees that are not disease that I was standing or something that is cutting throughout the country and taking out entire species that is a big deal to us I'm not sure if it's such a big deal to the public though what's your best guess for why these don't have ...\nWe don't really know why that and have ... the reason why we're interested in them as the eye interested in that genetic makeup you want to see if they are maybe not susceptible to like hang her or just a little bit stronger than other butter not\nThe healthy butter nuts will be closely monitored for the next couple of years for any signs of the fungus if they remain tinker free park conservancy staff will collect their DNA and add it to a genetic database of the city strongest treats and they'll also grow new trees that will be use to re populate this site\nFor now the hard work to force restoration continues [noise]\nToday there's a chain saw the help but often it's just a lot of old fashioned hand weeding to keep the site free of invasive like that pesky honey cycle that's already creeping back\nWhat snacks here what are you what are you going to be looking for and what are going to be doing me will\nContinue going out here with interns and falling here is a staff and removing as many invasive as they can as they every growing ideally in like two to three years because ... planting restoration she is on the side to start selling and the canopy\nCook says the project will take at least ten years but when they're done the tree canopy will be closed they hope by a bunch of healthy tanker free butter not trees\nThat is like one of the greatest things about Pittsburgh that they're so green and we have so many pies so it's really important to preserve them and make them stronger\nThat story from Mandy Cuba's comes to us courtesy of the Allegheny Front [noise]\nOn the
