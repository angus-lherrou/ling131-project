{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "That's really what this project is about\nAbout not seeing race as something that pits you against me but something that tells a story\nAnd it gives us an opportunity that we have not had before it is see herself as just deeply connected at the most fundamental level\nAnd I think many if not most white Americans grow up believing their ancestry is a hundred percent European in your experience how frequently to students discovered that they are multi racial\nWe've been doing statistical analysis\nAnd the group that is most likely to over estimate their background or whites whites will generally say I have a hundred percent European and often they will be predominantly European but there are other things in their background and even if somebody has two three four or five percent\nThey're completely flabbergasted\nOne gentleman who was really interesting a white guy said that there had been a story and his family that his great grandmother was black\nAnd that she had given away his grandfather so that he would have a better life he was biracial\nAnd that he had seen her only once in life and it was under oh these clandestine circumstances and indeed we tested him and he had three percent African ancestry which would be consistent with that but for the most part\nPeople have these percentages and there isn't a narrative and it's not surprising because look at the history\nIn particular the United states where one drop of blood and so if somebody was light they quote path they lied about it so does this open the door to interesting conversations when the kids go back home\nOh yes sometimes stories tumble out that they hadn't expected when general and took the test it was a really funny many people will say they have Native American and their background which whites and blacks over estimate the Native American and their their background which is\nInteresting because they have these romantic images of Native Americans and think about the real story of how Native Americans were treated\nBut at any rate there was a gentleman who said he had Native American and his background the evidence is always a woman with long dark braid so anyway we tested me comes out of ten percent African so he goes back to his family and I said God Bless them as families that are maybe she was black [laughter]\nBut I can imagine that this might play out in a class like maybe a kid who\nHas identified as a hundred percent white European discovers that she's got some African ancestry maybe it's an uncomfortable kind of situation for her I can imagine a kids sitting next or who's African American might be really offended and\nSay what you're not happy to have African blood or you racist\nYeah and I certainly understand why somebody who identifies as white is going to find it upsetting if they find African and their background for heaven's sake look at African Americans have been treated in this country legally and socially\nDelve into that that's a real learning experience\nWhat are their beliefs might there have been somebody in their background who hit that for particular reasons and you know how do we move forward with that so it happens and I'm not just with African ancestry Middle Eastern one fellow in in a class at two or three percent middle Easterners family it was up in arms about it\n[noise] so what kind of conversations do you have in classrooms after the students get their results and what are they wind up talking about with each other because the revelations it's just the beginning\n\nThe interesting thing is that over time people start to talk about race differently you see a younger generation already being more flexible and again in our research\nWe found that older people were more rigid about their backgrounds and black and white whatever\nYounger people were much more fluid in terms of how they saw race and how they saw their racial identity\nAnd so we see these genetic tests as really just another element of making race\nMore fluid and allowing people to live with more ambiguity around race\nYounger people for a variety of reasons and these genetic tests are just part of it are much more comfortable with ambiguity with contested race and with having this conversation\nHave you noticed the young people are\nTo discover that they're multi racial\nYes much more so we'll have young people tested and often say I thought I was going to have more stuff than that you know they'll be disappointed that they don't have something and we even did one project with children who were uh I think the youngest was nine years old\nOne of the questions was what would you like to have in your ancestry what would be the best background and he said I Want everything\n[laughter] do you ever wonder what would happen if everybody just grew up knowing their genetic ancestry like what if genetic testing was mandatory in first grade with that change about how we think and talk about race in this country\nI Do think that we're going to\nGet to a different place than talking about race now given some of the things that are going on socially and politically people say to me that can you say that but I think that some of the turmoil that we're experiencing right now is because things are changing\nAnd it really hard for people I think there's a point of panic before\nYou break through to another level and I think that there are enough good people who want to talk about these things who want to figure out how we can live together I don't think we have to give up\nOur understanding of real histories that have occurred in the United states and globally but I think that becomes part of the narrative that is not just\nThe African American narrative or that you know Italian it's it's our narrative it belongs to all of us so that when we look at our genes we realize that people are our people [noise]\nUm\n[noise]\n... she leads the DNA

think we're in the moment when so many things that we've always believed in [noise] I don't really starting to feel not true anymore [noise] it's a moment that feels like crisis\nThose stories and more this week on living on earth\nYou know we talk a lot about slime in politics but it was one of the first times that we're talking about literally\nHad well oh say like you you generally when you're a politician you don't want to be a name and you definitely don't want that seemed to involve skull\nSo to what extent are the candidates here for Senate addressing or maybe they're not addressing the issue of these booms\nIt's been a huge issue for senator Nelson who of course is saying that basically this is Rick Scott's pulse\nShen that he is directly responsible when Governor Scott has already put twenty million dollars at his own money into campaign advertisements and he's taking this head on\nAnd are making this kind of circuitous argument that actually this is senator Nelson faults and his argument has to do with Lake Okeechobee in the in the middle of the peninsula which are known as the kind of liquid heart of Florida and Ninety percent of it\nThis year was covered in toxic algae when the lake gets too high the Army Corps of engineers has to blast that filthy water east and west into the estuaries that have had some really serious toxic algae blooms\nAnd Governor Scott has argued that because the\nCongress has not provided enough money for fixing that died they have had to let the water out at a earlier time than they would've had to otherwise and that therefore\nThat's why it's happening and then senator Nelson who has been in the Congress for too long hasn't done enough to get money to fix the diet well of course most people are sort of saying like well yeah but the water is dirty not supposed to be dirty and the state is in charge of water quality in a in Florida and every state\nSo how much does is hurting the campaign of Rick Scott\nHas definitely not helping one of the problems facing is that the brunt of the toxic algal blooms are are largely being felt and really staunch the Republican coastal areas\nAnd we're talking about it actually around his own home town of Naples he actually had to cancel an event that it was supposed to do there because they were going to be so many protesters\nHe got chased out of a restaurant in Venice oh another staunchly Republican area on the west coast\nAnd over in Stewart on the east coast where you know President Trump got sixty six percent of the vote he hasn't been able to get out of his car because uh they have been so many protesters yelling at him about the glove and the water so this is a real problem for him that's one of the reasons that he's fighting back so hard with his campaign ad\nSo now these protesters are the trolls that had been hired by the opposition are these folks and neighborhoods are really upset\nNo people are really bad and you can see there's all kinds of evidence that a lot of people don't like flying in their backyard now do Republicans ended up coming out and and voting for Scott anyway just because he's a Republican or because they liked what he says about taxes or because they don't like Chuck Schumer\nThat's certainly possible but every election and every statewide election in Florida is close Governor Scott when both of his races by one point\nSo this is something where if the slime you know it's just flip a few voters or if it persuaded a few voters to to leave the Rick Scott space blank that could really tell the difference between losing and winning\nSo how have the environmental issues featured in past elections in Florida\nYou know Florida is you know in the last Twenty years Republicans have won the governor's race has dominated the legislature it's obviously a swing state\nBut it's definitely filtered read but it is always tilted green the story I like to tell is that Jeb Bush in Nineteen Ninety four when people were talking about him that he was sort of the Arab parents who his dad\nWho is most likely going to be president some day that was Nineteen Ninety four huge Republican year and Jeff ran as a right wing conservative he was actually making fun of environmental is on the campaign trail and he turned out to be one of the only Republicans to lose that you hear and his brother became the kind of error parents four years later\nOne of the first things he did after he lost the election was he joined the Audubon Society he ran in Jeb ran in Nineteen Ninety eight as a green Republican anyone in his ... in a landslide so this is something where it's not\nAlways the deciding issue but it's an issue where you don't want to be on the wrong side of and so far in Florida that really has been lacking and that's become a really big issue\nIn the governor's race where you see a Democrat Andrew Gillum who is talking about making it a top priority and in the Senate race where democratic incumbent Bill Nelson\nWho is not anybody's idea of a particularly inspiring or effective leader mobilizing action on climate change but has been at least on the side of doing something and Rick Scott has and then he's trying to make that an issue by\nThe way what about climate change as governor Rick Scott is famous for totally agencies not to use that phrase it you guys have been horribly slashed by hurricane Michael I'm a game you know down south and Florida pretty tough time last year how does climate figure into this\nYou know I Lived until a couple of years ago in South beach and we'd have sunny days where Biscayne Bay was rising through our storm drains at high tide climate change is with the possible exception of Alaska\nIs is tangible in Florida as it is anywhere else you know we've got most of our state as long as we're very close to the coast where a\nPeninsula jutting into the Gulf Stream we're right in hurricane alley these are all incredibly powerful motivators for Floridians to at least pay attention to climate change and that is an issue where Rick Scott has been on the other side\nI'm Michael looking ahead would hope to use the the Florida will remain a livable and economically viable place and he's coming decades given\nAll these issues [laughter]\nI'll look you know I'm a\nI'm a sort of short term pessimist and a long term optimist I voted with my feet right I ah I moved here I'm raising two kids here\nIt's not a you know we're just going to have to figure out how to live more sustainably and we're going to have to take better care of the waterways that makes it such an awesome play which is going to have to stop dumping are crap in it and what people like me I've always said is that you know eventually Mother Nature is going to screen loud enough that we're gonna have\nTo listen and certainly right now we're hearing that screen then we'll see if the politicians listen\nMichael ... book is called the swamp the Everglades Florida and the politics of paradise he's a senior reporter with political Michael thanks so much for taking the time with us today\nThanks for having me for the record Governor Scott did declare a state of emergency for red tide and said quote as southwest Florida and the Tampa Bay area continues to feel the devastating impact of red tide we will continue taking an aggressive approach by using all available resources to help our local communities\n[noise]\nLet's take a look beyond the headlines now with Peter Dexter he was an editor with environmental health news that the agenda and Oregon daily climate thought or on the line from Atlanta Georgia in the middle of this political season Peter hey what's going on\nHey Steve we heard earlier in the show from Michael Grunwald about the race in Florida the algae blooms on both coasts and everything but let's consider and appreciate that it's a real breakthrough in Florida in the Senate race because\nI Can't think of any time went environment has been as front and center and the type political race as it is now between governor Rick Scott challenging Bill Nelson for his Senate seat\nI have to agree with you I'm trying to think of when I was at the top of the ballot and them I'm not sure we've seen it this way and the major race\nIt's because there's a lot going on with the environment and Florida\nHave talked to me about where else in the country we're seeing environment I think it's mostly of ballot issues right\nThat's right there's a big initiative in Washington state dealing with climate change that also hopes to put a carbon tax\nWithin the state it's opposed by a lot of fossil fuel introduced the western states petroleum association is the biggest one in Alaska and Montana they're clean water initiatives on the ballot and clean energy initiatives\nIn the states of Arizona and Nevada\nAnd Arizona Nevada also have some pretty close Senate races what else do you have for us today\nFor Imran Khan was a provincial politician in Pakistan his province had seen huge environmental degradation from deforestation from timber theft\nAnd as a provincial official he proposed the planting of one billion trees in his province\nWell that's a big deal how well did it work\nThey didn't get anywhere near a billion but they still manage to plant a few hundred thousand trees and it made a difference and now\nSo we now have to take carbon back out of the atmosphere those scenarios allow us to continue to burn carbon now\nUnder the assumption that decades from now we will be able to remove it from the atmosphere is the faith in unproven technology that I consider foolhardy\nProfessor man how scared are you\nI'm certainly frightened of the possibility\nThat we will not act in time I hold out cautious optimism for the scenario that we do and let me be specific\nDo I hold out much optimism for\nStabilizing warming below one and a half degrees Celsius no I don't at this point do I still see two degrees Celsius stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius as possible I I Do but we need to again dramatically reduce our carbon emissions not ten years from now now but\nIt isn't a cliff that we go off of at one point five or two degrees Celsius um it's much more like a minefield that we walk out onto into further out onto that minefield\nThe more likely it is that we um set off these devastating destinations and that is why we have to limit the warming as much as we possibly can\nMichael Mann is a distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the earth system
