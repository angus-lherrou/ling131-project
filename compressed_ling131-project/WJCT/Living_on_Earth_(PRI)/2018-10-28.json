N. dot org and they have the climate that are on the line now from Atlanta Georgia hey there Peter what do you got for us today\nHi Steve we're going to do something a little different and take a look at sports yeah October the peak season uh for American sports the world series of course college in pro football or in the middle of their seasons and pro basketball pro hockey are underway it's probably the\nBest time to point out that some of her favorite sports teams have appropriated vanishing species as their mascots and nicknames or one of my favorites the Wolverine so the University of Michigan when no actual Wolverine ths have been spotted in the state of Michigan since the mid Eighteen hundreds\nThese teams and colleges make millions on merchandise licensing on TV revenues on ads and everything else the same thing for teams named after tigers and timber wolves and of course the national hockey league's San jose sharks\nBut my all time favorite or the Florida Panthers also in the national hockey league twenty three guys on the Panthers roster and there were about that many real Florida Panthers in the wild in the Everglades not too long ago but some good news the four legged Florida Panthers have rebounded\nNo wait a second I thought basketball teams rebounded or not and this analogy but you know why can't most of his care about species rather than just the team's named after them hey what else do you have for today\nOh well a little humor because climate change as we all know is that is hilarious as it is widely covered by TV news do you mean Peter it's neither one a while a week ago it was both funny and widely covered\nFunny because the coverage I'm Talking about was on late night comedy shows like this one more Trevor Noah talked about a new report that says climate change will raise the price of beer\nOh man that try so hard to get people to care about climate change right because they didn't tell Americans in ten years the Marshall Islands will be underwater no one has to tell them corona will cost more not that much [noise] [laughter]\nOkay now he's got this one from the Late Show with Stephen called bear rather than talking about just how uninformed the general public is when you go to the White House where he's misinformed\nAnd after a year of massive storms and our glaciers just shrinking in every direction topless still ambivalent on the concept of climate change he told a reporter\nAsked scientists on both sides\nOf the issue that is true that that is so there are scientists on both sides on one side all the scientists on the other one guy who runs a blog called real show American science eagles out\nHere [noise] [laughter]\nSo if we slap football helmet son all the Wolverine and make increase storms flooded coastlines and all the other climate baggage more humorous I think we'll all be okay you know I think a lot of beer is the way many folks are going to deal with this one meter\nAll join you on that okay what do you have in the history of all for us Thirty years ago throughout the month\nOf October Nineteen eighty eight we followed along with the saga of three young great whales that were trapped in the Arctic ice I'll let you review this 'cause it's all a little funny too it was a videographer for the well funded cable TV operation\nUm Alaska's north slope\nWell of course with all the big oil companies they're expecting them to have the best equipment\nOr right and they did the videographer happened upon three whales just offshore his pictures prompted a worldwide frenzy two of the whales eventually escape even the Soviet Union send an icebreaker all the way over to help the whales the third one disappeared and is presumed dead\nIt how was that funny Peter\n... maybe it's not funny but it's ironic because there are an estimated two hundred gray wells believed to die like this every year but the presence of the mighty video camera made these three literally into Hollywood Stars there was a movie called big miracle made about all this during Drew Barrymore uh about ten years ago\nBecause it was a whale of a story well how about we mark that cliche for extinction fair enough Peter Peter doctors\nWith environmental health news at the age endowed Oregon daily climate thought or we'll talk to again real soon\nAll right Steve thanks a lot to talk to you soon\nAnd there's more on these stories at our website eh Lolita or G. and if you have a joke about climate change tell us about it right at the comments that eh Lolita or gee that's comments at ... dot

the misery in Gaza does go beyond its borders\nIs led to the closure also beaches are directly on the Israeli side of the key\nAuthorities even had the clothes and Israeli desalination playing for

simply stopped moving to the fences of Israel and Egypt and they will be moving with a stove ... rockets there'll be moving with empty buckets desperately calling out for clean water [noise]\n\n\nAssigning blame for the plight of guys and says well exactly simple take the fact that three percent of Gaza's drinking water wells are actually drinkable\nIs that because ... farmers ... too much or because Israeli agricultural settlers depleted deep pocket of freshwater before they left Gossett two thousand five\nOr the simple fact that causes population quadrupled the matter of weeks towns and villages fell to Israel in Nineteen forty eight\nAnd how about the food and water borne diseases that's in part because the power is shut off for twenty hours a day do we blame Israel and Egypt for withholding fuel deliveries\nOr Israel for bombing water and sewage infrastructure in Gaza during the two thousand fourteen war or the fight between Hamas the Palestinian authority which deprives constants of critical medicine\nAnd what about Israel's economic blockade of Gaza which human rights groups say contributes to worst sitting poverty skyrocketing unemployment and child malnutrition\nA peace deal could have connected dollars it to the west bank\nOr the vast mountain aquifer is big enough to end Gaza's water crisis\nAs it is there is no peace\nTo Palestinian territories are splintered\nAn Israel has effective control over the water [noise]\nCritics say Israel could solve the whole problem by simply build a big water and power lines into Gaza\nBut Israeli officials say they are already sending water to Gaza to do more with the rewarding gods as bad actors\nMy name is we shall I Am the spokesperson for the Israeli ... once said going up as a real catastrophe the situation there is\nUnbearable but it's also frustrating at least from our point of view because ah it's a bit difficult to help someone that that doesn't want to help himself problem in death has really that the ... most people do nothing in order to try even silver problem\nNow the observation of Israel in this agreement that we have to provide a certain amount of water to Gaza Israel is providing more than twice the amount that we are obliged by their disagreements\nThat amount is just a fraction of the clean water Gazans need every day\nAnd so the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate humanitarian groups estimate the gossip will become uninhabitable by twenty twenty barely a year from now to avoid that international relief agencies and the Palestinian water authority are working on a network of big sewage in desalination plants\nFrom the Saudis sent\nThis is ... ... more and more manager of the south thousands desalination plant it's a small for ... eventually it would be a few more along with big sewage plant the five hundred million dollars at all\nFunded by international donors but my visit doesn't inspire confidence and it's quiet here we can

path with we hope\nFor\nA man this is I Will say they will solve this problem but we didn't know\nWhen or how\nBasically the half billion dollar plan relies on Tuesday when the Gazans haven't had a

Gregory ... the water expert from UNICEF\nIsn't that a risk [noise]\nAny infrastructure is a risk in context like ... but then the question than oversea is what's on the other option really what is
