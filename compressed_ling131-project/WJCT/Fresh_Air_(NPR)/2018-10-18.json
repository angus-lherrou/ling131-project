that places like Sinclair county in parts of New Hampshire I think are facing a real economic challenge in that ah workers in firms off and do value being close to a dense labor markets in business ecosystems are\nEconomists call this ... economies and they're often strong knowledge spillover that happened within these these dance markets and so I think that there there's a real challenge here but I I Do like the idea of\nGiving us especially new college grads you know some space to do a more comprehensive job search and to look at places other than the New York city and San Francisco's it's kind of look more broadly\nWe heard from Elizabeth who lives in East Lansing Michigan Elizabeth emailed most of my family lives in St Clair and marine city and watching the county and small cities rebound gives me so much hope for the area and makes me so happy to see I Love this come home initiative I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a\nRandy what's the long term goal for the war is there a specific number of people you want to attract or a certain amount of debt that you want to cancel what are your big metric for success\nAnd that's an interesting a long discussion Joshua because truly what we tell people although that come home program has received national attention we're very proud of it that's really just beige lawn of rethinking talent and something that I have to echo because that's what's driving us economic development is attracting Platt\nEconomic development is every voice in your region contributing to make in a place where people want to live um for us Josh the long term goal is for foundations across America to realize we have assets and resources to bring to bear on economic growth\nWe can develop tell 'em to come home for him as a talent attraction program\nWe're putting far more money and time into growing the local town that's already here um they'll provide a much greater benefit for our region so for us to come home with phase one I think if we can do about a hundred thousand a year and Joshua in that program I think we're good\nOur other program that is going to a local town is about three hundred five hundred thousand a year

always had trouble finding qualified workers we invested in a training program when we opened our lab Eighteen years ago it was a big investment but it has paid off\nAnd leave emailed this is a multifaceted problem with many causes I see one remedy pay us more\nThan we could afford our student loans care for our children or elders or being willing to move to where the job is Ryan what about leaves comment is that is that really where the rubber hits the road is just not being paid enough\nI think there's a lot of truth to that I think that we would expect these tight labor markets or\nIn some combination of higher wages of firms looking at a larger pool of job applicants and more employer investments in training as has been discussed and we're just not we're not seeing that to the extent that we expected\nYou know David tweeted I'm a blue collar worker and it's tough the cost of living is outrageous for example my rent increased forty dollars just this year I still make Fifteen

I don't really understand how three year old Donald Trump can be his father's landlord can you explain that\nSure it was his land to do what he wanted with and he put it in a trust in this instance when they were very young for their benefit and began pain them round it's completely legal\nUm but that's sort of one of the ways in which he early on and you know he's in his point it's in the Nineteen forties his children or young and he's looking for ways you would imagine at this point to begin to take care of his children as they get older so that they you know when they grow up they've got money\nAnd as a way to transfer what is now he's becoming a very rich man\nIs a one way to begin to transfer of wealth to them this is the first one that happened in Nineteen forty nine\nSo what are some of the way that by the time Donald Trump was a teenager he lands already well what are some other ways his father gave him money [noise] he\nBegan doing a number of things so she started buying or building\nApartment complexes in Brooklyn and queens\nAnd then gradually transferring ownership of those apartment complexes to his children so for example Donald\nWhen he was Seventeen years old became co owner with his family members of a fifty two unit apartment building in Brooklyn that his father had acquired for them and so they would over time Fred\nTrump assembled a roughly eight apartment complexes over a thousand units and all that she transferred through a variety of mechanisms to his children and so those\nThousand units start churning out profits that flowed effortlessly into the pockets of the children we actually documented in our reporting two hundred and Ninety five different revenue streams that Fred Trump ultimately created for Donald Trump\nOver fifty year period Fred Trump was so\nIngenious at finding different ways of putting money into about Trump's pockets or he didn't just\nPut him on his payroll is a salary employees said he also paid him separately to be a consultant to him\nHe paid him separately to be a property manager for him he paid him separately\nTo be a purchasing agent for him on and on it would go he was getting laundry revenue from Trump and from the ... so you know some of these revenue streams were relatively\nModest some of them were kind of one hit wonders but when you add it all up it was this incredible stream of money that I mean Donald Trump\nUm he was a millionaire actually by the time he was eight or nine years old before he ever entered and set foot into Manhattan where he would make his name uh for Trump had already transferred to him over nine million dollars in wealth\nHey by the time he was twenty nine in Nineteen Seventy five Donald Trump had collected nearly nine million\n... million dollars in today's dollars\nFrom his father when he was thirty and I tend to have any sex then methods ... really starts to expand their Nineteen Seventy six article in your newspaper thing here at times and you describe it as one of the first major Donald Trump profiles and a cornerstone of decades of myth making about his wealth\nWhether the article saying what were the main points of this Nineteen Seventy six article that Donald Trump\n[noise] it was really one of the first big big profiles that ran a Donald Trump and Donald Trump did something in this particular profile but if you would actually a repeat and use to great effect in subsequent profiles which was [noise]\nShe took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he called his job is empire and he starts driving around New York pointing out\nThis building in that building in talking about how wonderful they were doing and and effectively what he was doing was\nHe was appropriating\nHis father's empire as if it were his own empire so these buildings that he's pointing out as his jobs with part of his empire there were in fact completely owned by his father\nHad known ships taken in any of those buildings and so what he what he did especially when it was critical to kind of early mismanaging of Donald Trump was\nShe simply asserted that his father's empire was his empire and those claims unfortunately largely went unchallenged for for many years by the reporters who were kind of swept up in the glamour of this\nYoung swag lying handsome guy who was so full of confidence in so full of big plans for the city of New York and so that story was the thing that I think helped give birth to the myth of Donald Trump self made billionaire\nOne of the things it's really remarkable vote that story when you read at his you know he goes through job after jogging and says that things that are as father or his own and he tells the reporter that he's worth in excess of two hundred million dollars\nAnd everything he pointed to the story that would go to his his net worth at that time was his father's he had a tax return to a few years later where we see he declared a I think he may twenty five thousand dollars a couple of years last year actually I've got actually that year Nineteen\nSeventy sat down and yet he was sitting there saying that he was worth two hundred million dollars and it was a claim that he would\nBecome part of the claim that would put him on the very first list of wealthiest Americans published by Forbes magazine in the Nineteen I Want to say what eighty eighty eighty one somewhere in there\nIt was just spectacular calling and I guess that are kind of got used to people taking him at his word even one his word wasn't true [noise] yeah I think things build up\nRight they they're like these layers right and reporters come along and they\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs are they going to look at what's been written about before and it all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling of his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan\nInto ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that he sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you'd hear if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne crack and David ... of the New York times\nSure this was an interesting moment because when you think of ... you think of all the buildings that he only owned numerous buildings in Queens and Brooklyn where hundreds of millions of dollars before Trump was also somebody who hated debt\nAnd so he had very little doubt on these buildings and the documents that we found when we were sort of going through them we saw he had just mountains of cash tens of millions of dollars of cash were throwing flowing through his personal bank accounts and the bank accounts the buildings and this created\nA huge problem for the siblings because if he died he would be facing a fifty five percent\nOr state talks so they created a company in the early Nineteen nineties called all county building supply and maintenance and it was a company the shareholders for Donald Trump and his siblings and a nephew of fraud Trump\nAnd what this company did was for years ... buildings would go out and they would buy supplies you'd see for everything from ... to ... to\nSupplies of the needed a new roof to windows all this stuff would be bought 'em by the buildings and they would go to like Long Island wholesalers or a Home Depot and they would get what they needed um and for a Trump buildings would pay for that\nAnd then one day all county the company that Donald Trump and his sibling owns they would go out and all county would pay for the material\nThe differences is if they paid five hundred dollars for French stove combo they would then send a separate invoices a potted invoice up to for Trump\nAnd the building that he owned and they would mark it up to seven hundred dollars and the shareholders of all county Donald Trump and his siblings would pocket the difference this went on for years on item after item after item and they were successfully able to drain tens of millions of dollars from front Trump's buildings this way\nSo the sole purpose as far as you can tell of this company that the Trump children created was to inflate the prices of things like boy ... refrigerators and um other like things that I'm buildings need so that they buy them inflate the price\nSell it to Fred Trump for his real estate empire pocket the difference so that they make hundreds of dollars every time they sell something ... and that was a way of like transferring money from ... to the siblings\nYou know and as we started out on the reporting of some at one of the questions I'm immediately we knew for Trump drove a hard deal he was very careful with his money I'm an every penny was you know you could see it you would account for he was a guy who would walk construction sites and if he saw an nail on the ground he would pick it up and make sure it was used somewhere\nSo we found it hard to believe that he wasn't already driving a pretty hard to deal with the with the dealers and the the the sellers that he had to\nTo do business with every day from the buildings but we went out and when we looked for um\nPossible employees that all county had maybe they had a purchasing department that was actually getting better deals we throw our interviews and the documents um that we had we couldn't find any any even employees that all county had it was simply a mechanism where\nIt would mark up the material and then build friend who was up in basically in voice ... operation where they would just overcharge Fred on these items that it's sort of no other purpose\nWhen the Trump sibling set up all county this this company that just that existed to siphon money from French ... give it to the children did Fred Trump know about the company but the purpose of the company was he a knowing\nPart of its creation [noise]\nWe think that he absolutely was he was enormous strategy meetings where they came up with these ideas and it appealed to him because it was um she was someone who just hated the idea of putting any kind of gets gr state taxes and we also see his signature on trucks\nUm that were written to all county building supplies so he was a man who\nPaid close attention to every penny is with us but there's evidence both in the reporting in the documents\nThat she was absolutely um this was something that he was all on board with\nAnd then in a way like the collateral victims of these inflated cost where rent or is that a lot of Trump properties because he use those inflated cost for boilers and refrigerators and sell of as a way to justify raising the rent on people living in government rent\nControlled unit that's right when you're an owner of a building is have rent controlled apartments you have people living in them you have to apply to the city or the state to have the rent increased\nAnd you have to send over proof when you do that that you've made various improvements in in this case they use the potted receipts in many instances the false receipts to say that we made repairs worth you know a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand when in fact\nThose repairs may have only costs eighty thousand they use these bogus receipts that they had created to justify higher than what should've been rent increases and then the depositions that we have um that we obtained journal reporting Robert Trump Donald Trump's brother talks about this and he says the higher the markup the higher the rent we could charge\nAfter friend the parent died in June of Nineteen Ninety nine at age Ninety three\nYou say the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere to be found in his state and that that was a testament to the success of the tax strategies\nTo transfer money to the Trump children but you're right the single largest item included in ... estate tax return was it ten point three million dollar I argue from Donald Trump money Donald tramp appear to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died we've heard stories about Donald Trump's debt\nTo banks and this is the first time hearing that he owned his father millions of dollars on his father died\nWell he owed his fall their money for most of his life um and there were repeated\nStrategies through the years to do something about the unpaid that's that would accumulate so for example in the late Nineteen eighties at this point\nDonald Trump or his father somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifteen million bucks and the problem is that if his father simply cancelled that that\nWill in the eyes of the IRS\nOr cancel dollar debt is the same as a dollar of income so Fred Trump is simply chance all the debt and said I forgive you you don't have to pay me back Donald Trump was owed a chunk of tax for what's called cancellation of debt\nSo Donald Trump and for Trump came up with this other way of making that are completely disappear involved trading that that for a stake in one of Donald Trump's buildings\nSo Fifteen million dollars or so of that for a steak in a building called Trump Palace in them and then\nThese years later Fred Trump sold that Fifteen million dollar steak back to his son for ten thousand dollars proof there goes that huge debt\nMy guess or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow after a break we'll talk more about the reporting into how Donald Trump became wealthy through money transferred from his father ... real estate empire this is fresh air [noise]\n\nFor NPR comes from the station\nAnd from St Martin's press publishers of\nWhy we hate each other

investigation based on thousands of confidential financial documents\nRevealed had Trump's father Fred setting transferring money to Donald using various schemes to avoid paying taxes starting when Donald was three\nWhen yeah it it all up it was this incredible stream of money that I mean Donald Trump the millionaire actually by the time he was eight or nine years old\nToday David Barstow and Suzanne ... described their investigation and you have ... transfer\nOf wealth from his real estate empire to Donald for handwritten Thirteen million measured in today's dollars and ten tanker reviews the new album by Eric Church who performed in Vegas last October when the shooter opened fire on the audience [noise]\n[noise] but that's exactly right he felt he was vehemently opposed to the idea that as he has this fortune on his family but he should pay any kind of tax whatsoever on the transfer of wealth\nTo his children and he took all kinds of measures that we described in the story to avoid\nPaying either give taxes or later on um a state taxes because of this\nBelief that she just felt that\nWhat he had maybe she you know the government just didn't have a right to a single penny of it\nYour investigation really like deconstruct than Donald Trump ness of the self made man who got like a one million dollar loan from his father and use that to build this enormous fortune and this real estate empire the actual ...\nAnd like she reports starts when he was like three years old and starts getting like tens of thousands of dollars a year in today's dollars [noise] so what was the process by which by age three years getting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his father\nThat started in Nineteen forty nine and it was one of the projects that um that had got got that ... had received government funding to build it was um\nA complex called beach have and what fried shrimp that it was quite ingenious says he bought the land underneath speech have in the complex that he would go on to build and he placed the land in a trust 'em for the benefit of his five children\nAnd then he started paying them round he makes them his landlord\nAnd every year they continue to get payments so\nWait a second I don't really understand how three year old Donald Trump can be his father's landlord can you explain that\nSure it was his land to do what he wanted with and he put it in a trust in this instance when they were very young for their benefit and began pain them round it's completely legal\nUm but that's sort of one of the ways in which he\nEarly on and you know he's in

was this incredible stream of money that I mean Donald Trump\nUm he was a millionaire actually by the time he was eight or nine years old before he ever entered set foot into Manhattan where he would make his name uh for Trump had already transferred to him over nine million dollars in wealth\nHey by the time and he was twenty nine in Nineteen Seventy five Donald Trump had collected nearly nine million\nYou probably have nine million dollars in today's dollars\nFrom his father when he was thirty and Nineteen Seventy six ... really starts to expand their Nineteen Seventy six article in your newspaper the New York times and you describe it as one of the first major Donald Trump profiles and a cornerstone of decades of myth making about his wealth\nWhat does the article say what were the main points of this Nineteen Seventy six article that Donald Trump\n[noise] it was really one of the first big big profiles that ran a Donald Trump and Donald Trump did something in this particular profile but if you would actually a repeat and use to great effect in subsequent profiles which was [noise]\nShe took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he called his jobs his empire and he starts driving around New York pointing out\nThis building in that building and talking about how wonderful they were doing and and effectively what he was doing was\nHe was appropriating his father's empire as if it were his own empire so these buildings that he's pointing out is his jobs as part of his empire there were in fact completely owned by his father\nHad known ships taken in any of those buildings and so what he what he did especially when it was critical to kind of early mismanaging of Donald Trump was\nShe simply asserted that his father's empire was his empire and those claims unfortunately largely went unchallenged for for many years by the reporters who were kind of swept up in the glamour of this\nYoung swag roaring handsome guy who was so full of confidence in so full of big plans for the city of New York and so that story was the thing that I think helped give birth to the myth of Donald Trump self made billionaire\nOne of the things it's really remarkable about that story when you read at his you know he goes through job after jogging and says that things that are his father or his own and he tells the reporter that he's worth in excess of two hundred million dollars\nAnd everything he pointed to in the story that would go to his his net worth at that time was his father's he had a tax return to a few years later where we see he declared a I think he may twenty five thousand dollars a couple of years last year actually I got that actually that year Nineteen\nSeventies now and yet he was sitting there saying that he was\nWorth two hundred million dollars and it was a claim that he would become part of the claim that would put him on the very first list of wealthiest Americans published by Forbes magazine in the Nineteen I Will say one eighty ... eighty eighty one somewhere in there\nWas a spectacular calling and I guess that are kind of got used to people taking him at his word even one his word wasn't true\n[noise] yeah and these things build up right they they're like these layers right and reporters come along and they\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs where they go look at what's been written about before and it all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling of his story the famous line that he is always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained\nFor the most part the dominant narrative that he's sold certainly you know to make himself a celebrity and to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on the actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forty fifth president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's\nInherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\nDemocratic congressional candidates collectively raised more than a billion dollars for their campaign\nMover unlivable prepare to go big and go public and early estimates put the final Costa ... Michael over ten billion dollars\nSure this was an interesting moment because when you think of ... you think of all the buildings that he only owned numerous buildings in Queens and Brooklyn where hundreds of millions of dollars before Trump was also somebody who hated\nDebt and so he had very little doubt on these buildings and the documents that we found when we were sort of going through them we saw he had just mountains of cash tens of millions of dollars of cash were throwing flowing through his personal bank accounts and the bank accounts of the buildings\nAnd this created\nA huge problem for the siblings because if he died he would be facing a fifty five percent\nOr state talks so they created a company in the early Nineteen nineties called all county building supplies and maintenance and it was a company the shareholders for Donald Trump and his siblings and a nephew of fraud Trump\nAnd what this company did was for years for Trump's buildings would go out and they would buy supplies you'd see for everything from ... to ... to\nSupplies if they needed a new roof to windows all this stuff would be bought 'em by the buildings and they would go to like Long Island wholesalers or a Home Depot and they would get what they needed um and for a Trump buildings would pay for that\nAnd then one day all counting the company that does Donald Trump and his sibling owns they would go out\nAnd all county would pay for the material\nThe differences is if they paid five hundred dollars for French stove combo\nThey would then send a separate invoices potted invoice up to for Trump\nAnd the building that he owned and they would mark it up to six seven hundred dollars and the shareholders of all county Donald Trump and his siblings would pocket the difference this went on for years on item after item after item and they were successfully able to drain tens of millions of dollars from Trump's buildings this way\nSo the sole purpose of SARS you can tell of this company that the Trump children created was to inflate the prices of things like boy ... refrigerators and um other like things that I'm buildings need so that they buy them inflate the price\nSalad to Fred Trump for his real estate empire pocket the difference so that they make hundreds of dollars every time they sell something to ... and\nThat was a way of like transferring money from ... to the siblings\nYou know and as we started out on the reporting of some at one of the questions I'm immediately we knew for Trump drove a hard deal he was very careful with his money I'm an every penny was you know you could see it you would account for it he was a guy who would walk construction sites and if you saw a nail on the ground he would pick it up and make sure it was used somewhere\nSo we found it hard to believe that he was an already driving a pretty hard to deal with the with the dealers and the the the sellers that he had to\nTo do business with every day from the buildings but we went out and when we looked for um\nPossible employees that all county had maybe they had a purchasing department that was actually getting better deals we throw our interviews and the documents um that we had we couldn't find any any even employees that all county had it was simply a mechanism where\nIt would mark up the material and then build friend who was in basically in voice ... operation where they would just overcharge Fred on these items that it's sort of no other purpose\nWhen the Trump siblings set up all county this this company that just that existed to siphon money from French ... give it to the children did Fred Trump know about the company by the purpose of the company was he a knowing\nPart of its creation [noise]\nWe think that he absolutely was he was in on the strategy meetings where they came up with these ideas and appeal to him because it was um she was someone who just hated the idea of putting any kind of just gr state taxes and we also see the signature on trucks\nUm that were written to all Kelly building supplies so he was a man who paid close attention to everybody is with us but there's evidence both in the reporting in the documents\nThat she was absolutely um this was something that he was on board with\nAnd then in a way like the collateral victims of these inflated cost were rent or isn't a lot of Trump properties because he use those inflated cost for boilers and refrigerators and style of\nAs a way to justify raising the rent on people living in government rent control units that's right when\nYou're an owner of a building and have rent controlled apartments you have people living in them you have to apply to the city or the state to have the rent increased\nAnd you have to send over proof when you do that that you've made various improvements in in this case they use the potted receipts and many instances the false receipts to say that we made repairs worth you know a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand when in fact\nThose repairs may have only costs eighty thousand they use these bogus receipts that they had created to justify higher than what should've been rent increases and then the depositions that we have um that we obtained journal reporting Robert Trump Donald Trump's brother talks about this and he says the higher the markup the higher the rent we could charge\nAfter Fred the parents died in June Nineteen Ninety nine at age in Ninety three you say the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere\nTo be found in his state and that that was a testament to the success of the tax strategies\nTo transfer money to the Trump children\nBut you're right the single largest item included infrared Trump's estate tax return was it ten point three million dollar I argue from Donald Trump money Donald Trump appeared to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died we've heard stories about Donald Trump's\nDebt to banks that this was the first time hearing\nHe owed his father millions of dollars on his father died\n[noise] well he owed his father money for most of his life um and there were repeated strategies through the years to do something about\nThe unpaid that's that would accumulate so for example in the late Nineteen eighties at this point Donald Trump or his father somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifteen million bucks and the problem is that if his father simply cancelled that that well in the eyes of the IRS\nOr cancel dollar of that is the same as a dollar of income so Fred Trump it's simply cancelled the debt and said I forgive you you don't have to pay me back Donald Trump would've owed a chunk of tax for what's called cancellation of debt\nSo Donald Trump and Fred Trump came up with this other way of making that debt completely disappear involved trading that debt for a stake in one of Donald Trump's buildings\nSo Fifteen million dollars or so of that for a steak in a building called Trump Palace\nAnd then and then a few years later Fred Trump sold that Fifteen million dollar steak back to his son for ten thousand dollars proof there goes that huge debt\nMy guests are New York times reporter Suzanne crack in David ... now after a
