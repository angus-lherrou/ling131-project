{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Um and also I wanted to bring 'em\nJust like absurd joy that a lot of my friends had around words uh from fifth grade on and so we would do all these ... and now we knew spelling test and we were just\nAmazing is out probably probably says really crazy to some people but we were just amazed at a different kind of ways you could say worse\nSo there was a work you know the law I talk about we were talking about great who's galore apples galore but we were pronounced apples\n... or ... you know like me and we would like draw it out like ... and we would always laugh about the fact\nThat we pronounce those words so differently than I think they were intended to be um pronounce but that in a way we didn't know how to talk about it was one way we said to each other I Love you you know what I'm saying like these words are where we live yes we live in this neighborhood and yes we live in this state in the nation\nBut really like we're living in our communication and I felt the same way when I listen to hip hop right I Will not at all from New York\nBut I felt initially um that those brothers up there were rhyming in ways and doing things with them that I wanted to do when when hip I moved to the west coast I felt a little big affinity\nBecause they were rhyming and using Redmond words to talk about things that we're familiar with me which will like long cars like riding in cars there's lots of gang violence and stuff happening in Jackson, Mississippi and so\nYou know I just found this affinity with words but again I think ironically my mother is the source of my love and fascination with not just words for rhythm um which is interesting\nGiven that I think you know often write things that she doesn't like that you know make public this a fascination I have with words I'm\nJoshua Johnson you're listening to one a\nHow did your mom take this memoir by the way what did she make of it [laughter] a great question um I you know but it's I I just had to write\nAn essay book how to slowly for yourself and others and I had to write a novel cologne division before I had the skill or audacity to even try to write this book so on one hand my mother is absolutely proud that you know her son is a professor was writing work that some people in the world care about\nOn the other hand she's still my mother ratio worried about what it means to put this kind of book out in the world she's worried that people who don't like me are enemies are people who\nHave I have I we knew who I have harmed or she thinks I have harmed would come back at me because I'm putting so much out there that she says I didn't have to put out I think there was a small part of her and it was worried about how it was going to impact her\nUm and her ability to make a living\nSo she's scare and that they should be um but but more than a scare she's proud and she's thankful that this book allowed us to talk about different kinds of addiction\nAnd different kinds of violence in different times the joy that we just never been able to make time to talk about but we're still working you know what I'm saying we did not like this book is a deliverance I\nDidn't write this book and now everything is on the door I wrote this book and now we have a better chance of being better tomorrow but we're not where we need to be fish or\nAnother question about your writing style eve tweeted I Would love for him to talk about how he scales his writing between the the ... and the national critique how do you leave those together\nThat's a big question so I'm always interested in how to we have what happens inside of a house or what happens inside of a relationship with what the nation is encouraging us to do so in that past\nShould I just read about my mother one of the things I wanted to show was that yes like this this ... police violence was was was was grappling with us was grass mean us was trying to ... us in a particular way\nAnd often I think one of those stories atoll we just see them as tragic we're just seeing them as morose we just see them as part of what they are which is violent\nBut when I Do is I often use the comedy of the familial the comedy of the personal to ultimately not just shed light on\nThe on the national but to the to the to allow us into the national in a different way so for me that question of the the familiar with the national has everything to do with traditional narratives of what they tell us to do and be and and and familial narratives that we actually\nFind comedy like even when people talk about the way black parents in black communities beat their children to death\nYou know I Want to put that up against the way the nation obsessively beads our families historically to death but also don't just want them to class I Want to try to find like shards of humor\nLaw particularly in the familial even if we can't find shards of humor and the national because I don't think the familial exist without the national but I think that the humor is sort of what gives it any kind of integrity and the humor is not used to laugh it off if anything is a lubricant to get us in there and to deal with the things more profoundly\nI knew were low on time but what's next for you\nI'm working on a book called and so on and it's a novel I'm a kind of like for future is now will be coming out maybe at the end of two thousand Nineteen and also have a a collection of essays that might come out right before that\nI'm and I'm doing a lot of other um private secret things that I Hope to talk about in a few months but I'm I'm very thankful that you may time to talk to me about this book\nOh for sure one more thing I Would I Would ask you you are now a teacher you talked about some of the books you were told to read earlier how do you approach giving students books in terms of the influence that you know that it may have on them before we go\nThe first thing I Do all my classes I let teach my students know the books that are present me with I'm not present in those books to you because I Want you to appreciate them\nAs like great art given those books you because I think that can be teachable right and so I'm always trying to give books to my students that they might not have ever read but I Want them to go on those books and turtles books up and tell us we're really works in those books but also we don't have to have reverence just because it's it's it's a published published proud of it\nI Want them to find themselves in the book and I want them to find holes in the book and then in their work I Want them to try to fill those holes I think we're vision\nIs crucial and you can revise the reading things that you don't like just as much you can revise the reading things that you do like\n... an author and professor of English and creative writing at the University of Mississippi whose new memoir is called heavy TSA

Bob Blacksburg it's an adult animated series satirizing Hollywood with a cast of characters that includes people and talking animals do jak as a horse who starred in the nineties sitcom person around\nBy Blacksburg says when he created the theory he thought of the sixties sitcom about attacking horse named Mr Ed\nPart of the original patch was what Mr Ed like behind the scenes right when [laughter]\nWhen Mr Ed goes home after\n... seasons five of Bo jackets on Netflix Comedy Central is rerunning season one\nAnd marine current and reviews the new book of Eleanor Roosevelt advice column\nAnd uh I got there and I was this nobody and I didn't know anybody in town and there was this winding treacherous road up to get there which I was terrified of taking\nAnd I felt so disconnected from everything and that idea feeling simultaneously on top of the world and also never more alone and isolated was the beginning of of of this character for me and I wanted to make a show\nAbout a character who had every opportunity for success and still couldn't find a way to be happy and then mixing that with leases animal drawings was the patch\nSo bow jak as a horse who's raising three human children in the sitcom horsing around\nIs that inspired by like different strokes about white wealthy businessmen whose wife is deceased he's living on Park Avenue and he ... his late housekeepers to children who are African American and so it's just like unusual blended family that all the comedy is built around\nIt's actually based on a lot of things in different strokes are certainly an inspiration for house the Brady Bunch step by step I mean I think in the seventies and eighties and nineties there are a lot of sitcoms about\nDifferent family units and blended family is an odd configurations of families and different ideas of\nOf what makes the family sort of felt very appropriate that in our world we have animals and people coexist thing that there would be a show about a horse bachelor raising three human kids and and learning how to make a family together\nSo did you grow up on us TV shows\nI did yeah I'm a big fan of those shows the TGIF ABC wind up was a big part of my childhood I grew up Jewish and you know we we can never go out on Friday nights so we would stay in and watch family television together\nAnd those shows I mean a lot to me and you know one thing that I really enjoy exploring on Bo jak horsemen is\nOur cultures relationship with these you know some might say cheesy sitcoms of the eighties and nineties um and also bow jak zone relationship with being a part of it that even in ... ambivalence about being on this show that he knows it's not the height of art and sophistication but there are real people who come to him and say this show meant a lot to me\nAnd it means something and I like that\nWhile we're on the subject of cheesy um of course in around the show that ... start in\nHad a theme song and not many TV shows have theme songs anymore that explained the premise of the show yeah and so I Love that that horse in Iran actually has a theme song explaining what the shows about so I thought we could listen to the theme song [noise]\n\n\nSo that's the theme song for the show within a show on Bo jak horsemen I'm so why did you want a theme song for horsing around\nWell you know like you said you don't hear theme songs are certainly not expose a tour theme song so much in this day and age but it does feel like a staple of those shows like the Brady Bunch of the perfect example of okay so you're just tuning in here is the premise of the show\nThis is who these characters are this is how it works um\nAnd it felt like a really fun way in like I thought if you heard the song you would immediately know what kind of show this is\nSince ... as a horse did you ever watch Mr Ed you're too young to have grown up with it but I'm was that an influence at all and he too like the bow jak horsemen series within the series horsing around he too had a theme song that kind of explained\nThe premise of the show that he was a ... horse\nAre you know I have seen a little Mr Right it is a slightly before my time but I think the the nature of being my age\nIs that when I stayed home sick from school I didn't have cable so I Would just watch whatever was on TV which was often older rerun so I Do have a bit of pop culture knowledge outside of my own experience um and certainly part of the original pitch was what's Mr Ed like behind the scenes right what [laughter]\nWhen Mr Ed goes home after senator and really and that was helpful way to think of that series\nThat's really funny if you're just joining us my guess is Rafi ... Blacksburg and he's the creator and show runner of Bo jak horsemen an animated comedy tragedy [laughter] that's really funny and sometimes really really sad so we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Rafi ... Blacksburg he's the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated comedy drama series bow jak horsemen and um it's now in season five ... five was recently released on Netflix\nWhen I first started watching bow jak I thought oh this is such a funny show about the tropes of popular culture and then like the deeper I got into it I thought like wow there's some really late emotionally upsetting things that happen in this\nYou know bogus alcoholic he's mean he sex is he has this ongoing monologue self destructive monologue in his head about how much she hates himself and how ... how much he knows he's always doing the wrong thing and so what he does is is drink more\nIntense thing sometimes get like really dark and at the risk of I'm giving something away from an earlier season\nI'll say that Sarah Palin who is the actress who plays bow jak daughter adopted daughter on both jak sitcom horsing around um after she gets out of rehab years later and he invited her\nTo get high which he should never have done she just got out of rehab she ended up oh dean at you know toward the end of the episode and it's it's kind of shocking I mean you know it's a comedy it's animated but you really emotionally unprepared for that\nYeah I think the the the pitch for the show you know what I went into Netflix\nWas always that's going to start like your typical animated comedy and it's going to feel like as you're watching it like oh I get this I get what it is\nAn over the course of the first season it was going to reveal itself to the audience as being something more and and darker and more interesting and kind of a goal was by the time you get to the end of the first season you're thinking oh my God I care about these characters went went\nUp and they they tricked me um\nAnd so that transition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one thing we've really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark or melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse as bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some fun surprising ways\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness and says\nIn some fun ways [laughter] I'm deaf on was exactly as a kind of sadness I like the final version better [laughter] and and jackets\nAnd such despair afterwards and feel so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him\nFully investigated these actions and I think we've taken great pains to try not to glamorize who Bo jak is um but I think I have a firmer understanding of the power of narrative and the power of humor I think in the in the context of the show we were making in the context of\nAnimated shows in general are at the time when the show came out and also just TV shows about\nLet's say bad dudes or you know dirt bags I think there is a a kind of joke where it feels like you're like holding someone to task but really you're playing it is like kind of cute are funny\nAnd I don't know if we always landed on the right line of that but I think there are moments in season one or maybe it feels like we're not just letting them off the hook but kind of taking his perspective on things\nSo if he says a sexist thing or if he you know dismisses somebody\nThe obvious joke is not oh he's a bore and he shouldn't be saying this it almost feels like we're saying oh isn't it\nIt's kind of cool and funny that he's saying this even though we know we shouldn't be saying it like don't you kind of wish that you could say these things to you know what I mean and\nAnd that wasn't that wasn't intentional but I think it's slippery I think that happens sometimes without us meaning to and I think there are a lot of comedy writers and I I Would include myself on those who sometimes think we have a better handle on what we're saying than we actually do\nAnd there was a kind of comedy that I think you could call\nIronic sexism or post racism or yes our character is saying this thing but we you know the voice of the show don't agree with that\nAnd I think that distinction is maybe more slippery then people will allow themselves to believe I don't know if you have the control over that that you think you do about how that goes out into the world and how people internalize that humor um you know I I grew up uh in the era of South Park\nAnd I think South Park is a brilliant show and then there's so much that they do well and I there they've made me think about a lot of things in New ways um\nBut I they also have a lot of jokes about Jews and I remember being in middle school and high school and people like making jokes about me that they got from South park\nAnd obviously if you ask Matt in trade they would say well Carmen is not a role model if you're not supposed to think he's like cool or funny or charming but I think middle school or high school me who is the butter those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that mean to me and I think I Am\nAlso guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always thinking about what are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give of that of a joke that you may be regret or wish you had placed differently in it can actually\nSure I can give a couple of examples you know I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have had throughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes and\nI think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs past that as I convinced myself that we were and thought that we were and now some of those jokes in the early seasons just hit me a little differently um another joke about somebody that I'm not as we have a joke in season to 'em and bow jak is a very Boris character\nAnd we had a a gag where he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive\nAnd they're going to Alaska and he has a line about what we're going to Alaska what am I going to say that it's going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber monsters is the line\nAnd you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as and now he doesn't realize and clearly the way it's set up as oh he is saying this offensive thing\nAnd not even knowing that it's offensive so I feel like technically we are in the right on this joke\nUm but someone tweeted at me a couple of years ago and said you know I Am a native Alaskan myself and I was watching your show\nAnd there is not a lot of representation for my people on television and to watch this show make this joke about my people and knowing that this was the only reference in the show of my people and knowing that nobody who works on the show is of my people it it hurts\nAnd I cannot then say no but you are wrong because I did it correctly I you you misinterpreted it so you are wrong to be offended I have to hear that note and go oh you're right maybe weren't as careful about that as we should have been\n[noise] I Know I Know some comics deal is become actually very difficult to do comedy because there's always somebody calling you out for saying something politically incorrect so I'm Wondering how you've changed the right in the on the show with this kind of sensitivity\nThat you feel you didn't have in the first season and that you're trying to have no\nWell I mean first of all who says comedy should be easy like why why did you get free by like oh this is making this making my job harder yeah boom ... that's what happens in life\nSometimes there are challenges in your job or your career and you have to like learn how to take them and I think it's a good thing and I think this means that more people are being hurt because I don't think\nAll of a sudden just because I saw that tweet\nI I don't think that means that people were not offended or hurt by my humor before it just means now I can see it and now I Am aware of it and I think that is a good thing and\nI think it is a challenge to to to challenge your own preconceived notions of what is okay or what is funny or who are you making your comedy for and I think if you're a comedian who doesn't care about that\nThen fine to make the comedy for the people that will not be offended and that will be your audience you know I Want to make comedy that that people who are perhaps disenfranchise or marginalized can't enjoy I don't want my\nComedy to exclude them so it's a challenge but I take on and it's sometimes hard to get that feedback and people say hey this really hurt me because my ego\nWants to say no it didn't you know because I Want to say like no I I Am I Am smart I Am good I'm a good guy you don't understand I have good intentions\nBut I I think hearing that really helps me and I I don't want to get to a place where I'm not hearing those notes or I feel like I don't have to hear those notes because I think it makes me a better more sensitive and more interesting writer\nIf you're just joining us my guess is ...

at a very troubled childhood\nReading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell your parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell me about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in\nThe bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a

with\nThese new officers get five weeks of training but just the four hours ... teachers on how to deal with women prisoners\nThe same we're supposed to treat everyone the same for Farrington says why is there anything that I'm working with women\nThe country some Fifteen states are teaching new ways of treating women prisoners gender response of corrections is built around the understanding that women prisoners are different\nThey're less likely to come to prison for violent crimes in prison they're less likely than men to be violent but the discipline system in prison is set up to control violent men so those rules country women more harshly more unfairly\nIt's an insight that came out of decades of academic research from feminist historians sociologist and other academics from women consultants who specializes in prisons\nAnd from that minority of women who made a career in corrections like Maggie Burke she was the warden of a women's prison in Illinois but she too started as a corrections officer at a men's prison\nYou do firearms your very first week of training and then that screams everybody out if you can't pass with a weapon than you can't do the job and and I'm going to tell you that you know twenty nine years in the department and I've never had to usually on\nThe second thing she says corrections officers learn how to use handcuffs\nAnd so that kind of set people up with an expectation that the work we're doing is physical as aggressive as law and order is paramilitary but the work we're doing is talking to people in the changing lives and you don't do that by barking orders you don't do that by forcing people to do something\nAbout Seventy five Ninety percent of women in prison had been victims of sexual or physical violence when a corrections officer especially if it's a man yells or parks and order the woman's reaction is often defensive she might just shut down or she might yell back and back can result in a ticket she gets disciplined\nTypically when you tell them in to do something a male inmates he's either going to do it or he's but he's not going to ... and he's not going to talk back there isn't a whole lot of emotion to it\nBroke worked in men's and women's prisons whereas\nWith women emotion is in their\nThis sounds like a generalization but we heard it over and over from experts on women's prisons\nAnd it was she's just like go ahead write me a ticket it just feels a fire and so then it's an emotional ticket\nPrison guards are trained to keep it made under control women in our society in general are expected to be compliant and if they push back which in prison they do more than men officers use that tool they have control they hand out punishment\nNow she's got influence because she's talking back at me and maybe she said something that I can perceive us threatening and I'm going to write you know that she threatened me\nNPR on the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states\nWe estimated rates of punishment for men and women and our numbers show that women typically get this going to higher rates for the more minor violations of prison rolls\nOff twice or three times the rate for men for those smaller things like disobeying a corrections officer or cursing or talking back who send the Gillum as a prisoner at the Iowa correctional institution for women serving time for robbery\nShe remembers when not that long ago she'd get into a lot of trouble for talking\nOnce a corrections officer made an announcement on the overhead speaker for the women to be quiet but ... says she was on another part of the cell block and didn't hear it\nWhile I was coming from upstairs and I have to end up and I said what was that and he said hey I said no talk and I would ever now it's like well you don't have to yeah and I let him down here and he made a comment on our site well this is America and say what I Want [laughter] and he wrote me up for it fell my response that smart Adel al Awlaki and I got to a major report\nTypically when women prisoners by weight rules even a lesser violation that can lose privileges like getting visits are using the phone they can go to solitary confinement or have days added to their time in prison\nNow the prison in Iowa trains officers that if it's not a security issue that some of those things go de escalate situations that we the tickets because officers\nThe new ones that I notice they they talk to us more they interact with us more to access Halloween doing not trying to be our friend realized that where people on that we've made mistakes get ourselves here you know they they're kinder\nAnd go on says that's changing the way corrections officers responded to her help premature\nShe's been taking college classes and once you leave prison next year she wants to complete her degree and get a job counseling people recovering from substance abuse as states start implementing these new ways of treating women there is a small amount of research that shows women like who send the Gillum men do better when they leave prison\nSo are there lessons in this women's reformed to make present work better for men to Becky Nate thanks so women lead the way yes she's a pioneer of gender response of corrections she started the national resource center on just a symbol women\nMen probably have trauma in their lives and then probably been victimized in their lives and then have lots of discipline issues\nAnd men make up Ninety three percent of people in prison\nSo maybe we will find some opportunities to take the work we know about trauma and give it a male fan and have that be very helpful to them as well\nJust like women's prisons learned from studying what specific about the trauma of women may says men's prisons can learn by studying what specific about the lives of men she says there's already an example\nMore men's prisons are training corrections officers how to de escalate conflict to figure out what it is about man that causes them to ACT UP and to use that gender based knowledge to avoid situations that we'd be getting disciplined for

Bob Blacksburg it's an adult animated series satirizing Hollywood with a cast of characters that includes people and talking animals do jak as a horse who starred in the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBob Blacksburg says when he created the series he's head of the sixties sitcom about a talking horse named Mr ad\nPart of the original pitch was what's Mr Ed vibe behind the scenes right when [laughter]\nWhen Mr Ed goes home after ...\nSeasons five of jackets on Netflix Comedy Central is rerunning season one and marine kayak and reviews the new book of Eleanor Roosevelt advice column\nAnd uh I got there and I was this nobody and I didn't know anybody in town and there was this winding treacherous road up to get there which I was terrified of taking\nAnd I felt so disconnected from everything and that idea feeling simultaneously on top of the world and also never more alone and isolated was the beginning of of of this character for me and I wanted to make a show about a character who had\nEvery opportunity for success and still couldn't find a way to be happy and then mixing that with leases animal drawings was the patch\nSo bow jak as a horse who's raising three human children in the sitcom horsing around is that inspired by\nIt's different strokes about white wealthy businessmen his wife is deceased he's living on Park Avenue and he ... his late housekeepers to children who are African American ... and so it's just like unusual blended family that all the comedy is built around\nIt's actually based on a lot of things in different strokes are certainly an inspiration for house the Brady Bunch step by step I mean I think in the seventies and eighties and nineties there are a lot of sitcoms about\nDifferent family unit and blended family is an odd configurations of families and different ideas of\nOf what makes a family so it felt very appropriate that in our world where we have animals and people go existing that there would be a show about a horse bachelor raising three human kids and and learning how to make a family together\nSo did you grow up on us TV shows\nI did yeah I'm a big fan of those shows the TGIF ABC wind up was a big part of my childhood I grew up Jewish and you know we we can never go out on Friday nights so we would stay in and watch family television together\nAnd those shows I mean a lot to me and you know one thing that I really enjoy exploring on Bo jak horsemen is\nOur cultures relationship with these you know some might say cheesy sitcoms of the eighties and nineties um and also bow jak zone relationship with being a part of it that even in ... ambivalence about being on this show that he knows it's not the height of art and sophistication but there are real people who come to him and say this show meant a lot to me\nAnd it means something and I like that\nWhile we're on the subject of cheesy um horsing around\nThe show that ... start in had a theme song and not many TV shows have theme songs anymore that explain the premise of the show yeah and so I Love that that horse in Iran actually has a theme song explaining what the shows about so I thought we could listen to the theme song [noise]\n[noise]\nSo that's the theme song for the show within a show on both jak horsemen I'm so why did you want a theme song for horsing around\nWell you know like you said you don't hear theme songs are certainly not expose a tour theme song so much in this day and age but it does feel like a staple\nOf those shows like the Brady Bunch is the perfect example of okay so you're just tuning in here's the premise of the show this is who these characters are this is how it works um\nAnd it felt like a really fun way in like I thought if you heard this song you would immediately know what kind of show that says\nSince jak as a horse did you ever watch Mr Ed you're too young to have grown up with it but I'm was that an influence at all and he too like the bow jak horsemen series within the serious horsing around he too had a theme song that kind of explained\nThe premise of the show that he was a ... horse\nAre you know I have seen a little Mr Right it is a slightly before my time but I think the the nature of being my age is that when I stayed home sick from school I didn't have cable so I Would just watch whatever was on TV which was often older rerun so I Do have\nA bit of pop culture knowledge outside of my own experience um and certainly part of the original pitch was what's Mr Ed like behind the scenes right when [laughter]\nWhen Mr Ed goes home master and really and that was a helpful way to think about that series\nThat's really funny if you're just joining us my guess is Rafi ... Blacksburg and he's the creator and show runner of Bo jak horsemen an animated comedy tragedy [laughter] that's really funny and sometimes\nReally really sad so we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nMany places in downtown Jacksonville being considered for demolition or redevelopment have had their histories last\nHow can we bring these stories back to life while determining a future for these sites W. J. C. T. and partnership with modern cities present the Jackson forgotten space Tuesday October twenty third at W. J. C. P. studios the evening begins with a receptionist six\nFollowed by a panel discussion at six thirty ... with his free events at W. J. C. T. dot org slash about sponsored in part by downtown invest them\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is ... Blacksburg he's the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated comedy drama series bow jak horsemen and um it's now in season five all a season five was recently released on Netflix\nWhen I first started watching bow jak I thought oh this is such a funny show about the tropes of popular culture and then like the deeper I got into it I thought like wow there's some really emotionally upsetting things that happen in this\nYou know ... is an alcoholic he's mean he ... he has this ongoing monologue self destructive monologue in his head about how much she hates himself and how ... how much he knows he's always doing the wrong thing and so what he does is is drink more\nUm invent things sometimes get like really dark and at the risk of I'm giving something away from an earlier season I'll say that Sarah Palin who is the actress who plays\n... daughter adopted daughter ... sitcom horsing around um after she gets out of rehab years later and he invited her\nTo get high which he should never have done she just got out of rehab she ended up oh dang it you know toward the end of the salad and it's it's kind of shocking I mean you know it's a comedy it's animated but you really emotionally unprepared for that\nYeah I think the the the pitch for the show you know what I went into Netflix was always that it's going to start like your typical animated comedy and it's going to feel like as you're watching it like oh I get this I get what it is an\nOver the course of the first season it was going to reveal itself to the audience as being something more and and darker and more interesting and kind of a goal was by the time you get to the end of the first season you're thinking oh my God I care about these characters went went up and they they tricked me um\nAnd so that transition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one thing we've really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark or melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of these story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and its brightened colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack into sadness and says in some fun ways [laughter] was exactly as a kind of sadness I like the final version better [laughter] and and\nJackets and such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nLet's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... maybe\nThere are distinctions to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he is going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote if I'm an unusual episode because it's one long monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side\nFully investigated these actions and I think we've taken great pains to try not to glamorize who Bo jak is um but I I think I have a firmer understanding of the power of narrative and the power of humor I think in the in the context of the show we were making in the context of\nAnimated shows in general are at the time when the show came out\nAnd also just TV shows about let's say bad dudes or you know dirt bags I think there is a a kind of joke where he feels like you're like holding someone to task but really you're playing it it's like kind of cute are funny\nAnd I don't know if we always landed on the right line of that but I think there are moments in season one where maybe it feels like we're not just letting them off the hook but kind of taking his perspective on things right so if he says a sexist thing or if he dismisses somebody\nThe obvious joke is not oh he's a bore and he shouldn't be saying this it almost feels like we're saying oh isn't it\nIt's kind of cool and funny that he's saying this even though we know we shouldn't be saying it like don't you kind of wish that you could say these things to you know what I mean and and that wasn't that wasn't intentional but I think it's slippery I think that happens sometimes without us meaning to and I think there are a lot of comedy writers\nAnd I I Would include myself on those who sometimes think we have a better handle on what we're saying then we actually do\nAnd there was a kind of comedy that I think you could call\nIronic sexism or post racism\nOr yes our character is saying this thing but we you know the voice of the show don't agree with that and I think that distinction as maybe more slippery\nThen people will allow themselves to believe I don't know if you have the control over that but you think you do about how that goes out into the world and how people internalize that humor um you know I I grew up in the era of South Park\nAnd I think South Park is a brilliant show and there's so much that they do well and I there they've made me think about a lot of things in New ways um\nBut I they also have a lot of jokes about Jews and I remember being in middle school and high school and people like making jokes about me that they got from South park\nAnd obviously if you ask Matt in trade they would say well Carmen is not a role model if you're not supposed to think he's like cool or funnier charming but I think middle school or high school maybe who is the butter those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that mean to me and I think I Am\nAlso guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always thinking about what are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give of that of a joke that you may be regret or wish you had placed differently in a ...\nSure I can give a couple of examples you know I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have had throughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes and\nI think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs passed it as I had to convince myself that we were and thought that we were I Know some of those jokes in the early seasons just hit me a little differently um another joke about or somebody that I'm not as we have a joke in season to 'em and bow jak is a very boorish character\nAnd we had a a gag or he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive and they're going to Alaska and he has a line or about what we're going to Alaska what\nAm I going to say that is going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber marchers is the line\nAnd you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as and now he doesn't realize and clearly the way it's set up as oh he is saying this offensive thing\nAnd not even knowing that it's offensive so I feel like technically we are in the right on this joke\nUm but someone tweeted at me a couple of years ago and said you know I Am a native Alaskan myself and I was watching your show and there is not a lot of representation for my people on television\nAnd to watch this show make this joke about my people and knowing that this was the only reference in the show of my people and knowing that nobody who works on the show is of my people it it hurts\nAnd I cannot then say no but you are wrong because I did it correctly I you you misinterpreted it so you are wrong to be offended I have to hear that note and go oh you're right maybe weren't as careful about that as we should have been\n[noise] I Know I Know some ... become actually very difficult to do comedy because there's always somebody calling you out for saying something politically incorrect so I'm Wondering how you've changed the right in the on the show with this kind of sensitivity\nThat you feel you didn't have in the first season and that you're trying to have no\nWell I mean first of all who says comedy should be easy like why why do you get free like oh this is making this making my job harder yeah boom that that is what happens in life\nSometimes there are challenges in your job or your career and you have to learn how to take them and I think it's a good thing and I think this means that more people are being hurt because I don't think\nAll of a sudden just because I saw that tweet I I don't think that means that people were not offended or hurt by my humor before it just means now I can see it and now I Am aware of it and I think that is a good thing and I think it is a challenge to to\nTo challenge your own preconceived notions of what is okay or what is funny or who are you making your comedy for and I think if you're a comedian who doesn't care about that then fine and make the comedy for the people that will not be offended and that will be\nYour audience you know I Want to make comedy that that people who are perhaps disenfranchise or marginalized can't enjoy I don't want my comedy to exclude them so it's a challenge but I take on and it's sometimes hard to get that feedback and people say hey this really hurt me because my ego\nWants to say no it didn't you know because I wanted to say like no I I Am I Am smart I Am good I'm a good guy you don't understand I have good intentions\nBut I I think hearing that really helps me and I I don't want to get to a place where I'm not hearing those notes or I feel like I don't have to hear those notes because I think it makes me a better more sensitive and more interesting writer\nIf you're just joining us my guess is ...
