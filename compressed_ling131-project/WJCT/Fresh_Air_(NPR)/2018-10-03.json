{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "A look I've watched the poll since Brett Kavanaugh's performance his rating among Republican women hasn't gotten worse it's gotten better by about four points he is more positively rated now was by women on the Republican\nSide but I think we saw this and in the transition of sort of a national anger or so before the election\nAccording to a couple of different surveys the angry as people in the country or conservative white women after the election they kind of pass the baton to liberal women mainly liberal white women\nAnd so that that shift I think is meaningful and that kind of activism that we're seeing but the the the caller that that described herself\nI'm essentially is put a typical of a a person who has very systems justifying\nBeliefs and a a sense that the world is Justin that if you do something wrong you deserve whatever happens to you and that if something bad happens to you must have done something wrong\nAnd so that world view is extremely um\nIt it's extremely tied to often deeply religious so usually white evangelical or white Christian and Catholic communities that have very sex segregated rules that have responsibilities that accrue to men and women differently\nThat in theory or complementary an equal but are really hierarchical and didn't do systems women experience really inequality and so the white women fifty three percent of whom voted for Trump\nWho maybe many of them are supporting Kavanaugh can leverage um their racial status to offset there a lack of gender status and I think we see that over and over and over again in our history and still today but I think one notable\nAfter I forgive me for interrupting you but this is the tyranny of the clock radio business will like sitting in for Joshua Johnson you're listening to\nThe ... [laughter]\nUm but there was just one last thing which is that around the world and in the United states too authoritarian beliefs tend to be embraced first and most readily by women in situations of great gender inequality\nAnd we never really want to talk about what gender inequality looks like in conservative white families but I think that that is central to understanding um that sense of justifying the system as it is because you experience power vicariously and you depend on a strong man for example to provide and protect\nAnn Cavanaugh performed that way right he was indignant and and he was very muscular and and ... but it's sort of hyper masculine and his anger\nBrittany talked about where she thinks this movement might go when the cameras are gone Donald Trump is not going to be president forever and political wins do shift\nUm but before we in the hour I Want to go back to the immediate term Rebecca Traister can't be ignored and I think we should spend a minute here\nThat the resolution of this if you're over Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court rest largely and in the end my rest entirely\nOn two women senators they look at the evidence you know centers or look at the FBI report they'll look at a party to look at Mitch McConnell what do I need to do to look at politics to look at the election all of that\nBut I have a really hard time imagining even after years in his business and politics um that these two women senators at this moment will want to repudiate or\nPosition of being perceived to be repudiating women's anger\nAnd women's voices and this moment in America you have a hard time believing that part I guess maybe I Want to have a hard time believing that because this nomination has become so much bigger than Brett Kavanaugh right it's about um if there is a moment in this country and everybody's aware of it\nUm and this could rest on the shoulders possibly of two women senators now\nIt could there's also it's become about so much more than Brett Kavanaugh from the perspective of the angry women and from that perspective of a can of conservative politics in this country so that it's now about a win and that for a lot of\nA Donald Trump Republican Party um this is about getting this guy true and also making some statements about what they will not put up would they will not put up\nWith having a further a cruel of power on the right of a white patriarchy disrupted by the stories and the anger of women they don't want this to be a model for how um\nPeople with less power might interfere with the for the record cruel of power by those who already have a lot of power so there's a lot on the line and I actually don't know what's going to happen every day so far from the ... of the past month has brought surprises I don't want to make predictions but I Will say this\nI'm not going to be surprised if ... Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the court and you know what if he's not there's gonna be another judge who's going to be confirmed to do the same work that the Republicans want Brett Kavanaugh to do which is put into place mechanisms that are going to suppress\nThe angry resistance of the masses including women and that includes taking away voting rights collective bargaining rights reproductive rights\nThis is also a long term fight the mass anger extends decades into our future regardless of the immediate result we saw that with Clarence Thomas Anita Hill has reverberated for twenty seven years in electoral politics and in protest and an awareness of sexual harassment we're looking at winds that are deep into the future even if we have losses that are short\nTerm that is the voice of Rebecca Traister writer for New York magazine and the cut author of good in ... the revolutionary power of women's anger Rebecca Traister what a pleasure thank you for being here thank you also Brittany Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage a black feminist discovers her superpower Britney Cooper thank you so much\nThank you and psoriasis Molly director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book rage because her\nThe power of women's anger ... thanks to you\nThanks very much time I'd like everyone to remember that you can subscribe to win a podcast on the NPR One ap or wherever you like we'd love it if you would write is a review if you're new to podcast you can find all the links to listen on line at NPR dot org slash won a\nThis hour was produced by Bianca Martin to learn more about her and the rest of our team visit the website at the one eight dot org slash death\nThis program comes to you from WAMC you part of American University in Washington distributed by NPR until we meet again I'm Todd's will like sitting in for Joshua Johnson we're going to end the show today with bay here's beyond say thanks so much for listening\nDi di\nDi\nDi\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with the Boehner's certified craftsman program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise and customer service contract are located or any more information or a donut dot com\n[noise] from Rhodes Scholar a not for profit offering learning adventures for adults in natural settings across the country learn more at R.

throes of it there was no uh although there's always that kind of perverse part I think of a writer or an artist that has the third eye in the middle of their forehead and they're kind of watching life\nAs it's unfolding so maybe sometimes even in the most\n[noise] unsightly\nTimes are places that they are kind of record\nAnd um what's happening uh so you know but that's not conscious but it must be happening somehow so at what point did\nYou know a that is going to be the subject of my movie trying to\nI had I had a good friend uh when I was going through the ... when my husband and I were in the process of doing our own you know artificial reproductive technology slash adoption by any means necessary approach to try and have a baby\nI had a friend a girlfriend her name's Rebecca and she's a documentary filmmaker and she was my confidant and when I spoke to her about what was happening she always said you know you should write the stuff down this would be really great material for a movie\nAnd I was horrified and just for ... like that is never going to happen Rebecca I Would never write about this stuff\nAnd obviously now I have a movie and I should write about it and I don't know exactly when I thought it was legal ah emotionally legal for myself but I did notice and actually Rebecca is one of the people among my friends soon after my own struggle with trying\nTo figure out how to get a baby um a lot of people I knew were starting\nTo fall fall into that situation also so I felt like it was almost a mini epidemic among my friends um and who were very specific kind of subset of New York people who had unusual live\nSort of freelance lives that were writers and artists and filmmakers and journalists and they didn't have um you know steady\nIncome and the same as nothing was a regular that maybe they didn't have health insurance maybe they held on light not unlike the characters in the movie they held on to their you know New York existence by their fingernails because they don't rent stabilized apartment they had tiny apartments how are they going to start families they were\nPursuing their career and then suddenly they looked around and realize that\nThey were you know forty or over and oh my God we better you know ... uh you know they were arriving late to the table\nSo a spoiler on how many children do you have children I Do I have an eight year old who's almost nine [laughter] is that near to him the film was dedicated it is [laughter] okay and you\nCan at eyes [laughter] before we always think nobody is going to say that because like the very very end like right before you know thinking New York state for letting a shoot here like no one is sticking around for that [noise]\nUm so I always thought it was so buried no one would notice now I have to stick around to the end of the credit so I can come from its ... on the soundtrack [laughter] she was at Lincoln Center last night we I mean the movie premiered at the New York film festival last night and so which was a huge like fantasy of mine\nBecause I've been going to the New York ... festival as\nA total liking nerdy\nYoung film person forever and never had a movie there and last night was the first time and it was super exciting and actually now he was an audience but I did an eye on stage I was thanking everyone and then I said something about knowing me kind of like she's here isn't she and someone yelled out no and it was her [laughter]\nShe got out there but of course she was there and yeah we got three songs from her which was really great\nDo you mind me asking if you adopted if you did I have yes\nWe did do we actually were pursuing not unlike the characters in the movie other sort of differently [noise]\nWe were pursuing international adoption and ... simultaneously um and uh yeah we were doing those things at the same time it was kind of like whatever happens first wins and an IV F. one and we got pregnant and finally had me at Taylor who was my daughter\nOkay we'll talk about it that moral [laughter] of it later let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess just hemorrhaging and she wrote and directed the new film private life it opens in theaters and will be on Netflix starting this Friday\nWe'll be right back this is fresh air [noise]\nOh\n[noise] oh [noise] um [noise]\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is hammer Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life starting Paul Giamatti and Catherine on as a couple of trying to conceive each of them having problems with fertility so they're trying alternate means ivy F egg donor penny you name it [laughter] adoption [noise] um\nSo it's a comedy but it gets to like really serious issues within about marriage and about all the complications of trying to conceive [noise] um\nShe also made the savages and slums of Beverly Hills so the movie starts with the Catherine on character\nOn her bed in her bikini underwear relying on her hip it's a kind of sexy pose\nBut what really happening is that she's waiting for her husband to inject her was whatever the hormone is that she's getting at that moment\nAnd it's a great shot to show how what should be a very sexual process you know what I mean like yeah making love and then conceiving\nWhen you're having to go through fertility treatments it's it's like it's injections and pills and you know all this stuff that's like\nNot only not sexy but it also kind of is going to have an effect on your body because you're you're ingesting all these hormone yes yeah and I said can you talk about that shot can you talk about like\nFraming it as something that looks like it's going to be really sexual erotic it's not and there's also sounds\nSo before you ... you kind of come into the senior hearing Paul and Paul has an amazing kind of was free voice and\nShe sang screwed over and you're hearing brass Senate sounds sort of like a your overhearing kind of a bedroom\nScene and then you arrive and then it's a shot of Katherine slower hunch\nUm you don't see any heads or it's not attached it's kind of her lower body a laid out on the bad and then Paul arrives above her and pulls her underpants down a little bit to expose sort of her\nHunch and ah you see a wedding ring any lowers at and then he says are you ready and she says yeah and he's like okay here we go and he starts counting one two three and you think they're going to like try some neurotic act\nBecause there's all this preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the make needle and an intra muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you got wide and you see wow that is not a sex scene that as a medical situation\n[noise] and and to compare it to say pregnancy that instead of the has been put in\nHis hand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her with needles in her belly and her and her head and I'm a ... again it's just\nIt's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby and let that can be like it can lead ride that moment\nBut that process is just so it's a different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination who you're lying in a you know kind of a ... with stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant and uh it's not your husband it's the doctor\nAnd I think it's interesting that you did that you didn't just try to do the woman's point of view and have the men be like totally un comprehending and and cold and you know not going not going through his own issues\nYeah I Love I like I'm Glad you said that and I love Paul's portrait\nOf I'm Richard her husband and I think when I set out to do it I remember thinking to myself oh this is a mutual midlife crisis\nThis is happening to both of them and in a way sometimes I think of it like a buddy movie and I did this with the savages too when you're writing some things that's so character driven sometimes you need to create order in your brain because it's not a genre\nAnd I remember thinking with is that it was like a buddy movie\nAnd in stead of getting in a car and driving across the country I don't know bank heist or something they're getting in a car and driving through like\nInfertility land was important to me that it was a mutual I don't know crisis that it wasn't just her problem or I mean they're both falling apart they're they ah you know as they're heading up against the limitations of being a human being simultaneously it's not just her one\nOf the differences though is that it's the woman is Katherine ... character who's getting these hormonal injections that are affecting her mood they're affecting her whole life body balance so I think that that's\nYeah I heard her ... her emotionally incompetent [laughter] no no no incontinent southern continents ... yes because she says oh my God my shrink had a really weird name for it I think I got off it and I know it's a mostly incontinent and that's why\nThe said a character goes ooh grows oh that's great oh that's funny yeah so did you go through that of feeling like you you didn't understand your own emotions that they were kind of a little out of control for you\nYeah I mean you are taking hormones I mean I think that just even if you weren't taking hormones or if the hormones themselves didn't make you feel like that the process of going through the\nYou know going through ivy out for ... is so bizarre that psychologically it's upsetting and then on top of it you're injecting yourself with hormones that make you feel\nCrazy and weird and it's just such a non natural stuff the as Paul later says there's ... there's been nothing natural about this so far why should we start now I mean it's so not natural\nThat it does you and um but you know there's a lot of indignities on the mail from the male point of view too I mean because you're saying oh but she has all the injections he sits in a collection room where he's you know expected to produce a sample\nUm and that's pretty demoralizing and then he has sperm blockage and has to go through some procedure it's off screen but that has to do with some kind of biopsies in his testicle I mean it they're they're getting it from both ends\nYou know when he has to do the sperm donation he's watching really awful [laughter] I think really cheap awful porn and looked like that was supplied by the fertility clinic is that right\nYeah well they that's what they do that's always such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines that just seems like somebody actually to go out and go shopping for those and bring them to the office like that's a you know that's [laughter]\nThat's medicine I don't know it's you know a medical office and somebody has to go pick up [noise]\nGo down the street and pick out some porn magazines and some videos\nOf poker Mahdi says like rolling his eyes instead of getting aroused [laughter] just rolling their eyes at the point I I was hoping I'd find something better do you know like the thing yeah yeah it's not very good call is not ready to call it yeah [laughter] okay um so um during the process of when trying\nAlternate path of either conceiving do various fertility treatments or of adoption did you have to ask yourself what would it mean for a child who really feel like your child\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as a heterosexual couple that you have all the equipment to do this old fashioned thing which is to you know give birth to a child that represents\nHalf of you and half of your partner\nAnd when it is taken away for some reason\nI think it's traumatizing at first\nAnd then I think kind of like the characters in the movie\nYou tip toed towards different ideas of what it's really about is it about\nGiving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent\nUm what is that what is the end goal and it it just starts changing and shifting I always find it really interesting when people like in the movie I've there's like a lot of I don't know if the right word is comedy of manners or\nLike when people are just saying oh my God I don't know why why why don't they just adopt and justice always a tally size like oh my God why would they be going through this why don't they just adopt as if adopting is just the easiest thing in the planet\nLike oh you just go out to you know target and pick up a kid or something it's very difficult to adopt I mean it's complicated um egg donation is complicated ivy F is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't\nLying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nFrom the outside like well why don't they just adopt there's all these children out in the world that need adoption and nobody says that to people that go and have sex nobody climbs into their bend say oh no why are you having sex right now\nTo have a baby 'cause there's all these unwanted children out there you should go you know it's so presumptuous it's so um [noise] it's so interesting and it's such a hot button thing for people I remember when my husband and I were in the throes of our fertility stuff\nRealizing that the people that I should be talking to the most for comfort and perspective we're all my gay friends\nBecause any of my gay friends that were trying to have babies had to pursue complicated arrangements to get their kids they didn't have the opportunity to just lie in bed and have sex and have a baby so that was so normalized and gay people that want to have babies that I really was like this is where I should hang out\nI shouldn't hang out with all the header as [laughter]\nHave had such a great way where they can get drunk in line bed and have sex and I have a baby I'm just hanging out with all my gay friends because they know what this feels like because they have to figure out\nAn unusual path to getting a child not the you know old fashioned way let's put it that way so I really found like that was a safe place to be like a and it gave me a lot of perspective\nIf you're just joining us my guest is hemorrhaging and she wrote and directed the new film private life which shares Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon as a couple in their forties trying to conceive through various methods or adopt\nTo have a baby and if that all the complications medical

a lot of emotional turmoil in conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband [noise] he said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was my other character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nThe reason was China Tibet as a part of China but many Tibetans hate Chinese rule and the Chinese government tries to stamp out anything that suggests a separate Tibetan identity potential sponsors were so worried about offending Beijing they pressed to China's agenda themselves\nI did have a threat to someone he said it was to my boss it's Tibet can you get them out there [laughter] and he apologized today so I'm really sorry it's a terrible thing to ask we love what you do but would you

artificial reproductive technology slash adoption by any means necessary approach to try and have a baby\nI had a friend a girlfriend her name's Rebecca and she's a documentary filmmaker and she was my confidant and when I spoke to her about what was happening she always said you know you should write the stuff down this would be really great material for a movie and I was horrified\nAnd just for poll students like that it's never going to happen Rebecca I Would never write about this stuff\nAnd obviously now I have a movie and I should write about it and I don't know exactly when I thought it was legal ah emotionally legal for myself but I did notice and actually we're Beck is one of the people among my friends soon after my own struggle with trying\nTo figure out how to get a baby um a lot of people I knew were starting\nTo fall fall into that situation also so I felt like it was almost a mini epidemic among my friends um and who are very specific kind of subset of New York people who had unusual live sort of freelance lives that\nWere writers and artists and\nFilmmakers and journalists and they didn't have\nUm you know steady income and the same as nothing was a regular that maybe they didn't have health insurance maybe they held on light not unlike the characters in the movie\nThey held on to their you know New York existence by their fingernails because they don't rent stabilized apartment they had tiny apartments how are they going to start families they were pursuing their career and then suddenly they looked around and realize that they were\nYou know forty or over and\nOh my God we better you know what a you know they were ... arriving late to the table\nSo a spoiler on how many children do you have children I Do I have an eight year old who's almost nine is that near to him the film was dedicated\nIt is [laughter] okay and you can read at odd [laughter] before we always think nobody is going to say that because like the very very end like right before you know thinking New York state for letting us shoot here and like no one's sticking around for that [noise]\nUm so I always thought it was so buried no one would notice now I have to stick around to the end of the credit so I can come from its ... on the soundtrack [laughter] she was at Lincoln Center last night we I mean the movie premiered at\nThe New York film festival last night and so which was a huge like fantasy of mine because I've been going to the New York ... festival as a total\nLiking nerdy young film person forever and never had a movie there and last night was the first time and it was super\nExciting and actually now he was in the audience but I did an eye on stage I was thanking everyone and then I said something about knowing me kind of like she's here isn't she and someone yelled out no and it was her [laughter] she goes out there but of course she was there and yeah we got three songs from her which was really great\nDo you mind me asking if you adopted if you did have yes\nWe did do we actually were pursuing not unlike the characters in the movie all the sort of differently\nWe were pursuing international adoption and ... simultaneously um and ah yeah we were doing those things at the same time it was kind of like whatever happens first wins and an IV F. one and we got pregnant and finally had me at Taylor who was my daughter\nOkay we'll talk about that moral [laughter] of it later let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess just hemorrhaging and she wrote and directed the new film private life

joining us my guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life starting Paul Giamatti and Catherine on as a couple of trying to conceive each of them having problems with fertility so they're trying alternate means ivy F egg donor can you name it [laughter] adoption [noise] um\nSo it's a comedy but it gets to like really serious issues within about marriage and about all the complications have trying to conceive [noise] um she also made the savages and slums of Beverly Hills so the movie starts\nWith the Catherine on character on her bed in her bikini underwear lying on her hip but to kind of sexy pose\nBut what's really happening is that she's waiting for her husband to inject her was whatever the hormone is that she's getting at that moment\nAnd it's a great shot to show how what should be a very sexual process you know what I mean like yeah making love and then conceiving\nWhen you're having to go through fertility treatments it's it's like it's injections and pills and you know all this stuff that's like\nNot only not sexy but it also kind of is going to have an effect on your body because you're you're ingesting all these hormone yes [noise] yeah um and I said can you talk about that shot can you talk about like\nFraming it as something that looks like it's going to be really sexual erotic it's not [laughter]\nAnd there's also sound so before you ... you kind of come into the senior hearing Paul and Paul has an amazing kind of whisper e voice and\nShe sang screwed over and you're hearing brass and it sounds sort of like a your overhearing kind of a bedroom\nScene and then you arrive and then it's a shot of Katherine slower hunch\nUm you don't see any heads or it's not attached it's kind of her lower body a laid out on the bad and then Paul arrives above her and pulls her underpants down a little bit to expose sort of her\nHunch and ah you see a wedding ring any lowers at and then he says are you ready and she says yeah and he's like okay here we go and he starts counting one two three and you think they're going to like try some neurotic act\nBecause there's all this preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the MEK needle and an intra muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you've got wide and you see\nWow that is not a sex scene that as a medical situation [noise]\nAnd and to compare it to say pregnancy that instead of\nThe has been put in his hand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her was needles in her belly and her and her head and I'm a ... again it's just\nIt's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby in what that's going to be like it can lead ride that moment but that process is just so it's a different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination who you're lying in a you know kind of a with stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant and uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter]\nThat's pretty strange too and you shoot\nThose scenes in the stair ups [laughter] and the fertility clinic from the point of view Catherine ... figure skating the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of\nYou know yeah there was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter] yeah um yeah and I'm ... I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents I actually had great doctors it's a very\nBizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh he\nIt's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nAnd I think it's interesting that you did that you didn't just try to do the woman's point of view and have the man be like totally on comprehending and and cold and you know not going not going through his own issues\nYeah I Love I like I'm Glad you said that and I love Paul ... portrait\nOf I'm Richard her husband and I think when I set out to do it I remember thinking to myself oh this is a mutual midlife crisis\nThis is happening to both of them and in a way sometimes I think of it like a buddy movie and I did this with a Savage is too when you're writing some thing that's so character driven sometimes you need to create order in your brain because it's not a genre and I remember thinking with is that it was like a buddy movie\nAnd instead of getting in a car and driving across the country with I don't know a bank heist or something they're getting in a car and driving through like\nInfertility land was important to me that it was a mutual I don't know crisis that it wasn't just her problem or I mean they're both falling apart they're they ah you know as they're heading up against the limitations of being a human being simultaneously it's not just her one\nOf the difference is though is that it's the woman has to Catherine ... character who's getting these hormonal injections that are affecting her mood they're affecting her whole life body balance so I think that that's\nYeah I heard her ... her emotionally incompetent [laughter] no no no incontinent continents ... yes because she says oh my God my shrink cut her really weird name for it I think I had an off it and I know it's emotionally incontinent and that's why\nThe said a character goes ooh grows oh that's great oh that's funny yeah so did you go through that of feeling like you you didn't understand your own emotions that they were kind of a little out of control for you yeah I mean\nYou are taking hormones I mean I think that just even if you weren't taking hormones or if the hormones themselves didn't make you feel like that the process of going through the\nYou know going through ivy out for ... is so bizarre that psychologically it's upsetting and then on top of it you're injecting yourself with hormones that make you feel\nCrazy and weird and it's just such a non natural ... nothing as Paul later says there's ... there's been nothing natural about this so far why should we start now I mean it's so not natural\nThat it does you and um but you know there's a lot of indignities on the mail from the male point of view too I mean because you're saying oh but she has all the injections he sits in a collection room where he's you know expected to produce a sample\nUm and that's pretty demoralizing and then he has sperm blockage and has to go through some procedure it's off the screen but that has to do with some kind of biopsies in his testicle I mean it they're they're getting it from both ends\nYou know when he has to do the sperm donation he's watching really awful [laughter] it's like really cheap awful porn and it looks like that was supplied by the fertility clinic is that right\nYeah well they that's what they do that's always such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines that just seems like somebody actually to go out and go shopping for those and bring them to the office like that's a you know that's [laughter]\nThat's medicine I don't know it's you know a medical office and somebody has to go pick up [noise]\nGo down the street and pick out some porn magazines and some videos\nOf poker Mahdi says like rolling his eyes and said we're getting a rouse [laughter] just rolling your eyes at the point I I I was hoping to find something better do you like that yeah yeah it's not very good call and not very good quality yeah [laughter]\nOkay um so um during the process of when trying alternate path of either conceiving do various fertility treatments or of adoption did you have to ask yourself what would it mean for a child to really feel like you're a child\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as a heterosexual couple that you have all the equipment to do this old fashioned thing which is to you know give birth to a child that represents\nHalf of you and a half of your partner and when it is taken away for some reason\nI think it's traumatizing at first\nAnd then I think kind of like the characters in the movie\nYou tip toed towards different ideas of what it's really about is it about\nGiving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent um what is that what is the end goal and it it just starts changing and shifting I always find it really interesting when people like in the movie I there's like a lot of I don't know if the right word is comedy of manners or like\nWhen people are just saying oh my God I don't know why why why don't they just adopt and justice always a tally size like oh my God why would they be going through this why don't they just adopt as if adopting is just the easiest thing in the planet\nLike oh you just go out to you know target and pick up a kid or something it's very difficult to adopt I mean it's complicated um\nEgg donation is complicated IDF is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't lying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nFrom the outside like well why don't they just adopt there's all these children out in the world that need adoption and nobody says that to people that go and have sex nobody climbs into their bend to oh no are you having sex right now\nTo have a baby because there's all these unwanted children out there you should go you know it's so presumptuous it's so um [noise] it's so interesting and it's such a hot button thing for people I remember when my husband and I were in the throes of our fertility stuff\nRealizing that the people that I should be talking to the most for comfort and perspective we're all my gay friends\nBecause any of my gay friends that were trying to have babies had to pursue complicated arrangements to get their kids they didn't have the opportunity to just lie in bed and have sex and have a baby so that was so normal life\nThere's an gay people that want to have babies that I really was like this is where I should hang out\nI should and hang out with all the Hazaras\nHave had such a great way where they can get drunk and lie in bed and have sex and I have a baby I'm just hanging out with all my gay friends because they know what this feels like because they have to figure out an unusual path to getting a child not the you know\nOld fashioned way let's put it that way so I really found like that was a safe place to be like a\nAnd it gave me a lot of perspective if you're just\nJoining us my guest is Tom Ridge ink and she wrote and directed the new film private life which are as Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon as a couple in their forties trying to conceive through various methods or adopt\nTo have a baby and that's about all the complications medical hormonal and emotional that happened as a
