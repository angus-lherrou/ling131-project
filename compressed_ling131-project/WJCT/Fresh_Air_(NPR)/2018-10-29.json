{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "So arbitration law at the state level are a bit odd because there's a federal law that called the federal arbitration act\nThat basically prohibit states from enacting laws that make arbitration agreements unenforceable so it is a little bit few tiles for states to try and legislate on the force arbitration that's something that Congress really has to do\n[noise] we got a call Emily from one listener who said that the police in her state told her and she's in Indiana that the law is different on harassment and assault depending on whether it's verbal abuse or physical abuse here's the message that and left in our inbox\nAnd I live in Denver, Indiana Indiana State police and for me right after the incident that in the state of Indiana when someone tries to sort of have you actually [noise]\nThey they have to a ... force you I was a police force in just about the point of physically\nAnd I wear that that I feel this is very wrong\nAnd thanks for calling in and sharing your story with us Emily what would you say that\nAnd I think one thing that and really disturbing story makes clear it's important to emphasize if there's a difference between\nCriminal law and civil loud and we talk about sexual assault and sexual harassment so it sounds as though possibly what the police were telling her about with Indiana criminal law and what constitutes sexual assault or rape under Indiana criminal law\nAnd that's a separate question from whether your employer can be held responsible for sexual harassment if your co worker or a supervisor sexually assault you\nAnd the question of does it have to be physical behavior are words enough words are definitely enough under under civil law\nUm however there is a need to make clear in state law and federal law I'm again that the one growth Pearl doesn't apply that um that harassment can be severe or pervasive based just on words\nBased on um more limited physical contact that there isn't some\nA single ... way that harassment looks\nSuzanne we would be remiss if we did not know that a number of the bills were also aimed to address scandals of state lawmakers who were accused of sexual harassment or abuse there was a bill that would have outlawed unwanted sexual advances by lawmakers in Florida and that bill died in Florida State house this year\nThe Florida Senate President Joe Negron said part of the reason that Senate bill sixteen twenty eight never passed is because the already takes sexual harassment seriously here as part of what he said at the time\nSexual harassment is illegal it's against the wall is against our rules at our policies we encourage anyone to report it immediately if they do to observe it or they're someone that's experience being committed on them by another person\nAnyone who was found guilty of sexual harassment is subject to discipline including being expelled from the body\nI think that is evidence of a zero tolerance policy towards sexual harassment\nThat is Joe Negron who's the outgoing president of Florida State Senate Susan\nYeah that's another kind that we've been seeing a lot this year is we've been tracking legislation as a really specific to sexual harassment within state house walls so we've seen over a hundred and twenty five different pieces of legislation introduced in\nThirty two states this year uh it's resulted in at least two legislators being expelled I'm due to sexual harassment allegations as well as sixteen more I'm\nResigning I think legislators are looking at ... up providing mandatory sexual harassment training um and also requiring lobby lobbyist to train 'em and looking at different ways to tackle it within their own state houses\nHandily before we go we were a lot of ground and there's a wide array of these new kinds of laws any kinds of laws that you're looking for on the horizon either at the state or national level so we should be keeping an eye on four but well we are\nAdvocating for an state and national levels are laws that do a lot of the things that we talked about today that ensure that all work is safe work that doesn't turn on how big your employer is or whether you are technically an employee or not\nThat increased transparency and accountability that don't silence I'm working people who experience harassment that shine some light on patterns of harassment so employers have real incentives to prevent and and toxic workplaces\nAnd that provides working people more power you know you are much more able to challenge harassing behavior\nIf you earn a decent wage if you have some protections against a retaliation I'm all of those things put people in a position to say this is unacceptable and to enforce their rights and that's a critical piece of the puzzle\nDo we expect any movement in on this from Congress\nWell I think that we'll see some legislation introduced and that's a good first step\nUm and you know we've seen some bipartisan support for some bills in Congress this year there's bipartisan support for a bill that would prohibit employers from requiring mandatory arbitration for sex discrimination sexual harassment claims\nThere is bipartisan support for a bill called the empower act which would limit nondisclosure agreements and provide some new transparency around sexual harassment claims\nEmily Martin with the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole team with the national conference of state legislatures and University of Oregon law

views of the white nationalist movement without 'cause ... whose book rising out of hatred\nIs about white nationalist leader done black and his son Derrick who was an heir apparent to the movement Derek with central and creating and popular rising the phrase white genocide and other militant messaging that the shooter picked up on\n... white nationalist views in his twenties but ... says\nI think every time something like this happened she feel small waves call for you wonder how much the re messaging that he did ... nationalism plays into incidents like that\nAfter we talked to ask them about the shooting we'll hear my September interview with fast slow and Derek Black\nI mean and the horrific sort of hierarchy of white nationalist believe um they they really consider Jews their primary enemy um\n... white nationalist believe although it's ridiculous and awful and scientifically accurate to say is that people of color and immigrants are by and large inferior to white and left on their own they would not be able to\nChallenge the white race but white nationalist believe the Jews\nAre while not whites I'm very smart and sort of scheming and also are trying to propagate a scheme of multiculturalism which will weaken the white race\nThey believe that Jews have used immigrants people of color and push for greater immigration push for things like now this caravan to change the demographics of America so that ultimately white people will become a minority and then white nationalist believe\nJews will have even more power than they do now in the country and that's that's why they identify Jews as their number one enemy minutes why throughout the history of the white nationalist movement we've seen more attacks on on synagogue more bombing threats on on Jewish schools than we have almost any other demographic group\nSo Bowers notion media to talk about how immigrants are going to slaughter white people and President Trump has been tweeting and speaking about the dangers of the migrant caravan that is walking on foot\nFrom Honduras to the U.S Mexico border and here's an example of something he said the assault on our country at our southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in\nIs far more important to me as president than trade or the U.S MCA that's the replacement for NAFTA that he negotiated\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border all Democrats called for weeklong but anyway she called this the assault on our country and it sounds like people are being killed if you use the word salt\nUm how is the president's language his language that's very you know describing invading frightening words this group of migrants walking toward the border how is that language resonating among white nationalist\nLanguage is hugely popular among white nationalists and I think also hugely damaging because when you're when you're talking to people as if they are at war which when you use words like on slots and\nThat's exactly what you're doing then I think it's natural to expect that a few people within this movement are going to begin behaving as if they're at war and they're going to take drastic action at this sort of fear mongering that happens I think particularly around immigration and the country is\nA big huge fuel behind white nationalist ideas and it's it's something that comes from mainstream corners of our of our country in politics and on the Internet and I think one of the scary things about the the last posted Bowers wrote on gab is if you take out the last ... the I'm going in\nThat reads essentially like many means on Facebook or do every day it reads like hundreds of post on storm front do every day these are widely held ideas at white nationalist recently have gone from referring to immigrants\nFirst is illegals which is insulting enough then as infiltrators and now as invaders and they speak about this as if they are wartime commanders which begins to justified drastic and violent action\nA President Trump has been calling himself a nationalist\nAnd some people are saying that's a really were for white nationalists and that's ... is like one step away from calling yourself a white nationalist\nAnd so I'm I'm Wondering how your hearing the president's self description as a nationalist and also how that is being heard in the white nationalist world\nYeah I think that I'm white national I feel like\nDonald Trump in some ways has been sort of we can get them um and has been for ... years now and in ways where he can use some of their language but also managed to explain that he was not saying it exactly that way so\nYou know during the presidential campaign that sometimes meant that Donald Trump would read tweets a white genocide message from from the white genocide user and that exact phrase white genocide would be spread dolls Donald Trump's followers I think similarly when Donald Trump sort of\nSaid that he was on a nationalist and give it to the fence for nationalism a lot of white nationalist thought hey this is signaling to us that our ideas have real mainstream power and that he identifies with some of what we're doing even though of course he can't fully say that he's a white nationalist\nSo the synagogue shooting rubber ... criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are saying he's not a nationalist he's a global is its global to buzz word for Jewish\nYes the globe with is a is definitely a buzzword for Jewish and above worried that the\nPresident himself and and many people close to him have used often the the final campaign ad of of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global west with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad that global\nIs is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world why\nBecause they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because they they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews are this is sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to\nTheir way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized President Trump or being too accommodating of Jewish influence\nAnd I'm Wondering here is it's confusing to white nationalists to feeling the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a national has been on the other hand\nHis son in law Jared is Jewish\nUh ... daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get a sense of white nationalist or a little confused about how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but it's a confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration am white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician at with any power in the country and and and now they feel like they have a politician who sort of is doing this dance of\nEmpowering some of their ideas speaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough room to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement and\nSo I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology but they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of those ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nTo social media platform the powers used is called gab\nAnd it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off of Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic statements so what can you tell us about gap\nThat gap is pretty small and and the social media space I mean I think it's about a half million users um but ah it really embraces this sort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people and gab Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and\nThat was when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following\nUm to create like a white utopia there he and some um you know white nationalism buddies were armed and were they were in their car like with ammunition driving to the ship when they were stopped by\nLaw enforcement agents and your father spent three years in prison so he I mean he really deeply bought the idea that you could create that's like white nationalist utopia\nYeah yeah he from the time he was a teenager um he was raised in civil rights era Alabama and everybody around him had sort of\nNormal casual southern racist ideas about segregation and what distinguished him was a feeling that it was not just an unfortunate thing that the schools are being integrated but that it was a cataclysmic moment it that was going to lead to a minority white America and it was going to\nIn western civilization and that he had to do something it dedicated his life to\nMaking people aware of that and the distinguishing factor for him was how extreme heat solve the problem was and how far forward he was thinking about it\nWhat was your vision for white nationalism what what did you foresee you weren't going to try to overthrow a Caribbean island and create a white utopia there that failed for your father\nDid you have an alternate plan for like a white space for white people to be in the independent of anybody of any race and not have to suffer interactions with them\nYeah I was convinced um that there was a lot of late and support for\nThe tenets of white nationalism that race was super important than the immigration from non European countries was making things worse than that people believe that in large numbers and wouldn't vote for that and I I was born\nJust as a David Duke was winning his first campaign in Louisiana in Nineteen eighty nine and my dad was on the road are coming back because my mother was in labor\nAnd so I with you knew I yeah for a labor with me and so I knew from the time as a child that\nWhite nationalism as long as it was not necessarily calling itself white nationalism could win campaigns so I did things like\nRun little Republican county elections or demonstrate that I could win the majority of the vote for white nationalist talking points that are very normal\nUh South Florida neighborhood and I ran a training sessions on how people could hone their message to try to get that audience not freak people out and just tap into things like don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway or making everything worse and don't you think political correctness is just\nNot letting you talk about things that are real and getting people to agree on that would be the way forward\nAnd you won a local election as a member of the west Palm Beach county Republican committee but they wouldn't let you take your seat because of your views so I Do that kind of do you feel like that boils your plans for like I take over the Republican Party\nFor my plans for um being on the administration of the Republican Party and its decision making in Palm Beach county but\nWinning the election was always the real goal it was just trying to prove that I could walk around and organize a campaign and go door to door\nAnd say everything that white nationalist bullied or at least Ninety percent of it without saying what the organization my dad ran was and that I could win on that the point was always the show that that could still work in the in the same year the ... was running his campaign\nWas going to win the presidency that that was a good time to start advocating white nationalist talking points that broke Obama winning was a sign that why people would start voting more strongly on a racist idea is not less\nYou know I put that into context for us with their lives Derek like the only person then who ... who is thinking that thought that with Obama running for president then becoming a president this was like an opportunity for white nationalist\nI think a lot of white nationalist sub President Obama's election is a huge opportunity for their movements and because what white nationalist have done a\nWith with dangerous effect is played to this ah factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists unfortunately in large parts of white America polls consistently show that\nThirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or than juice which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away a things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish that\nHas a huge effect uh with with a lot of voters and and it's got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue exactly right it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people or do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to this effect that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride then or\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts there were attended by majority white crowds in the south or an Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they would go into the parking lot and they would hand out these CDs sort of suddenly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was re branded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races there are other ways that white\nWhite nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little bit\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people\nI was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would organize little teams that are apparently on line ...\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and posts some carefully done talking points uh we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries is white genocide and would talk about white pride talk or things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and try to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable\nPeople who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said [noise]\nI find really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet there you are describing\nThat you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language and finds you just changed to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and they are and fat and and the and this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nTo being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white miss and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities into hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races and different places like what percent one percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing fits that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nWhoa whoa\nOnes you have a phone never ever\nOnes you have um [noise]\nUh\nThis is Florida frontiers highly Baker is a public historian with the University of central Florida she has this look at the Melrose ladies literary and debating society\nDr Cynthia Patterson associate professor of English at the University of South Florida recently wrote catching the spirit the Melrose ladies literary and debating society Eighteen Ninety to Eighteen Ninety nine and article that was published in the fall twenty Seventeen issue of the Florida historical quarterly\nHer interest in Florida women's clubs and the progressive era came from her earlier research unsettling clubs from the nineteenth century\nSome circles where a lot more about political reform activities then they were about sewing\nMany of the sewing circles eventually morph into literary societies Dr Paterson's investigation of literary societies in the late Nineteen than early twentieth century led her to the story of the ... ladies' literary and debating society\nThis group arose in Melrose, Florida very small community still today in Eighteen Ninety\nAnd it was one of what would come to be hundreds of women's groups in the state of Florida by the mid twentieth century and the clock was actually founded by two northern transplants a woman named allies a king and her companion Nelly gland\nAnd they had relocated to Melrose using kings small fortune that she had inherited from a deceased father and spouse to invest in orange groves in the state of Florida and so they got together with six other women\nAnd the eight original members of the Melrose ladies literary debating society met Fort nightly that is every other week\nAnd they met in the homes of members most of them lived in Melrose year round\nAnd so they held their meetings to plan\nActivities related to reading to\nWriting to debating\nAnd also to be engaged in the reform activities in their little village of Melrose\nMelrose ladies Larry and debating society was one of the first went in clubs in Florida it was also one of the most radical ones\nThe Melrose ladies were a little bit more radical and some of their sister clubs were in terms of at least they're reading material they were talking about sexual relationships and the age of consent for women\nThey were talking about the lives of blacks Floridians how to improve them they were talking about prostitution in the state of Florida and how to put an end to it\nAnd I did not see evidence of that kind of debating going on in the other clubs who's records I've examined\nThe Melrose ladies literary in today's society was ahead of its time Dr Patterson points out that they're concerned about the rights of women were similar to those expressed by women in the modern me too movement\nCan actually draw a line from their concern about the rights of women\nAnd male abuse of power to today's contemporary me too movement I don't know\nIt's a far stretched to see that they were already asking these kinds of questions and concerned with these issues\nOf the rights of women and male abuse of power then that now or in the media today\nI think it's important to note also that most of these women's groups are still in existence today and still meet in their original meeting house as does the male risk group the same one they arrested in the Eighteen nineties\nOver two hundred group still belong to the Florida federation of women's clubs\nAnd that's just the way the clubs for white women there was a whole other organization the national association of colored women's clubs\nWhich was also very active beginning in the Eighteen nineties these clubs are still very active in leading reform initiatives in their villages towns and cities\nThe story of the ... ladies' literary and debating society shows that the archival records that society than clubs can be used to uncover the voices of women in Florida history\nThis is a good time I think to put in a plug for saving and preserving the records related to women in the state of Florida I have read\nThe leading text books that purport to teach the history of Florida and there is very little in there about what women were doing I suspect that one reason for this is that\nMost of these women's clubs records are held privately they're held in the homes of the secretary of the club in the clubhouse or storage unit some of which are not climate controlled\nI was fortunate that the records of the Melrose ladies literary and debating society had been donated to the University of Florida otherwise\nThis would not have been known to his story and I would urge our listeners to think about the preservation of records particularly records related to women and what women were doing in the state of Florida\nAnd what blacks Floridians were doing for the most part you simply will not find that these kinds of records have been collected and archived\nIn libraries museums university archives so the the challenge of preserving these histories is very real\nFor Florida frontiers I'm Holly Baker radio and

think similarly when Donald Trump sort of\nSaid that he was on a nationalized then gave it to the fence for nationalism a lot of white nationalist thought hey this is signaling to us that our ideas have real mainstream power and that he identifies with some of what we're doing even though of course he can't fully say that he's a white nationalist\nSo the synagogue shooting rubber ... hours criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are saying he's not a nationalist he's a globalized globalized a buzz word for Jewish\nYes the global is is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and above worried that the\nPresident himself and and many people close to him have used often the final campaign ad\nOf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global with with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world why\nBecause they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because they they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews are this\nIs sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized President Trump or being too accommodating of Jewish influence\nAnd I'm Wondering here is it's confusing to white nationalists to feeling the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a national has been on the other hand\nHis son in law Jared is Jewish\nUh Trump's daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump right now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get a sense of white nationalist or a little confused about how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but it's the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration am white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician or with any power in the country and and and now\nThey feel like they have a politician who sort of is doing this dance of empowering some of their ideas speaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough for him to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement and\nSo I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology but they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of those ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nThe social media platform that powers used is called gab and it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off of Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic statements so what can you tell us about gap\nThat gap is pretty small and in the social media space I mean it I think it's about a half million users um but ah it really embraces this sort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't\nDoesn't allow for it he's he's one of the most popular people on gas Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the\nWhite nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue um instilling friend is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial warrior and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction storefronts um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there have been many uh several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nUm to create like a white utopia there he and some um you know white nationalism buddies were armed they were they were in their car like with ammunition driving to the ship when they were stopped by\nLaw enforcement agents and your father spent three years in prison so he I mean he really deeply bought the idea that you could create that's like white nationalist utopia\nYeah yeah he from the time he was a teenager um he was raised in ... Alabama and everybody around him had sort of\nNormal casual southern racist ideas about segregation and what distinguished him was a feeling that it was not just an unfortunate thing that the schools are being integrated but that it was a cataclysmic moment that that was going to lead to a minority white America and it was going to\nIn western civilization and that he had to do something it dedicated his life to\nMaking people aware of that and the distinguishing factor for him was how extreme heat solve the problem was and how far forward he was thinking about it\nWhat was your vision for white nationalism ... what what did you foresee you weren't going to try to overthrow a Caribbean island and create a white utopia there that failed for your father\nDid you have an alternate plan for like a white space for white people to be in the independent of anybody of any race and not have to suffer interactions with them yeah\nI was convinced um that\nThere was a lot of late and support for the tenets of white nationalism that race was super important and that immigration from non European countries was making things worse than that people believe that in large numbers and wouldn't vote for that and I I was born\nJust as a David Duke was winning his first campaign in Louisiana in Nineteen eighty nine and my dad was on the road are coming back because my mother was in labor\nAnd so I with you knew I yeah for a labor with me and so I knew from the time that I was a child that\nWhite nationalism as long as it was not necessarily calling itself white nationalism could win campaigns so I did things like run little Republican county elections or demonstrate that I could win with the majority of the vote for white nationalist talking points that are very normal\nUh South Florida neighborhood and I ran a training sessions on how people could hold their message to try to get that audience not freak people out and just tap into things like don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway or making everything worsen don't you think political correctness is just\nNot letting you talk about things that are real and getting people to agree on that would be the way forward\nAnd you won a local election as a member of the west Palm Beach county Republican committee but they wouldn't let you take your seat because of your views so I did that I Do feel like that for ... your plans for like I take over the Republican Party\nFor my plans for um being on the administration of the Republican Party and its decision making in Palm Beach county but\nWinning the election was always the real goal it was just trying to prove that I could walk around and organize a campaign and go door to door\nAnd say everything that white nationalist bullied or at least Ninety percent of it without saying what the organization my dad ran was and that I could win on that the point was always to show that that could still work and that in the same year the ... was running his campaign\nWas going to win the presidency that that was a good time to start advocating white nationalist talking points that broke Obama winning was a sign that why people would start voting more strongly on a racist ideas not less\nYou know I put that into context for us with her was Derek like the only person then who who was thinking that thought that with Obama running for president then becoming a president this was like an opportunity for white nationalist\nI think a lot of white nationalist sub President Obama's election as a huge opportunity for their movements and because what white nationalist I've done a\nWith with dangerous effect is played to this ah factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists unfortunately in large parts of white America polls consistently show that\nThirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or then juice which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away a\nThings are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish that has a huge effect uh with with a lot of voters and and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue exactly right it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to this effect that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is a strong front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride than\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to big country concerts there were attended by majority white crowds in the south and Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they were going to the parking lot and they would hand out the CDs sort of suddenly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was rebranded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races there are other ways that white\nWhite nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do\nWho was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little bit\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would organize little teams that are apparently on line ...\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points uh we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and would talk about white pride would talk or things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and tried to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language\nAnd I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said [noise]\nI find really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet there you are describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide that white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about youth committing violence but it's about\nThe other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you so it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors\nAre and who the victims and ... and the\nAnd this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal why people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and that quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nAnd back to being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American\nCulture you know won't be quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities in to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint of the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races into different places like what percent one percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that um it racism nebulous thing that's a that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "29"}
