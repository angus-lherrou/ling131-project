{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Those moments when I feel\nThat I'm kind of going along the feeding in Munich myself shrinking myself down whether it's professionally or personally or or socially it just feels like a cancer that I Can't cut and it just makes me it grates on me\nTo this is an example to imagine a workplace where there are collected values\nFrom an organization and everyone there can say\nHere's what I'm asking in in a line that with my values and here's what I'm not like going back to that tweet like the tweet are you kidding me\nBring your opinion to work and you're fired\nOr some serious is this a joke yeah your opinions out of my place of business or you are fired\nSo that's interesting because one of the values we have at our workplaces innovation you don't bring your opinion to the table you sit back when we're in struggled trying to figure something out\nAnd you don't share\nYou're in trouble at my workplace so I don't know what kind of business someone's running whether or not interested in the opinions of the people who work there but what I can say is I Hope that we're not dependent on any innovation from that\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nLet's get to one more voice mail that we got in our inbox from someone who felt like they wanted to maybe be a little more open but that they had very good and legitimate reasons for armor ring up was\nI Believe I have to arm or up to a certain extent\nUm I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disease or disorder and uh it's really throwing me for a loop because prior to this\nYeah I was always going in with a mask off as I'm also bisexual in the place where I work it's a very conservative environment in a very conservative part of the country\nUm so I like to know what most brown thinks about the\nThanks very much for having the courage to share your story I have to say I can relate\nTo this caller I did mention of course being out but like\nEven within that you know there's we we know that there are ... people but you may not know like what kind of algae beauty person you're dealing with which float in the pride parade that they will be and if you would float they were on you you had your pearls you wouldn't touch them fight like I I kind of get this there are parts of my life and I think of this person's life\nWhere it feels safe to be an armored but there's that one lock box you have and say well this piece of armor like there's no way there's no way I could share that\nSo here's what's really important that important distinction we share again vulnerability is not disclosure\nVulnerability is I mean we've interviewed daring leaders some of the brightest people I've ever seen who disclosed very little but they are willing to show up and hard conversations they manage uncertainty they listen they problem solve they stay in things when they're uncomfortable an awkward\nThey give people honesty back even if it's hard\nThen I've met I've met leaders who share everything and I wouldn't consider them courageous at all vulnerability is not about disclosure we share with people who've earned the right to hear our story and with whom their relationship can bear the weight of the story and so I don't think\nFor the call her just came and again thank you for being brave I don't think your courage at work is dependent on you disclosing anything about your identity about your diagnosis\nThat that's not that's not what vulnerability is\nThat's not what vulnerability as I Would I Would say to this say this\nCultures where we've done gone in and done deep work and there is a huge pressure to conform to be perfect to look the same act the same and think the same\n\nHave the highest levels of courage to trust and the and the lowest levels of innovation\nOr newer low on time but I'm curious to know you know what this journey is like for you these days you written in the books quite a bit that you are kind of a fellow traveler but you're not an expert on that are still kind of working on this yourself how how is it how is it going at this point last year when you're on the proto after how you do it and you're like [laughter]\nOkay [laughter]\nI don't know [laughter]\nThat sounds very familiar it's hard to [laughter]\nJust trying to take it all in and I understand it and apply it to my own life and it's this book was really yeah I Would say up there with parenting and partnering I'm leading\nHas been one of the hardest things I've ever done and I'm an armored person you know fifth generation Texan by nature I'm just an armored person\nYou said your family models should be walking load it is like and like we have cops [laughter] like it's awful like but customize term yeah yes yeah that we're serious like yeah and so I think\nThere's a story in the book that I tell about an intervention with my leadership team with me that sad you know you're always\nYou're always pushing these deadlines and we fail to meet them because they're unrealistic but were afraid to tell you that they're unrealistic when you propose that because you get really intense and you push and push and push harder and we're not going to do it anymore\nAnd\nThis research really taught me to say okay let me think about that from it or not did defensive let me think about it and I went home and thought I thought about it for a couple of days that I was like I Do that not out of ambition but out of fear\nAnd scarcity like I Am comparison I look and see what other people are doing and we should be doing that and why isn't this gone already and it led to a couple of weeks and the hardest conversations that I've ever had with my leadership team\nBut it changed us and what a gift that you have a team that's going to say that oh my God brave\n... brown research professor at the University of Houston graduate College of social work her latest book beer to lead is out today and it was great to

Thomas who had grown up from an early age interested in music\nAnd was a very successful emerging rapper ... outside of Chicago but unfortunately it also been drawn into the game said he was a gangster disciple and he wanted everyone to know it\nSo he often across Instagram YouTube would broadcast his affiliation with the disciples and he was the subject of not one or two but three assassination attempts by rival gang members he survives the first two\nAnd as he survives rather than you know thinking twice or maybe laying low for a bit he posts bold new videos on YouTube\nBasically challenging these folks to come at him again what we've seen in a gang violence across this country is that much of that has migrated to social media\nBecause so much of being in a gang is about space and it's about fronting\nIt matters a great deal if someone say finds your Facebook it to counter trolls you or a leaves a disrespectful Instagram comment and something else that's happened as this game violence moves to social media is that it also means that violence is no longer about who's feuding for a particular block\nBut games at the same franchise even if there are many miles apart might start fighting each other over something that originated on line\nSo so if someone calls you out on line you going to respond and it may not it may be on line but it may also be on the street right\nAnd that's the difference between a gang feuds in the past is if two people died yelled words or the other in the street I'm only the people around them would hear it and the moment would be done if you posted online\nThe whole world is watching at least in their perception\nAnd it sticks up there until something is done about it and that's why it's at the origin of so many of these uh fights and not just a eighty percent of fights and school sparked from something on line but also of course the spate of gang killings\nAnd what's interesting in a little bit scary is that we see the same phenomena of Internet beef at the gang level moving up to levels of drug cartels all the way to how it's changed a diplomacy how it's changed politics\nWe have this question of what happens when leaders of nations are interacting in the same way when they're having these beliefs in front of the world will make it harder for them to negotiate if the whole world knows that they've been insulted and they've done nothing about it\nYou have an interesting kind of looking at the development of mass communications you say that the Internet is the most consequential communications development since the invention of the written word and that it really got super charged when everything could be\nDone on smartphones and\nThere are many examples where social media has have been used to fuel popular uprisings the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring at that time a lot of people talk about social media is being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone\nThe trouble is the authoritarian regimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nTheir spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media you have everything from a national media sources describing it's a liberating power to people in Egypt are literally naming their kids Facebook but then\nAuthoritarians figure it out they figure out how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth and so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media\nAnd a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking and what they're saying ah for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer or the example we use is a journalist and turkey who reach wheat something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands of Turkish prison\nSo government can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China is presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say to a what you buy\nCan all be monitored and it's brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness so for example or if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent if you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a free charges of your smartphone at coffee shops\nTo a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations it's even used in dating profiles so it affects uh how attractive the person you're gonna be able to go on dates or even Mary\nAnd ah what's notable about this what goes in a way that or will never could have imagined\nIs the network side of it your score reflects not only what you do but what everyone else in your network to us so if for example your brother is not being positive enough about the regime online your score will go down so then you'll go to your brother and say hey you know get it together\nAnd this is this a strange way of using technology in essence to steer us to a behavior that at least in China the government wants\nSo people who who have phones and do a lot of social media will have a social credit score the aim is so that eventually everyone will get one\n\nThe goal of it is to achieve a what's known as mass control to steer an entire population towards a certain direction\nIt's not just the idea that um you will have your online activity but that the government will force you to have this kind of Internet presence of for example there are certain places in China where there are police checkpoints physical checkpoints where they will check your smartphone to ensure that you have the apps that allows monitoring of you\nWrite and just just to get a sense of the region does I mean do we know how many people now have social credit scores in China is it hundreds of thousands tens of millions\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army and their job uh and it it has its own\nAnd she's pushing out messaging ah to that effect in particularly I'm Around that period of Charlottesville she is so angry that right winger are being blamed for this and she says it's this Internet conspiracy and the like\nAnd of course and she is a fake and how do we know that Angie is a fake Angie is presenting herself with imagery that is actually Leonardo DiCaprio Z German girlfriend\nAnd what's interesting is that when reports then circulate online that Angie as a fake\nShe then attacks the people going after her basically to say that they're part of this a conspiracy theory and do you get this strange outcome where her fake messages get greater attraction than the messages debunking her famous\nSo Andrew Jackson was a fake but she attracted a lot of ... quite a following on social media was that because she was so compelling or was it because there were many many other fake accounts or robotic jobs that were re tweeting or stuff\nSo and she was a ... she was a machine voice masquerading as a human on line\nAnd each of those is powerful\nIn another themselves but where they gain their true power is creating what are known as ... net so for example ah and she was only one of at least sixty thousand Russian accounts in a single ... that infects Twitter almost like a cancer and its war being and twisting the American political dialogue\nBut what's fascinating is that it's not just about persuading the targets it's about hijacking the network's own algorithms so these botnets Dr viral\nDifferent points of view that then push that up into the news feed it makes them trends so people even outside those networks begin to see them\nAnd the impact of this can be seen in examples that range from a brags that\nAbout one third of the online conversation related to ... that were these artificial voices to or even just a couple of months ago the Mexican election same percentage one third were these artificial voices and of course they played a huge impact in the American twenty sixteen election many people think it's going to do the same in the upcoming vote\n... just make sure we understand us and we all know that you can establish a fake account or make up a name and get on a social media platform like Twitter and there are a lot of those but you're saying this this sixty thousand ... actually robotically generated accounts generating their messages is that right\nYes and one of the challenges of space is that\nAh we don't have a good handle on the link so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls will trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account who are posing as something that they are not so at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg\nWho's acting like they are an American veteran a grandmother from Texas but then you have also bought ... these are machines these algorithms that are basically pushing out messages automatically\nThe combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box can drive that message viral by having thousands or tens of thousands of voices echo it out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter get rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically regenerate\nAnd what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now something that these Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate social media conversation something they're increasingly doing is\nCreating accounts and having them lie dormant and have a history of messages that seem authentic and benign and not related to a hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road it will be much harder to detect than as something other than a real person\nYou said an amazing number here you say that when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know that is\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is that out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior\nMaybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts\nThese were in essence fake followers created to give the semblance of a massive online following that can then be turned into a real online following by driving your messages viral\nRight but at fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically a bot accounts generated out of water known as click farms are these are almost you think of like a\nSweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh and then you combine these uh physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power and politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big an number but an extent that campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nAh it now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you saw similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to er there's actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing but the echo effect and to the broader population including the media\nOne of the uh accounts that was posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like as if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it\nAnd so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether it swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it was ...\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked\nBecause they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about conflict and

their equipment for ISIS the claim which then fueled another propaganda victory as suddenly they could broadcast using all this stuff American equipment\nAnd you had this wonderful double effect where at the local level\nIraqi soldiers are looking down at their smartphones and they're seeing a what seems like an ISIS victory playing out on the screens in their hands and then it becomes one ah causes them to decide to run away this um army that's much larger ...\nIt was powerful military in the world the U.S military as tanks it as helicopters and the like and yet ah what's playing out on social media changes the dynamics of the battlefield but simultaneously that it changes the way the rest of us look at the world and fear it\nYou get this phenomena where more Americans are afraid of terrorism at that point\nThen they were in the weeks after nine eleven and so it shows the power of social media and how it can sort of rewriting the narrative and then turn that incident as leverage to into playing out with impact on our own politics as part of the changes in the twenty sixteen election\nYou also cite an example from another part of the world's where a social media can lead to ... and it can affect a events on the ground and this is in Chicago where social media taunts interacts with gang gang violence in ways that can be deadly you want to give us an example of that\nFor

been drawn into the gang scene he was a gangster disciple and he wanted everyone to know it\nSo he often across Instagram YouTube would broadcast his affiliation with the disciples and he was the

at the same franchise even if there are many miles apart might start fighting each other over something that originated on line\nSo so if someone calls you out on line you're going to respond and it may not it may be on line but it may also be on the street right\nAnd that's the difference between a gang feuds in the past is if two people are ... ... words or the other in the street I'm only the people around them would hear it and the moment would be done if you posted online\nThe whole world is watching at least in their perception\nAnd it sticks up there until something is done about it and that's why it's at the origin of so many of these uh fights and not just a eighty percent of fights in school sparked from something on line but also of course the spate of gang killings\nAnd what's interesting in a little bit scary is that we see the same phenomena of Internet beeps at the gang level moving up to levels of drug cartels all the way to how it's changed a diplomacy how it's changed politics\nWe have this question of what happens when leaders of nations are interacting in the same way when they're having these beliefs in front of the world\nWill make it harder for them to negotiate if the whole world knows that they've been insulted and they've done nothing about it\nYou have an interesting kind of look at ... at the development of mass communications you say that the Internet is the most consequential communications development since the invention of the written word and it it really got super charged when everything could be\nDone on smartphones and\nThere are many examples where social media has have been used to fuel popular uprisings the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring at that time a lot of people talk about social media as being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone\nThe trouble is the authoritarian regimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nThe Arab Spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media you have everything from a national media sources describing it's a liberating power to people in Egypt are literally naming their kids Facebook but then\nAuthoritarians figure it out they figure out how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth\nAnd so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media and a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking of what they're saying ah for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer or the example we use as a journalist and turkey who reach wheat something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands and a Turkish prison so governments can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China is presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say\nTo a what you buy can all be monitored and it's brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness so for example or if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent\nIf you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a free charges of your smartphone at coffee shops to a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations\nIt's even used in dating profiles so it affects uh how attractive the person you're gonna be able to go on dates or even Mary\nAnd ah what's notable about this what goes in a way that Orwell never could have imagined\nIs the network side of it your score reflects not only what you do but what everyone else in your network does so if for example your brother is not being positive enough about the regime online your score will go down so then you'll go to your brother and say hey you know get it together\nAnd this is this a strange way of using technology in essence to steer us to a behavior that at least in China the government wants\nSo people who who have phones and do a lot of social media will have a social credit score the aim is so that eventually everyone will get one\n\nThe goal of it is to achieve a what's known as mass control to steer an entire population towards a certain direction\nIt's not just the idea that um you will have your online activity but the the government will force you to have this kind of Internet presence or for example there are certain places in China where there are police checkpoints physical checkpoints where they will check your smartphone to ensure that you have the apps that allows monitoring of you\nWrite and just just to get a sense of the region does I mean do we know how many people now have social credit scores in China is it hundreds of thousands tens of millions\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army uh started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in a credit station systems\nTheir job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on ... and other Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations Peter Singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air\nClimate change needs fixing\nThe world's leading scientists believe we have about a decade to keep overwhelming under one and a half degrees they say we already have the know how to head off extreme heat devastating floods and poverty for millions but what can we do about that who's leading by example and who's not\nAnd of course and she is a fake and how do we know that Angie is a fake Angie is presenting herself with imagery that is actually Leonardo DiCaprio Z German girlfriend\nAnd what's interesting is that when reports then circulate online that and she has a fake\nShe then attacks the people going after her basically to say that they're part of this a conspiracy theory and you get this strange outcome where her fake messages get greater attraction than the messages debunking her Vegas\nSo Andrew Jackson was a fake but she attracted a lot of ... quite a following on social media was that because she was so compelling or was it because there were many many other fake accounts or robotic uh jobs that were re tweeting or stuff\nSo and she was a ... she was a machine voice masquerading as a human on line\nAnd each of those is powerful in another themselves but where they gain their true power is creating what are known as ... nets so for example a Angie was only one of at least sixty thousand Russian accounts in a single botnet that infects Twitter almost like a cancer\nAnd its war being and twisting the American political dialogue\nBut what's fascinating is that it's not just about persuading the targets it's about hijacking the network's own algorithms so these botnets Dr viral\nDifferent points of view that didn't push that up into the news feed it makes them trends so people even outside those networks begin to see them\nAnd the impact of this can be seen in examples that range from a brags that\nAbout one third of the online conversation related to ... that were these artificial voices to or even just a couple of months ago the Mexican election same percentage one third were these artificial voices and of course they played a huge impact in the American twenty sixteen election many people think it's going to do the same in the upcoming vote\n... just to be sure we understand us and we all know that you can establish a fake account or make up a name and get on the social media platforms like Twitter and there are a lot of those but you're saying this this sixty thousand ... actually robotically generated accounts generating their messages is that right\nYes one of the challenges of space is that\nAh we don't have a good handle on the lingo so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls well trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account who are posing as something that they're not\nSo at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg who's acting like they are an American veteran a grandmother from Texas but then you have also bought ... these are machines these algorithms\nThat are basically pushing out messages automatically\nThe combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box can drive that message viral by having thousands or tens of thousands of voices echo it out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter get rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically regenerate\nAnd what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now something that these Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate social media conversation something they're increasingly doing is\nCreating accounts and having them lie dormant and have a history of messages that seem authentic and benign and not related to a hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road you'll be much harder to detect than as something other than a real person\nYou sent an amazing number here you say that when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know that is\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is it out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior maybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts\nThese were in essence fake followers created to give the semblance of a massive on line following that can then be turned into a real online following by driving your messages viral\nRight but at fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically a bot accounts generated out of water known as click farms are these are almost you think of like a\nSweatshop factory at the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh and then you combine these physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power and politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out in little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big an number but an extent\nCampaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook ah it now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you saw similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to er there's actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing but the echo effect and to the broader population including the media itself one of the uh accounts that was um posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like as if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it\nAnd so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether at swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about conflict and social media ...
