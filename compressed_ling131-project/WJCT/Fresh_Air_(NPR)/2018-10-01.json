{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Mary thanks very much for calling in Scott I Wonder if you could respond to marry a particularly because nine states pass laws this year that prevent domestic violence offenders from getting guns California's law bans domestic abusers from purchasing guns for life\nYeah I mean I think again this is an example of a measure that I'm a can attract support from people who even from people who consider themselves to be a gun rights proponents I don't think anybody wants\nTo see a guns in the hands of people who have already been determined to be a danger but um you know through the legal system so uh\nI think that's another area a much like the you know it's related to the red flag laws where there is room for a agreement there and compromise\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nWe stick with you one second Scott since you mentioned red flag laws Martinez tweeted how you determine mental illness for red flag laws I have a mental illness have never been in trouble I'm not violent I Love guns and weapons in general and also want gun control but what would these laws means for me Scott well\nEach uh each state I mean the laws are going to be the details will be different in each state but generally speaking I'm a and Chris or maybe you could give a little more detail on this it's a family members\nOr police officers determine or or believe that a person might be a danger to others or to him or herself then that would trigger the the red flag law and the ... of course the details as I say differ but that's the general idea\nChris yes thank you that that's exactly right and I and I think that\nWhat's important to note is none of the states that have passed excuse me\nA red flag laws have the issue of mental illness as the defining feature for the issuance of uh what what we're calling extreme risk laws it's actually at risk behavior\nThat as noted by family members or police that is the subject of the order is the subject of the court hearing\nFor the record I think it's very important to know the vast majority of individuals in this country who have a diagnosable mental illness do not connect any kind of crimes with a gun\nAnd so I think that it's at concerning I don't want to have the idea that somehow that focuses on mental illness it's the focus is on at risk behaviors that indicate that the person may be suffering temporarily\nUh from some kind of crisis and that guns and should not be in possession of the person during that time\nGet in one more comment from Kate in Tallahassee, Florida Kate posted on our Facebook page\nMoms demand action is working hard in every state across the country to advocate for meaningful commonsense solution that Americans overwhelmingly want\nWe support legal responsible gun ownership but we know we can do better to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals while we were happy to see the Florida Legislature passed meaningful reform this year we strongly disagree with the idea of arming teachers and will continue to fight against this dangerous proposal\nRichard let me get your response and of course I'd also like to hear from you too and she talked about kind of the politicking on both sides the Brady Campaign in the ad counselor partnering on a new campaign called end family fire\nThat's related to the safe storage of guns course I'd like you to tell us more about this campaign in the moment but first let's listen to part of the ad and then Richard I'd love to get your reaction was\nThree guys with a\nWhy do you want to search you can I Know absolutely not it's not a toy you know ... and ...\nYear well it's not any way I needed to protect you your sister in law\nGuys like on TV but\nWhat about the tires that mistake and guys you got there I have to\nPut a visceral campaign Richard I know we're a long time but what do you make of it\nIt's true when children have access to guns I'm horrible things can happen um\nYou know we should be one of the things that we can do a much better job in this country is instead of always thinking about adding to our criminal law and making this illegal in this little thing illegal why don't we act like smart American sometimes\nAnd use our tax laws and encourage people to do the right thing not just say it's illegal if you don't do this I mean we could encourage people to buy\nA firearm locks and sit in a safe to keep their guns and give them tax credits why don't we start thinking like smart people again in this country\nOf course we're low on time but let me give you the last word on this and and whether or not there are certain states they are targeting with this at particularly Kennedy she may have campaigned partly on gun legislation before we got to go\nShore I just want to say Richard I'm with you let's work on that together but the epidemic of gun violence we have in this country requires multiple solutions not just one and family fire is so important to us because we have lost\nAn opportunity for a long time now with Congress shutting down research into gun violence et cetera\nTo really push information about safe storage four point six million children in this country live in homes with loaded an unlocked guns eight kids today\nAnd homes across America are shot and injured or killed with a gun and the home this campaign aims directly at that and focuses and gives a a word family fire to these incidents that are completely preventable\nChris round the co president of the Brady Campaign to

campaign and Russia which out with Washington Post reporter Greg Miller who broke several related stories and shared a Pulitzer this year\nWe'll talk about the stories he broke including one about what she says\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nAnd we'll talk about reading an economy memo that in an Oval Office meeting between Colombian President Trump from complained about leaks and about a reporter and Miller realized he was that reporter\nThey're talking about heads on ... reporters in jail chasing down sources it was unnerving\nAlso TV critic David be including considers has Saturday Night live and sixty minutes responded to the Kavanaugh hearings that's on fresh air [noise]\n\nA so he already had troubling connections to the Kremlin and and when it was revealed that he had had conversations with the Russian ambassador\nCommensurate right around the same time that all the Obama administration was announcing sanctions against Russia I mean it just raised obvious questions what was Flynn telling these people\n[noise] so how did you find out what he was telling them how do you do that\n[laughter] [noise] we were digging it that for quite a long time\nNot getting I'm not making a whole lot of progress um I had gone to\nA an event or Kislyak was speaking even\nAnd he was speaking he's a physicist by training at all things and he was speaking at a conference in Washington and I showed up and sat down next to sit down next to him and started covering him with questions and\nHe started answering them a and sort of caught me off guard he wouldn't tell me what he talked about ... but he uh admitted that he had had longstanding relationship with Flynn and had many conversations with him\nThe thing that I think one thing that changed the dynamic was a column um that David Ignatius a columnist for the Washington Post wrote that just posed these questions we know that Mike Flynn had conversations with the Russian ambassador we know what when those occurred\nWe deserve answers from this new administration about what was said\nAnd that puts the white that put the White House under some pressure and it was their answers and they're misleading and dishonest answers that then unleashed the sourcing that we needed to get to the bottom of it did this come to you\nWill so we what happens is\nAfter after that Ignatius column you have incoming White House officials including Sean Spicer and vice president Pence going on television and saying we've talked Mike Flynn sanctions were not discussed in those conversations absolutely not nothing to it\nThat's when I'm longstanding sources for reporters at the post started here started to tell us\nNot true not true you guys need to look into this that's not true and it was you know I'm through the reporting of my colleagues adamant is Ellen knock ashamed of myself in trying to get out that\nThat we ultimately got nine sources I'm telling us consistently that Flynn had in fact discuss sanctions with\nChris Rock and in fact it signaled that they could expect some relief from those sanctions when Trump was in office so you know there's a scene in the book that I write about which one of my colleagues Adam and says I'm a terrific national security reporter\nIs meeting with a source and he has this certain method about that when he has conversations with sources he'll often bring a piece of paper that will have a list of facts that he wants to check would that source and he's going through that list of the facts and in this case it's about Flynn and Kislyak\nAnd uh at that moment that he gets the first sort of indication from a highly reliable source that the White House position on this\nIs false that Flynn's claims that Pence's claims that Sean Spicer claims need to be scrutinized further that they're not honest and that's what sets in motion to sort of really\nA fervent push on our end to get to the bottom of it\n[noise] the your your team contacts\nFlynn to say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador\nAbout lifting sanctions after Trump takes office and Flynn of course denied it and denied it and denied it and then you had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision made\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter I'm so when we write stories like this you know\nBasically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public and there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have\nEverything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague Karen DeYoung who had a previously scheduled interview with planned in his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raise this question with him on last time to tell him look post as close to publishing stories saying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats that several times no no no basically did not happen\nSo caring comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this and we actually hit pause on the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the sort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to theirs and we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom the next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Kamron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I I I ever use the word number nine I late I said we have nine different source of telling us this is true and and described that sourcing to those editors\nAnd came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the efforts we had gone to to try to to nail this town I'm Marty Baron and others were were didn't hesitate you know we're going forward with the story we need to tell Mike Flynn what we're doing\nSo that sets in motion another interaction with Flynn that was amazing so we call the White House we say we have the denial we're going to use that on the record we're going forward with the story anyway we're confident our sources and then the White House blinks Flynn links\nComes back to us calls me it through a spokesman calls me and says for the first time\nI'm Mr Flynn is no longer certain that those sanctions were not discussed in that column he can't be sure that the subject didn't come up\nAnd that was just so different from the categorical denial we had gotten I don't know sixteen hours earlier that we knew that we were we knew we were right and that's when we published\n[noise] so when Flynn was forced out of the Trump Administration\nLike well how did that feel if I Do feel like proud that you've broken such a consequential story\nUm do you feel like good like truth has been out there that I really like to know what it feels like that is now is a really yeah sure if they're really big thing very very early in the Trump Administration\nAll the all of the above Terry so sure absolutely proud of our of our work proud that we would have been able to accomplish something of such consequences proud that we were um\nYou know especially in this climate where the process is under constant siege an attack that we were able to do work that still mad that that mattered in your head immediate impact all of that\nI mean at that part of it felt great um I mean for me I had I had actually known Flynn for\nFor a long time probably a decade or so had interviewed him many times I'm overseas in at the Pentagon and other positions\nAnd always liked him I took no pleasure in his ouster I'm In his his resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time it just the I yeah I mean I was\nAs a reporter there's there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\nDid you face consequences did you get troll a lot as a result of having an mask this lie\nI mean the ... ... ... absolutely so troll ... attacked a lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the this administration at this really highly politically charged time where we're living through I'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nAbout Russian interference before the election cause the Obama administration knew about it the intelligence agencies they were on the what was happening and the intelligence agencies strongly felt that\nIntended not just a mess with it but\nTo discredit Hillary Clinton [noise] there was a lot of Republican opposition to making any of this public and a lot of that opposition came from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell can you describe the ways he tried to prevent anything\nFrom going public about Russian interference\nThere is a long gap between when the U.S government through its intelligence services learns what Russia's doing and when the public finally learn about it a and there's a lot of second guessing even now about why the Obama administration didn't tell the public more or earlier\nThere are scenes in the book I write about in late August or the early August timeframe late July timeframe John Brennan who was CIA director at the time becoming increasingly concerned about what was happening the WikiLeaks dump it already occurred\nHe sort of holes himself up inside his office at the CIA headquarters on the seventh floor for two straight days deep into the night each day poring over all of the agencies Russian intelligence at the end of this exercise is just convinced that Russia and he has any sitting on new intelligence in fact the tells him\nThat the Kremlin is playing a bigger game here than anybody has to that point realized that they're not just in it to try to disrupt the election but they are trying to help elect Trump and damage Hillary Clinton and he calls the White House that week calls them in early August I Need to get in to see the president\nAfter his meeting with Obama\nThe game plan involves brand and then trying to reach out to congressional leadership this is sort of an all hands on deck moment for the U.S government they want to make sure the leadership in Congress is aware of what's happening in the election so Brennan starts calling\nYou know the Senate and house leadership the committee to leadership at the committee the relevant committees and so forth and setting up one on one briefings with these people\nAnd uh that's really unusual for CIA director to do and\nHe finds you know that the Democrats are lining up at his door that to to me and learn about what's happening Republicans are putting them off\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans until almost a month later this sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless this is a you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\n'em he finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this and the book and Brennan feels like he's coming to these leaders would\nFrightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has the subject of they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and trying to install Donald Trump\nAnd then he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell because McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate is deeply troubled by McConnell is saying view basically tells them\nIf you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump\nI Will consider that interference in the election and I will and I will call the administration out on that I Will accuse the administration of tried to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader\nBeing told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to issue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering in the election\n[noise] you you write ... had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would\nUh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia's trying to tilt the outcome of this election the Obama team felt sort of handcuffed\nNow ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this and a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refused to go along they're sort of stuck\nThey can't see a way past that it takes some months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose [noise]\nYou know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference and this was in late September [noise]\nUm was a letter to state election officials from all four leaders of Congress warning of unnamed quote mala factors that are seeking to use cyberattacks\nTo disrupt the administration of our elections and an urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell even I signed on to a statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mentioned of of Russia it's so they are just\nStarting to look packets astonishing look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um\nSo so meanwhile John Brennan who is trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell is saying oh yeah if you say that public am going to say you were interfering in the election so Brennan recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is still the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um\nI don't know if you can answer this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influenced the outcome of it and then try to cover it up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like treason um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um the tell us that we're in a different political earlier than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time\nUm where political imperatives where loyalty to party or party considerations\nSeem to overwhelm everything else including\nThe concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAn election an American election for president of the United states what is more deserving of protection um and putting above all party considerations than that and yet we've seen numerous cases through this period in which um when senior a fist\nI think Mitch McConnell is one of them their impulse is to protect the party interests to try to protect the prospect of a Trump victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's it's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] I mean we introduced you know if you're just joining us my guess is Glenn Miller he covers national security and intelligence for the Washington Post now he

the Trump Administration who have been told that they had to sign non disclosure agreements which means that they wouldn't be able to divulge\nAnything to a reporter like you and if you called them and this is an attempt to prevent any kind of damaging information about the Trump Administration friends from getting out to the public do you know when somebody you're speaking to has signed a non disclosure agreement\nLoaded up the machinery brought 'em out to Cape Canaveral they actually also cancelled some of the stamps right here and cocoa and all the Sam's went on sale right here in our building so that the first of these project mercury stamps were sold right here in our in our building which is now part of the library for history so it's\nKind of all come full circle grade well thanks then sure thank you ... director of educational resources for the Florida Historical Society an arc of is that the library of Florida history in cocoa\nThis is Florida frontiers established in Eighteen Ninety five Jones' high school is Orlando's historic African American school highly Baker is a graduate student in the public history program at the University of central Florida\nI'm a graduate of Jones' high school class of Ninety seven to one and I'm just always willing to do what I can to get back into the school because the school was the foundation when you leave Jones you have left and what a quality education that was always emphasized because of the great teachers that we had the great principles that we have\nAnd the connection and we all look out for each other I can see there were juniors and seniors and they had to pass me and then some of them would go into the feel of education in return is teachers\nSo it really just kind of gave us as a a future vision is for why we want to give back because that's for me it was given to me and as a person I truly believe I have to give it back\nThat was Walter Hawkins that President John highschool Historical Society and an alumnus of John's high school in Orlando I recently sat down with Walter Hawkins and Mary Lewis and history student at the University of central Florida they talked with me I thought that John highschool historical museum\nWalter Hawkins told me about the history of the museum\nJones' high school was established in Eighteen Ninety five\nAnd part of what we want to do a as we came into the Nineteen nineties was have a celebration recognizing a hundred years the centennial of Jones' high school which was a done in Nineteen Ninety five from centennial celebration\nWhich was a hundred years of great things that happened that Jones was any discussion of creating a museum\nThat will have the artifacts talk about the history of Joe talk about the great things that was part of the historical Jones' high school and that's why I came about over six individuals that came together the cause of all of the celebrations that was part of the centennial\nJust people were bringing artifacts\nBringing just talking about stories of ... years they were there\nAnd they said why not create this museum where we can capture all of this data and be able to highlight it for years to come\nNear Lewis recently interned at the Jones highschool museum and called me more about it\nThe museum of it's a space at the Jones high campus and houses\nLot of material about Jones started was curated by Audrey Rikers she was a former teacher there that she had a hand and everything that was in it and wrote a a bunch of histories of journalism she pretty much the whole thing together\nAnd in the museum there spaces where we see pictures of a principals on the wall and there's also band directors or such as chief Wilson and all of his accomplishments when this trophies for football players as well\nAnd along with that there's a year books in the museum as well there's a lot of it\nSpecial about how Jones got to where it is the documents to move from the town has been the first school house that was there there's pictures that highlighted movement to uh the location that they have now off of Rio Grande and uh the museum it's mainly visual\nAnd the deals a lot with photographs of them in my opinion the museum was catered more towards alumni\nAnd in order for them to feel that they were part of the museum they like to see pictures of people that they know and people that they dealt with and they'd like to see themselves in the museum that's the main draw the museum if I have the one thing would be the photos on the wall mad of\nVisitors come to invade your point and say hey that's my principal and the law or I went to school with them they were in my class\nThat Jones highschool museum and the University of central Florida recently worked together on marching forward a documentary film about the Jones an edge what our high school marching bands\nIn Nineteen sixty four the city of Orlando came together to fund their trip to the world's fair in New York I asked us Mary Lewis what it was like working on the documentary found in a classy recently took at the University of central Florida\nThe experience working on march forward was a it was really eye opening for me I really liked that because it was a combination of two things that I Want to do and that's like film and history is like a classroom outside of the classroom where I was learning information about Iran do that I never learned before\nAnd there was this black history and just his family neighborhood that I don't think I Would ever learn this taking a class of ... that would be focused on that and I think it would be possible to do that\nBut I just thought it was a very interesting experience just to be able to learn about uh you know the community that I'm In and also being able to apply what I've learned being an undergrad\nStudent and you know writing research papers and learning how to look for sources goes very interesting to finally be able to look for sources for something that wasn't a fee for something that you'd put on screen\nWalter Hawkins also talked with me about worth of John high school and he's now is headed in the future\nWas just really emphasized and not just Jones' high school but also kind of emphasizes the African American community which is the key to all those because many of those for\nGrew up in the African American community and Jones is one of those votes in a wheel that was very important so that to me is how we want to see this thing go for\nThis interview was conducted as a part of every town got to confess the pod cast others

a piece of paper that will have a list of facts that he wants to check would that source and he's going through that list of the facts and in this case it's about Flynn and Kislyak\nAnd uh at that moment that he gets the first sort of indication from a highly reliable source that the White House position on this\nIs false that Flynn's claims that Pence's claims that Sean Spicer claims need to be scrutinized further that they're not honest and that's what sets in motion is sort of really\nA fervent push on our end to get to the bottom of it [noise]\nSee your your team contacts Flynn just say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions after Trump takes office and Flynn of course denied it and denied it and denied it\nYou had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision made\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter I'm so when we write stories like this you know\nBasically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public and there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have\nEverything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague Karen DeYoung who had previously scheduled interview with Flynn in his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raise this question with him one last time to tell him look post is close to publishing stories saying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats that several times no no no basically did not happen so Karen comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this\nAnd we actually hit pause on the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the sort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to theirs and we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom\nThe next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Cameron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I I I ever use the word number nine I laid I said we have nine different sources are telling us this is true and and described that sourcing to those editors\nAnd came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the efforts we had gone to to try to to nail this down I'm Marty Baron and others were were didn't hesitate you know we're going forward with this story we need to tell Mike Flynn what we're doing\nSo that's that's an option another interaction with Lynn that was amazing so we call the White House we say we have the denial we're going to use that on the record we're going forward with the story anyway we're confident our sources and then the White House blinks Flynn links\nComes back to us calls me it through a spokesman calls me and says for the first time\nI'm Mr Flynn is no longer certain that those sanctions were not discussed and that call if you can't be sure that the subject didn't come up\nAnd that was just so different from the categorical denial we had gotten I don't know sixteen hours earlier that we knew that we were we knew we were right and that's when we published\n[noise] so when Flynn was forced out of the Trump Administration\n... how did that feel if I did you feel like proud that he'd broken such a consequential story\nUm do you feel like good like truth has been out there I've driven Latino and it feels like that that wasn't really sure if it really makes things very very early in the Trump Administration\nAll the all of the above Jerry so sure absolutely proud of our of our work proud that we would have been able to accomplish something of such consequence proud that we were um\nYou know especially in this climate where the process is under a constant siege an attack that we were able to do work that still mad that that mattered in your head immediate impact all of that\nI mean not that part of it felt great um I mean for me I had I had actually known Flynn for\nFor a long time probably a decade or so had interviewed him many times I'm overseas and at the Pentagon and other positions\nAnd always liked him I took no pleasure in his ouster I'm In his his resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time it just the I yeah I mean it was\nAs a reporter there's there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\nDid you face consequences did you get traveled a lot as a result of having a mask this lie\nI mean the ... ... ... absolutely so troll the lot attacked a lot\nUm and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the ... at this really highly politically charged time where we're living through I'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCards ... actual letters in the in the mail or thanks for readers from far away places\nUm notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and I mean that was ... that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never ...\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter Brad Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and assume version of American democracy\nWe'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise] war what is it good for try science Neil DeGrasse Tyson is no hawk for America's Best known astrophysicist says many breakthroughs would not happen without military support and funding Neil DeGrasse Tyson on the dangers of this deadly Elias next on one\nAbout Russian interference before the election because the Obama administration knew about it the intelligence agencies and we're on to what was happening and the intelligence agencies strongly felt that\nRussia intended not just a mess with it but to discredit Hillary Clinton [noise]\nThere was a lot of Republican opposition to making any of this public and a lot of that opposition came from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell can you describe the ways he tried to prevent anything from going public about Russian interference\nThere's a long gap between when the U.S government through its intelligence services learns what Russia's doing and when the public finally learned about it a and there's a lot of second guessing even now about why the Obama administration didn't tell the public more or earlier\nThere are scenes in the book I write about in late August or the early August timeframe late July timeframe John Brennan who was CIA director at the time becoming increasingly concerned about what was happening the WikiLeaks dump it already occurred\nHe sort of holes himself up inside his office at CIA headquarters on the seventh floor for two straight days deep into the night each day poring over all of the agencies Russian intelligence at the end of this exercise he's just convinced that Russia and he has any sitting on new intelligence in fact the tells him\nThat the Kremlin is playing a bigger game here than anybody has to that point realized that they're not just in it to try to disrupt the election but they are trying to help elect Trump and damage Hillary Clinton and he calls the White House that week calls them in early August I Need to get in to see the president\nAfter his meeting with Obama\nThe game plan involves brand and then trying to reach out to congressional leadership [noise] this is sort of an all hands on deck moment for the U.S government they want to make sure the leadership in Congress is aware of what's happening in the election so Brennan starts calling\nYou know the Senate and house leadership to committed the leadership of the committee to relevant committees and so forth and setting up one on one briefings with these people\nAnd uh that's really unusual for CIA director to do and\nHe finds you know that the Democrats are lining up at his door that to to me and learn about what's happening Republicans are putting them off\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans until almost a month later this sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless as I you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\n'em he finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this and the book and Brennan feels like he's coming to these leaders would\nFrightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has this objective they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and try to install Donald Trump\nAnd then he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell because McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate is deeply troubled by McConnell is saying well if you basically tells them\nIf you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump\nI Will consider that interference in the election and I will and I will call the administration out on that I Will accuse the administration of trying to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader\nBeing told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to issue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering election\n[noise] you you right who had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would\nUh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia's trying to tilt the outcome of this election the Obama team felt sort of\nHandcuffed I'm now ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it but\nThe Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refuse to go along they're sort of stuck\nThey can't see a way past that it takes some months to figure out a way to get a statement out even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose [noise]\nYou know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference in this was in late September [noise]\nUm was a letter to state election officials from all four leaders of Congress warning of unnamed quote malefactor that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections and an urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is\nSecure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell given I signed on to a statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mention of of Russia it's so they are just\nStarting to look ... look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um so\nSo meanwhile John Brennan who is trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell essay Oh yes you say that public am going to say you were interfering in the election so Brennan recently lost his security\nAnd McConnell is still the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um\nI don't know if you can answer this at all but if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it and then tried to cut\nIt up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like treason [noise] um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um the tell us that we're in a different political earlier than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time\nUm where political imperatives where loyalty to party or party considerations\nSeemed to overwhelm everything else including\nThe ... concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAn election an American election for president of the United states\nWhat is more deserving of protection um and putting above all party considerations than that and yet and we see numerous cases through this period in which um when senior officials learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell is one of them\nTheir impulse is to protect the party interests to try to protect the prospect of a Trump victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's it's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] I mean we introduced you know if you're just joining us my guest is Glenn Miller he covers national security and
