novel wildlife about a teenager who's unmoored watching his parents' marriage fall apart\nAnd doesn't know who to side with\nJake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan play the parents the story reminded they know about what he experienced when his parents' marriage started to unravel\nI think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about a kid who rebels for me I remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the\nGround shake and not wanting things to tip\nAnd Kevin White had reviews a reissue of music by you know road [noise]\nAnd thinking that everybody around her thinks oh there's a woman with a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong it home and at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or a great song or whatever it is it felt like it for you in some way and that\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet you know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan\nReally close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having you know struggles and their relationships sort of what a profound and gets difficult moment that was for me so this book sort of reflected back to me\nHow family is one of the greatest loves in our life\nAnd because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nIn the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe how awkward is that ask game a teenage boy weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid who rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip\nSo Joe and I have something in common and and Richard for it and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together\nSo if something like that had been posed to me um you know I Want to said you know I'm ... you know out of here and like what you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and and then it can I help\nDid your parents separate well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated\nThey like the end of this book strangely which is on the on the film ... living together a few years ago they never got officially divorced but we did not always lived together\nYou were fourteen when your parents separated the character and wildlife is sixteen in the novel yeah but he's fourteen in the movie did you make them fourteen in the movie 'cause that was your age when your parents separated\nI met him fourteen because that's when I moved to new town as the Brunson family does in the film\nW. J. C. T. digital streaming as broad view by listeners like you if you get do you ought to W. J. C. T. digital streaming would you consider giving some value back due to W. J. C. T. dot org slash support to become a sustaining member\nAnd that's very funny it's fun to build a character and I think that you do ask yourself\nWhere's the energy in this person's body for example right\nOr their shoulders you know a little bit more back than mine and then I think the same with the voice you know you\nAsked yourself how does this person to live in the front or the back or ... as the throat yeah with the mouth or the um and I mean it's really small subtle you know stuff but at least ask the questions and maybe try to you know\nThe questions you asked is this character stay strong or did they become a week when they're being being ensure\nAnd are they injuries there are they enjoying this are they you know terrified what what's the how does that affect the screen [noise]\nUm well usually at that point you've tried to lay the groundwork so that when the moment comes it comes the way it's meant to ... or ... you know so I don't know that I Would intellectual lives like but but certainly something I'm may think about is um\nLike for example one of the country talking about as prisoners Amazon called prisoners and\nYou know that person was somebody who was would be traumatized interviews are very young age and I felt like his body was sort of frozen um you know the way that you react when you're scared your shoulders go up a little bit you know your neck gets a little tight and so then you know carrying\nThe history and cause the body holes that information your body does you know it it's holding some of your history you're emotional life and and it does for all of us and and that is a part of the voice\nYou went to a racket ate at age twenty two by one of the greatest directors of our time about how much energy than where there's things you learned from him about drafting about how to work with actors um that you try to\nUm carry through and the rest of your acting career and now in your first time directorial effort\n[noise] yeah Paul I think has a lot of love I think he loves his actors and his crew\nHe has a an incredible eye for detail\nI think it's definitely been important for me I'm having wanting to have been a filmmaker for a long time to seen directors like this go to work meaning to see them wait for the oil drip to be right even though the time and money is you know burning I remember one time or in a costume fitting\nYou know him noticing something in the stitching the tie that nobody else would have noticed you know I'm just sort of the focus to care\nAnd the integrity and it's also important when you see somebody like him I'm\nAble to enjoy their work and and have a moment of fun probably too but to absolutely loved working with him and and frankly many of the directors I've worked with I think that a common theme is really um hard work\nThat talk about your family love and mercy and this is the story of Brian Wilson most famous for for the beach boys and of course for his solo albums\nAnd I'm In this film there's two versions of Brian Wilson is the version ... he's younger getting the beach boys Iraq and then the version later in life when he's having serious mental health issues and\nListening that price to pay back on she sat\nSo I Want to pay scene from love and mercy you've been in this scene writing a guide only knows great song and you play it for your father and if your father who's played by bill camp in the movie is an abusive control freak he's various are carrying with his sons and\nI'm very hypercritical and I think everybody enough for him\nAnd say you're playing the song for him while he's sitting and looking very tense and smoking has type\nSo here's Paul day now and bill camp in a scene from Marcy\nIn mind\nI'm\nLast verse will be one more time in the chorus will harmonize over and over at the end\nSo rough I Know but it's getting their wife or cause was\nMean it'll get better than the vocal\nTo back it was for real soulful [noise]\nSo you don't want my advice for my lovely\nWill just tell me what you think it's usually\n[laughter] we're still family\nFamilies don't fire their own father\nDon't stuff that argument again argue I say something that you argue but don't say anything\nYou don't like the song I never said that I can tell\nI Would change the title\nThe country's a tuna called God only knows fifty five\nDid you close your eyes like I asked you to tell me and I think [noise] if you close your eyes\nPlace\nIt's like being blind but because you fly and you can see more don't you think it's a spiritual kind of\nI don't know what\nI close my eyes students here say\n[noise] I don't know\nMaybe it could be something with the right arrangement\nWhere you live French horn on it and flutes tambourine sleigh bells piano base real complex key shifts\nFrankly if you really want to do I don't care for it\nTo wishy washy if you leave me why leave me\nLife will go on why go on living\nIt's not like a beach voice on your brothers are going to hate it\n... it's a suicide note fish you just say it could be something with the writer arrangement well I gave in another thought okay\nIf you can't keep your voice down in my house\nSo that's my guess Latino and bill camp in a scene from love and mercy the full day notice brand will send him to a camp and his father Murray wealth and\nIt's really upsetting seen I mean God only knows it's such a beautiful song and the fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that and that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's\nVery upsetting but in any way you had to sing in a way that approximate it [laughter] you know Brian loss and you're at the piano or are you actually I Know you're doing the singing and I've seen you actually playing of course\nYeah and that's ... that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just in the same\nYou used to be in a band called moved a new guitarist and um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably have formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music for this film of mercy listening to it or is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally personally I\nLoved this music so much you know a particularly pet sounds and smile I don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you get so much light in him\nYes yeah and when he when we talked about music he still felt like a school boy about it you know and it could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by lightning sign him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself to us and I think he wanted to help people heal\nWhich is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to\nGive give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know I'm is just such a beautiful\nGenerosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's just um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad\nYou know and we found it totally I get it yeah unseen the core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those courts like you'd you know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court not Brian or a guy named area and isn't as bad um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd same with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly\nYou know learn your learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nWhat countries are coming from\nShelbyville has seen a big influx of immigrants in the last Twenty years voters like ... told me they're worried about crime\nBecause there have been people who had been hurt and killed because of illegal immigrants that have come into this country\nOther voters are worried that immigrants are taking benefits and jobs away from us citizens best Campbell is the Republican National committee woman pretend to see\nAll of a sudden he's got this huge number of illegal and our people are warning job Arab citizens for jobs and so they're going to others\nTennessee has one of the fastest growing immigrant populations in the country now immigration is a wedge issue in a closely watched race for an open Senate seat here Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn is airing TV ads attacking her democratic opponent Phil Bredesen the former governor of Tennessee\nWhere does the legal immigrants hundreds of miles and by offering the drivers or to\nIn fact the state issue drivers certificates to undocumented immigrants years ago Bredesen ended the practice after he took office and in recent years Tennessee has passed some of the toughest anti immigrant laws in the country at a recent debate in Knoxville reticent said he's a border hawk even if he doesn't agree with President Trump\nI Believe very strongly in controlling our borders but I think there are much better ways of doing it and building a wall to wall is sort of political theater\nBut Marsha Blackburn clearly sides with the president\nLet me tell you something Tennessee and want to see that wall built because open border policy should make every town a border town in every state uh borders\nBlackburn has been a longtime immigration hawk representing Tennessee in the house her critics say Blackburn and Trump are trying to exploit fears about immigrants who are no more likely to commit crimes than anyone else\nCertainly we think candidates like Trump saw what worked here in Tennessee that you can make people think innovation it's something to be feared and you can win\nStephanie ... is the co director of the Tennessee immigrant and refugee rights coalition she thinks voters need to know that immigrants have helped to fuel tendencies economic growth so her group is training volunteers from across the state on how to get out the vote\nSo every school in\nWe learned down one\nSeveral hundred volunteers gathered last weekend outside of Nashville many of them are recent immigrants can't vote but ... says they're trying to mobilize allies who think President Trump's immigration crackdown his too harsh she says they've turned out by the thousands to protest in the last two years were reminding then\nIf you were angry about family separations if you came out in March with us out when Trump signed them listen then we need you to stand with us again so don't suggest went out\nThere already this morning Greg\nFallen tears knock on doors in Antioch, Tennessee diverse working class neighborhood in southeastern Nashville are big sellers to vote for immigrants uh personally I Am ... was born in Ethiopia enjoyed his father in Tennessee when he was Thirteen\nThey're both citizens now but but she says he still has to explain the importance of voting to his father\nMany of us come from countries where human rights and our respective so votes don't matter and you know very rigged election so to many of our parents don't understand the purpose of it\nBut but she thinks his own generation the children of immigrants they get it\nThat's why I feel hopeless at our generation our younger generations are going to understand that and be the voice for parents and uh the the voice for the community that as being attacked\nSheer hopes the immigrant community can make the difference in a tight election\nIf not this year maybe next time Joel Rose NPR News Nashville okay\nWhatever you're doing out there stop for a minute because astrophysicist\nAdam Frank has some good news for you and you don't even need a telescope to see it he says no matter how crazy world me feel take heart in its molecular order\nThe good News I'm bringing you comes from the universe itself and you can find it in something as simple as a single grain of salt actually it's not a grain of table salt I Want you to focus on what the molecular structure making up that grain\nSee every salt molecule is made of exactly one atom of the elements sodium and one atom of element chlorine fat never changes and what might seem a little weird I'm here to tell you that we can take great comfort in that tiny atomic fact\nYour sea salt of your income laying solved it might have some extra additives in there like iodine and there are other compounds that scientists like to call salt but no matter what the sodium chloride molecules in your salt shaker are always hooked together in exactly the same way\nThat never changes and it's a constant see that means that every molecule salt as exactly the same properties as every other molecule salt in the entire universe\nThrough all of space and all of time off salt molecules look the same they moved the same and most importantly they behave the same\nSee at the rock bottom basement level of the universe things are not a mess instead there's a kind of angels seeing in the cloud sublime ordered that science reveal to us and every molecule of salt has a shape and a behavior that is intern perfectly specified\nThey are like beautiful cosmic a lego blocks clicking together in the most perfect way and this never ever change is the fact that all Adams everywhere across the universe display this perfect unchanging lego blocks quarter is why the reliability of chemistry is possible\nIt's why nature can start with tiny Adams and use them to build all the other things that make up the wonder of life around us\nYou know stuff like mountains in oceans slime molds and sequoia trees spiders and cocker spaniel dolphins and elephants all that wonderful and complex stuff exists because perfect simple atomic rules live at the world's smallest and most invisible levels\nSo yes humans and our conflicts can be a horrible mess but we should never forget that below all that mess has a cosmic order that far outlast our brief moment on earth\nAnd it's an order that the whole miracle that is life depends upon and to see this wander\nOlder you got to do is pass the song

[noise]\nGood evening in fact you for joining us for this all important final debate in the race for Florida governor I Want to welcome our state wide audience on television and an Florida public radio and the audience here in Bailey Hall at Broward College in Davey Florida because tonight we're going to seek answers to the issues that matter most to you\nSay let me just finish this one is the one side is why I'm here to make sure that the Koran and because the lobbyists who do you want to do that or at times but it's only in dollars or more a restaurant I Will advise you are saying is if you\nNobody can hear you unfortunately you talk over me were all out but if you talk over me nobody at home known as always we'll hear you unless you to Santa's this next question is for you that is you say because the FBI pro which you just mentioned in the corporate scandals that Henry Gillum champion trusted with running the state\nHow does that statement square up with your support of the president we have an ongoing FBI Russia pro hanging on the White House with\nRussian scandals are forced out two cabinet members because of misuse of taxpayer money we have the guilty pleas to federal crimes by the president's national security advisor in top Trump campaign officials I ask you how does one square with the other well let's just\nLet me finish my thought about what was going on here so he you have see the sixty he got the the the junk that he didn't pay foreign ... about a thousand dollars they had business before the city these lobbyists and guess what Andrew is getting things he shouldn't have gotten and then they got a two million dollar contract from the city of Tallahassee that is what corruption is when you get something you shouldn't have had\nAnd then you give something to people who are trying to influence you so that is wrong and he is not told the truth about any of that would I Would like Andrew to do is committed to Wade he's now under ethics investigation by the Florida ethics commission wave all confidentiality get all the statements and evidence out there so the voters of Florida can know\nWhether it's on the up and up so if you commit to do that then I think we can maybe put this all the bed that is what we need to do now in terms of the administration\nI was conducting oversight over people who were bad apples Peter Struck saying we're going to use an investigation to alternate election I work with FBI agents as a prosecutor not one of them would have done that they are not political they're good civil servant he abused his power and I was glad to try to bring him to justice\nOr and this was going to give thirty seconds to Mr Gillum no\nIs it possible to get a minute you as opposed to touch him of his time when he continued to use its\nPrivilege how about I cut the differences are making forty fives okay I'll\nWork within their so let's first to try to deconstruct a lot of the lies that again came from my opponent a\nNumber one uh I'm just going back up because this is a race for governor uh we had bombs delivered the homes of national leaders today are the issues that are confronting the people of this thing healthcare a accessibility\nAffordable housing paying teachers what they're worth\nAll being sucked up by the first however many minutes of this debate by ... by this gentleman who by the way I told the press that he would not release one hundred and forty five thousand dollars of public money our money\nAnd where he traveled we know he used some of that money to go to Fox News to run his campaign for governor yet he has refused to release those receipts why don't you begin setting an example and releasing overseas because I've release all\nLet's go on each of them and I I I Know that but I Know you want to talk about these other issues and we are way over on this one let's talk about health care I Know you both wanted to talk about health care this question is Andrew Gillum\nPromised to fight for Medicaid expansion you set on Sunday eight hundred thousand people you could get this coverage for them for this Republican legislators are going to fight back against that the state house rejected the idea last time the governor eventually to to\nIf you're governor\nWhat can you really delivered to the people of Florida when you say I Want to expand Medicaid to these people\nAbsolutely so we should begin by saying that the Senate under Republican troll control actually pass Medicaid expansion by a vote of thirty nine to one under Republican leadership\nUh we deserve to expand Medicaid and offer access to health care for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in our state and if we do that\nWe will pull down six billion dollars from the federal government that will go into the state's health care system so we can hire more doctors or nurses are nurse practitioners more health care workers\nThis means something to me I remember having to wait for the free dental Clinton that come through my neighborhood in order to have my teeth cleaned\nOr I Would expect that they elected representatives and the house and in the Senate would do the work of the people of this state\nSpin with the philosophical differences and go and act on that to have my opponent or in Congress voted over a dozen times to repeal the Affordable CARE Act he told a cancer patient when concerned about how they were supposed to get access to health care to go to the emergency room\nMy opponent also said that he would allow insurance companies to discriminate based off of pre existing condition\nMr Guillen fact he was sort of saying that the U.S census reports the last year to send a Thirteen percent more than one in ten Floridians don't have health insurance right now about two point five million people in the state only four states are doing worse right now\nYou\nDid vote for the American health care act that was the replacement for Obamacare\nNow\nPreexisting conditions is mentioned in that legislation however the nonpartisan congressional budget office analyzed it looked at the plan and found that that plan would end up costing people with preexisting conditions their coverage and that they wouldn't be able to afford the coverage because the premiums would rush to high that's a nonpartisan congressional budget office\nI Know you want to defend that vote was not true so\nPeople not just sort of the nonpartisan people but you also said been wrong about a lot of things so here's what we did um we wanted to bring premiums and deductibles died so many folks come to me\nAnd their deductible skyrocketed their premiums are some people paying more for premiums\nThan for rent and so people couldn't afford it some people lost access\nSo the bill mandated pre existing conditions and there were people who drop coverage and decided not to do it not people through no fault of their own\nBut there were subsidies that would have paid that off there would have been ... subsidies that would've said they would not have borne the cost and so that was a way I thought\nTo have more access to people lower premiums because if you lower the premiums more people can afford it and you'll get more people doing it it'll here's your here's the problem is that I make the voters here in Florida if for some reason something changes on that individual market protections\nUm the court does something I Will happily sign a bill to help folks with pre existing conditions here in the state of Florida\nAnd Mr saying is I I Want to give you a chance to just go back to the congressional budget office analysis\nThat they also said that eight billion dollars it was put in to an age of sixteen twenty eight would have done something it was supposed to pay for pre existing conditions that was one point six billion dollars a year for five years and the c._e._o. said that it would not cover the cost and they would still lose their present recovered\nWay more money than that there was over a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars\nIn the bill and states have done is effectively like Maine who had Obamacare style\nArchitecture prior to that on state level they use uh this this tool and they were able to directly subsidize the people who were effectively uninsured that brought rates down for everybody else but allowed access so that was way over a hundred billion dollars so I'm not sure where you're getting that but at the end of the day\nWhen we know obviously everyone on Medicare employer insurance all they've uncovered and pre existing conditions for decades we all support that I serve on the point of Oregon and we should do with it\nI should also let you know again my facts come from the congressional budget office are going on and give you you have a chance to you're not a well\nI mean it's very simple Mr Sanchez can have a a monopoly on his opinion he doesn't have a monopoly on facts facts matter [noise]\nUh and his record matters he voted repeatedly to take away health care he voted repeatedly to allow insurance companies to deny people with pre existing coverage or if you are a cancer patient\nA patient with diabetes sickle cell if you were a pregnant woman in the state of Florida Mitt citizen scientists loud but your health care to be taken from you that is a fact he can't run away from it just because he wants to be governor of the state of Florida he has to level with the people about what his congressional record\nI have to give us some sense of the thirty seconds then we're going to move on\nAnybody with pre existing conditions if that falls through the cracks in Florida will stand by you the bottom line is we have to make it more affordable for people that's what my health care plan on Rhonda Sanders dot com you can go check it out we're focusing on affordability like a laser were also focused on protecting people's existing coverage\nAndrew supports a single payer plan which will force people off Medicare\nForce people off their employer plans dumped them on a government run single payer plan that is wrong you shouldn't be able to keep the coverage that you've earned whether it's Medicare Medicare Advantage whether it's what you're getting through your insurer through your business to say they are going to go along with that is dead wrong [noise]\nGentlemen thank you expected that to go the way when it was long but I think you both were and going out to our panel is Anthony man\nMr Gillum you support a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in Florida and you support raising the state's a corporate tax rate from five point five to a about eight percent and you're saving that money\nGenerate a billion dollars to increase education funding but one of those two moves on job creation possibly close layoffs because of rising payroll costs and keep some companies are moving to Florida and you know maybe even close some businesses to leave the state\nNo and I mean we've seen this and other places are so number one let's get to the tax uh and the and the revenue flow proposal uh we're talking about my opponent has talked a lot about the fact that I Want to propose an income tax I Am against a state income tax I've never proposed a state income tax a Ninety\nSeven percent of businesses in the state of Florida don't pay any corporate tax rate at all Ninety seven percent and guess what I'm not proposing to change that either I'm Talking about the three percent of the wealthiest corporations in this state three percent a they received under the ... tax realignment which was supported by the congressman\n[noise]\n\n\n\n...\nThe Florida gubernatorial debate [noise] now here's your moderator W PBS twenty five news anchor cognitive of it\nAll right we are back if the audience who take their seats [noise]\nIt's been a lively first half hour let's get right to the next question is history you Mr Gillum their campaign website says President Trump's attacks on cities Friendly's immigrants most end and we must quote remove the immoral family separation policy you want to replace immigration and Customs Enforcement ice\nThe question is do you support sanctuary cities in the state of Florida would you refused cooperation with federal agents if more children are separated from their parents at the border\nYeah so first off are there are no sanctuary cities and the state of Florida and there's also no definition or in this state for sanctuary city um we believe that we are a nation in a state of borders or we also believe that we're a nation and the state of values\nAre where we don't separate a baby's put them in cages to separate them from their mothers\nImmigration and border control has an important job to do and we ought to empower them to do that job which is why we propose moving the agency inside of the department of justice which obviously already overseas for agencies so that they can do the job of\nEnsuring that rapists and murderers on coming into the United states makes sure that sex traffickers aren't coming into the United states are intercepted fit no that's coming in by containers are from Asia into our communities and and he got in our city streets\nAre I Believe a in borders here in the United states but I Believe that our mission has been diverted toward taking away a breast feeding babies from their mothers and that is inconsistent with the American way\nMr Guillen fact you Mr ... we've got this care about people coming to the southern border again seeking political asylum it's a big news story right now they're in Mexico your record as saying you don't approve of the family separation policy\nHow we respond as governor because the federal policy of taking kids from their parents bringing those children here to Florida to be held continues well look\nI mean I have to see what my options are but but here's what I Would say Andrew says there's no sanctuary cities in Florida and that may be true\nBut I couldn't change if he's governor I mean she will support sanctuary city he said he will not cooperate with Donald Trump's ice or in that to me it's just absolutely outrageous I mean he hates Trump's so much\nHe's political posturing that if we have a criminal illegal that serves the presidents and and there's an ice detained her on that individuals so that we can get them in federal custody and send them home\nAndrew doesn't want to he won't commit to cooperating I Will cooperate I Will get that it that criminal out of our of our state and out of our country and here's the thing why would you allow your dislike for the president to knowingly put communities at risk staff\nMothers who may have their sons or daughters harm by somebody that is just wrong we have to protect Floridians his first\nSecond ... I'll do is you're not going to be clear that was the question is usually give you more turned out to thirty seconds however Mr Guillen thirty seconds we're above\nYeah sure so again I said this before Mr ... says far too many degrees not to get hit a but yet again tonight\nHe shows that he didn't get it a ... under no circumstances would I let someone who is committed a crime in our community and our state get away with the middle of a crime they will be adjudicated through the normal judicial process and he'll fully responsible\nBut what we also said is we're not going to criminalize people on their person who would simply because you have brown skin person or you speak a language that may be able to foreign ... Santa is or you may live in a neighborhood that might include more brown people that got sent in it of itself\nA subject you to racial profile ever I sat there you can show angel and stuff that he would be promoted thank you\nVery much closer to San is thirty seconds here so he says if someone's here legally they commit a crime they should go to the justice system obviously but what he will not commit to is once they've served that sentence say you're convicted of child molestation you're here illegally you've served your sentence state prison are you going to hand them over to ice or not he will not commit to doing that\nThat means that child molester convicted gets released back on the streets after serving a sentence\nAnd guess what that child molester will re offend in someone son or daughter in Florida\nWill end up paying the price\nOf doing this is too important a claim and again it it it it it can ... with the way in which is why they give you time has run his campaign\nAnd in my opinion a first of all that would never happen if you commit a crime like that you will be deported from the United states will cooperate with absolutely cooperate with any federal order that comes down into the state and into any county because that's the law of the land but more importantly when you're running for governor the first thing you have to do it's a level honestly with the people\nYou've got ads on TV that are completely false they'd been ranked completely false\nHow can we expect you to be honest with the people at the state of Florida if not here on this stage you can be honest with them about my record or Europe where you're disqualified in my opinion from the office of guys\n[noise] Andrew\nIs the one Who Lied to the people have poured on Sunday night about accepting again from an undercover FBI\nGot luxury ... and all you the one who was with a lobbyist he's the one\nDid all that and now the documents come out they show he was lying and now he's trying to say he apologized to he's just apologizing 'cause he got caught he's not apologizing\n\nAgain if we we all have to go to ... I mean unfortunately the theatrics on full display a Mr Mrs ... San Francisco calmed down a we're not going anywhere\nUh and let's just talk about what the truth of the matter is if he wants to talk about receipt not a Hamilton ticket\nBut a hundred and forty five thousand dollars of taxpayer money why won't you release those receipts and where is the evidence of where you went and how our money was spent to be a junket for you to go to New York and hang out in full news and friends will let you answer that and\nBoth Andrew and I have received money to travel with the federal government the differences I received my money legally and through my congressional office to travel from Florida to Washington and back again for six years twice a week Andrew got travel money from the federal government because it was from an undercover FBI\nAgent who was investigating him\nRelease the receive that it's ... it's that simple my receipts are public [noise] my my receipts have been made public\nA Mr disadvantages ... unfortunately has still refused to make public\nHis receipts we're talking about a couple of hundred dollars compared to a hundred and forty five thousand two sentences pointed out that those records are available they are not available and he has refused to release them that is the fact six years worth of\nCongressional travel every single member of ... does the filming and leave I Would like to eat in LA there's a lot of big big difference I Know with all\nThis sort of saying I'm going to direct who's next question to a lot of TV in August and the first day of the general election campaign you sort of entered Dylan's run for governor quote the last thing we need to do is the monkey this up\nWhen embracing a socialist agenda Fox News quickly just about your word saying quote\nThey do not condone the language now you call some of this response absurd\nYou made appearances at for David hordes is freedom center events again four separate times four speeches among so Mr Horwitz his statements quoting here this country's only serious race war he's against whites I'll ask the question of a card game and I I'm given for the question is are okay\nHe also said if blacks are oppressed in America why isn't there a black exodus\nNow in two thousand Fifteen in your speech before the freedom center you set of Mr Horwitz David has done such a ... great work I've been into Myra ... coverage is in the past I've been a big admirer of an organization that shoot straight tells the American people the truth in standing up for the right thing those are his words here's like\nHe has been made those statements then I guess he heads for the first statement was made and how how am I supposed to know every single saving money many parents that they\nLet me just say this let me just say this ... straight up\nOr you know I live my life whether it's athletics whether it's military whether it's a serving as a prosecutor you know when I was down range in Iraq we work together as a team regardless of race we had the American flag on our arm we wore the same uniform and we fought for the country when I was a prosecutor\nVictims of every race color creed that the only way to do it in our country it's something I Believe in as governor I Will represent all the people everyone will get a fair shake but I Am not going to bow down to the altar political correctness I'm going to not let the media smear me", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "24"}
