before he did this by both the school district and law enforcement as being it's severe risk to both himself and the school and they ignored those warning signs and my\nBiggest fear is that we pass legislation or in the heat of the moment and tell everyone we've solve something when in fact we've actually left all of our children at the same amount of risk as the day before in fact maybe more risk\nBecause you're not paying attention to the issues that are really important here uh you you we've got a mental illness challenge in this this country and I've I've tried to work on it or before the Parkland issue as a delegation southwest Florida we've\nSecured funding and worked on a ... center with Lee county or you have people that get arrested that have a addiction issues they have depression issues they have mental illness issues they shouldn't go to the general population they need to get treatment they need to be diverted to or the resources that are going to help them and we've helped fund that\nAh but there's so much more we need to do in that space\nRepresented ... let me just ask you about the the the legislation itself because if you are elected as the commissioner of agriculture you would certainly be involved\nIn enforcing some of that with your thought that the ban on a long gun purchases by Floridians under the age of Twenty one which is now the state law what'd you uphold that lawful elected as a secretary commissioner even though you may have been that unconstitutional\nWell again my job is Misha would be to evaluate whether or not you deserve to get a concealed weapons permit whether you meet the qualifications or for that said permits or the other questions are actually of the commissioners to regulate but again the bigger focus I think is is\nWhat you just sitting than is as commissioner of agriculture are claiming that that portion of the law is unconstitutional\nWhile I Believe those lawsuits have already been filed and and following suit and I'm certainly going to respect\nTheir outcome that there are certainly a no shortage of differences of opinion on any kind of issues that deal with constitutionality I I think it's really just incumbent or on those of us who are asked to answer a question to say what we truly in engineering to leave and then you have to\nMove forward based on that but again the the real issue is is focusing on uh the at risk youth that we have in our school systems are that are really a or a danger to themselves and to the student body and\nWe're being ignored in this example and I'm worried are going to be ignored and not just Broward County but throughout the state because we're not\nFocusing on the actual issue at hand\nAnd right now if you're just tuning in on the floor to round up we're speaking with state representative ... called well the Republican candidate for agriculture commissioner you can follow the conversation on line on Twitter at Florida round up\nNow represent of how well you talked a lot about the plight of citrus farmers in the state we always think of Florida as having the three ... of the economy here a tourism\nGrows and agriculture the agriculture sector has had a hard time in some respects recently a lean production years because there's been competition from Mexico hurricanes greening diseases of the citrus crop\nUh what's your proposal for a I guess shoring up the sector of the economy and making it more robust how would you approach that part of the job\nYou know the or the department of agriculture really has two big roles that it can play or not just in citrus but an all agriculture commodities and the\nFirst site is is advocating supporting the funding at University of Florida and the Institute of food and agricultural science you'll see called ISIS that's the research arm of the university that's constantly looking for ways to solve disease issues like citrus greening up but also to be researching a new crop varieties are they've got\nA current trial on hops for example and trying to take advantage of the growth in the craft beer industry are also a help this last year a secure a trial an industrial hemp are both fame you Andrew F or\nExploring that different crop varieties so an alternative if someone doesn't believe they want to stay in whatever whether it's ... or anything else that doesn't seem like that's the direction they want to go\nOff in an alternative or the other goal is to continue to be engaged or near the greater and greater uh regard in trade ah we've got great a bilateral\nRelationships with South American Central American countries European countries\nWere constantly looking for new ways to open up markets for our products again being a state that doesn't have just you know corn and soybeans and pigs but instead we have three hundred plus commodities or you know tropical fruits and vegetables and as you pointed out the citrus industry we grow rice radishes\nA wintertime vegetables tomatoes are plants rather just really an amazing\nYeah it's a rainbow and a lot more than people realize yeah don't produce section\nThat has to act like we're we're constantly looking for new trade opportunities uh and and elevating uh those those chances internationally but then also\nA having a state this growing by a thousand people a day are also looking within the state we really have two different sectors in the market in in Florida you got large commodity producers and that they're going to get bigger\nTo compete in the global scale but we've got these great opportunities with very vocally relevant or you know selling within a hundred mile radius of operations that are are really booming right now\nRepresentative just about a minute and a half left I got to ask about the do not call list uh it it is a ... under the saddle for a lot of Floridians ah would you uh a pledge to a boost enforcement of the day not call list if elected\nWithout question uh that people need to be prosecuted or I Would have to remind people encourage them to make sure they report and in fact\nI was talking to somebody the other day and it struck me a we ought to actually look to develop an app where if you get a call most people get solicited on their phones their cell phones nowadays immediately be able to Texas Department and report the phone number or because otherwise if you don't report it's very possible\nWhy isn't it being enforced if the laws on the books why isn't it being enforced\n... I think it is I think you just like every con artist or they're constantly looking for ways to outrun the law and or whether we're talking about do not call scams with her talking about ... the gas pumps or the\nOther major threat right now the hackers breaking into the backside of major retailers target Wal Mart et cetera and stealing our credit card info or as the law enforcement side you've got to constantly be up to speed track them down wherever they're headed\nRepresentative we've got to leave it there but thank you so much for your time we appreciate your conversation here on the floor to round up as a representative Matt called well the Republican candidate for the commissioner of agriculture and consumer services in the state of Florida math thanks so much for your time absolutely\nToo interesting candidates get out and vote everybody that's our show the Florida roundup produced by W.

I mean anything just you know refusing to let me borrow the car that night or something I mean you know I um\nYeah I mean I definitely spent a lot of time being really really angry with both my parents you know with everybody I mean part of that I think was was just a you know another aspect of or another I'm part of denial or or whatever and and not wanting to take responsibility for my actions and things yeah\n[noise] there were times when you went to rehab willingly in times when you went against your will is that correct\nYes absolutely did it make a difference to the outcome whether you went there willingly or whether you went there against your will\nUm ... no not really I mean you know each rehab that I went to I feel like really helped me a lot and I learned more and more about myself and I learned more and more about you know this disease and and you know what it takes to stay sober and how to sort of learn how to take care of yourself and love yourself and everything\nI mean each time that I relapsed after going the treatment I don't think that that meant that those treatment centers bailed me or anything or that it just was that I Would just wasn't ready you know\nThis last treatment center I went to I was absolutely did not want to go you know this is to to a little over two years ago and I was basically coerced into treatment and you know once I got there I didn't want to stay there\nAnd it's not fun you know I mean you're being told what to do every second of the day and you know you have to sleep and room with three other people and so it's not like I mean if I could do if I could have done it without having to go to rehab I definitely would have preferred to do that as expensive too you know it's it's it's hard you know for sure\nYou know a lot of people say that if you're in ... you're not gonna\nYou're not really going to be ready\nTo stop until you've bottomed out you seem to hit bottom like a whole bunch of times one of which was when you're on guard so badly infected from shooting up that um when you went to the when you finally went to the emergency room the doctor thought he might need to amputate your arm on\nSomebody when the surgeon wouldn't eat and you take your arm yeah um so how how come incidents like that weren't enough to get you to think well I'd better stop I'm killing myself\nUm well I guess I'm a part of it I again is that I think that killing myself was okay with me you know I mean I sort of knew that that was what I was doing and and I was sort of resigned\nTo that and also you know I I guess there's a point where you feel like you've gone so far\nDown that building your life back after you know having let everyone down again and having you know disappointed people and and you know overdrawn your bank account and lost her cell phone and lost her job and you know lost your car and\nI mean it just feels like ... at certain points like just start over and to try to rebuild my whole life to get it it's just too much and so you know I might as well just ride this out till the end and just you know see it through until yeah until I'd I'd die you know and\nBut um but there was I mean there was something inside of me that I guess I Believe that maybe things could get better somehow even against all you know rationale or whatever and that little bit of hope you know as well as what I was able to to hold onto and and um\nYou know it's gotten me here thank God so\nWe're listening to an interview with Nick Schiffman whose father David Sheff recorded in two thousand date\nNick shift memoir about who struggled with addiction is called tweak growing up on methamphetamines David chefs memoir about his son's addiction is called beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie based on both memoirs we'll hear more of this conversation after a break this is fresh air\nIn ancient Greece everyone went to the theater it was something that was mandatory for everyone regardless of their income regardless of their education find out why Shakespeare as big an East Africa\nAt one point to shake stay with being performed more in Mumbai southern in London's West End\nIn here with cool about music festival in Iceland\nEvery time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and the next\nTravel with Rick Steves Saturday morning at seven on eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. [noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back to ... interview with David shift and his son Nick chef they both written memoirs about coping with Nick's addiction to methamphetamines memoirs which was the basis of the new film beautiful boy starring Steve Carell\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was the quote God talk you know in the alcoholics anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how you you you were or are still are an an atheist and raise net without religion um did\nYou have to I too felt guilty when you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be with a higher power and things like that it was like I Would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately I learned and I think he learned that you could not\nDeny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know Nick didn't agree for a long time it's just that he that he was powerless over his addiction he felt he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in Tulsa programs and undercover I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lot of time trying so hard\nAnd I've seen brain scans are there's so much research now that shows that people with addiction process drugs differently\nOr their neurological system is different a different part of the brain is in control you know we think about addiction as it morally reprehensible choice but uh addicts act crazy because in a way that they are\nSo you know you're right in the book that I'm going through detox is just the first step you know after you've given up the drug\nAnd you've come out the other end you still need treatment and maybe not just you know toss step kind of program maybe you really need psychiatric treatment and medication to help you through whatever the problem was that ... to your addiction and the first place\nThere was this really dangerous idea for so long that all someone had to do with goes off drugs they had to detox you know they have to go through cold turkey and they would wake up in the morning and they'd Be Sober\nBeing sober is just the first step cutting off drugs is just the first step and then treatment really begins if someone has psychological disorders most often they haven't been diagnosed whether they have or haven't they need to be treated\nIf someone is struggling in some other ways in their life they need help\nYou write that young people are more susceptible to addiction and an addiction is especially dangerous for young people and this all has to do with the development of their brain the part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex is still developing\nWhen you're young to talk about the importance of that part of the brain in any impressions development and and then in addiction\nWhat kids are the most vulnerable to becoming addicted you know it's a really stressful time and their lives I mean we've had being an adolescent is really hard but they're also is this underlying\nTeenagers' brains are developing more rapidly than at any other time in their life\nBut all the um parts of the brain don't develop at the same time the final part of the brain which is associated with judgment in rational thinking is lagging a so it's not in control and meanwhile the first part of the brain to develop\nIs the rare portion which is associated with pleasure sinking seeking an impulsiveness so it's in control we always think about teenagers being impulsive you know they want to experiment they have all kinds of crazy reckless behavior a lot of it is because of that their brain hasn't developed to the point\nWhere they can moderate these impulses\nSo it's much more likely that kids are going to use drugs and they're more likely to use them excessively\nSo the development is even slower the part of the brain that normally would regulate would help kids make better decisions isn't in control so they start using more and there's this cycle\nAnd that's where addiction comes from a Ninety percent of the people who become addicted started using when they were teenagers before they were Eighteen [noise]\nA lot of memoirs written by people who had been addict start within hitting bottom\nYou know the the absolutely worst imagine little thing that happened to them because of their addiction\nAnd then they hit bottom and then they go into rehab and seek treatment and then things start to turn around and then the the two book kind of begins and so many stories just like addicts stories that are you know are told you know start again with like hitting bottom and\nI think a lot of people assume that if you love somebody who is addicted to a substance\nThat until they hit bottom and until they really realize that their life is at stake that their dignity is at stake that there's there's no way they're going to give up\nYou know the drug or alcohol and you make a point in the book that that's not necessarily true that if you love somebody who is an addict you don't need to wait until they hit bottom you can intervene and perhaps intervene effectively\nIf you love someone who's an addict and their use is life threatening you don't wait until they hit bottom because that can mean that they're going to die you have to do everything you can to get them in treatment and\nNow we know that it's too dangerous to wait for a person to hit bottom I mean people were told that they had to let their kids their husbands or wives whoever it was they had to stand back not to intervene let them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment center and say please help me\nThat idea it's so dangerous that has killed so many people\nThe other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease which means that as long as it's not being treated it gets worse addiction as a disease like anything else it's like cancer like heart disease like diabetes and we know\nYou know at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment\nIf someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases we would bring them to a doctor to figure out what is going on we would not wait until the disease progressed so we want to intervene in the second we get a sense that there is a problem\nBut you know with addiction and this is different from cancer a person has to\nBe willing to change to stop using and um I mean you can lock them up in an environment where they can't get drugs you or you know whether that's prison or ... or you know put them in rehab where there's not going to be any drugs but when they get out\nYou know unless there's constant surveillance they still have to make that decision to to not use 'em\nLet let me give me an example of a story that you've told about your son um when he was addicted that he would call you you know from the street and say you have to pick me up I think I'm dying you have to come get me and take me home and you you didn't want to do that 'cause\nYou've been burned before you take them home and he would he'd steal from you he would do things that would be dangerous for your younger children to observe [noise]\nUm so you finally said to him no\nI'll pick you up and I'll take you to rehab\nAnd your son said no I don't want to go to rehab doesn't work for me you need to take me home and you said\nCall back when you're ready to go to rehab and you hung up so if you had to do that over again would you think that that was the right way of handling it\nNo I tried to do so many times to get him into treatment and I would do anything it took I Would drag him off the streets I searched for him when I could find him you know I I\nI just did whatever it took to get him into treatment and it hadn't worked every time he would go\nThe treatment he would do fine for a while and then he would relapse so my assumption was that relapse proved that the treatment hadn't worked but I now know is that many times not always but many times relapse as a part of this disease\nSo addicts get sober a it's a chronic illness the craving doesn't go away unless it's being treated and relapses common\nThat means that even though Nick was resistant to going back into treatment\nEvery time I had to do whatever I could to get them into treatment and when they called up begging me to go back telling me that he was going to die\nSo many times I had succumbed I mean all I wanted to do with never mind to to to get him help but I just wanted to see him to see that he was alive\nBut I finally listen to the messages of these rehab programs that talk about this tough love thing and that he had to hit bottom and I hung up the phone\nAnd I wept was artist thing I'd ever done and\nHe did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story you basically had two options and I can think of one is to say well if I'm not driving you rehab I'm not picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take it home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking home it alone you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nIt's an ... you should have chosen the other option is which would have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but if I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous\nI mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose in died\nIf I got him home at least they would have been off the streets and I may have been able to get him back and treatment and I would have done everything I could to get him back the way I feel now yeah you want to get your kid off the streets it's too dangerous out there\nWere listening to an interview with journalist David Sheff to re grow spoke with him in two thousand Thirteen about his book clean which focuses on research into addiction and recovery we'll hear more after a break this is fresh air [noise]\nNext time on asked me another we're joined by actor Nick curl from the krill show Broadway oh how low and Netflix animated series big mouth and will play a game called best of the fast where contestants will have to guess real festivals from one we just made up\nThe portion of the coast or where they lived has been eroding much more rapidly there those wetlands have been disappearing and you know the people there are now live literally along the road a hit on both sides of the road there were there's water\nSo the state and the federal government made the decision that a levee system that's being built in that same area would not go\nFar far enough south to protect that community because they just weren't enough people living down there to make it financially peaceable\nTell me a little bit more about the process of getting residents of elders on trials on board with this relocation the\nState has been able to get a federal grant and gotten agreement finally from the vast majority of people who live down there and they'll create a new village for them to live and further away from the potential for flooding we're talking about people who make their living off of fishing\nBut we're also talking about a a large elderly population as well and just don't want to leave they don't want to leave their their culture they don't want to leave their um their graveyards and and you know the location that they're going to is you know twenty thirty forty miles away\nSo between the coastal restoration projects and the upgrades to the levee system what's your thought now on how prepared\nCoastal Louisiana in New Orleans are for the next big hurricane\nIn the New Orleans area we have a brand new levee system that was built\nA after Katrina two new standards what kinds of hurricanes can occur in the Gulf of Mexico taking into account climate change into potential that over time a hurricane's will become more intense so that's that's for inside the levee system\nBut there are lots of areas that are outside the levee system and I'm Sorry I'll hope it's rough on them\nOn the spectrum of\nPreparedness for sea level rise and having experience in dealing with the rising sea and the accompanying threats where it is Miami fall\nNew Orleans is protected ... at least for the Next Fifty years and we've been working on a heck of a lot longer than by me has when New Orleans was built\nA B ... decided to place the city of the crescent though this other than the Mississippi River because it was um the closest place that was defensible\nAt that time it was defensible against the Spanish and English Today is the closest place is defensible against storm surge and it's in one\nWell at least it is today but\nMiami wasn't built that way flag were built a railroad all the way down to Miami and and\nYou know did it as a way to get people who live there and and make money off of it and the Miami Beach during the wetlands in front of Miami Beach there are there long gone you know you don't have many ... flood walls or levees protecting\nI mean we have a few the laws but not nothing like the levee system that New Orleans had 'cause it just wouldn't be affected with\nSand and and and clay water doesn't have the ability of coming through that's not a place that water is coming in you know the reality is that you know our nation is going to have to look at our coastal

I mean anything just you know refusing to let me borrow the car that night or something I mean you know I um\nYeah I mean I definitely spend a lot of time being really really angry with both my parents you know with everybody I mean and part of that I think was was just a you know another aspect of or another I'm part of denial or or whatever and and not wanting to\nTake responsibility for my actions and things yeah\n[noise] there were times when you went to rehab willingly in times when you went against your will is that correct\nYes absolutely did it make a difference to the outcome whether you went there willingly or whether you went there against your will\nUm ... no not really I mean you know each rehab that I went to I feel like really helped me a lot and I learned more and more about myself and I learned more and more about you know this disease and and\nYou know what it takes to stay sober and how to sort of learn how to take care of yourself and love yourself and everything I mean each time that I relapsed after going the treatment I don't think that that meant that those treatment centers bailed me or anything or that it just was that I just wasn't ready you know\nThis last treatment center I went to I was absolutely did not want to go you know this is to to a little over two years ago and I was basically coerced into treatment and you know once I got there I didn't want to stay there and it's not fun you know I mean you're being told what to do every second of the day and\nYou know you have to sleep and room with three other people and so it's not like I mean if I could do if I could have done it without having to go to rehab I definitely would have preferred to do that as expensive too you know it's it's it's hard you know for sure\nYou know a lot of people say that if you're in ... you're not gonna\nYou're not really going to be ready to stop until your bottom doubt you seem to hit bottom like a whole bunch of times one of which was when you're on guard so badly infected\nFrom shooting up that um when you went to the when you finally went to the emergency room the doctor thought he might need to amputate your arm\nSomebody when the surgeon wouldn't eat and pay your arm yeah um so how how come incidents like that weren't enough to get you to think well I better stop I'm killing myself\nUm well I guess I'm a part of it I again is that I think that killing myself was okay with me you know I mean I I sort of knew that that was what I was doing and and I I was sort of resigned\nTo that and also you know I guess there's a point where you feel like you've gone so far\nDown that building your life back after you know having let everyone down again and having you know disappointed people and and you know overdrawn your bank account and lost her cell phone and lost her job and you know lost her car and\nI mean it just feels like at certain points like just start over and to try to rebuild my whole life again it's just too much and so you know I might as well just ride this out till the end and just see it through until yeah until I'd I'd die you know and\nBut um but there was I mean there was something inside of me that I guess I Believe that maybe things to get better somehow even against all you know rationale or whatever and that little bit of hope you know as well as what I was able to to hold onto and and um\nThat's gotten me here thank God so\nWe're listening to an interview with Nick chef Mendez father David Sheff recorded in two thousand date\nNick shift memoir about who struggled with addiction is called tweak growing up on methamphetamines David chefs memoir about his son's addiction is called beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie based on both memoirs we'll hear more of this conversation after a break this is fresh air\nSenator Elizabeth Warren got in trouble for saying she had Native American ancestry this week she said she had taken a DNA test to prove it and got in more trouble the lesson never say anything ever to anyone\nBeat her cycle will completely ignore that rule as we talked the author John Grisham without all kinds of mysteries we cannot figure out join us for the news with us from NPR's Saturday morning at ten on eighty nine nine W. J. C. T.\nThis is fresh air let's get back to ... interview with David shift in his son Nick chef\nThey both written memoirs about coping with Nick's addiction to methamphetamines memoirs which was the basis of a new film beautiful boy starring Steve ...\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was the quote God top you know in the ... anonymous model you look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe\nIn your memoir how you you you were or are still\nAre in an atheist and raise Nick without religion um did\nI too I too felt guilty when you're asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was as I Would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately I learned and I think he learned that you could not\nBy some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know Nick didn't agree for a long time it's just that that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in Tulsa programs and undercover I think it is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lot of time you know trying so hard\nBut then the more I learned I mean ten kids would go out after school smell smoke pot or the party on the Friday nights I'll I'll drink and one of those possibly two of those will become addicted so there's something different about that person or something like a different about the brain\nAnd I've seen brain scans are there's so much research now that shows that people with addiction process drugs differently\nOr their neurological system is different a different part of the brain is in control you know we think about addiction as a morally reprehensible choice but uh addicts act crazy because in a way that they are\nSo you know you're right in the book that I'm going through detox is just the first step you know after you've given up the drug can you've come out the other end you still need treatment\nAnd maybe not just you know a two step kind of program maybe you really need psychiatric treatment and medication to help you through\nWhatever the problem was that ... to your addiction and the first place\nThere was a really dangerous idea for so long that all someone had to do with goes off drugs they had to do talks you know they have to go through cold turkey and they would wake up in the morning and they'd Be Sober\nBeing sober is just the first step getting off drugs is just the first step and then treatment really begins if someone has psychological disorders most often they haven't been diagnosed whether they have or haven't they need to be treated if someone is struggling and some other ways and their life they\nNeed help you write that young people are more susceptible to addiction and an addiction is especially dangerous for young people and this all has to do with the development of their brain the part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex is still developing\nWhen you're young to talk about the importance of that part of the brain in any I'm persons development and and then in addiction\nWhat kids are the most vulnerable to becoming addicted you know it's a really stressful time and their lives I mean we've you know being an adolescent is really hard but they're also is this underlying\nTeenagers' brains are developing more rapidly than at any other time in their life\nBut all the um parts of the brain don't develop at the same time the final part of the brain which is associated with judgment and rational thinking is lagging a so it's not in control and meanwhile the first part of the brain to develop\nIs the rare portion which is associated with pleasure sinking seeking an impulsiveness so it's in control we always think about teenagers being impulsive you know they want to experiment they have all kinds of crazy reckless behavior a lot of it is because of that their brain hasn't developed to the point\nWhere they can moderate these impulses\nSo it's much more likely that kids are going to use drugs and they're more likely to use them excessively\nSo the development is even slower the part of the brain that normally would regulate would help kids make better decisions isn't in control so they start using more and there's this cycle\nAnd that's where addiction comes from a Ninety percent of the people who become addicted started using when they were teenagers before they were Eighteen [noise]\nA lot of memoirs written by people who had been addict start within hitting bottom\n... you know the the absolutely worst imaginable thing that happened to them because of their addiction\nAnd then they hit bottom and then they go into rehab and they seek treatment and then things start to turn around and then the the two book kind of begins and so many stories just like addicts stories that are you know are told you know start again with like hitting bottom and\nI think a lot of people assume that if you love somebody who is addicted to a substance that until they hit bottom and until they really realize that their life is at stake that their dignity is at stake that there's there's no way they're going to give up\nYou know the drug or alcohol and you make a point in the book that that's not necessarily true that if you love somebody who's an addict you don't need to wait till they hit bottom you can intervene and perhaps intervene effectively\nIf you love someone who's an addict and their use is life threatening you don't wait until they hit bottom because that can mean that they're going to die you have to do everything you can get them in treatment\nAnd now we know that it's too dangerous to wait for a person to hit bottom I mean people were told that they had to let their kids have their husbands or wives whoever it was they had to stand back not to intervene let them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment center and say please help me\nThat idea it's so dangerous that has killed so many people\nThe other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease which means that as long as it's not being treated it gets worse addiction as a disease like anything else it's like cancer like heart disease like diabetes and we know\nYou know at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment\nIf someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases we would bring them to a doctor to figure out what is going on we would not wait until the disease progressed so we want to intervene in the second we get a sense that there is a problem\nBut you know with addiction and this is different from cancer a person has to be willing to change to stop using and um\nI mean you can lock them up in an environment where they can't get drugs you or you know whether that's prison or ... or you know put them in rehab where there is not going to be any drugs\nBut when they get out you know unless there's constant surveillance they still have to make that decision to to not use 'em\nLet let me give me an example of a story that you've told about your son um when he was addicted that he would call you you know from the street and say you have to pick me up I think I'm dying you have to come get me and take me home\nYou you didn't want to do that 'cause you've been burned before you take them home and he would he'd steal from you he would do things that would be dangerous for your younger children to observe [noise] um so you finally said to\nAnd no I'll pick you up and I'll take you to rehab and you send said no I don't want to go to rehab doesn't work for me you need to take me home and you said call back when you're ready to go to rehab and you hung up so if you had to do that over again would you think that that was the right way of handling\nNo I'd try though so many times to get him into treatment and I would do anything it took I Would drag him off the streets I searched for him when I could find him you know I I\nI just did whatever it took to get him into treatment and it hadn't worked every time he\nWould go into treatment he would do fine for a while and then he would relapse so my assumption was that relapse proved that the treatment hadn't worked but I now know is that many times not always but many times relapse as a part of this disease\nSo addicts get sober a it's a chronic illness the craving doesn't go away unless it's being treated and relapses common\nThat means that even though Nick was resistant going back into treatment\nEvery time I had to do whatever I could to get into treatment and when they called up begging me to go back telling me that he was going to die\nSo many times I I had succumbed I mean all I wanted to do with never mind to to to get him help but I just wanted to see him to see that he was alive\nBut I finally listened to the messages of these rehab programs that talk about this tough love thing and that he had to hit bottom and I hung up the phone and I kept\nThose artist thing I'd ever done and\nHe did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story\nHe basically had two options that I can think of one is to say well if I'm not driving need rehab I'm picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take it home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking home it alone you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to we had a few days later\nThan ... think you should have chosen the other option is which it would have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but\nIf I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose in died\nIf I got him home at least it would have been off the streets and I may have been able to get him back in treatment and I would have done everything I could to get him back the way I feel now yeah you want to get your kid off the streets it's too dangerous out there\nWere listening to an interview with journalist David Sheff to re grow spoke with him in two thousand Thirteen about his book clean which focuses on
