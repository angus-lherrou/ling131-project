{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Because I've been doing it for so long I don't really stress about it anymore it's you know it's fun and I kind of look at it like okay it's almost a challenge and they throw these challenges at us because they know we can handle it so I look at it as a challenge but it's but it's but it's a it's a blast thrilling\nYou ever screwed up of course what's worse screw up [noise]\nWell a few years back we got some changes\nUm right before the show is going to START I actually made the changes and\nFor some reason they gave us they gave us three two pages of changes and it was page just I'm just gonna make them pay just pay Seventeen and page Nineteen there was no page Eighteen and then my quick to do that I didn't see a page Eighteen so I cut out\nThe entire page Eighteen which wasn't cut that was supposed to be in the sketch and it was the cold open and it was J Farrell was supposed to be saying live from New York\nI called up and you mean the the part the very beginning of Saturday Night live before the credits for\nThe most important sketch that you learn in the show the producers want the cold over to the mall or to go great because there was the first two things that the most viewers will watch so those are the things that you want to go smooth and then the rest of the show if there's a bump visible so yeah I cut out Jay Farah who is supposed to say live from New York\nHe wasn't even on the set because I had kind of monitor the sketch well uh it was a pretty big screw up it was I Would be\nYeah he was they were all mad they're off her over but again you know that was probably the worst mistake in and I got to say like twenty seven years we we ... we maybe we'll miss a a word here are lying there but um or drop a card or not drop a car but made our current sticks to another card little things like\nThat but that was a big mistake and yeah they they weren't they weren't quite upset but you know what it's it's live t._v. and stuff happens you know\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day so we go back to your hypothetical contract with me for my new late night show right if something like that happened once let alone\nTwice the next day we in our production meeting I'd be sitting with my executive producer going maybe we should buy teleprompter is maybe this whole human error element for a show like ours is just something that we can live\nWithout well I mean if you're if you're a live show than you know those prompt or is it going to go down to ... go down all the time so I think prompt or is it going to screw up more than the human element was corrupt especially if you're if you're just a regular talk show\nAnd you're doing you know you're doing a daily talk show I've been doing Seth Meyers for the last three years and I don't think we've had a major mistake\nYou know in three and three years because it's because compared to Saturday Night live is such a more relaxed show and it's a taped show so if there is a mistake we can go back and if we can do it again if if they need to what\nAbout the physical aspect of being a cue card holder I mean it occurs to me that you are a cue card holder you're not just putting them on like a music stand and flipping them know you must get tired holding those cards especially for a Ninety minutes show like Saturday Night live\nAre correct you're you're very correct um yeah I've been I'm I'm fifty fifty two and three weeks\nI started when I was twenty five I'm my body is slowly breaking down yes I had in the past I think probably eight years I've had ten tonight is in my left elbow that I had ten and I just am I right elbow I had um physical therapy done on both of those physical therapy done in my left shoulder physics\nAnd then I had some back issues a couple of years back that I have physical therapy on also right now I'm all good so you know knock on wood\nOne more thing I have to ask you about before we let you go to the fact that you did the cue cards for The Apprentice that is correct and we all know who the star of The Apprentice wise\nThat is also correct that was that like\nA well I consider myself Donald Trump's personal cute guy I Am the only one as the cue cards for him in the last since The Apprentice but that was started in two thousand four\nAnd actually when I started my company two thousand four he was my very first client here's my first in voice that I that I set out to a Donald Trump for The Apprentice\nUm he's been very very nice to me over the last Thirteen Years um he he relied on me and I you know I I took care of him on a Saturday Night live you can kind of random rarely through the ringer the first time we met on Saturday Night live in two thousand four but that happens quite often when people are stars are nervous\nSometimes they'll take it out on me which is fine as part of my job and is what I Do and I think you know I took it well that ever since then anytime he's using your needs cards he'll have the company called he's if he's doing a commercial\nI'll get a phone call and say we need to hire you for commercial and I was like who's the talent in the middle like their their hesitate there like\nA Donald Trump but I was like oh did he tell you that I can charge whatever I Want and they're like they're like yes he did but please don't go don't go to Rob as we don't have a big ... [laughter]\nSo he's been very nice to be like that I use is match tickets several times you know he's he's got a good man to be I Can't say that I agree with everything he's doing in politics right now but as a cue card relationship he was very good to me\nPresident Trump is kind of known these days for going off script a great deal when he's reading a statement or or the opening a press conference how was he as an on air talents on The Apprentice did he stick to the scripts\nUm we we had a ... it was weird it was kind of thing it's like you know we had stuff on cue cards and um\nYeah he would sometimes go off a little bit but he would go he would I Would know where where he was going to come back to if he did that um and it was funny because the producers all looked to me because he just would just sometimes rather deal with me than the writers and stuff\nSo he would always be giving me changes and tell me what to put down an asking what I thought about it and it was kind of an interesting thing but yeah no he would go off sometimes but he'd go right back to it I think about the teleprompter operator that's that's working with him now because I'm like man that guy must have it rough because he does go off script then\nYou know you hope he picks up push push to pick up with you know from\nWiley Ferris than is the owner of NYC cars while he thinks we're talking to Russia affects family appreciate this program comes to you from W.

rethinking sex power and consent on campus when she was in college in the nineties woman told to protect themselves by carrying mace and learning self defense today many women on campus are saying no it's not\nHit you on bullies you have to change its ... into tuitions that\nAlso can tackle reviews in early recording by hazel Dickens and Alice Gerard\nWrote a feminist perspective to blue grass and Justin Chang reviews first man\nThey've found a lot of the Trump presidency to be and there were triggering this is certainly part of it um to watch a woman be just a cost to the side just waved away when she went to the Senate I think that that\nIs your personal worst nightmare ... that I Would sit there\nAnd be publicly humiliated um\nBut there's so much shame that a lot of survivors carry about what happened to them and this historic moment that we're in is about\nRaising the demons casting off the ... and you know it's a real like ... for them so to have it be so publicly the punch clock turned that has been extremely upsetting\n[noise] so um there's been two times when the Judiciary Committee and then all of Congress have had to vote about whether the woman who accused them in a federal harassment or assault was lying or telling the truth\nAnd if there's enough evidence to prevent\nThe Supreme Court nominee from becoming confirmed so there isn't the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas case and other blogs before Brett Kavanaugh case and in both cases judiciary and Congress voted for the men and against the woman making the accusations\nLet's look at how colleges handle accusations you write about how colleges have developed their own system of helping to bring some kind of justice\nWhen accusations when women come forward to accuse\nI'm a fellow student of sexual assault or rape they're not courts per se but they are some forms of proceedings can you give us a couple of examples of colleges that are doing this and how they do it like what their procedures\nAre well all colleges have to be doing it that's the rule you got to have a title nine office and the title nine of us have to take any claims of sexual assault or misconduct or\nGroping or violent rape very seriously and they have been since two thousand eleven when Obama kind of lay down the law and said I Want all of you to um pursue this I Want girls to have an equal access to education and they can't if they're\nYou know dealing with trauma from a sexual assault and that's totally true in great um\nSince then as many people know universities have had a hard time putting these courts together Obama's guidance was good but he almost didn't hold them enough about what they should do\nYou know what do the records look like who should sit on the court he did say that he like everybody to use a\nStandard of the preponderance of evidence so it's more likely than not that the act occurred um\nIt's so hard to prove so many of these cases that I think a lower standard is appropriate here also many attorneys do not agree with that um\nSo what what are these proceedings alone [noise]\nDid they bring people in who will support their point of view is there an investigation hundreds or ...\nYou know the number one thing to understand is that across the country all of these courts are different ... different according to whether the university wants to take this super seriously or not and if the university has the funds to take it seriously\nI'm so real investigations are happening for short now universities don't have subpoena power so whichever students are going to talk to them\nThey'll send a letter to the accused and say you are being brought up\nOn this they'll you know say okay well we're going to probably have our case and a couple of months so get everything ready and you know there is no real system to help the accused him a lot of cases and the boys\nRarely call their parents right there on their own they're at school they're afraid they ask somebody's you know older brother who sets them up with some attorney who may or may not have an idea of how to actually help this boy then there'll\nBe some sort of proceeding and you might have a fisheries professor who is the person who's going to judge her case where you might have actually a a former prosecutor it's completely random who is going to decide your fate\nPart of the reason why these college systems have developed to\nDeal with charges of sexual assault as President Obama sent out basically a a letter of guidance right or was it wasn't a law but it was a letter of guidance about how colleges should go about trying to handle accusations of sexual assault and this was built on\nTitle nine and so explain what title nine is which was passed\nAs a small part of a of a larger piece of legislation\nAnd signed by President Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nSo title nine is just a short law that nobody in a university should be discriminated against on the basis of gender and I knew it in the nineties as a law that would protect Women's Sports which of course it doesn't and this argument about whether\nTitle nine should cover sexual assault has been going on for many years\nPresident Trump's secretary of education Betsy divorce is changing the guidelines for sexual assault on campus and tell us about the changes that she's making or is on the verge of making that need to focus has been very\nConcerned about the due process in a campus courts\nShe has also made it fairly clear that she is aligned with Trump in believing that this is a scarier time for boys so she is quite concerned about the accused students and thinks that\nYou know I mean you just had to her deputy set it to the New York times you know Ninety percent of the cases that they're seeing 'em involve just regret it sucks\nTo devise is concerned about due process rights she's concerned about false accusations um\nShe's also concerned that Obama imposed these mandates by the at even though they were guidance he really did have the office for civil rights try to go to universities and\nSay open up your books I Want to see how you've been deciding the sexual assault cases and I'm here now and this is serious so she's really backed off of\nUm sending the OC are out but for the students really the most important thing is that she may change the definition of sexual assault\nWhich had previously been something kind of vague about unwelcome contract and you know various colleges hadn't interpreted what sexual assault was on their own\nNow she's interested in saying okay well what would count it needs to be something that is his ear and pervasive\nEnough to deprive a student of education so what would happen if it was a one off sexual assault like lousy for described applying for a close eye hand on a mouse um quote unquote and nothing happened even though she er she is thinking about ... years later\nWhen he was afraid she'd be smothered to death\nShe was afraid that she was going to be killed unintentionally unintentionally mother to yeah\nAnd she was prevented from leaving 'em so it's best to devise trying to say title nine which mandates against gender discrimination on campus needs to be applied to discrimination against men because so many men are being wrongfully accused as that her case that is exactly what you're saying yeah\nShe's interested in this idea of gender discrimination claims both ways\nSo um have her guidelines taken effect yet\nNo they haven't they were leaked to the New York times on there will be a notice from comment period a you know we have to see also if she's going to put these out these were draft that the times got their hands on\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\n\n\nWell I think that the at the time that Kavanaugh was there it was actually a pretty cool thing to be part of um it was a repository of future power and\nPeople like the ones you just described were in it but nobody who wasn't in deep cared about but over the years since the eighties um frogs have become very popular on American campuses you know millennials they like to join things\nOn your social network is so important right now in terms of moving forward getting a job being ... that to me being really help you um you know we've seen students really joined up with the Greek system so\nThe famous story with deep is the story and early two thousand tens\nWhere it groups pledges or marching across campus and went to the women's center where upon they chanted no means yes yes means anal um and some of the students who work at yell at the time\nReally thought that this was the straw that broke the camel's back for them in terms of the weight girls were being treated on the campus and\nThey ended up filing title nine complaint with office for civil rights about yell and particularly the\nUm and it was the first one that was filed during this kind of two thousand eleven Obama time when Obama said yes students tell us what's happening we want to hear from you what's going on on your campuses so it was a very important part of that history what are some of the ways\nColleges college administrators are trying to deal\nWith fraternities and with the binge drinking at fraternity parties\nThere are some universities who had moved pledging either in January or they've moved it to sophomore year entirely because they realize that you know having kids start to pledge in September when the sexual assault risk is the highest is just\nMadness right now you have kids pledging fraud and who knows what kind of bears are going to be told to tape and they're going to be getting wasted every night us or have just I mean this is just hideous um\nSo I think there are some frogs that are are trying to bring in um courses about sexual assault trying to be more enlightened about it uh I return it extensively\nSure there are some fraternities are doing that yeah definitely um I read excessively about widely in where I went to school which is not exactly known as a fried haven but there were a bunch of friends there and while I was reporting the book um they'd wetland decided to shut the all of those routes down [noise]\nSo you know I didn't know that until I read your book but I'm sororities are um but by the Greek code or or whatever it is are already is aren't allowed to serve alcohol as their parties only fraternities can do that\nAnd that's a kind of unequal status right there because it means that it's the men on campus who are going to control the party atmosphere since people expect alcohol at\nParties Oh absolutely I mean this is the key issues that universities have boys still really dominate the social scene on college campuses not only are one in six American boys who got a four year colleges are in profits\nAt home which is a population that's up by half in the last decade guys get the kegs right guys by the drugs you can't even have parties at sororities in America that's the ... rules so the guy has got to have the\nParties at their houses and they set the rules and they set the costumes theme and the scene is always something like Little Mermaid\nFor the girls to come really scantily close so I was just kind of shocked that the animal house east those which we used to think was just a small sliver of the American college experience and almost a joke\nHas really spread out across America where you can just do whatever you want to do and then when it's over it's all Scruggs and it's just crazy thing you did in college ... no actually because there's a lot of girls coming out of here with a lot of traumatic experiences\nYou know some women are saying now ... what we really need to do in order to like stop or at least diminished the amount of sexual assault on campus is just stop rape culture\nWhat is meant by that\nSo rape culture is a term that really just tries to connect the dots between in American society that turns this blind eye to sexual assault and the true experience of girls which is that they are experiencing a lot of sexual assault so you know this rape culture is\nA culture where their rape mess that a woman's health fed or alcohol consumption has caused her rape\nAnd nobody questions these attitudes that box and the victim like nobody says it doesn't matter that you were dressed a certain way or it doesn't matter how much you drank\nThey say well victims\nAre kind of a week and they can lie and maybe they're just crazy or maybe they're gold diggers there's all these reasons why a woman would make up the story maybe she's just trying to lie so she didn't get in trouble with her boyfriend et cetera so\nWhat we really see about rung the young generation is we use a whole to participate in that culture and also very differently than in the nineties when I was in college\nBack then of course she talked about sexual assault a lot in the early nineties during you know that PC era but what we were taught us carry me go to a self defense class right protect yourself\nBecause boys will be boys and the best you can do is make sure that your safe on your own down these girls are saying no it's not our problem it's your problem ... and there's times will say things like\nDon't get raped and then they'll cross out\nSome of the word so let's go rape no it's boys who have to change its feet into tuitions that have to change this is about institutional accountability\nMuch about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism and I'll just beyond say as an example here I mean she is a symbol of empowerment\nTo so many women and so many men and women just\nI mean adore her understandably\nAt the same time in so many of her concerts over the years she's she's dressed in very sexual allies clothing and a lot of the clothing it's and there's a ... a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars [noise]\nUm it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed to call attention to them\nShow all areas of the body [noise] um so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see it another way I'm offering myself to you as an object as a sexual I as somebody\nI Want you to look at me sexually I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly sexual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on sexual parts of my body\nMhm and and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campus as\nWell it's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is us in power and or is this denigrating 'em\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism I in my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self objective vacation isn't that just a\nA reasons it isn't that to some we're justifying on this kind of\nWay that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up with these kids I interviewed in college just graduating now Brittany spears was just like\nThey were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion and that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with so\nThey don't have the same ideas about oh if I trust this way it makes me look like a slut because this is the way people dress now there's such a casual way and you're right and a lot of concerts as a beyond say or\nKaty Perry ... you know it's it's crossing a line wave from scanty to something makes really sexual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nA huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised them like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that but they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves\nYou know but ten years before the first official coming out day coming out was really made a political action by Harvey Milk a name I'm sure you know right the first openly gay member of the board of supervisors exactly he was an icon for the community and in this speech he gave in Seventy eight he basically call them all of America to come out\nAnd\nCome out [noise]\nTell your immediate\nGoing to be they are your\nYour wife so clearly you know you have Harvey Milk here stake in this line and the sad but if you really want to get to where the energy for the gay rights movement and coming out came from\nYou could track at all the way back to where the root for the civil rights movement and gay rights movement and women's rights movement came from which was post World war two activism started by black soldiers okay so you're taking it all the way back\nDown to the Nineteen forties Harvey Milk was this huge inspiration in the seventies then coming out day gets foreign allies in the eighties 'cause you're thinking about the eighties I mean this is it gets warm light in the decade that was that was turbulent and scary and and really heartbreaking for much of the gay community\nYeah in many ways it was awful for the gay community and this was in the throes of the AIDS crisis you had this groundswell of activism from the algae to community over the issue while the government was very silent\nOr in the same decade in eighty six you had the Supreme Court uphold a state law from Georgia again sodomy which allowed gay sex to be treated as a felony and so the thinking was if coming out day was the thing that happened and it proved that people had gay and lesbian folks in their lives everywhere and you know them\nSome of the way the law treated them or ignored them would have to change\nIt feels like a lot has changed I mean let me ask you is coming out with the same kind of moment now to marking coming out day feel as necessary\nYeah I think the answer depends on who you ask but for me it feels very very different in large part\nBecause the language that we have around sexuality and gender is constantly evolving you know a thing that we talk about in the episode is how the increased prominence of queer identity of trans identity of people declaring themselves and their sexuality in these ways that are new to many people\nThat almost doesn't fit what you could call the old model of coming out there's also you know this phenomena we go we go from Ellen coming out some Twenty years ago how into artist exactly to artist like Frank Ocean\nWho came out but didn't use the word gay or Janelle Monet who didn't come out as gay or lesbian or by she came out as pan sexual\nIt's just a different language and a different rubric almost so of course that just changes were coming out is to did you walk away from\nThis forming an opinion about\nYourself [noise] um I think it helped me in my own coming out story to stop being angry about how long it took or feeling guilty about my path of my process\nAnd just from what I've been more proud of who I Am and there's I don't know there was just feeling throughout the entire episode where\nThe listeners we talked to coming out is not just declaring yourself to the world\nIt is declaring herself to every earlier version of yourself and tell him that person they're cool too\nNPR's Sam Sanders you can check out his whole episode\nBut on the history of coming out and what it means today by going to the pie taffy for it's been a minute or wherever you get your pie cat think how much than thank you well\nOne of the most competitive and expensive house races in the country

helping to bring some kind of justice when accusations when women come forward to accuse\nI'm a fellow student of sexual assault or rape they're not courts per se but they are some forms of proceedings can you give us a couple of examples of colleges that are doing this and how they do it like what their procedures are\nWell all colleges have to be doing it it's the rule [laughter] you've got to have a title nine office and the title nine office has to take any claims of sexual assault or misconduct or\nGroping or violent rape very seriously and they have them since two thousand nine eleven when Obama kind of lay down the law and said I Want all of you to um pursue this I Want girls to have an equal access to education and they can't if they're\nYou know dealing with trauma from a sexual assault and that's totally true in great um\nSince then as many people know universities have had a hard time putting these courts together Obama's guidance was good but he almost didn't hold them enough about what they should do\nYou know what do the records look like who should sit on the court he did say that he'd like everybody to use a\nStandard of the preponderance of the evidence so it's more likely than not that the act occurred um it's so\nTo prove so many of these cases that I think a lower standard is appropriate here although many attorneys do not agree with that um\nSo what do they what are these proceedings along [noise]\nDo they bring people in who will support their point of view is there an investigation hundreds or\n... you know the number one thing to understand is that across the country all of these courts are different and they're different according to whether the university wants to take this super seriously or not and if the university has the funds to take it seriously\nI'm so real investigations are happening for short now universities don't have subpoena power so whichever students are going to talk to them\nThey'll send a letter to the accused and say you're being brought up on this they'll\nYou know say okay well we're going to probably have our case in a couple of months so get everything ready and you know there's no real system to help the accused him a lot of cases and the boys\nRarely call their parents right there on their own they're at school they're afraid they ask somebody's you know older brother who sets them up with some attorney were may or may not have an idea of how to actually help this\nBoy then there'll be some sort of proceeding and you might have a fisheries professor who is the person who's going to judge her case where you might have actually a a former prosecutor it's completely random who is going to decide your fate\nPart of the reason why these college systems have developed to\nDeal with charges of a sexual assault as President Obama sent out basically a a letter of guidance right it was it wasn't a law but it was a letter of guidance about how colleges should go about trying to handle accusations of sexual assault and this was built on\nTitle nine and so explain what title nine is which was passed\nAs a small part of a of a larger piece of legislation\nAnd signed by President Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nSo title nine is just a short law that nobody in a university should be discriminated against on the basis of gender and I knew it in the nineties as a law that would protect Women's Sports which of course it doesn't and this argument about whether\nTitle nine should cover sexual assault has been going on for many years\nPresident Trump's secretary of education Betsy divorce is changing the guidelines for sexual assault on campus and tell us about the changes that she's making or is on the verge of making that he had to focus has been very\nConcerned about the due process in a campus courts\nShe has also made it fairly clear that she is aligned with Trump in believing that this is a scarier time for boys so she is quite concerned about the accused students and thinks that\nYou know I mean you just had to her deputy set it to the New York times you know Ninety percent of the cases that they're seeing 'em involve just regret it sucks\nSo devise is concerned about due process rights she's concerned about false accusations um she's also concerned that Obama imposed these mandates by\nYet even though they were guidance he really did have the office for civil rights try to go to universities and say open up your books I Want to see how you've been deciding is sexual assault cases and\nI'm here now and this is serious so she's really backed off of um sending the OC are out but for the students really the most important thing is that she may change this definition of sexual assault\nWhich had previously been something kind of vague about unwelcome contract and you know various colleges headed interpreted what sexual assault was on their own\nNow she's interested in saying okay well what would count it needs to be something that is severe and pervasive enough to deprive a student of education\nSo what would happen if it was a one off sexual assault like ... described applying for a close eye hand on a mouse um quote unquote and nothing happened even though she er she is thinking about ... years later\nWhen he was afraid she'd be smothered to death\n[noise] she was afraid that she was going to be killed unintentionally unintentionally mother to yeah\nAnd she was prevented from leaving 'em so as Betsy device trying to say title nine ... which mandate against gender discrimination on campus needs to be applied to discrimination against men because so many men are being wrongfully accused as that her case that is exactly what you're saying yeah\nShe's interest in this idea of gender discrimination claims both ways\nSo um have hurt guidelines taken effect yet\nNo they haven't they were leads to the New York times on there will be a notice on comment period or you know we have to see also if she's going to put these out these were draft that the times got their hands on\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nOn Fridays we welcome you to comment on the world as you're not just as you want it to Saudi Arabia\nKilled one of its own we're doing just that our number one by one of my\n... year old women in Brazil's\nNot him and Bollywood me me too that's gone on one week David eleven on eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. [noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nWell I think the deed at the time that Kavanaugh was there it was actually a pretty cool thing to be part of um it was a repository of future power and\nPeople like the ones you just described were in it but nobody who wasn't in the care about the but over the years since the eighties I'm ... I'm very popular on American campuses you know millennials they like to join things\nOn your social network is so important right now in terms of moving forward getting a job being ... that to me being really help you um you know we've seen students really joined up with a Greek system so\nThe famous story was deep is the story and early two thousand tens\nWhere it groups pledges were marching across campus and went to the women's center where upon they chanted no means yes yes means in all um and some of the students who work at yell at the time I\nReally thought that this was the straw that broke the camel's back for them in terms of the way girls were being treated on the campus and\nThey ended up filing title nine complaint with office for civil rights about yell and particularly the\nUm and it was the first one that was filed during this kind of two thousand eleven Obama time when Obama said yes students tell us what's happening we want to hear from you what's going on on your campus says so it was a very important part of that history what are some of the ways\nColleges college administrators are trying to deal with fraternities and with the binge\nDrinking at fraternity parties there are some universities who had moved pledging either in January or they've moved it to sophomore year entirely because they realize that you know having kids start to pledge in September when the sexual assault risk is the highest is just\nMadness right now you have kids pledging fried and who knows what kind of bears are going to be told to pay and they're going to be getting wasted every night or have just I mean this is just\nHideous um\nSo I think there are um some frogs that are are trying to bring in um courses about sexual assault trying to be more enlightened about it uh I ... I really [noise]\nSure there are some fraternities are doing that yeah definitely um I read extensively about widely in where I went to school which is you know not exactly known as the fried haven but there were a bunch of ... there and while I was reporting the book um they wetland decided to shut the all of those ...\n[noise] so you know I didn't know that until I read your book but I'm sororities are um ... by the Greeks code or or whatever it is sororities aren't allowed to serve alcohol at their parties only fraternities\nCan do that\nAnd that's a kind of unequal status right there because it means that it's the men on campus who are going to control the party atmosphere since people expect alcohol at\nParties Oh absolutely I mean this is the key issues that universities have boys still\nReally dominate the social scene on college campuses not only are one in six American boys who go to a four year colleges are in profits at home which is the population that's up by half in the last decade guys get the kegs right guys by the drugs\nYou can't even have parties at sororities in\nAmerica that's the ... rules so the guy has got to have the\nParties at their houses and they set the rules and they set the costumes scene and the scene is always something like Little Mermaid\nFor the girls to come really scantily closed so I Would just kind of shocked that the animal house east those which we used to think was just a small sliver of the American college experience and almost a joke\nHas really spread out across America where you can just do whatever you want to do and then when it's over it's all ... and it's just that crazy thing you did in college who know actually because there's a lot of girls coming out of here with a lot of traumatic experiences you\nKnow some woman are saying now are we really need to do in order to like stop or at least diminished the amount of sexual assault on campus is to stop rape culture\nWhat is meant by that\nSo rape culture um is a term that really just tries to connect the dots between in American society that turns this blind eye to sexual assault and the true experience of girls which is that they are experiencing a lot of sexual assault so you know this rape culture is\nA culture where their rape mess that women's health fed or alcohol consumption has caused her weight\nAnd nobody questions these attitudes that box and the victim like nobody says\nIt doesn't matter that you were dressed a certain way or it doesn't matter\nHow much you drank they say well victims\nAre kind of a week and they can lie and maybe they're just crazy or maybe they're gold diggers there's all these reasons why a woman would make up the story maybe she's just trying to lie so she didn't get in trouble with her boyfriend cetera so\nWhat we really see about rung the young generation is we use a whole to participate in that culture and also very differently than in the nineties when I was in college back then of course we talked about sexual assault a lot in the early nineties during that PC era\nBut what we were taught his carry me\nGo to a self defense class right protect yourself\nBecause boys will be boys and the best you can do is make sure that your safe on your own down these girls are saying no it's not our problem it's your problem right and there are signs\nWe'll say things like don't get raped and then they'll cross out some of the word so let's go rape no it's boys who have to change its the into tuitions that have to change this is about institutional accountability\nBut talking about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism and I'll use beyond say as an example here I mean she is a symbol of empowerment\nTo so many women and so many men and women just\nI mean adore her ... understandably\nAt the same time in so many of her concerts over the years she's she's dressed in very sexual allies clothing and a lot of the clothing it's and it's just to have a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars\nUm it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body [noise] um so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see it another way I'm offering myself to you as an object as a sexual up as somebody\nI Want you to look at me sexually I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly sexual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on sexual parts of my body\nMhm and and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nWell it's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is this empowering or is this denigrating 'em\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism I in my knee jerk reaction is like us recalling the self object to vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of\nWay that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up in these kids I interviewed in college just graduating now you know Brittany spears was just like\nIt they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion and that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with so\nThey don't have the same ideas about oh if I trust this way it makes me look like a lot because this is the way people dress now there's such a casual way and you're right and a lot of concerts as a beyond say or\nKaty Perry re on a you know it's it's crossing the line way from scanty to something may extremely sexual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nHuge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised them like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that but they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves", "show_name": "Fresh
