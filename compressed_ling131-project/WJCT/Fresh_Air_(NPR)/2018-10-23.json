{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "A stereotype it takes about five years if someone is going to absorb all of this change in their life and had a normal life that they recreate or re imagined takes about five years\nFive years I who I Want to get to a few more of your comments about the lottery one of you left a note in our inbox about someone that they loved winning the lottery here's what he left in our voice mail\nBy name sprang from operate Florida\nMy step brother Tommy on two million dollars in the lottery isn't good that it happened at a better time it hurt himself at work and that added to play two dollars on the lottery and one to me but he was way behind on the couch and that was about to leave it\nUh his son was about to have to leave college because of lack of funds and the other side without going to be able to go to college because of not being able to pay for it but that being said it said this how\nIt paid for the doctor bills are paid for the surgery that he needed is taking care of and both of their son's college uh are paid or so couldn't have happened to a nicer guy\nSounds like a Frank thanks very much for sharing that story professor ... love to hear your reaction to to Frank's too\nSometimes things work out well uh but I've been following for over Twenty years a large number of people and we started following these people in their teenagers teenage years and some of them one\nAnd got large gives some won the lottery some of them got large inheritance is many of them didn't we could compare these people don't average those people who got large gifts and unheard and to some lottery winnings about fifty percent of all the money was gone relatively quickly in about a year to two years\nAnd there's been a number of other studies that have also looked at lottery winners there was one study that went back ten years later and among people who one large lottery prices when we were able to save sixteen percent so much of the money disappears quite quickly\nI'm Sorry sixteen percent one six percent\nOne six for the people who are able to hold on to more of that money\nWell let me not presume I mean I I don't want to presume that the idea of money is just to hold on to it I mean I think about Andrew Carnegie who once wrote I Want to spend the first half of my life making money I Want to spend the second half of my life giving it all away\nSo I Wonder professor what you see\nAs the focus of people who win these large sums do they want to keep it all do they want to give it all the way they want to buy an island off the coast of New Zealand I mean what's the what's the mainstream of what people do with this money\nI'm not really sure what people want to do with their money and I think a lot of people don't think about what they want to do with your money or their money\nOr in general what happens is the money just seems to disappear quickly and it's not going into actual physical things are part of our study we ask them do they own a house before the when these monies or before they get in the large inheritance do their own cars the value of all of it\nAnd they're not actually buying physical assets it just seems to have totally disappeared\nSusan let me get to a few more questions and comments including this one related to the tax implications of winning here's what this listener left in our inbox\nI'm not a lottery purchaser I've never won the lottery my bigger question is this is a form of taxation what happens to all the tax dollars where do they go how does the government spend them\nThanks very much for that question to our apple won a vox pop Susan can you talk about the way taxation effects lotteries I imagine is different from state to state right\nWell in gambling or nature tests like this\nThe other other income taxable so their tax dollars whether it's federal state county city knows where your tax dollars go\nUm it's it's not free money as it is in Canada or UK when they when they whenever the number is that under that they get so it\nIt is a form of of taxation that that happened that that's pretty common to this I don't think Los lottery winners are aware of what happens when you take a lump sum\nA when you get a pet in value a amount you get a discount there and then you get tested it's usually in one third is what someone walks away with\nWith a third of the of the jackpot that they went [laughter] so somebody will\nA lot of money and I know it's if that were happening yeah but if\nIt but it's not my point six billion I'm going to do that over thirty or period but if you wanted upfront it's called the present value calculations and it's this tape it counts\nLet me get some we get one or two more of your comments before we run out of time Vicki wrote on our Facebook page no state no fancy car no ridiculous designer per se I correct issues with my house pursue things and organizations I Want to volunteer for set up trust\nNot likely going to happen but it would be nice to lift up family and things like habitat for humanity literacy and the humanities\nAnd left her message just on Facebook if I win the lottery I Will make sure one a stays on the air for posterity [laughter] oh Lester you say that now you haven't heard my terms\nProfessors have or see before we go from your research just in terms of the question of money and happiness what's the main thing you want people to take away our own money and and wellness in terms of in terms of coming into a big sum of money like this before we go\nFired of summing up if you think winning the lottery is going to make all your problems go away it'll probably make the problems are currently facing today go away but you're going to get a totally different set of problems\nSo you just inherited bigger problems for the money that you're going\nTo do and if I just have one more minute I Want to tell you are listening as a quick story very very brief because it is possible it is possible to spend all of that there was a man named Huntington Hartford was the ear to the in the supermarket fortune to got almost one point three billion dollars when he was twelve

J. C. T. Jacksonville mid seventies today clouds rapidly return along with their twenty percent chance of rain a threat of coastal showers all day sixty five forty overnight low popping back to the upper seventies tomorrow\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia and Terry Gross with fresh\nAir the twenty Eighteen election to go in two different ways it could be tainted by voter suppression or it could be remembered as an election which voting rights were expanded for millions of people\nToday we talk with Ari Berman author of give us the ballot and senior reporter for Mother Jones about how the upcoming keen mid term elections could be affected by voting restriction\nThrough voter ID laws through proof of citizenship loss to register by purging the voting rolls by cutting early voting and by closing polling places\nAnd I'll talk about Kansas and Georgia where the secretary of state who oversees the election is also the Republican gubernatorial candidate\nThere is an inherent conflict of interest because secretaries of state or the top election officials in their states and so they decide how voting laws in their states are designed and implemented that coming up on fresh air\nI think a number of different things Georgia has done has earned a state that moniker but more recently this issue exploded because the news emerged it was reported by the Associated Press that Brian comes off as the secretary of state's office in Georgia\nWas blocking fifty three thousand voter registrations in that state Seventy percent from African Americans eighty percent for people of color or what was happening as people were submitting voter registration applications and if it didn't exactly match if their names on the voter registration forms didn't exactly match\nOther state database as these voters worse\nA letter telling them that their applications were pending and they needed to provide more information to election officials in this was very confusing to people because even though these pending voters could show up\nAnd vote at the polls with the correct id they couldn't vote by mail but they could vote at the polls\nIf you got a letter in the military that said there was a problem with your registration you probably would think that you weren't eligible to vote so they set off widespread confusion the fact that Brian kept the secretary of state was running for office at the same time his office was doing this and that he was running against Stacey Abrams\nWho could be the first black woman governor in us history\nThat really made this a huge national story\nAnd Stacey Abrams is actually a voting rights activists\nStacey Abrams is the voting rights activists and the big picture in this race is that these two candidates have a very different view of voting rights in this country Stacey Abrams a Democrat is running to become\nThe first black woman governor in us history she needs very high black voter turnout and in fact she has made it her goal to register a lot of new bloc voters she started a group and twenty Thirteen called the New Georgia project\nThat had the intent and purpose of registering more black voters\nBrian cap on the other hand the Republican is very reliant on support from white voters in Georgia and so his view of the electorate and his view of voting rights is that it's necessary to restrict access to the ballot and in fact the people that are most\nAffected by his policies are the kind of people that are going to be most likely to vote for states to a room so this there was this clash between their two ideologies\nThese two figures have clashed themselves because one Stacey Abrams founded this group called the New Georgia project and twenty fourteen they submitted eighty five thousand voter registration applicants to\n... office and camps are blocked about half of those registrations from going through and he claimed that there was fraud going on within Abrams group the New Georgia project\nUltimately there were no fraud charges that were filed against the group however this battle between these two people Brian Kevin Stacey Abrams\nDates back a few election cycles so when I saw that they were running against each other I knew that voting rights was going to be a major issue in this race although I don't think anyone quite saw that the issue is going to blow up quite as much as it did\nYou know the exact match room where your food your registration has to exactly match your voter id\nI understand how hard that can be I mean I have a passport and your driver's license and one has a middle initial and one has a middle name\nAnd and trying to change the passport and there's so much I tried and failed I really tried and so I still have to work on that it's not fast and it's confusing which for him to use which office to go to I got run and vice so it's not simple to change that kind of\nReally minor discrepancy\nIt makes you feel any better you're not alone Terry there in Wisconsin was thinking about adopting a similar exact match system the six retired judges who help oversee elections there they ran this test and four out of the six judges in Wisconsin failed the exact match system\nBecause their names on their voter registration forms were different than their names in state databases and so this kind of exact match system is known as disenfranchisement by typo\nBecause when you submit a voter registration form if you have a hyphen missing on your name if you have an apostrophe missing if you use Tom\nOn one form and Thomas on another your former is going to be blocked by the state of Georgia and what's interesting to me is that Georgia first tried to put this policy in place in two thousand nine when it previously had to approve its voting changes with the federal government under the voting rights act\nAnd the federal government actually blocked this exact match system from going into effect\nBecause they said it was discriminatory against minority voters who are more likely to be flagged by this system then when Brian Kemp was elected and twenty ten he started doing this administratively he was sued and twenty sixteen by the lawyers committee for civil rights of voting rights group because thirty five thousand\nRegistrations were flagged as pending under the exact match system and there was a huge racial disparity in terms of who was flat and camps office after said he was going to stop doing this system but what happened is the Georgia legislature\nBasically reauthorize the law gave voters more time to do this and so a lot of people didn't even realize this law was backed into effect they thought and I was one of those people that thought\nThis law was blocked in twenty sixteen how is Brian Kemp doing this again and that's only when I realized that the Georgia legislature had reauthorized respond given kept new powers that a federal lawsuit was meant to prevent\nWhy are people of color\nImpacted by this exact match law than a white people are\nThat's a very good question and that was the question that I posed to a number of voting rights lawyers recently and what they told me is that\nBasically the names of people who are African American or Latino or Asian American tend to be more unfamiliar to election workers so they might have names that don't match\nOn the databases from one form to another or election officials might actually enter\nThe correct name incorrectly or because they're confused by the spelling or they don't recognize\nThe name and so I think that basically people of different kinds of backgrounds are sometimes unfamiliar to the largely white officials that are running Georgia's elections I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people of color are ending up on these pending registration lists\nAre there other ways that Brian Kemp as secretary of state has restricted voting rights\nYes so there was recently a very interesting report by the U.S commission on civil rights a very historic group that's been monitoring civil rights for for many years\nAnd they looked at the different ways\nIn which voting is being targeted and they found five different ways that voting is being targeted through voter ID laws through proof of citizenship loss to register\nBy purging the voting rolls by cutting early voting and by closing polling places they found that Georgia was the only state\nThat has adopted all five of these voting restrictions so it's not just one thing that Georgia is doing Georgia has closed two hundred and fourteen polling places in recent years they have cut back\nOn early voting they have aggressively purge the voter rolls Georgia has purge almost ten percent of people\nFrom voting rolls one point five million people have been purged from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen so there's a lot of different data points that show how Georgia is leading the way when it comes to restricting access to the ballot\nOkay there's other states with voting issues to talk about but first we're going to take a short break if you're just joining us my guess is Ari Berman he's author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones we'll talk more about voting rights after this short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office so let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary us\n'cause they're areas are too remote for the post office to deliver mail at ... under this law\nTribal IDs that list PO box is won't be able to be used as a valid voter IDs\nSo now we're in a situation where five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the twenty Eighteen elections with their tribal ID cards and this is sending off a tremendous amount of of alarming to say 'cause normally we wouldn't be talking about North Dakota Terry\nBut there is a competitive Senate race between the Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and the Republican Kevin Cramer Heidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the U.S Senate in twenty twelve\nBy twenty nine hundred votes and she got eighty percent of the vote on the two counties in the state\nWith the largest Native American reservations so there's a tremendous amount of fear in North Dakota that many Native Americans are not going to be able to vote in this state and that's going to particularly hurt Heidi Heitkamp the Democratic incumbent and they've had kept loses Democrats won't have any chance of taking back the U.S Senate\nIs there a suspicion that this law I'm with street addresses what was particularly targeted at Native Americans\nYes because in North Dakota Republicans began writing this law five months after hide cap was unexpectedly elected\nAnd twenty twelve and there's been a number of ... of this law but the district court in North Dakota struck down this law earlier this year and basically they said that the law was going to you Nick ... bird and Native American voters cause as it was written they couldn't use PO box as as their\nAddresses on their IDs and Republicans in North Dakota and the secretary of state who was large behind this new this at the time they knew that a Native Americans wouldn't be able to use their tribal ideas as the law was written but they they put it in place anyway the problem was that a very conservative appeals court\nUpheld this law in September so it was already very close to the election and the Supreme Court upheld that decision in October so basically a month before the election thousands of Native Americans were told\nThe ideas that you use for everything in your life you can't use for voting and now this is a very confusing situation on the ground in North Dakota\nWhat the tribes have said they'll do is they're actually going to sit outside the polls and they're going to use GPS coordinates to give Native Americans street address if they don't have one and they were going to print out forms and they're going to give them letters to then give to poll workers\nAs correct id but we have no idea if this is actually going to work the secretary of state of North Dakota has been noncommittal about whether he'll accept these IDs whether poll workers are going to be confused so if we have another close election in North Dakota\nIt can be swayed by this voter id law I think the larger point is that this is one of the most historically disenfranchised and not the most historically disenfranchised community in this country that Native Americans have\nAll sorts of problems right now that they're facing because of what this country did to them and and now they're facing all of these burdens just to be able to vote in the ... election I think that's just very very disturbing from a civil rights perspective\n[noise] it's kind of standard almost a cliche for people including you know elected officials to get out and vote American democracy is based on exercising your franchise\nOver the weekend President Trump tweeted a warning he treated all levels of government law enforcement are watching carefully for voter fraud including early voting cheat at your own peril violators will be subject to maximum penalties civil and criminal\nUm what's the reaction to that tweet and\nIt was a very alarming tweet by the president as you mentioned Terry usually presidents and high ranking officials encourage people to vote President Obama just put out a tweet recently when he went through all the excuses for people not voting and said this is why you should vote\nBut Donald Trump was doing the opposite he basically made it seem like this was an act of voter intimidation by the president of the United states not the first time that Donald Trump has tweeted about voter fraud he repeatedly clamped out any evidence that millions of people voted legally\nIn the twenties sixteen elections and fats voter fraud is of very rare problem in American elections it's not like it never happens but it's not nearly as widespread as many people including the president would have you believe just to cite one study\nThere was a review of\nEvery ballot cast between two thousand and twenty fourteen so over a billion ballots cast during that period\nAnd there are only thirty one cases of voter impersonation so that means you're more likely to be struck by lightning than you are to commit voter fraud but I think the real reason why Trump was doing this and why he mentioned early voting in particular is that in spite of the bears that we've been talking about\nEarly voting turn on his way up\nAnd a lot of crucial swing states and its favoring Democrats who are getting out to vote in spite of the barriers they're facing and this was alarmed Republicans and so what Trump is saying is that\nHe wants to essentially intimidate people out of voting particularly at an early voting because he feels like this is hurting the Republican Party and any time it seems like Republicans are about to lose an election\nThey invoke the specter of widespread voter fraud which they feel well hopefully have a chilling effect on voter participation\nWe've been talking about voter restrictions were going to talk about the possibility of expanding voting rights during this election after we take a short break if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the ballot for modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for mother\nJones or he's been covering up all the voting issues and more that we've been talking about we'll

America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones and he's been writing about voting issues\nThe say the twenty Eighteen can actually be a big year for expanding voting rights act in spite of all these additional new restrictions\nThat we've been discussing and that their initiatives on the ballot in seven states it would make it easier to vote and harder for states to gerrymander political districts so give us an overview of those uh initiatives on the seven states\n[noise] yeah so despite all of the focus on voter suppression Terry twenty team could actually be a huge year when it comes to expanding access to the ballot because there are initiative that would make it\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration there are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymander by doing things like citizen ladder nonpartisan redistricting\nIn places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ... of the one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida\nWhere one point six million ex felons can vote that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony\nConviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia in North Dakota and Kansas and other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts and\nSee there's thousands of young men last sidelined in the economy a marginal cost I think there's no point in ... in the books they got no place in the system and no faith in his coat easy targets to be getting brainwashed by these [noise]\nWho say this feeling innocent blood is peace in a ... it's called sour times when I spoke to a\nI asked him about that and how his feelings about it I've changed\nI didn't perform that for about four years because I was terrified that if anyone ever heard me say things like that among you know I thought I might get hard is it terrorism apologies as a radical\nAnd it's really interesting the the limitations of replacing ourselves and when I first read it to someone to my friend than you would like you're asking you should be putting out I was really scared to say that to people so everything's in remind myself is never a good sign if you wait until there's a perfect time is a perfect atmosphere to say something\nYou should just assume you're always gonna piss someone else and then do anyway\nRace op ed is thirty five he's British Pakistani Muslim a graduate of Oxford he's also the first South Asian man to win an acting any for his role in the HBO drama the night of\nHe says that show ended central character a young man awaiting trial for murder and Rikers Island are all about complexity and shades of gray\nI think there is a kind of do a lot of teachers as well to be on his way drew people in with for some people was allowed them to indulge defense Caesar the dangerous listening by ... them in the face with was the realization of our common humanity and I think that kind of bait and switch was actually quite effective\nI think you're right about this really eloquently at ... at the time um you have this essay that appeared in the guardian which was the title was type cast a as a terrorist and and you talk about this idea of there being three stages for brown actor in film do you mind just telling us what those three stages are\nBasically acting when his thoughts out you're also play the cab driver you also played terrorists is the arranged marriage is a on a kitty is that kind of thing I kinda just made a decision by the stall was him to do that will just wasn't interested in it that's the law went into this\nAnd sometimes I mean going without work ... when I joined industry would just be post nine eleven you know the U.S a kiss vibes and then the stage to off the stereotypical portrayal is I think his\nStory that take place don't explicitly as an aside terrain by aims just above those and that was what the side taking shape when I joined industry\nI was lucky that I was ... some of those projects to flat for lying it's about a group of terrorists but they just kind of these lovable do the accident be blow up bin Laden and whether I'm just kind of makes you second guessed it may be most of us who thought and then once this is just like us and in stage three I'd do is um this idea of the problem is that\nYou know where I'm not ... ...\nEuros I'm playing on only ones which are very very culturally specific\nAnd you could look at this is like playing roles rock and a guy named the bull would day but the the premise not isn't just about the rest of the nation is about ... the place where it's like I could also be hard to ... is not about leaving my identity behind is about not just being shuttled to a two dimensional idea of it\nSo as your star is on the rise you reached this new level of fame and we'll call this level of fame the Hollywood sex symbol\nOf what you can't see that the audience at this event can is a massive photo from\nProjected on the screen behind us is race mad lying on a leather couch oil up with a shirt [laughter]\nYou could say what it\nMeans you're kind of put on a pedestal right especially when somebody is like a smart on current events and issues of the day then you are the kind of woke Internet boyfriends and that is a pedophile you can be knocked off of how precarious does it feel that kind of popularity\nOkay what is I mean it's two two things I think it's all about what you said first is this idea of kind of embracing his sexuality is a man\nIs brown Ninety particular um that's something that sometimes I feel is like a little bit Coney let's face it you know it can be but I also think if somebody has kind of important to do because I think often brown men you know coach indicted ... allowed to be sexual sensitive essential day like\nEither terrorists barbarians are going to come and eat kids will be competing in my family and then the object of desire oh\nYou know I didn't ... that caught me as well and in my own mind I never costs myself is that the leading guy was someone who'd be you know desire but in that way and so that's really approaches re education and kind of\nRe examining your self image to allow yourself to do that to not itself to be that particularly if you're from a ... of culture so it's actually something that it's it's it's I think he's been Paul my journey of growth\nDue to allow myself to occupy that space [noise] um in terms of like being knocked off incident pedestals I mean like happened to be ten seconds doesn't it you know\nAnd I asked because you do speak out on ideas right you're not afraid to go on some talk show and really say what you think about something and see if you get nervous\nYeah I guess maybe on some level I Do feel like\nOn then maybe they want to know people like me doing\nThis so I Do feel some responsibility to represent wherever but coming we'd that in speaking to your point of being knocked off as kind of pedestal and disappointing people\nYou can't represent everyone you climb represent at one point of view the idea that I can like you know that any given film where there is like bending ... disease so the big sequel goodness gracious me with the night off can satisfied experience of a billion Muslims around the world well how many million South Asians though in America that in itself is patronize\nAnd it's an unfair but in some place I think the one responsibility do have is to try and be full self and that's going to disappoint some people on the religion of some people I'm Julie just father people I'm going to take a show a few months to some people I'm not big enough for others\n[noise] you know no one in this room of course\n\nSo I think the main the main

doing that hopefully you inspire other people in power the people to go like why you know he's going to look at the show up in that and maybe I can to [noise]\nHe can before a live audience in

up\nAnd vote at the polls with the correct id they couldn't vote by mail but they could vote at the polls\nIf you got a letter in the military that said there was a problem with your registration you probably would think that you weren't eligible to vote so they set off a widespread confusion the fact that Brian ... secretary of state was running for office at the same time his office was doing this and that he was running against Stacey Abrams\nWho could be the first black woman governor in us history\nThat really made this a huge national story\nAnd Stacey Abrams is actually a voting rights activists\nStacey Abrams is the voting rights activists and the big picture in this race is that these two candidates have a very different view of voting rights in this country Stacey Abrams a Democrat is running to become\nThe first black woman governor and us history she needs very high black voter turnout and in fact she has made it her goal to register a lot of new bloc voters she started a group and twenty Thirteen called the New Georgia project\nThat had the intent and purpose of registering more black voters\nBrian cap on the other hand the Republican is very reliant on support from white voters in Georgia and so his view of the electorate and his view of voting rights is that it's necessary to restrict access to the ballot and in fact the people that are most\nAffected by his policies are the kind of people that are going to be most likely to vote for Stacey Abrams so there's there's a clash between their two ideologies\nThese two figures have clashed themselves because when Stacey Abrams founded this group called the New Georgia project and twenty fourteen they submitted eighty five thousand voter registration applicants\nTo ... office and camp to blocked about half of those registrations from going through and he claimed that there was fraud going on within Abrams group the New Georgia project\nUltimately there were no fraud charges that were filed against the group however this battle between these two people Brian Kevin Stacey Abrams\nDates back a few election cycles so when I saw they were running against each other I knew that voting rights was going to be a major issue in this race although I don't think anyone quite saw the issue was going to blow up quite as much as it did\nYou know the exact match rule where your food your registration has to exactly match your voter ID I understand how hard that can be I mean I have a passport and your driver's license and one has a middle initial and one has been middle name and\nAnd trying to change the passport and there's so much I tried and failed I really tried and so I still have to work on that it's not fast and it's confusing which for him to use which office to go to I got wrong advice so it's not simple to change that kind of\nReally minor discrepancy\nIt makes you feel any better you're not alone Terry there in Wisconsin was thinking about adopting a similar exact match system the six retired judges who help oversee elections there they ran this test and four out of the six judges in Wisconsin failed the exact match system\nBecause of their names on their voter registration forms were different than their names and state databases and so this kind of ... system is known as disenfranchisement by tae Bo\nBecause when you submit a voter registration form if you have a\nMissing on your name if you have an apostrophe missing if you use Tom\nOn one form and Thomas on another your former is going to be blocked by the state of Georgia and what's interesting to me is that George or the first tried to put this policy in place in two thousand nine when it previously had to approve its voting changes with the federal government under the voting rights act\nAnd the federal government actually block this exact matched system from going into effect\nBecause they said it was discriminatory against minority voters who are more likely to be flagged\nBy this system than when Brian Kemp was elected in twenty ten he started doing this administratively he was sued and twenty sixteen by the lawyers committee for civil rights a voting rights group because thirty five thousand\nRegistrations were flagged as pending under the exact match system and there was a huge racial disparity in terms of who was flat\nAnd ... office after said he was going to stop doing this system but what happened is the Georgia legislature basically reauthorize the law gave voters more time to do this and so a lot of people didn't even realize this law was backed into effect they thought and I was one of those people that thought\nThis law was Boston twenty sixteen how is Brian Kemp doing this again and that's only when I realized that the Georgia legislature had reauthorized respond given kept new powers that a federal lawsuit was meant to prevent\nWhy are people of color\nImpacted by this exact match law than a white people are\nThat's a very good question and that was a question that I posed to a number of voting rights lawyers recently and what they told me is that\nBasically the names of people who are African American or Latino or Asian American tend to be more unfamiliar to election workers\nSo they might have names that don't match on the databases from one form to another or election officials might actually enter\nThe correct name incorrectly or because they're confused by the spelling or they don't recognize\nThe name and so I think that basically people of different kinds of backgrounds are sometimes unfamiliar to the largely white officials that are running Georgia's elections I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people of color are ending up on these pending registration lists\nAre there other ways that Brian Kemp as secretary of state has restricted voting rights\nYes so there was recently a very interesting report by the U.S commission on civil rights a very historic group that's been monitoring civil rights for for many years and they looked at the different ways\nIn which voting is being targeted and they found five different ways that voting as being targeted through voter ID laws through proof of citizenship loss to register by purging the voting rolls by\nCutting early voting and by closing polling places\nThey found that Georgia was the only state\nThat has adopted all five of these voting restrictions so it's not just one thing that Georgia is doing Georgia has closed two hundred and fourteen polling places in recent years they have cut back on early voting they have aggressively purge the voter rolls Georgia has purge almost ten percent of people\nFrom voting rolls one point five million people have been purged from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen so there's a lot of different data points that show how Georgia is leading the way when it comes to restricting access to the ballot\nOkay there's other states with voting issues to talk about but first we're going to take a short break if you're just joining us my guess is Ari Berman he's author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones we'll talk more about voting rights after this short break this is fresh out of\nHigh school is not easy to get into a trap blamed rather than ownership\nA documentary about a suburban Chicago high school charge the struggle between teachers and students\nRegardless of all the different thing when they come here\nAre and what the series in America to me could teach us about education and equity next time on one end weekdays at eleven on eighty nine nine W. J. C team\n\nFresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office so let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's right\nAnd for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry\nI Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nAt the post office using PO box is\n'cause they're areas are too remote for the post office to deliver mail at ... under this law\nTribal IDs that list peel boxes won't be able to be used as a valid voter IDs so now we're in a situation where five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the twenty Eighteen elections with their tribal ID cards\nAnd this is sending off a tremendous amount of of alarm the say 'cause normally we wouldn't be talking about North Dakota Terry\nBut there is a competitive Senate race between the Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Republican Kevin Cramer Heidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the U.S Senate in twenty twelve\nBy twenty nine hundred votes and she got eighty percent of the vote on the two counties in the state with the largest Native American reservations so there's a tremendous amount of fear in North Dakota\nThat many Native Americans are not going to be able to vote in this state and that's going to particularly hurt Heidi Heitkamp the Democratic incumbent and have had kept loses Democrats won't have any chance of taking back the U.S Senate\nIs there a suspicion that this law I'm with street addresses what was particularly targeted at Native Americans\nYes because in North Dakota Republicans began writing this law five months after high cap was unexpectedly elected and twenty twelve\nAnd there's been a number of ... of this law but the district court in North Dakota struck down this law earlier this year and basically they said that the law was going to uniquely burden Native American voters cause as it was written they couldn't use PO box is as their\nAddresses on their ideas and Republicans in North Dakota and the secretary of state who was larger behind this new this at the time they knew that a Native Americans wouldn't be able to use their tribal IDs as the law was written but they they put it in place anyway the problem was that a very conservative appeals court\nUpheld this law in September so it was already very close to the election and the Supreme Court upheld that decision in October so basically a month before the election thousands of Native Americans were told the ideas that you use for everything in your life\nYou can't use for voting and now this is a very confusing situation on the ground in North Dakota\nWhat the tribes have said they'll do is they're actually going to sit outside the polls and they're going to use GPS coordinates to give Native Americans a street address if they don't have one and they were going to print out forms and they're going to give them letters to then give to poll workers\nAs correct id but we have no idea if this is actually going to work the secretary of state of North Dakota has been noncommittal about whether he'll accept these IDs whether poll workers are going to be confused so if we have another close election in North Dakota\nIt can be swayed by this voter id law I think the larger point is that this is one of the most historically disenfranchised not the most historically disenfranchised community in this country that Native Americans have all sorts of problems right now that they're facing because of what this country did to them\nAnd and now they're facing all of these burdens just to be able to vote in the ... election I think that's just very very disturbing from a civil rights perspective\n[noise] it's kind of standard almost a cliche for people including you know elected officials to say get out and vote American democracy is based on exercising your franchise\nOver the weekend President Trump tweeted a warning he treated all levels of government law enforcement are watching carefully for voter fraud including early voting cheat at your own peril violators will be subject to maximum penalties civil and criminal\nUm what's the reaction to that tweet and\nIt was a very alarming tweet by the president as you mentioned Terry usually presidents and high ranking officials encourage people to vote President Obama just put out a tweet recently when he went through all the excuses for people not voting and said this is why you should vote\nBut Donald Trump was doing the opposite he basically made it seem like this was an act\nOf voter intimidation by the president of the United states not the first time that Donald Trump has tweeted about voter fraud he repeatedly clams out any evidence that millions of people voted illegally\nIn the twenty sixteen elections in fact voter fraud is a very rare problem in American elections it's not like it never happens but it's not nearly as widespread as many people including the president would have you believe just to cite one study there was a review of\nEvery ballots cast between two thousand and twenty fourteen so over a billion ballots cast during that period\nAnd there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation so that means you're more likely to be struck by lightning than you are to commit voter fraud but I think the real reason why Trump was doing this and why he mentioned early voting in particular is that in spite of the bears that we've been talking about\nEarly voting turned on his way up and a lot of crucial swing states and its favoring Democrats who are getting out to vote in spite of the barriers they're facing and this was alarmed Republicans and so what Trump is saying is that\nHe wants to essentially intimidate people out of voting particularly at an early voting because he feels like this is hurting the Republican Party and that anytime it seems like Republicans are about to lose an election\nThey invoke the specter of widespread voter fraud which they feel well hopefully have a chilling effect on voter participation\nWe've been talking about voter restrictions were going to talk about the possibility of expanding voting rights during this election after we take a short break if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the balance the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nAnd he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones or he's been covering up all the voting issues and more that we've been talking about we'll be right back after we take a short break\nThis is fresh air\nMay soon as I eat as a stand up comic with cerebral palsy and that and\nPart of
