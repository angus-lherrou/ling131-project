J. C. T. Jacksonville your community your world\nSome WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air today Michael Lewis\nAuthor of the best sellers money ball and the big short talks about his new book the fifth risk and examines the federal government under President Trump by focusing on three departments energy agriculture and commerce\nWhich together are responsible for controlling risk you wouldn't associate with those departments predicting hurricanes and overseeing our stockpile of nuclear weapons\nLouis that half of the top seven hundred jobs in the Trump Administration are still unfilled and some of the people who have been appointed have conflicts of interest or unqualified making them unprepared to deal with\nMany of them potentially catastrophic the risk of a pin them or\nThe risk of a nuclear at\nOne after another and many of these\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting today after the election\nAnd they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody to bring in many cases when I go get get get these briefings on the first person to have got them\nAnd I thought well this enterprises managing all these risks it imagines that we as a society to spend much time thinking about\nAnd it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big portfolio of risk like the federal government runs and ... would you what happens is you you amplify the risk you increase the probability of\nOf these risk actually causing problems [noise] see\nYou write about three different departments energy agriculture and commerce I'm In all three or at least in two of the three data has been removed and the public can no longer access and can you give us some examples across the agencies of data that's been removed\nYeah so this is a ... or ... times trying to ... wants to tease out some of the themes of the Trump Administration and one of the themes is it's going dark I mean or or or it's got a very loose or some of hostile attitude towards the data the government is supposed to collect and make available ...\nJust a couple of examples in all all three agencies anything having to do with climate was removed and then in in several cases that were kind of odd removal of data so for example\nOr the department of agriculture had data on its website about cases that the government had brought against people who would abuse to animals I mean circuses and ranchers and so and so forth\nAnd that gets taken down and say kind of like you look at the specific instances of what happens why it's happened in almost every case there's some Trump supporter or Trump appointee who has some narrow financial interest in the removal of the data\nYou write about the environmental protection agency but that seems to fit with one of the themes that you write about in your book the office at the EPA that give scientific input\nTo the presidential administration the office of the science advisors era the plan is according to an anonymous source that the New York times reported on the plan is to eliminate that job altogether does that fit into the themes that you've seen in three departments that you write about\nWell you know it's funny because the broad impulse so the Trump Administration has been just not to fill the jobs I mean the top seven hundred jobs in the administration\nHalf of them are still on the field and the ones that are filled are filled often very oddly by people who don't have the expertise for the job so I Would say the broader pattern is one of just general neglected misunderstand\nWhat there's no question that Trump has been specifically hostile to environmental regulation and to the idea of climate change and it's\nPretty clear that the reason he's off though is he's got he's backed by by fossil fuels people um and where you do find places in ... in in my stories where\nWhere you can see the hand that handed work\nEither removing climate change data from websites are filling jobs that would be specifically addressing\nClimate and the environment with people who are totally inappropriate for the job so for example or in the agriculture department the chief scientist the person who's in charge of distributing the three billion dollars a year the agriculture department distributes to for basic research\nThis research is done is done now almost entirely to find ways to adapt the food supply to climate change um I mean it's it's it's absolutely critical is not going to be done in the private sector they head of his job to a right wing talk show radio host or who would back Trump it I\nMean it's just that kind of thing is going on throughout the administration\n[noise] spoken to fresh air is Dave Davies about a year ago after your second article on how Trump is running the federal government was published in Vanity Fair and and with Davey focused on the department of energy and agriculture you've added in your book the department of commerce and want to take a look at that\nAnd you're right that the department of commerce has very little to do directly with commerce and if in fact forbidden by law from engaging in business and you say that the department of commerce should really be called the department of information or the department of data why\nBecause that's what it does it's you know inside of the department of commerce you have the census for example which is the best picture we have of ourselves as a society you have\nThe a collection and assimilation of all the economic statistics and above all more than half the budget of the department is spent gathering weather and climate data I mean the national weather services inside the department of commerce\nAnd one of the great opportunities that exists with the federal government is the the better use of the day that collects all of a sudden we're able to parse the data in in ... and use the data in ways we've never been able to use it\nAnd that's a seemingly something that the that the person that Trump put in charge of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not interested in he sees the job is kind of like cheap trade negotiator which is odd because we have a chief trade negotiator\nAnd one of the big like data pool that um the\nCommerce Department is responsible for is the U.S census and the head of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not now involved in a lawsuit pertaining to a question on census um I I don't know if this is definitive or not the question on the twenty Eighteen census whether it's on there and\nWhile they're still is still argument about whether they're going to insert on the census a question of establishing whether the person who's reply to the census is citizen ... will do is queer the responses to the census\nLet's let's talk about why 'cause a lot of people will be afraid to answer that question\nWill be if people will be afraid to answer the question or people will be suspicious of the motives of the census takers\nRight and and a lot of immigrants live with somebody who isn't here legally so even if you're here legally if you know someone who isn't you might be afraid to say that you're an immigrant\nI think at this point that even people who are here who are legal who are fearful so actually there's actually back of a second they haven't even the gun to prepare them for the census I mean the the the real problem with the census is that it's way behind schedule and it hasn't been budget it for\nSo there's some question whether they're going to be able to pull off the census in the first place but then how you pull it off\nIs another question in there and starting this they're inserting a question that seems designed to dissuade especially Latino from answering it\nAnd one of the consequences if Latinos are underrepresented in the census\nFor starters you don't get a picture a correct picture of the correct congressional districts so we're districts need to be with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn of late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the date of the government collects is\nResearchers have been doing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example um we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country\nIf the data on prescription drugs and not been made available and not been possible if we don't have a picture of what the society it looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of the society that will occur\nSo if people suing Wilbur Ross the plaintiffs include over a dozen states in big cities who say that he acted improperly and trying to add this question about are you\nUm are you a U.S citizen I'm that he acted improperly and trying to add that to the census and the states and cities fear their political representation will be\nCalculated incorrectly because they will be misrepresented in a sentence if this question discourages immigrants from answering so\nWilbur Ross well did you were you surprised at the choice of him to have the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound ages here but I'm data and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore well we\nSo there was a piece in the times to describe the meeting that occurred between the Obama administration\nAnd all of the remaining presidential campaign so it was Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump's campaign this is still with the before the Republican primary was over there were four or five of the campaigns and had sent representatives and the reason is that happening was\nBy law the outgoing administration is required to prepare for the transition\nAnd buy a law anybody who's likely to get elected the cat is the two major parties are required to prepare to receive the the briefings and Christie saw this and he saw that\nThe person that Trump's campaign said nothing about government and so he called Corey Lewandowski was running the campaign said look I'll go do it if no one else will because we really need someone someone who understands government to get involved\nIt surprised me that after learning that the Trump Administration had nobody who could fill this role and didn't seem to care very much not filling this role that Christie was still sell in support of Trump and wanted to run their transition\nI think there are a couple of things going on at once one is as Christian makes quite clear but as other people have pointed out Trump didn't run to when he he didn't have an acceptance speech on the on the night of the election he was running for ... as an exercise in brand building\nAnd so his whole attitude towards preparing to be president was why bother and when people told him he had to spend money\nEither his money or campaign money to build a transition team he'd become furious and when you heard it was millions of dollars he'd scream at one point he said to Christie you know if we win you know I can leave the victory party two hours early and figure out everything we need to figure out about the government\nSo that they were both are smart\nYeah let's say if that's right so this is another theme that underlines all of this and that in the Trump operation the presence of rich people Trump and especially in Jared Kushner there's this sense that\nThey both think that because they're rich they must be smart but the combination of not wanting to spend the money not actually thinking he's gonna win\nAnd not being really interested in the subject at all leads Trump's to neglect the transition effort\nBut this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few million raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law any bills actually I think a quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments\nAnd receive the government for their ... the Obama administration\nIs so the bottom of Mr Asian has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books that have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems so you understood so this is how we dealt with the Zika virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic\nHere's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems this is what this department does this is how you do it\nAnd Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefing why did he fire them\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner pulled into\nAnd the jak cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey it put cushion his father in jail but that really doesn't explain it I don't say because there was no reason Trump had to listen to cushion are and there's also no reason you couldn't just just fired Christian kept everybody else on board\nI think what happened was that the number of people who were in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor\nOr were left off the list of people who are going to get jobs important jobs in the government and they were left off the list because the transition timid vet it all these people and found the problems with him\nSo some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they persuaded crop to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened in a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run a he'd been terrified to get rid of the people who were going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw for Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was this that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was the law they had to do it they didn't have any choice\nTrump pay no attention didn't take it seriously was irritated when every heard money was being spent\nBut no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win so Jared Kushner although we oversaw it kind of closely and made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused I think it ... he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fifth risk and the

Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the question\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that\nBook was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book kind of been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nWe were going to a public university and we had all these privileges\nBut we wanted democratic space inspired by student movements around the world the demonstrators spent the summer clashing with soldiers and police by September then president ... said enough was enough\nAnd have a stake in it and we've\nBeen tolerant but there are limits the eyes of the world are watching it said BSO last the world was watching and just over a month Mexico was to host the summer Olympics\nOn October second ten days before the opening ceremony thousands of defiance students spilled the plaza and the city's northern the local neighborhood law student ...

with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn of late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the date of the government collects is\nResearchers have been doing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example um we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country\nIf the data on prescription drugs and not been made available and not been possible if we don't have a picture\nOf what the society it looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of society that will\nOccur so that people suing Wilbur Ross the plaintiffs include over a dozen states\nIn big cities who say that he acted improperly and trying to add this question about are you\nUm are you a U.S citizen I'm that he acted improperly and trying to add that to the census and the states and cities fear their political representation will be\nCalculated incorrectly because they will be misrepresented in a sense is if this question discourages immigrants from answering\nSo\nWilbur Ross ... did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound a just here but I'm data and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep and meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who try to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who are brought in to try to explain how the department work to him\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment an additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad odor with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for the job and it turned out he had\nTwo billion dollars less than the forms rich lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice if he was very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist rest and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air and\nWomen are taught to come because being angry means slave will sound childlike emotional\nHysterical and that's the problem so many of us take care not to express our anger blessed we undercut the very point we want to make but nowadays more women save their wages not just health rational\nNext next tier one today at eleven on eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mall or investigation and now to um that Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nSo there was a piece in the times to describe the meeting that occurred between the Obama administration\nAnd all of the remaining presidential campaign so it was Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump's campaign this was still with the before the Republican primary was over there were four or five of the campaigns and had sent representatives and the reason is that happened was\nBy law the outgoing administration is required to prepare for the transition and buy a law anybody who is likely to get elected ... of the two major parties are required to prepare to receive the the briefings and Christie saw this and he saw that\nThe person the Trump campaign and said nothing about government and so he called Corey Lewandowski was running a campaign said look I'll go do it if no one else will because we really need someone someone who understands government to get involved\nIt surprised me that after learning that the Trump Administration had nobody who could fill this role and didn't seem to care very much and that feeling this role that Christie was still sell and supportive Trump and wanted to run their transition\nI think there are a couple of things going on at once one is as Christie makes quite clear but as other people have pointed out Trump didn't run into when he he didn't have an acceptance speech on the on the night of the election he was running for ... as an exercise and brand building\nAnd so his whole attitude towards preparing to be president was why bother and when people told him he had to spend money\nEither his money or campaign money to build a transition team had become furious and when you heard it was millions of dollars he'd scream at one point he said to Christie you know if we win you know I can leave the victory party two hours early and figure out everything we need to figure out about the government\nSo that they were both are smart yeah well that's where that\nIs that's right so this is another theme that underlines all of this and that in the Trump operation the presence of rich people Trump and especially then Jared Kushner there's this sense that they both think that because they're rich they must be smart but the combination of not wanting to spend the money not actually thinking he's gonna win\nAnd not being really interested in the subject at all leads Trump's to neglect the transition effort\nBut this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few million raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law and he builds actually I think are quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments\nAnd receive the government for their ... the Obama administration\nIf they bomb and Mr Asian has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books that have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems so you understood so this is how we dealt with the ... virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic\nHere's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems this is what this department does\nThis is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner pulled into\nAnd the jak cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey had put Kushner's father in jail but that really doesn't explain it I don't say because there was no reason Trump had to listen to cushion there and there's also no reason you couldn't have just fired Christian kept everybody else on board\nI think what happened was that a number of people who were in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor\nOr were left off the list of people who are going to get jobs important jobs and the government and they were left off the list because the transition timid vetted all these people and found problems with them\nSo some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they persuaded crop to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened in a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run a he'd been terrified to get rid of the people who are going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw Tara Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was this that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was a law they had to do what they didn't have any choice Trump pay no attention didn't take it seriously with irritated when every heard money was being spent\nBut no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win so Jared Kushner although we oversaw it kind of closely and made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused\nI think it was he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the this risk and
