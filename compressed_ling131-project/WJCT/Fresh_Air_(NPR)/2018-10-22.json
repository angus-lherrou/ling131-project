{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Frankly if you look at the all the new teachers that are coming in right now if anybody did anything that fence and said they walk away or really quickly from the union people just are introducing people to what their rights are and what they have and what are the value of the union is\nJoshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nLet's look ahead now a number of state legislatures are part time they've been out of session since the Janice ruling there's a chance we'll see some bills on collective bargaining introduced when the legislature start back up Mickey ... is a democratic state rep in Oklahoma he's also a former teacher and a member of a F T\nHe told us about legislation that he will introduce next year that would repeal his state's right to work amendment\nThe right to work past in two thousand one it's been nearly\nTwenty years and when you have an experiment that has failed I think it's worthwhile to go back and to look at the facts and to see it it has it increased wages has it helped with unemployment and the answer to that is no so when you have to show to experiment I think it's worthwhile for and I think it's also fair\nFor the people to go back and have the opportunity to correct that mistake and so I Am going to introduce a house joint resolution\nThat would have to be voted on in the house in it and approved by the governor and it would go back to the vote of the people to let them reevaluate okay it's been Twenty years how has this hotel has this help working class people are still the wage gap\nHouses have working class people have consistent hours to be able to support a family on one job\nHave safe working conditions once they account for all of those and they can go back to the polls and cast their vote on whether or not they'd like to repeal the so called right to work\nThat's Oklahoma democratic state rep Mickey balance who was also a former teacher and member of a F T not to be confused with Mickey ... for those of you who are fans of satirical sixties rock music we heard from some of you about these efforts to roll back right to work laws one listener emailed\nI live in Missouri where we just had a right to vote on the ballot and overwhelmingly failed\nThe Republicans who constantly are trying to tear down unions and claim right to work is good for every one\nAre constantly offering exemptions to police and fire unions from white to work laws if it's good for everyone why offer exceptions also Republicans say they will keep forcing this issue on the ballot even though it failed overwhelmingly Scott do you have any sense\nOf what the future of right to work might be like in states like Oklahoma Missouri and others\nWill certainly the Missouri a vote that you just referred to offers a hope to um to unions and pro union I'm a people across the country I mean that that vote the Republican legislature in Missouri approved a right to work bill and then I'm\nA people who oppose that decision were able to gather a tremendous number of signatures and and put it to a on the ballot and it failed overwhelmingly something close to Seventy percent of Missouri voters voted against that so I think I'm\nA certainly if you are a pro union person that offers you some hope and then also to talk about I think one of your callers said about\nUh wages and I'm a oh you're the Oklahoma legislator it is a case that these states that had these teacher walkouts largely over over stagnant wages West Virginia Oklahoma Kentucky Arizona all our our right to work states so I'm a you know that that might support his ah his point of view\nI Know we're a long time but Vincent furniture I Wonder what you make of the decision in Missouri not to become a right to work state\nWell first let's just talk about some of the the wage issues that were brought up a wages are actually going up faster in right to work states than in non right to work states and I mean even in Oklahoma Oklahoma wages have out paste the majority of non right to work states\nSince that stayed a gay workers the freedom to choose a well over a decade ago I'm\nJust so workers are making more in right to work states and uh you know Rand is out there in New York City and she can probably tell you how much rent is how much groceries are uh the catch is that in non right to work states things were more expensive so yeah workers are making more in New York but everything costs more\nYou'll forgive me and I know we're very short on time I Wonder what you make of Missouri voting against becoming a right to work state\nUh well listen I mean there is a a lot of reports of how much money was spent but you know somewhere three to one summer five to one when you get outspent by that much with misinformation like uh like we were just talking about with right to work in wages\nIt was a tough race but um you know I could see it coming back in other states are still embracing worker freedom are still looking to give workers the ability to choose and when they do we do see wages going up and out pacing those in non right to work states rainy before we go\nSo wages in right to work states are three point one percent lower than those in non right to work states the point is is people as one of the one as Sarah said people join unions because they want to have a better life\nAnd unions help them and their families have a better life and they help the people we serve like kids had the resources that we need and that is why people are sticking with unions all across the country we have not seen a drop\n'em in any significant way and in fact in lots of places we are growing because people need to thank you for having us on\nScott before we wrap up what should we be looking at a going forward any other agenda slave labor cases to watch out for a big difference in this fight over unions and right to work\nWell certainly some some a pro union people are worried that um that the Janice case is just the beginning that people are opposed you didn't try that that case applied just to the public sector and um\nEven though a since the new deal there has been in the Wagner Act this uh enshrined in law that the guarantee a for private sector employees to unionize certainly there are fears that among the pro union folks that there will be further efforts to undermine that\nScott Greenberg or executive editor of state line Scott thanks for talking to us thanks very much for having me Randi Weingarten president of the American federation of teachers thanks

talk about growing up on a farm her early comedy act her breakout role and bridesmaids and playing Trump's former press secretary Sean Spicer and Saturday Night live she was initially skeptical she could look like him\nReally lovely um special effects guy that they're just said oh yeah that can be hard at all that will take like a half an hour which I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to him\nBut it really was it\nAlso John Powers he used the BBC series bodyguard which premiered in the u._k. in August and became one of the biggest hits of the decade it drops on Netflix Wednesday\nAnd and carry another or producers newer for ten years so I really just kind of sad and listen to their stories and listen to you know\nHow difficult yet to me always so witty and kind of fascinating she was so I I I got a lot of the the characters from that and then the rest you know I kind of conjured in and created\nSo it was like I thought it was a very deep telling detail about Lee Israel's personality is that she had a Twenty one year old cat who was like in from and\nI'm at old and living under the bed\nApartment was infested with flies\nShe writes I found no connection between the flies and my cat litter box although it should've been clear that she was doing what my grandmother used to call her business under my bed and her business was attracting flies\nI did not smell anything rather like those serial killers who garnish their flask with hacked off human parts but never seem bothered by or even aware of the stench\nAnd I can't help but wonder like how you see on the film that the whole underneath her bed it's just covered with cat who and she's totally unaware of it but when someone else walks in an apartment they they have to leave it smells so much\nSo you had to ask yourself right when you're playing her like how could you not have noticed\nWell how how far into denial and\nThere was such an inner I thought you know there was such an inner spiral for Lee in terms of\nJust shutting down and pushing people away and and and going inward and so much play I kind of there was there seem to be such a struggle and interior struggle\nFor her and so much a kind of anger and frustration and it was it a point in her life where the one thing she could do which was right and she was a great writer [noise]\nShe was being told she was obsolete and I think she was just no longer you know just as though in the same way that she was not flexible are capable enough of simply starting a new career or or even getting a job and just dealing with people she she did not have that\nAbility she could only do the one thing and I I think the more her life spiraled out the less\nShe could ... you know see what was literally right there in front of her with like you know I I think there's a thing when people kind of just start to barricade on the interior of themselves that they're you know you do truly become in denial of what's right in front of your face\nIf you're just you're asked my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me [noise] so I Want to ask you about something you did so well which is playing Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live [laughter]\nPresident Trump's first press secretary who had a very oppositional relationship with the press so here's a here's here's the the leaving at least here here's your first outing as Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nTo be true [noise] me too\nYou know President Trump\nHis Supreme Court pick on the national TV\nWhen he entered the room the crowd and what they\nFind that\n[laughter]\nNo\nNo one was [noise]\nSomething [noise]\nScheduled for three forty five to\n... screening of finding don't\nForget show everybody likes that\nFamilies can abolish the national park system but\n[laughter] so great my middle ground which turned out his eyes or what do you think listening back to it I it's strange to hear back\nI forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so rattling I always wanted to\nKnow whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you is that just having a lot of folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them\nNo ... no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that in a million years um my friend can't sublet that's I'm\nOne of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh he called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what the I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do impersonation so I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheelhouse and he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know just come in and can I can I send you to read\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw another rather you know insane press conference where I thought\nOh this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely um special effects guy there just said oh yeah that's not gonna be hard at all that will take like a half an hour\nWhich I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man that really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point we were doing it in my view Fifteen minutes but\nIt was just thought to I think I get the feel I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold hold the mirror up and see if anyone realizes how kind of ridiculous they're being\nSo one of the things that you became famous for within that sketches the moving podium which you kind of Dr aggressively [laughter] reporters\nAnd then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal\nShooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nWe have sale end to the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of a Segway podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it was kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rig so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nIt was weird there were just you know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you can I look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of ... against the glass and I thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starring in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess as Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most ...\nAnd they had nowhere else to go we would you know my mom and would take the men and she thought what's the difference we're in a big farm it does help to keep my from ever getting into the house\nAnd she's a you know a soft and we all like to cats so they would stay outside they weren't you know it wasn't it wasn't like a\nA horror movie where there's an addict and are leaving her own [laughter] but uh you know and people would put boxes of cats like in our driveway I always thought it was kind of sad and and terrible but we we take 'em in and as kids we'd love it I think I\nThink it did definitely frightened parents of my friends the first time in the first time I got taken home\nThere was always a bit of a catch in my chest of like when they finally get down on the gravel road and they pull into the driveway there are going to be twenty five cats that rush out to the car in a very friendly way but it does seem like oh and this is this is how will all be killed and I just remember\nThe first time parents were always like oh my God oh my God I'm like it's fine I'll get out here I'll just get out here and they're like well why do you have so many cats and\nYou know it's like an eight year old kid you're like well I'm you know we just take them in and it's not as weird as it looks meanwhile you know they were just like get out get out of a car\nWhat did you see them you must have had a lot of cat food there's a lot of cat food there were we'd make like big pictures of food I remember using different I've not thought about this [noise]\nWe I Believe these like carnation powdered milk and we'd like rip up bread and lots of cat food and make this kind of stew concoction and then go out on the back porch and you know and call all the cats and\nThat's a lot of thought to come running at one point you know especially if some of the cats were newer and a little more slightly feral my mom was very I'm aware\nOf making sure all the cats got pets so they got used to people and used to being around and she's really sweet so Sandy would always at each cat while they were eating and make sure that they got used to like people touching them and at one point she was out there doing that and when she stood up\nShe realized that one of the cats was a skunk\n[laughter] she said she hadn't been chatting and heading this kind of like you like that is that a good\nDinner and then she stood up and the light that she had been blocking with her body the light hit the skunk\nSo yeah it was a all all were welcome I guess is the take away their hope she didn't get sprayed by the skunk she didn't it just kept eating she kind of you know it's probably the only time for sure that got hit by a human\nMelissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about uh either acting or comedy which came for us like acting or comedy but comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and I moved to New York and I was twenty kind of out of the blue a pet and living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why I was even there I'd move there with my sister and then just was still kind of lingering and uh\nHad a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York\nSo three days later I moved to New York city\nThat night he found a place to do stand up the next an open Mike night the next day 'cause\nLike I said this has really talked about stand up but I think\nI kind of did a lot of telling stories and like to you know I found it fun to make people laugh and our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right I think because I was twenty and\nYou just kind of think everything's not a big deal I figure you know now I Would be terrified but at twenty I just went okay that seems fine we're not doing anything else and I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but it was really my it's what I did on you know I really loved it I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm going to go this direction [laughter]\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\nI Do strange I'm sure it was terrible uh I was a stand up in New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or\nAnd I went up on stage and you know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver\nMetallic kind of trench coat dress and\nAnd I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it would seem so he gets hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they were harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen since I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself and my complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this is really fun this is really strange and fun and such a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged and he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on his missed why I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous in more bold and brazen and I would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as his character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that\n... would you always dress the way you described a\nI was always recognize lately completely ... in a different I was always in a huge wig some very elaborate costume 'em but\nOh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends brain that would who now is a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and go do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like you know we we're ... swing Cape or some kind of scuba suits thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous in and fun and I just thought well why now\nAnd what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out let's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie called can you ever forgive me we'll be right back after this break this is fresh air\n\nFor NPR comes from this station\nMore than five hundred\nTire

career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nWhich is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer than probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] it when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nTop off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does it ever worked for

... is director of educational resources for the Florida Historical Society and park of is that the library of Florida history in cocoa [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nFishes Florida frontiers the first professional football team in Florida was not the dolphins or the jaguars or the bucks as Robert ... from the University of central Florida\nPublic history program explains it was the Miami Seahawks\nTeam was located in Miami and it was a team was called the Miami sea hawks and they were\nPart of the all American football coach ... conference that was organized in Nineteen forty four uh by arch ward who was the sports editor of the Chicago Tribune and knew it and was the inventor of the baseball's all star game and the college all star game uh in football\nMiami was obviously not a big league town at this point it turns out Miami was the smallest of any of the cities have done a fc French as it turned out also that in the end it probably did not have enough fan base to support a covert taught him\nThat was Dr Richard ... author of NFL football history of America's new national pastime\nHe smoked me about the Nineteen forty six Miami Seahawks the very first professional football team to call Florida home the Seahawks we're part of a short lived all American football conference or da and see that was a rival to the national football league\nThe Seahawks only lasted one season Dr ... tells us why this new league and team emerged after World War two\nProfessional football was still at the margins the NFL was at the margins the AFC is certainly was at the margins what what what the founders of the league we're looking at an early forties\nWas there believe that coming out of the war there was going to be a kind of prosperity in America and the prosperity would generate more leisure time and more leisure time could be transformed into more organized sport as entertainment\nAnd a lot of people who invested in a sea and some of the people who were investors in the NFL were looking to make some money doesn't they're always those people who get into professional sport because they're looking for exposure to promote themselves to sell their own ego and certainly that was involved with fellow nurses will\nDr ... tells us why they struggled\nWell I think if they had a winning season they might have they might have survived\nI don't think they were ever going to make a lot of money because of the city just wasn't picking up your just weren't going to draw that many people got people were going to go watch football they were probably going to go watch the Miami Hurricanes then you had to give them some reason to come to watch this\nThe hawks Seahawks than they have any big stars have big players so why go there initially they drew twenty five twenty six thousand fans for the first couple of games\nBut they were losing almost all the time they lost seven out of their first date games and the base just disappeared a and the second half of the season they were drawing about nine thousand pants\nThey wound up facing bankruptcy at the end and uh they couldn't get enough money to keep the team going\nThe Seahawks had a difficult relationship with the Cleveland Browns\nOne of the things that really hurt them initially so you had to play the first three games on the road and they had to play their first game against Cleveland at the Cleveland Browns and it turns out the Cleveland Browns was the best buy for the best team in the new league probably the best team in professional football\nCertainly by Nineteen fifty they were the best team in professional football but many people would argue even in forty six they weren't that good or the the opening game they lost I think forty four to nothing and was downhill from there because they say\nLater in the season when Cleveland came to play Miami at home the game would be no tourists for the racial climate that was present in the city\nCleveland had two African American players and when they were scheduled to come and play in Miami\nUh and when they were they play it of course the first game in Cleveland against Miami and there was no issue there but when they were scheduled to come down to Miami to play first of all the the Miami ownership notified the Cleveland Browns and Paul Brown the they they should bring their African American players\nBut there was a law in Florida against interracial competition in sport and they would love to play\nAnd there was a good deal of consternation and browse organization about what to do and whether the challenge this\nAnd in the end I think what persuaded them not to bring the players was there were a number of threads that came to the players from people in Miami and then the and Paul Brown thought you know this was not going to be a difficult game he didn't have to have all of his players they're going to win easily and why risk\nOr why put somebody at risk for that and so they didn't bring their players are and so it's one of the new one of those in another little interesting dark moments in the history of segregation in sport at a time period when sport was desegregating\nThe NFL desegregated the Nineteen forty six uh and and essentially what the AFC never had to desegregate because they never had segregation they gotta protect American players from the beginning\nThat was Dr Richard ...\nAnd I'm rubber cast mellow with Florida frontiers\nYou've been listening to Florida frontiers the weekly radio magazine of the Florida Historical Society\nJoining us right here again next

T.\nYour community your world from electronic\nUh to blues listen to after every Monday to friday nine PM only an eighty nine nine that family your community your world during these\n[noise]\n\nThese guys overnight lows in the mid ... accused a cloudy but scattered showers hike in there to help our seventies partly sunny Wednesday bases eighty nine nine of the Jaycee teach Jacksonville your community your world\nSome WHYY in Philadelphia and Terry Gross from Russia Today Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new found can you ever forgive me as a biographer tang literary forging\nWe'll talk about growing up on a farm her early comedy her breakout role and bridesmaids and playing Trump's former press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night on she was initially skeptical she could look like\nThey're really lovely and special effects guys they're just said oh yeah that hang in the heart and all that will take like a half an hour which I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a\nMan and that really wasn't\nA John power as easy as the BBC series bodyguard which premiered in the u._k. in August and became one of the biggest hit them for decades it drops on Netflix Weinstein that's on fresh\n\nAnd and carry another our producers newer for ten years so I really just kind of sad and listen to their stories and listen to you know\nHow difficult yet to me always so witty and kind of fascinating she was so I I I got a lot of the the characters from that and then the rest you know I kind of conjured in and created\nSo it was like I thought it was a very deep telling detail about Lee Israel's personality is that she had a Twenty one year old cat who was like in ... and\nI'm at old and living under the bed\nApartment was infested with fly yeah\nI found no connection between the flies and my cat litter box although it should've been clear that she was doing what my grandmother used to call her business under my bed and her business was attracting flies\nI did not smell anything rather like those serial killers who garnish their flats with hacked off human parts but never seem bothered by or even aware of the stench\nAnd I can't help but wonder like how you see on the film that the whole underneath her bed it's just covered with cat who and she's totally unaware of it but when someone else walks in apartment they they have to leave it smells so much\nSo you have to ask yourself right when you were playing her life how could you not have noticed\nWell how how far into denial and there was such an inner I thought you know there was such an inner spiral friendly in terms of\nJust shutting down and pushing people away and and and going inward and so much play I kind of there was there seem to be such a struggle and interior struggle\nFor her and so much a kind of anger and frustration and it was it a point in her life where the one thing she could do which was right and she was a great writer [noise]\nShe was being told she was obsolete and I think she was just no longer you know just as though in the same way that she was not flexible are capable enough of simply starting a new career or or even getting a job and just dealing with people she she did not have that\nAbility she could only do the one thing and I I think the more her life spiraled out the less\nShe could you know see what was literally right there in front of her with like you know I I think there's a thing when people kind of just start to barricade\nOn the interior of themselves that they're you know you do truly become in denial of what's right in front of your face\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me [noise] so I Want to ask you about something you did so well which is playing Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live [laughter]\nPresent Trump's first press secretary who had a very oppositional relationship with the press so here's a here's here's the the leaving at least here here's your first outing as Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\n[laughter] me too me too\n[noise]\nYou\nKnow it's a pretty important pick on the national TV\nWhen answering the wrong crowd greeted and what they\n[laughter]\n\nNo one was [noise]\nSomething else [noise]\nSchedule for three forty five to\nWell of course screening of finding don't [laughter] forgetful show everyone and\nThen if we can abolish the national park system\n[laughter] that's great my middle ground which turned out his eyes are [laughter] what do you think listening back to\n... I it's strange to hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so I also rattling I\nAlways wanted to know whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you is that the Senate life folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them\nNo ... no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that in a million years um my friend can sublet that's I'm\nOne of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh he called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what the I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do impersonation so I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in\nMy wheelhouse and he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know just come in and can I can I send you to read and I I think I said oh I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw another rather you know insane press conference where I thought\nWell this is weird or than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely um special effects guy there just said oh yeah that's not gonna be hard at all that'll take like a half an hour which I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a\nMan that really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point\nWe were doing it in my view Fifteen minutes but it was just thought to I think I got the ... I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold hold a mirror up and to see if anyone realizes how kind of ridiculous they're being\nSo one of the things that that you became famous for within that sketches the moving podium which you'd kind of Dr aggressively [laughter]\nReporters and then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal shooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nWe kind of seal into the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of a Segway podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it was kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rigs so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they've built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nAnd it was weird there were just\nYou know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you could I'd look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of press against the glass and they thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air\nAnthony Scaramucci remains loyal from ministry despite his brief and rocky tenure as White House communications director\nNow he says the personal twice and dramatic day to hide\nHis book the blue collar president lays out what she says he's got long and what Donald Trump got white Anthony Scaramucci\nNext time on one week days at eleven on eighty nine nine doubled Jaycee T. [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess as Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene\nWhen the right on the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying I like really expensive fancy bridal dress yet um\nYou know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive down that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross and I'm Wondering how you felt about\nThat scene because part of a of the scene part of the point of the movie is that you know women can do\nGross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and then ... none of us felt\nAnd they had nowhere else to go we would you know my mom and would take the men and she felt well what's the difference we're in a big farm it does help to keep my from ever getting into the house\nAnd she's a you know a soft and we all like to cats so they would stay outside they weren't you know it wasn't it wasn't like a a horror movie\nWith us and our living our own [laughter] but uh you know\nAnd people would put boxes of cats I cannot drive I always thought it was kind of sad and and terrible but we we take them in and as kids we'd love it I think I think it did definitely frightened parents of my friends the first time in the first time I got taken home\nThere was always a bit of a catch in my chest of like\nWhen they finally get down the gravel roads and they pull into the driveway there are going to be twenty five cats that rush out to the car in a very friendly way but it does seem like oh and this is this is how will all be killed and I just remember\nThe first time parents were always like oh my God oh my God I'm like it's fine I'll get out here I'll just get out here and they're like well why do you have so many cats and you know it's like an\nEight year old kid you're like well I'm you know we just take them in and it's not as weird as it looks meanwhile you know they were just like\nGet out get out of the car what did you see them you must have had a lot of cat food there is a lot of cat food there were we'd make like big pictures of food I remember using ... I've not thought about this\nWe believe these carnation powdered milk and we'd like rip up bread and lots of cat food and make this kind of stoop concoction and then go out on the back porch and you know and call all the cats and\nA lot of thought to come running at one point you know especially if some of the cats were new we're in a little more slightly feral my mom was very I'm aware\nOf making sure all the cats got pets so they got used to people and used to being around and she's really sweet so Sandy would always pet each cat while they were eating and make sure that they got used to like people touching them and at one point she was out there doing that and when she stood up\nShe realized that one of the cats was a skunk\n[laughter] she [laughter] she didn't chatting and heading this kind of like you like that is that a good\nDinner or and then she stood up and the light that she had been blocking with her body the light hit the skunk\nSo yeah it was a all all were welcome I guess is the take away their I Hope she didn't get sprayed by the skunk she didn't it just kept eating she got you know it's probably the only time for sure it got pet by a human\nMelissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy that combination standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and I moved to New York and I was twenty kind of out of the blue pit and living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I'd move there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and uh\nI had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York\nSo three days later I moved to New York city\nThat night he found a place to do stand up the next an open Mike night the next day 'cause\nLike I said this is really talked about stand up but I think\nI kind of did a lot of telling stories and like to you know I found it fun to make people laugh and our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right I think because I was twenty and\nYou just kind of think everything's not a big deal I figure you know now I Would be terrified but at twenty I just went okay that seems fine we're not doing anything else and I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT ahead and finish school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but it was really my it's what I did on you know I really loved it I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designers studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm gonna go this direction [laughter]\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\nI Do strange it I'm sure it was terrible uh I was a stand up in New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and you know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver\nMetallic kind of trench coat dress and\nAnd I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so he gets his typical and nurses cystic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they were harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen since I was a tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this is really fun this is really strange and fun and such a tight rope active when they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged and he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of again\nI went on as a character I went on his missed why I never would have ...\nAnd as myself but through a character I could be more ridiculous and more bold and brazen and I would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as of character I could and I just felt the great freedom in that\nWe do always dress the way you describe a\n... yeah I was always completely completely ... in a different I was always in a huge wig some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends Brian out what who now as a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and\nGo do stand up at night and I would throw in one of his like you know we we're ... swing Cape or some kind of scuba suit thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous in and fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie called can you ever forgive me we'll be right back after this break this is fresh air\nThis is Ira Glass of this American Life and I'm coming to Jacksonville given talk that costs seven things

stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nWhich is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nWho is one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy
