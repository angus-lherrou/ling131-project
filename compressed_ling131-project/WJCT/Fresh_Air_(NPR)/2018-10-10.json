I'm not a fan from his comedy but like I thought he did a good job with that character like he he was that guy if I could have cast anybody not knowing who he wasn't as prior life I thought he worked\nI suppose yes if we cast aside your entire prior life he sometimes are very smart charming screen and very true very true speaking of that I\nCould have been in the film John I knew were low on time but there had been reports that ... had apparently been in the running to play the character that lady Gaga ultimately God is that true what\nHappened there are very much true and that was in at a ration of the film that at one point Clint Eastwood was going to direct\nA Beyonce was even briefly you're going to be back with the Bradley Cooper version I think actually Lady Gaga is a much better casting choice because I don't know that you could really watch that film but the ... and I keep saying to yourself\nThat say oh that'd be on say and I think Lady Gaga has a better ability to do it in fact Andrew dice clay got that part of our people like Robert De Niro and John ... and\nJohn Travolta the one thing I Will say about Andrew dice clay yes he's a horrible massage minister comic\nThat does kind of ... one of the premises of the movie which is that Jack's character says you can't reinvent yourself you can't become this different artists and yet Bradley Cooper changes his voice an octave so he doesn't sound like Bradley Cooper\nAnd Andrew dice clay who has in his comedy been a horrible human being becomes a nice loving father so some of the choices in the movie itself\nBut why jacks complaint that you can't become a different artist as your career progressed\nCharacter but go ahead and go ahead and do it and I just wanted\nSays Andrew dice clay plays a loving father who is also however at a patriarch who um himself wished he had been at a famous singer I'm ... you know he plays those Frank Sinatra lines for last you know people said he was like Frank Sinatra but\nIn a strange way that character replaces the daddy elements of previous a male protect its so like for example the James Mason\nNorman main character played against right Garland\nUm he felt like a daddy he felt much older and and you know really patriarchal guiding her career I\nFeel like the Andrew dice clay character is not entirely sympathetic and this is you know maybe a radical reading but I feel like hey right right this is why this character this Lady Gaga except this other daddy\nWe've got to do on right there um Oregon and our critic and correspondent for NPR's Linda Holmes of NPR's pop culture happy hour podcast John horn hosted the frame from TV sci fi thank you all for being with us I'm Joshua Johnson thanks for listening this is one [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bone a certified Crossman program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and customer service contract to locate her and more information or at bona dot com\nFrom his Cox insurance providing customized insurance for small and medium businesses so they can do more and be more learn more at H.

they used in the sixties those capsules were tiny clamp rickety with knives and meters from the analog era often they feel more like\nExtensions of the machine age in the space age they feel like

loitering worth reviews the new collection of yo yo ma recordings of ... cello sweet [noise]\nA big fan of the instruments a pheromone which we use a lot in the in the score a loss of a lots of little amused musical idiosyncrasies with them though the wind up with my own\n[noise] you know an experience I had watching the movie and and I think a lot of people probably a lever Willie feeling this way is that you know as a live from the moon landing and I remember watching it on television it all seemed like so incredibly high tech and now fifty years later seeing\nAre we productions of the technology that was used and it looks so relatively low tax I mean kind dashboard look more high tech today and some of the control panels in space capsule\nUm they're they're they're like knobs and I'm ... and a lot meters [laughter] yeah it just makes you wonder like how did they do this\nHow do they do this without the kind of computer and digital technology that we have today\nWas ah it makes it even more astonishing I think you know it's it's it's astonishing enough that human beings have ever walked in the moon but they did it over fifty years ago um with the technology that they had\nYou know these capsules we're not really a I Would say we're not kind of reassuring to look at when you're about to get into them or they're tiny they're rickety are they as you say are totally kind of analog and feel I mean I often they feel more like extensions of the machine age the MySpace age they feel like things that you would expect out of a World War two\nSubmarine or tank movie\nVery much the opposite I think of how at least my generation grew up thinking about space travel which was high tech which was you know it was a everything having to do with space travel in the movies with sleek and grand and clean and just the epitome of technology um and really this was a\nThis was a time where you know we were being thrust into the future before the future it arrived and I just find that fascinating and you have a group of people literally make up as they go on [noise]\nYou know an example of all the things that could possibly go run in um the Gemini eight flight the this is like the first there's going to be the test at the first space craft to dock with another spacecraft to see if that's possible [laughter]\nAnd so you know a Neil Armstrong's on on that mission and as he's getting strapped in the space capsule before takeoff\nOn this really daring and dangerous mission they realize the seatbelt isn't working like the mechanism stock and well one of the members of the ... says hey does anybody have a Swiss army knife\nAnd it just makes you think about if the seatbelt isn't working just think about other things that could possibly go wrong um and I kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nA sort of be hitting me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nI think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nOr and also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to\nYou know at every juncture be looking at Neal in conjunction with with Janet Janet Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about this period in their life and just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to\nA family where you were trying to raise kids you know ... to\nYou know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York catastrophe in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash and clean the pool and help make his kids breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that the ... this mission nearly ended in catastrophe after um\nAfter his space craft talks with the fuel spacecraft in space is first time one space craft has docked with another\nThe whole thing gets out of control anything safe you know like the the the spacecraft that he's talked with that's causing everything to be out of control so he ... and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in out of control\nAnd he's just kind of spinning and and tumbling and it's noisy and it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes\nWhere you can just experience\nThe the and the extremes of being I'm In a space capsule and this case because\nIt's kind of lost control but in other cases ... entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it set to Iraqi cried so why don't you talk about that spacecraft seen Africa after they dock\nWe wanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up um and I think what was interesting about the gym night mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have this sort of you know everyone kind of feeling like ah like royalty as they should\nAnd right away you know almost like a trick is to say\nThis problem you you described began\nAnd it's not just that it was a this you know kind of immediately life threatening issue but uh but also the confusion of it um and so keeping the camera inside the capsule as much as possible not sort of cutting out to a big wide shots that would\nThat would sort of overly explain things trying to really be subjective and immersive to what Neal himself and he and his and his colleague Dave Scott would be experienced and I think that was really important to us\nAnd that was just one of many instances of you know I guess what I'd\nQualify as you're near failures or in certain cases failures that led the way to the success story of the moon landing um um so I think trying to remind audiences how fragile this all was how dangerous or the lives that almost cost in some cases the lives that did cos\nI'm you know I think it helps us appreciate maybe just just a how hard earned that final moonwalk really was\nIntroducing here if you're just joining us my guess is Demian ... and he directed the new movie first man that Neil Armstrong at an ... to be the first man to walk on the moon he also wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll be right back this is ...\n\n\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Daniel ... who directed the new movie the first man that Neil Armstrong the space program in the sixties and Armstrong's walk on the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and Damien ... also wrote and directed not on land and whip lash\nMine could you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercises just sending you can viscerally experience it and therefore portraying\nWe tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used full scale replicas of these capsules there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same our production designer or they think Crowley did incredible job sort of rebuilding these things and we ... we would mount though you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to ah and we would set those up against a giant\nI'm you know that ... that they were able or you know it was something in their character that sort of mid western I'm a\nKind of ... that they had an awesome you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture that was just able to do the impossible without complaint and uh you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when uh you know you're you're you're moving from place to place you know since you say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot VX Fifteen and he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity or and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job in in a way eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and and almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way um but of course that's complicated is that\nAnd uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know the the kind of day by day activities in instances of that we picked in a movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moment to the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a ... to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tell us somebody may not return\nThat made him to do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded in Japan since book I'm a but a beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what the conversation actually wasn't then what these suing dinner table conversation actually was\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from ah from what she recollect from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking baton apparently in real life to uh Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his hands saying like I might not make it back like she demanded that he has to do it and that she wasn't going to do it he had you up you know\nAnd and he has been in this incredible like low key way without really\nThat really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a or at least the only way they felt they could get through was was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nUh I think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and uh actually sitting down and facing them or you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void space you know he he was he was a man without any fear\nOr they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep gnawing fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] um congestion her way to get the score for the film and you also work\nWith him on whiplash another land you met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um\nI Know music is very important to you doing to the moon landing sequence um there's music that's happened to me like part military part like western theme music and you Star Trek refer to space has the final frontier [laughter]\nSo I don't even know intentional to have a kind of western an edge to catch the rhythm sounds part military ... kind of galloping portions in less than\nA well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping could sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflected Neal state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kind of get a sense of it when you listen to the ... ah themselves that\nSeason in the inner comes when you are\nYeah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio or between the capsule and kept calm and mission control and whatnot um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you can listen to all of it online and and ah\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going to land that thing I wasn't going to be stopped in and uh\nYou know a everyone had come too far at that point to turn around and and uh and you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent of the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music wise if we could get into Neal is mine space if we can get into that sense of just a relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would be fit to see\nOK let's hear some of that music and the moon landing music\nLanding and you're saying from just inherently to score\nThe first man and a movie that Neil Armstrong\nAnd his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon my guest Amy and she's now directed the movie he also directed not on land and ...\nSaying that your film has become controversial for in some circles as that even getting show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know\nIn real time on camera from the moon is it an excerpt of a transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative publication the Daily Caller this is from September fourth\nThe interviewer asked for Trump thoughts on the fact that the planning of the plant was not shown news asked do you think that's upsetting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of the time it's like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon\nYou think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then you have to think that people should go see the movie and ... says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about\nThe flag material in the movie you know I think it was\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that a kid arouse I think are obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times so to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each beat of the mission and mapping out you know in showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking of the rod into the into the litter soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as he first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his ... sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this um\nThose are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nThis family managed to haven't transferred to Vanderbilt from an outlying hospitals\nThey'll tell you the rest of the story but when you walk in the room you'll see what we're doing now there's only a few days like\nRichard Harris is very high ranting nice to meet you Randy ... started out in Los Angeles where he lived eaten tuna sandwich that he suspects and gone bad the day before he hopped a plane to visit his son in Nashville\nAnd we got on a plane and I just didn't feel right\nNow I asked and like you know\nWhat was going on these you know I was gay and he's saying it's by hand and bothering me\nHis wife Karen couldn't convince ready to go to a doctor until the symptoms got out of control\nWas rushed to the emergency room closest to his son's house\nHour from Nashville and they just started putting in terms of wind up going to work and doing different things and kind of similar to what was happening in at that point because\nImagine the shock when you go in there and they're like oh every Oregon and shutting down and have completely sepsis sepsis\nAs a leading cause of death in hospitals it's the bodies overwhelming reaction to an infection ... case was so bad the forty nine year old men ended up on a respirator and dialysis drugs sunk him into a state of quiet Elyria\nBecause he was supposed to be lightly sedated and he was\nHeavily sedated and that was not a good thing\nKaren says when the hospital told her to start calling next of kin and it was time to get them transferred stat to hospital better equipped to treat him within twenty four hours of arriving at Vanderbilt Randy's condition had turned around completely he was off dialysis the ventilator in off the drugs that put him into a delirious have\nApparently I'm pretty much of a miracle\nHe said that you were on one out of a thousand\nRecovery still lies ahead\nI'm starting to get locked accolades about man my brains starting to work really get again but\nJust the fact that I can you know carry a conversation right now it's pretty amazing in itself and you've actually been up and walk around a little bit of a lot done labs around the size of aids for anyway I mean I'm not going to do I mean that drink too much but yeah I Walk quite a bit\nDr early returns to the room and explains to the ... family what he'd done to help bring about this dramatic change it wasn't just good medical attention it was a philosophy\nYou know when you get on an airplane you get safely to the next location because airline industry has a checklist\nWhen he started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and they figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually he started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic tasks first they figured out when it's safe to take someone off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to remove people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberate should not what you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nElite came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patience to health as quickly as possible\nTo put all of this into a bundle which we now call the ... a B C D E F bundle\nBundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which couldn't caused Elyria patients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator F is for family engagement us as these all reduce the amount of time patients spend delirious\nAnd that in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of the bed early that eat part is cuts to him and a half so these things are all intersecting\nHe sits on a ... bed ... explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and\nTreat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them holistically\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again that they view\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered dementia by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patience it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey had been doing some elements of the bundle\nPulling it altogether a to F is a challenge Dr Kirk Volcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects\nPatients require more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into we're talking about a a\nCultural change so we have to have buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by and then you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and they only do rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says though they're still resistant to using the a through F checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F\nIs the exception it was even a challenge to make it routine at Vanderbilt\nBut the ... and I can't be\nJoanna starlings a clinical pharmacists to the ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through\nThey need to many cat were nice to be here and bracing for gay in San ... helped me had champion this project really empower the interstate ... makes it happening every day\nWith him at least crusade now is to make this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend an expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the human being and so if they're getting better care surviving more often with a more intact brain and not bouncing back to the ice you always see some financial benefits to needed to win with\nRichard Harris NPR News\nPeople on the Florida Panhandle are hunkering down as hurricane Michael Harrison through

tech\nAnd moist Schwartz reviews the new collection of yo yo ma recordings of ... cello sweets [noise]\nYou know an experience I had watching the movie and and I think a lot of people probably a lever Willie feeling this way that you know I have a life and the moon landing and I remember watching it on television it all seemed like so incredibly high tech\nAnd now fifty years later seeing a reproductions of the technology that was used and it looks so relatively low tech I mean card dashboard look more high tech today and some of the control panels and the space capsule\nUm they're they're they're like knobs and I'm ... and a lot meters [laughter] yeah it just makes you wonder like how did they do this\nHow do they do this without the kind of computer\nOh gee that we have today\nWas ah it makes it even more astonishing I think you know it's it's astonishing enough that human beings have ever walked in the moon but that they did it over fifty years ago um with the technology that they had you know these capsules we're not really a I Would say we're not kind of reassuring to look at when you're about to get into them\nOr they're tiny they're rickety are they as you say are totally kind of analog and feel I mean I often they feel more like extensions of the machine age the MySpace age they feel like things that you would expect out of a World War two submarine or tank movie\nVery much the opposite I think of how at least my generation grew up thinking about space travel which was high tech which was you know it was a everything having to do with space travel in the movies was sleek and grand and clean and just the epitome of technology um and really this was a\nThis was a time where you know we were being thrust into the future before the future it arrived and I've just find that fascinating and you have a group of people literally make up as they go along [noise]\nYou know an example of all the things that could possibly go wrong in um the Gemini eight flight the this is like the first there's going to be the test at the first space craft to dock with another spacecraft to see if that's possible [laughter] and so you know a Neil Armstrong's on on that mission\nAnd as he's getting strapped in two states capsule before takeoff\nOn this really daring and dangerous mission they realize the seatbelt isn't working like a mechanism stock and well one of the members of the ... says hey does anybody have a Swiss army knife and it just makes you think about if the seatbelt isn't working just think about other things that could possibly go wrong\nUm and I kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nA sort of be hitting me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nAnd I think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nOr and also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to you know at every juncture be looking at Neal in conjunction with with Janet with Jan and Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about this period in their life\nAnd just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to a family where you're trying to raise kids you know in ... case to you know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York it asked her the in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash and clean the pool and help make his kids breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that that this mission nearly ended in catastrophe\nAfter um after his space craft\nStocks with the fuel spacecraft in space is the first time one space craft has docked with another\nThe whole thing gets out of control anything safety I like the the the spacecraft that he's talked with that's causing everything to be out of control so he ... and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in out of control and he's just kind of spinning\nAnd tumbling and it's noisy and it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes where you can just experience\nThe the and the extremes of being I'm In space capsule and this case because\nIt's kind of lost control but in other cases you're entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it's a ... right so why don't you talk about that spacecraft seen Africa after they on dark\nWe wanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up\nUm and I think what was interesting about the Gemini mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have this sort of you know everyone kind of feeling like a like royalty as they should\nAnd right away you know almost like a trick to face\nThis problem you you described began and it's not just that it was a this you know kind of immediately life threatening issue but uh but also the confusion of it um and so keeping the camera inside the capsule as much as possible not sort of cutting out to big wide shots that would\nThat would sort of overly explain things trying to really be subjective and immersive to what Neal himself and he and his and his colleague Dave Scott what the experience and I think that was really important to us\nAnd that was just one of many instances of you know I guess what I'd qualify as you're near failures or in certain cases failures that led the way to the success story of the moon landing um um so I think trying to remind audiences how fragile this all was how dangerous\nOr the lives that almost cost in some cases the lives that did cos I'm you know I think it helps us appreciate maybe just just a how hard earned that final moonwalk really was\nIntroducing here if you're just joining us my guess is deem inches out and he directed the new movie first man that Neil Armstrong at an all a tip to be the first man to walk on the moon he also wrote and directed la la land\nAnd whiplash we'll be right back this is ...\nYou can sum up the Raymond caissons activism in forwards show up dive in we have\nTo be on the inside can't just be an out that only strategy and that is very different than it was before Trump won since Michael Brown was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri and the cats and has become a leading voice and the lightning rod and the black lives matter movement now selling his own story next time on one end\nWeekdays at ten after first find eighty nine nine W. J. C team your community your world\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Damien ... who directed the new movie the first man that Neil Armstrong the space program in the sixties in Armstrong's walk\nOn the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and Damien ... also wrote and directed not Iran and whiplash\nWhat did you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercises you can viscerally experience it and therefore\nPortraying while\nWe've tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used full scale replicas of these capsules they were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same our production designer Nathan Crowley did incredible job sort of rebuilding these things and we ... we would mount though you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to ah and we would set those up against a ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of stroke\nBut you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real to shake and we'll be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nI'm you know that ... that they were able\nOr you know it was something in their character as sort of mid western I'm a\nKind of ... that they had that also you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture that was just able to do the impossible without complaint and uh you know I really got a vivid sensitive when talking to ... you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when uh you know ... you're you're you're moving from place to place you miss it to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for ... you know test pilot VX Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity or and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just looked at me and and almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way um but of course as complicated as that\nAnd uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities in instances of that we depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moment to the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a ... to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tell them that he may not return the\nMade him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded and Jim Hansen's book I'm a but a beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from ah from what she recollection and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to uh Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his hands saying I might not make it that like she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yucky and that and and he has been in this incredible like\nLow key way without really that really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that is sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know it is in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nUh I think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and uh actually sitting down and facing them\nOr are you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep gnawing fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] um congestion how did the score for the film and you also work\nWith him on whiplash another land he met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um\nI Know music is very important to you during the the moon landing sequence um there's music that has to me like part military part like western theme music and Star Trek refer to space has the final frontier [laughter]\nSo I don't think ... to have a kind of western edge to it because there were them it sounds ... military impact kind of galloping portions in less than\nA well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping could sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflected in the state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kinda get a sense of it when you listen to the ... ah themselves to the intercom when\nYou are yeah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio or between the capsule and kept calm a U.N mission control and whatnot um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you can listen to all of it online and and uh\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going to land that thing I wasn't going to be stopped and and uh you know a everyone it come too far at that point to turn around and and uh\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent\nOf the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music wise if we could get into Neal is mine space if we can get into that sense of just a relentless on stopping drive\nUm ah it would it would be fit to sing\nOkay let's hear some of that music and this is ... music\nThat's moon landing music from just in her way to score\nFirst man and a movie about Neil Armstrong\nAnd his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon my guest Demian ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and whiplash\n[noise] the thing that your film has become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera from ...\nIn an excerpt of a transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative publication the Daily Caller\nThis is from September fourth\nThe interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... was not shown was asked do you think that's upsetting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of it's almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's asked do you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that a carousel I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flack standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking of the brought into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nOr we made a choice entirely instead of choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "10"}
