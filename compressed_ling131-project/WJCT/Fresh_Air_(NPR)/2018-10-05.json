{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "And that makes the national news yeah the impact would be devastating\nRoger let me ask you clearly you are putting this the defeat of Governor Scott but is there any uh blaming your mind to a senator Nelson and a federal response or lack there of during his tenure in the United States Senate especially\nWell it could be I mean I guess she could have maybe he did attempt to do something and just couldn't get it done I don't know\nUm you know there's talk about the Diet Coke ... Koch control the and so forth but you know red tide is is is red tide and and Mother Nature has the last say in gets revenge and you add Rick Scott right here in Florida who has seen this and for seven and a half years\nHurt the environment and now in an election year and the last six weeks or so before the election finally gives our southeastern counting some money to fight there's where was he for the past seven and a half\nRoger we gotta thanks for checking in from Miami Beach Mac let me put this to you or you are are a veteran of all a lot of gubernatorial Senate campaigns here have you ever seen\nOr the environment play the kind of role it's playing here in twenty eight teen this late in the election cycles certainly environment can play a role in the summertime when we've seen these algae blooms before but they have tended to die off or reduce by the time we get into October\nYeah if if Yellen was the best thing that happened to a Bill Nelson a red tide is the worst thing that has happened to Rick Scott there is a tendency as the caller just did to conflate a whole lot of things that I'm\nA may not quite be fair and somebody can correct me but I don't think anybody knows what causes red tide uh we've been\nBecause of its um algae and a bacterium in its natural yeah Haram unlike the blue green tied which is not naturally occurring the red tide is a natural occurrence\n... that's exactly right and this year it is much worse than it normally is a it's usually around I think if you go back to the early Eighteen hundreds and you can see record to retired so I I ... ...\nThere's always say that if you're the governor you're going to get the praise and you're going to get the blame a you know you you could go out and pick a thousand people at random in the state of Florida\nTell them you were going to shoot him if you did is they didn't name at least one of the presiding officers in the pros and the centers bigger the house you'd have to shoot nine hundred and Ninety six of them the under other for be related to Negron or a courtroom\nSo the government gets the blame he gets the credit or I'm not sure the blame is well placed on the red tide thing though\nTom to your point of this is such a fascinating issue because as a pollster I've always looked at the environment and it's never ever the most important issue even though a lot of people are passionate about if people think it's an important one when you actually try and prioritize never rises\nWhat I think is different about both the red tide and the algae bloom issue and the reason it's factor so late is it's visceral this is an issue that is now outside of the uh a funeral and it's in people's lives it's literally stinks in their eyes and knows in there I said\nIt's right in your face it let me ... in a couple of minutes we have left let's point out that vote by mail has already started in Florida so really the election is officially underway by the way it's the first time ever since Florida became a two party state that more Democrats than Republicans are asking to\nCast their ballot through the postal service that said uh\nThe intensity I think it's up on both sides are for not for not in Mac as we close out this program\nUse it at the top of the ... that this recalls Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton which I thought was really interesting analogy\nHave you ever seen a governor's race quite like this in Florida with these two really different candidates and this much rancor and partisanship this is really I think one for the books for not\nKnow it is in a nutshell why because this is the most nationalized governor's race for Florida that I think we've ever seen certainly in my lifetime I think Mac would probably agree\nThis race is a referendum for what is happening nationally you have two candidates representing what a lot of people think are on the extreme wings of their party\nReally become a referendum on Donald Trump people are looking at this for a governor's race and what it will mean for twenty twenty let's not forget\nHe or she who wins the governor's mansion in Florida is usually a tremendous indicator of who's going to carry forward is twenty nine electoral votes and that's why not only there are so much attention in drama it could be so determined to demand definitive once again Florida in the middle of everything\nYou know it's really good at it really is as I said we're getting the most interesting governor's race in ... in my memory um you know I'm dealing with is a progressive views of liberal liberal you use a Greek Society\nNew deal Democrat and use unapologetic about it and doubling down on it um\nI think that this answers is trying to slowly and suddenly maybe slide away from Trump towards the center of just a little bit whether you'll succeed or not I don't know but this this is this you're going to be a pier six row is pretty good [noise]\nWell and the center is still holds in Florida doesn't it uh despite the polarization in this country it's so centrist voters particularly the ice for a quarter still write that could make the difference in a\nWhile though I'd ... I'd prefer to eat out out on that I don't I don't I I kinda\nJust generally feel like with Florida much like a country that the sector is pretty hollowed out [noise] um\nYeah I I Would agree with that I I think this race is going to be determined by what determines every race for the Democrats why do Democrats amount when an off year ... elections it's turnouts\nAnd if the turnout breaks sixty percent state wide which I think it does if it breaks fifty percent South Florida which I think it will I think it's going to mean Andrew Gillum is going to be the next governor the state of Florida\nYou're rich got one very narrowly twice drop one very narrowly ... you know in Florida [noise] what did you go back to the off year elections with Scott Brown county voted you wouldn't want\nThat's exactly what I Would have been much much much twenty two and a twenty fourteen\n[noise]\nWhile we've got to early voting is underway in just two weeks and of course we're ah about three days out from election day itself a really great times here and we'll continue to have these conversations statewide every Friday noon here on your radio state wide in Florida and I'm On the Democratic pollster from Nixon in ... with us in Miami\nAnd max renovated a GOP strategist with us from our sister station WFSU in Tallahassee gentlemen thanks so much for your time today appreciate your insight thank you both\nLike your great great\nDiscussion thanks gentlemen and that is our show for today the floor to round up is pretty W.

most acclaimed dancer Wendy Whelan retired from the New York city ballet at the age of forty seven after\nHip injury [noise] she wasn't sure she'd ever dance again [noise] but after reconstructive surgery and months of physical therapy she briefly return to the dance come\n[noise] well I didn't want to lose the the voice I had physically the motive expression that I had and and the especially ... letting go the level of the expression that I had in changing the level\nUm I knew it so well\nYou know it's just like having a voice for having a talented writing and then losing a part of that losing um local court or losing access to your you know hand to write it down it just it was\nTerrifying to lose that motive expression that I was so in touch with that I so love die so cultivated for my whole entire life and it was your entire\nLife and I I mean that that was dancing was and still is your your your life\nYeah I started when I was three ... and I retired ballet and forty seven but I'm fifty now and I just took a class and I did yoga this morning and I moved my body and\nAnd I felt good so I was\nHappy about that and it's nice to hear so once you realized\nAfter your hip surgery and after the rehabilitation and physical therapy when you realized you could dance again\nBut it was time to leave the extreme dance and the New York city ballet did he change your identity to leave the New York city ballet you'd been with a ballet for Thirty years that I mean that was your you were a principle that was really like your identity\nAnd if one of the most famous ballet companies in the world\nYeah [noise] I I moved to New York from Louisville, Kentucky when I was Fifteen\nMy ultimate focus was was the New York city ballet getting in hopefully and thriving in that company and um and I did I was there as a an apprentice when I was Seventeen I'm joined when I was Nineteen and\nGrew up there I you know everything I experienced as an adult\nHappened as a member of New York city ballet so we're all connected to that place to leave it as an adult I'm going into it as basically a child was scary really scary\nYeah I mean like who are you if you're not the principles in your city of LA\nYeah and you know they gave us our our um schedule a day or two days before so I Know every day when I'm supposed to do mhm leaving your city ballet the world doesn't do that for me [laughter] you know I have to do that myself\nSo that was huge you know to sort of let myself no oh well if you want to sleep in you can sleep in you know that was like whoa you know it just letting go when you and releasing and relaxing a little bit\nWas a huge\nWas letting go hard I mean with it sounds I mean you don't really know how to do\nI've been strapped in you know physically strapped in the point you strapped into a leotard in tights my hair's been strapped up [noise] for my whole entire life\nAnd to you on tied the shoes [noise] um I don't wear leotard anymore and wear T shirt and I wear pants I don't wear tight\nI generally where my hair looser and or or even in a breed now um I wear socks on my feet I don't like to be construed it now but that was safe than I was terrified to be on constricted and now I don't know another way I'd rather be so\nYeah it was from one extreme finding the safety and the other\nWhen you were describing how your dress you talking about on stage or off\n[noise] booze onstage and off I I wake up I go to class at ten ten thirty in the morning I'm having a leotard on and type tone and shoes and my hair's up and I spend the day like that until you know I rehearsed on a date and I go and do a performance and everything\nBecomes a little bit tighter including the nervous system so everything's on a on a high ladder of like a\nYou know I got a I've got to succeed I I Can't fault or I have to you know make that step happened\nHave to feel in this zone [noise] I'm In front of three thousand people tonight and then coming off of that from a performance is takes a while your adrenaline is pumped and [noise]\nYou calm down and maybe go to sleep at midnight or wine or if you can't sleep because you're nervous later than that and then you get up and you do it all again the next day I did that for\nDecades um I don't consider myself a ballerina now I'm I'm a former ballerina now so there's some of it's still in there but I don't I I'm trying to pain what I was in the same way\nAnymore I've given it up I've let it go and it's life and we all have to do that at some point and\nIt's hard sometimes to do it in our culture because I think people are ashamed of getting older it's either shame definitely people don't hide their age the way they used to because it's ... I saw anybody needs to do is go on Google so why [laughter]\n[noise] but that's still I think people are very often very self conscious about their age especially in professions where you're judged by your age and that covers a lot of professions that when you're judged visually by your age I mean I'm sure that's one of the reasons why so many people\nGet cosmetic surgery you ... yeah [noise]\nI've always I mean I've always been proud of always been a long this will never lied about my age level you know so\nThey ended ballet it must have been like wow I don't know she's like forty five now when she when she gonna retire how much more does she have a less did you feel that from people\nYou know I heard later my career my boss say we're going to outlast some of your your colleagues just physically I can tell 'em until I was revved up about that I felt confident and yeah\nYou know I sure am and I and I\nDid but then at the same time he's the one that's okay now maybe you should rethink doing this particular role or this particular thing and you know and so you know he's kind of the master of of time Mr time [laughter] [noise]\nWhat was your mix between anger in gratitude [laughter] so maybe it's no longer time for you to be doing this wrong I think the role he was talking about is in the neck record what you've done every year\nYeah I was surprised I went into the meeting thinking it was about something else I had no idea that this was going to come up um\nThis is ... ballet master Peter Martin\nYeah [noise] and because I hadn't had any real pain in my body I mean I knew I wasn't twenty eight anymore but at the same time I did and I wasn't feeling pain and or boredom I still feel inspired\nAnd I'm so when it happened I was ... are you serious\nI shocked me and then it hurt really really bad and I cried a lot for a while\nUm and I think the shock was was what hurt the most is because I didn't expect it how long after that meeting did you get injured\n[noise] um that happened in I think October two thousand eleven and [noise] by um January two thousand twelve I had pain mhm [noise] so two months and the pain never stopped in different areas of my body\nFor four years wow that's a long time to be in the yeah\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll try some or if you're just joining us my guest is windy Wheelan who was a principal dancer with the New York city ballet for Thirty years she retired from the company twenty fourteen after making a comeback following a hip injury [noise]\nThe new documentary wrestlers creature is about that period of her life will be back after a break this is fresh air\n\n\n\nAnd weekend edition push in terms of the Supreme Court saga Saturday and we can do in terms of the Supreme Court saga and we can do in terms of the Supreme Court Shakur today and we can do in terms of the Supreme Court saga\nAnd what it means to do in ... in terms of the Supreme Court saga come November when Americans cast their ballots [noise]\nAlso or Tom Bowman Iraq or Syria story of a good run dry and defined role undecided or was it was so it was over ... right now and I literally just shake my head injuries and started here for maybe you're a new thing\nIt was her age as well as her hip injury the letter to leave the company after Thirty years the injury required surgery and months of rehab and physical therapy she managed to return to the belly briefly for an amazing comeback\nShe sense given up ballet but she still dancing contemporary dance Wendy Whalen is the subject of the documentary restless creature which is now available on Netflix\nOne of the and I I actually I forget which now so is this a forgive me but um you do is I Am with your partner so like your apartment it was kind of lifting you as you do a kind of court we'll a slow cart wheel in the Arab making a full circle with\nYour legs almost a in a complete split as you're doing right and that looks like an incredibly physically challenging thing to do yet you make it seem so effortless and it looks like you're just kind of floating\nBut you're not I mean gravity is kind of like this when you're on stage it doesn't stop for you [laughter] know when you talk about what you're physically doing in that particular move [noise]\nYeah that belly you're ... you're talking about is called ...\nAnd um that's the very last moment of the peace um and I always felt like I was um [noise]\nA switch played in that moment\nMy partner ... he he was like a magician and luckily for me I got to partner with him for about Fifteen Years\nAnd uh he's holding me in a certain way any lifts me up like a Jack knife from under my hips under my my my bottom sort of taking my my ... my hips high up into the air and my legs are named Jack knife position\nAny drops me back down any meals at the same time and I'm just\nSort of bring them back dive holding on to my front foot\nBack bending with his support rotating cart willing backwards catching myself on the floor with my hands letting my legs follow me and sliding under his leg and two and Neal and he kneels behind me and me both look at the audience and the lights fade\nAnd it's just really like cool\nAnd how does it physically fields ... says feel like wow this is hard I'm really exerting myself or does it feel as fluid as it looks\nFeels heavenly feels like magic ... feels like it was like there's no other place I'd rather be than making that movement right there then mhm yeah\nWhat's the importance of ballet shoes when you're a ballerina like having like the exact right shoo oh you mean like the points you\nYeah I'm the one where you go up on your toes one way to go ... yeah it needs to fit like a glove\n[noise] so it really needs to ... we practice pointing our feet working exercising our feet so that we can articulate\nUm the joints in the feet and the and create um shapes um sculpting defeat um because that's a huge part of our expression\nUm footwork so when you get on a point you ... a ... you want to be able to follow through with that articulation and not have it break the line or break the movement or break your ability to express to the most\nWith that foot I think most dancers now start point work at twelve or so and all the way through your childhood and your and your young years you're trying to get that right shoe to fit you just write and to make your foot shape just right so it's honest [noise]\nTrue strong powerful gorgeous [noise]\nSee you started dancing at the age of three yes by twelve you were diagnosed with ... house if it was it\nUm severe enough that the doctors wanted to treat me for it with some traction\nBody casting and ultimately a Milwaukee brace so they want it to halt the curve because if they didn't hold the curve when they found it the curve probably would've um accelerated to a place where I Would have needed surgery which ultimately\nWould not have allowed me to have a ballet career\nSo we caught it really right at the crux of it either getting worse without treatment or halting and and uh respond to treatment\nAnd being a dancer a was a great thing the doctor told me back then he said the best things for ... says this was in Nineteen Seventy nine or Nineteen eighty um our swimming and ballet great and therefore my body was flexible enough that it ... really responded to the treatment quickly I grew in inch and a half\nAfter a week of traction in the hospital and the doctors were thrilled and that really kind of\nPulled me away from the surgery side of things where as one of my my hospital room mate didn't get so lucky and she ended up having to get a a rod in her spine [noise]\nSo when you had to wear a body cast mhm how did how did you keep up with dancing\n[laughter] well\nI was in a Fifteen pound body cast I'm so imagine one of those down vest that you can get it north face or one of the basically that made out of plaster was what I Lived in for it ended up being a month at a time over five months one summer\nAnd in between each casting I Would go back into the hospital and spend a week in traction with a head Halter on and leather straps holding my hips down towards the base of the bed and twelve pounds pulling on my head on his head Halter [noise]\nSo I'm Sam ... uncomfortable as that was it really helped me straighten out my back and then I Would go into this body cast for months at a time and my teacher said to me at the time living in Louisville, Kentucky she said you know you've done so well\nAnd I don't want you to lose your focus during the treatment right now so I Want you to come into the studio and your body cast and I want you to try to do whatever you can do we don't expect you to do this we don't expect to do that but just\nFeeling out move your body\nKeep your brain focused on what we're talking about in the class so that you just stay connected and um that was paramount that shaped my whole life\nThe documentary about the the new documentary restless creature ends with an excerpt of your final New York city ballet performance and then when when you take your ballot like everybody's coming up with a bouquet of roses you have so many bouquets of roses at some point you down and they they just look back to\nThan you are [laughter] yeah like too heavy to even carry at some point\nAnd yeah what was it like waking up the next day do you remember that\n[laughter] funny [noise] um yeah my niece was there she's she was I think\nThree or four at the time and uh we\nWere pretending with the cat toy that we were fishing you know like I Am in retirement now I'm just saying you know [laughter] like yeah uh and even on stage I just felt like you know I was I ... I think down for nearly a half an hour I don't remember quite long but people are you about a long time the end of your show\nAnd I just I felt slowly like I was taking a skin off like a this kind of snake skin like I Am now me\nAnd you're seeing me the goofy Wendy just I'm not trying to be\nWho you all thought I was for so long you know I'm just that you know just this girl and I jumped to like a little kid you know a little bit and I I had like bad posture and I was like walking like a normal person in my house and I was like yeah I'm just a human being\nYou know and I've been ... the whole time but I haven't been able to show it\n[noise] there's a moment in the film we talk about how you can't watch the New York city ballet because it's just too painful since you can't dance at that point you're still recovering [noise] so well that was yeah yeah sorry but do you do you still have to deal at all\nWith you know envy are um no\nI mean you see like young dancers and when you learn the dancers in the New York city ballet do you wish you could be back there that you could be that again ... ...\nI did it did it and I'm so proud of how I did it and I'm proud of how I let it go and I'm excited for these people\nThat are in it now loving it living it being it\nFinding themselves I'm finding myself in a new different place mhm now which is exciting\nUm I Would never want to go back now [noise] [noise]\nWell I Can't tell you how much I [laughter] and fire you thank you so much for talking has really been great to talk with you\nThank you it's been a thrill Wendy Whalen speaking with Terry Gross twenty Seventeen the former principal ballerina or for the New York city ballet is the subject of the documentary restless creature which\nIs now available on Netflix Wendy Whalen is now working on a new solo performance project which is scheduled to premier next summer and guess teaching across the country\nComing up jazz critic Kevin Whitehead remembers influential bass player Jimmy Blanton who was born a hundred years ago today and film critic David Edelstein reviews the new adaptation of a star is born starting Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga this is fresh air\nWithin months of her relief she enrolled in college and earned three degrees practically back to back today king his program director for life after hate a non profit for reforms extremists the organization run support groups for people looking to leave hate groups\nTo any confused young person there was finding acceptance and these groups right now um my message as a simple one\nI understand\nIf you need to talk I'm here to listen without Judgement [noise]\nKing has said that talking about her past is draining and that she'll probably be apologizing for the rest of her life she just hopes that people hear her\nThat was W. ...

schedule a day or two days before so I Know every day what I'm supposed to do mhm leaving your city ballet the world doesn't do that for me to do that myself [laughter]\nSo that was huge you know to sort of let myself no oh well if you want to sleep and you can sleep in you know that was like what [noise] you know just letting go and ... and releasing and relaxing a little bit was huge\nWas letting go hard I mean with that\nSo I'm telling you don't really know how to do\nI've been strapped in you know physically strapped in the points you strapped into a leotard and tights my hair's been strapped up [noise] for my whole entire life\nAnd two on tie the shoes um I don't wear leotard anymore I wear T shirt and I wear pants I don't wear tights\nAre generally where my hair Lucerne or or even in a braid now um I wear socks on my feet I don't like to be constricted now but that was safe than I was terrified to be on constricted and now I don't know another way I'd rather be so\nYeah it was from one extreme finding the safety and the other\nWhen you were describing how you address are you talking about on stage or off\nBoth on stage enough I I wake up I go to class at ten ten thirty in the morning I'm half ... shoes and my hair's up and I spend that day ... ... well like that until you know\nA ... day then I go and do a performance and everything was becomes a little bit tighter [laughter] including the nervous system so everything's on a on a high ladder\nOf like [noise] you know I've got a I've got to succeed I I Can't fault her I have to you know make that step happen\nI have to feel end zone I'm In front of three thousand people tonight and then coming off of that from a performance is takes a while your adrenaline is pumped and\nYou calm down and maybe you go to sleep at midnight or one or if you can't sleep 'cause you're nervous later than that and then you get up and you do it all again the next day I did that for\nDecades um and I don't consider myself a ballerina now I'm a I'm a former ballerina now so there's some of it's still in there but I don't um [noise] try to attain ... what I was in the same way\nAnymore I've given it up I've let it go and it's life and we all have to do that at some point and\nIt it's hard sometimes to do it in our culture because I think people are ashamed of getting older it's in a shame definitely people don't hide their age the way they used to because it's point last saw anybody needs to do is go on Google so why [laughter]\nBother to hide it but but still I think people are very often very self conscious about their age especially in professions where you're judged by your age and that covers a lot of professions but when you're judged visually by your age I mean I'm sure that's one of the reasons why so many people get cosmetic surgery you know ...\nYeah [noise] I've always been I mean I've always been proud of always been a while I'm this old never lied about my age you know and you know so\nBut but but and the ballet it must have been like well I don't know she's like she's forty five now when she's when is she gonna retire how much more does she have left did you feel that from people\nI you know I heard later in my career my boss say we're going to outlast some of your your colleagues just physically I can tell\n'em until I was revved up about that I felt confident and yeah I Am you know I sure am and I and I did but then at the same time\nHe's the one that's okay now maybe should rethink doing this particular roller this particular thing and you know and so you know he's kind of the master of of time ... Mr time [laughter] [noise]\nWhat was your mix between anger and gratitude [laughter] votes oh maybe it's no longer time for you to be doing this wrong and I think the role he was talking about was in the ... which you'd done every year yeah\nWas surprised I went into the meeting thinking it was about something else I had no idea that this was going to come up um this was hiding\n... ballet master Peter Martin\nYeah and because I hadn't had any real pain in my body I mean I knew I wasn't twenty eight anymore but at the same time I ... I wasn't feeling pain and or boredom I still feel inspired\nAnd I'm so when it happened I was what you are you serious\nI shocked me and then it hurt really really bad and I cried a lot for a while\nUm and I think the shock was\nWas what hurt the most is because I didn't expect it how long after that meeting did you get injured\n[noise] um that happened in I think October two thousand eleven and [noise] by um January two thousand twelve I had pain mhm [noise] so two months and the pain never stopped in different areas of my body\nFor four years wow that's a long time to be in yeah yeah\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll shocks them or if you're just joining us my guest is Wendy Whelan who was a principal dancer with the New York city ballet for Thirty years she retired from the company and twenty fourteen after making a comeback following a hip injury the new documentary restless creature is about that period of her life\nWill be back after a break this is fresh air\nAnd next time on ask me another we've got comedian Tom Arnold star of the new show the hunt for the Trump tape plus singer songwriter Jill so below performs with their very own Jonathan Gold in music parity game about artists who go\nOne name so joined me over the euro for NPR's our a puzzle word games Andrea via Saturday at eleven AM on eighty nine nine W. J. C. T.\n\nThis is fresh air if you're just joining us my guest is Wendy Whalen\nIt was a principal ballerina with the New York city ballet for Thirty years and twenty Thirteen hip injury led to reconstructive surgery in months of rehabilitation and physical therapy\nShe returned to the New York city ballet for the spring twenty fourteen season and retired from the company that October after a triumphant performance she noticed contemporary dance\nThe new film restless creature documents that period of her life from her surgery to her comeback period during which you worried about whether she would dance again and how leaving the New York city ballet would alter her identity\n[noise] how did you get the hip injury that led to your pain into your surgery\n[noise] came out of nowhere literally came out of nowhere I um [noise]\nAnd that looks like an credibly physically challenging thing to do yet you make it seem so effortless and it looks like you're just kind of floating\nBut you're not I mean gravity kind of like this when you're on stage it doesn't stop for you [laughter] can you talk about what you're physically doing in that particular move\nYeah that deli you're ... you're talking of is called ... and um that's the very last\nMoment of the peace um and I always felt like I was um [noise]\nA switch blade in that moment my partner ... he he was like a magician and luckily for me I got to partner with him for about Fifteen Years\nAnd uh he's holding me in a certain way any lifts me up like a Jack knife from under my hips under my my my bottom sort of taking my my ... my hips high up into the air and my legs aren't a Jack knife position\nAny drops me back down any meals at the same time\nAnd I'm just\nSort of bring them back dive holding on to my front foot\nBack bending with his support rotating cart willing backwards catching myself on the floor with my hands letting my legs follow me and sliding under his leg and two in Neal and he kneels behind me and me both look at the audience and the lights fade\nAnd it's just really like cool\nAnd how does it physically fields and it's just feel like wow this is hard I'm really exerting myself or does it feel as fluid as it looks\nFeels heavenly feels like magic mhm feels like it was like there's no other place I'd rather be than making that movement right there then\nMhm yeah\nWhat's important is of valley shoes when you're a ballerina like having like the exact right shoo\nOh you mean like the points you yeah I'm the one where you go up on your toe one way to go into yeah it needs to fit like a glove\n[noise] so it really needs to ... we practice pointing our feet working exercising our feet so that we can articulate\nUm the joints in the feet and the and create um shapes um sculpting defeat um because that's a huge part of our expression\nUm footwork so when you get on a point you ... a ... you want to be able to follow through with that articulation and not have it break the line or break the movement or break your ability to express to the most\nWith that foot I think most dancers now start point work at twelve or so and all the way through your childhood and your and your young years you're trying to get that right shoe to fit you just write and to make your foot shape just right so it's honest [noise]\nTrue strong powerful gorgeous [noise]\nSee you started dancing at the age of three yes him by twelve you were diagnosed with ... says how severe it was it\nUm severe enough that the doctors wanted to treat me for it with um traction body casting and ultimately a Milwaukee brace\nSo they wanted to halt the curve because if they didn't hold the curve when they found it the curve probably would've um accelerated to a place where I Would have needed surgery which ultimately would not have allowed me to have a ballet career\nSo we caught it really right at the crux of it either getting worse without treatment or halting and\nAnd uh respond to treatment and being a dancer a was a great thing the doctor told me back then he said the best things for ... this was in Nineteen Seventy nine\nOr Nineteen eighty um our swimming and ballet was a great and therefore my body was flexible enough that it ... really responded to the treatment quickly I grew in inch and a half\nAfter a week of traction in the hospital and the doctors were thrilled and that really kind of\nPulled me away from the surgery side of things where as one of my my hospital room mate didn't get so lucky and she ended up having to get a a rod in her spine\n[noise] so when you had to wear a body cast mhm how did how did you keep up with dancing [laughter] well\nI was in a Fifteen pound body cast I'm so imagine one of those down vest that you can get it north face or one of the [noise] basically that made out of plaster was what I Lived in for it ended up being a month at a time over five months one summer\nAnd in between each casting I Would go back into the hospital and spend a week in traction with a head Halter on and leather straps holding my hips down towards the base of the bed and twelve pounds pulling on my head on his head Halter [noise]\nSo um it's an ... uncomfortable as that was it really helped me straighten out my back and then I Would go into this body cast for months at a time and my teacher said to me at the time living in Louisville, Kentucky she said you know you've done so well\nAnd I don't want you to lose your focus during the treatment right now so I Want you to come into the studio and nearby cast and I want you to try to do whatever you can do we don't expect you to do this we don't expect to do that but just\nFeeling out move your body\nKeep your brain focused on what we're talking about in the class so that you just stay connected [noise] and\nThat was paramount that shaped my whole life\nThe documentary about the new documentary wrestlers creature ends with an excerpt of your final New York city ballet performance and then when when you take your bow like everybody's coming up with a bouquet of roses you have so many bouquet of roses at some point you put it down and they they just looked like to the bigger than you are [laughter]\nYeah I got too heavy to even carry at some point yeah what was it like waking up the next day do you remember that\n[laughter] funny [noise] um yeah my niece was there she's she was I think\nThree or four at the time and uh we\nWere pretending with the cat toy that we were fishing you know they go in retirement now guessing [laughter] you know [laughter] yeah uh and even on stage I just felt like you know I was I ... I think I doubt for nearly a half an hour I don't remember quite a long but people are you about a long time the end of your show\nAnd I just I felt slowly like I was taking a skin off like a this kind of snake skin like\nI Am now me\nAnd you're seeing me the goofy Wendy just I'm not trying to be who\nYou all thought I was for so long you know I'm just a you know just this girl\nAnd I jumped to like a little kid you know a little bit and I I had like bad posture and I was like walking like a normal person in my house and I was like yeah I'm just a human being you know and I've been in this the whole time but I haven't been able to show it\n[noise] there's a moment in the film we talk about how you can't watch the New York city ballet because it's just too painful since you can't dance at that point you're still recovering [noise] so well that was yeah yeah sorry but do you do you still have to deal at\nAll with you know and the our um no\nI think you see like young dancers and when you learn the dancers in the New York city ballet do you wish like you you could be back there that you could be that again ... ...\nI did it I did it and I'm so proud of how I did it and I'm proud of how I let it go and I'm excited for these people\nThat are in it now loving it living it being it\nFinding themselves I'm finding myself in a new different place mhm now which is exciting\nUm I Would never want to go back now [noise]\n[noise] well I Can't tell you how much I [laughter] and fire you thank you so much for talking has really been great to talk with you\nThank you it's been a thrill Wendy wailing speaking with Terry Gross twenty Seventeen the former principal ballerina for the New York city ballet is the subject of the documentary restless creature which is now available on Netflix\nWendy Whalen is now working on a new solo performance project which is scheduled to premier next summer and guess teaching across the country\nComing up jazz critic Kevin White head remembers influential bass player Jimmy Blanton who was born a hundred years ago today and film critic David Edelstein reviews the new adaptation of a star is born starting Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga this is fresh air\nThis week the deputy attorney general was and was not fired the president was and refuse to be the leaders of the world and the next Supreme Court justice was and was not a virgin at the age of twenty\nI'm Peter Segal in these uncertain times uh one thing we know for certain is that this week our guest is Dr John ... is it it is going to the news clips from it feels Saturday morning at ten on eighty nine nine W.
