the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to this I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself at his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about\nI've read that brief yeah by ... why not\nI Believe in simple explanations the simple explanation is that\nKavanaugh leaving aside ideology and political credentials is as respected a federal judge in the country as almost anybody if you ask liberals and conservatives apart from ideology who were the most respected\nUh appeals court judges in the country Kavanaugh would be on anybody's list of twenty he's enough of an intellect a technocrat a scholar to make that list and I think when you take that um basic credential\nAnd in fact when ... close relationship with him and that would made him the odds on favorite\nHere's another question that you also might not be able to answer I Would love to know\nHow the justices what they think of what President Trump has said about judges he's insulted judges he used the term so called judge to describe one judge during the campaign he called\nChief justice Roberts an absolute disaster he said Roberts gave us Obamacare it might as well be called Roberts' care\nHe did not say that in a positive way another time he claimed that Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare the Affordable CARE Act because he wanted to be popular inside the beltway um\nYou're right that Neil Gorsuch nearly withdrew his nomination after Trump insulted him and this was after\nSenator Richard Blumenthal had had his me meeting with nominee Neil Gorsuch and said that Gorsuch had called Trump's attacks on the federal judiciary disheartening and demoralizing\nWhat if anything [laughter] can you tell us about how the justices feel about what the president has said about catches\nWell every single one of them that I talked to to the extent that I could\nGet them talking a little or use some body language are all Paul by him how can one not be appalled by him generally in terms of his attacks on the federal judiciary I think they are especially\nAnnoyed perturbed and I went to some extent aggrieved because they think it wound up the integrity of the judiciary which has a limited capacity to fight back I was struck by something I report in the book that Roberts chief justice Roberts during the two thousand sixteen\nPresidential campaign ... confided to a friend\nThat he was outraged by candidate Trump's attacks\nOn Roberts Roberts in effect saying I've been a loyal Republican my whole life I worked in the Reagan Administration I helped the Bush campaign in Bush Gore how can anybody seriously question\nMy credentials I was struck by that that the chief justice of the United states would particularly care what the presidential candidate thought because long after that candidates gone weather is elected president or not what chief justice Roberts will still be occupying the Senate seat of the marble temple and will be there for decades\nSince this is the era of the John Roberts court in two ways one is that he's the chief justice but also he is now considered to be the swing vote so he is really the most decisive factor in the court now right\nCorrect he will be the first chief justice in eighty plus years who is in the middle such as it is of the court it'll will truly be his court and he will have the potential for quote unquote greatness\nAnd he's demonstrated at his greatest moment on the court and the Obamacare ruling has he demonstrated it in any other moment\nNo [laughter] not really it may be on the margins of some rulings but the two important projects for this chief justice have been deregulating campaign finance Citizens United and all that\nAnd removing a racial preferences from American Life whether it's in college admissions or a how the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty sixty five is applied and he\nFirmly believes in the conservative agenda on those two issues if you look at what he's done in those areas don't confuse him\nFor a moderate he's not but I think he holds the potential\nTo apply the brakes and I think to the extent we see the court\nFurther placed into the male strum in coming years now that it's got five votes on a lot of issues I think you may see this chief justice take his views about the courts integrity and place them ahead of his own particular views on this or that issue\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision that gutted the voting rights act\nAnd that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise] um so ... future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to the Supreme Court did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous Zimmer arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act or Nineteen sixty five\nOr you can like or dislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states with with discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices\nBut Congress passed the law\nAnd Rio the law uncontroversial ... periodically why is it the court's role to override that democratic preference\nWhy is it um that those who brought\nThe challenge against the voting rights act somehow you need to have their ledge writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts has a high mark\nSaid John Roberts was the swing vote on upholding the Affordable CARE Act and you write that he had to draft of his decision what were the differences between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nWe knew that Roberts from prior reporting had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the other conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though we initially voted to strike down the law he immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks\nTo draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down by the second opinion that resulted in the ... being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because of the workforce\nJustice is on each side he knew he was the swing vote he knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions looked like and sometimes as justices will say Roberts and otherwise the opinion just doesn't right\nAnd he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best sense of the word in a close case decided\nI'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter to strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack in the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\nIf you're just

I'm Sorry Sunday at one PM on eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to this I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself\nAt his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault and whether those justices who are already seated on the court thought he had a judicial temperament do you have anything that you can tell us about that\nI stayed in touch with some of the justices I've interviewed I've stayed in touch with them since the book has come out I guess I can offer two thoughts one leaving aside the specifics\nOf Dr Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's response the justices can stand seeing the court placed or in the mail room\nThey they think it's bad for the court they think it's embarrassing and while they'll watch the hearings are on TV you know they have cable at the court they live in a marble temple but they can still watch TV and they hate it\nHaving said that I think part of the reaction this time was having a specific most of the justices know\nHaving a chief justice Roberts served briefly I think with a cabin on the DC circuit in ... if not they live near each other in suburban Washington they belong to the same clubs eat at the same restaurants there are other piece and Elena Kagan\nJustice Kagan when she was dean at Harvard law school tire Kavanaugh to ah come teach there so they all know Kavanaugh they knew know him far more than they knew Neil Gorsuch when he joined the court and they like Kavanaugh and they respect him there is a reason\nThat Kavanaugh was the leading so cold feet or judge in the country that is the judges who send their own law clerks up to the Supreme Court to then clerked for justice is Kavanaugh was the leader in the country incidentally I think second place was Merrick Garland\nStill on the federal appeals court in Washington and who who of course was Obama's pick\nTo succeed Scully in two thousand sixteen\n[noise] so I think there are a lot of concerns now that we have two justices\nIn the Supreme Court who has been accused of sexual misconduct Clarence Thomas the sexual harassment and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault and these men might have decisive votes in matters pertaining to gender equality sexual assault or sexual harassed\nThe issues and it questions the credibility of the ... court because they might be very biased\nOpinions whether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example think you will see recusal\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused herself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true\nPartisan shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nRead that brief yeah by ... why not\nI Believe in simple explanations simple explanation is that\nKavanaugh leaving aside ideology and political credentials is as respected a federal judge in the country as almost anybody if you ask liberals and conservatives apart from ideology who are the most respected\nUh appeals court judges in the country Kavanaugh would be on anybody's list of twenty he's enough of an intellect technocrat a scholar to make\nThat list and I think when you take that um basic credential and in fact when ... close relationship with him that would made him the odds on favorite\nHere's another question that you also might not be able to answer I Would love to know\nHow the justices what they think of what President Trump has said about judges he's insulted judges he used the term so called judge to describe one judge during the campaign he called\nChief justice Roberts an absolute disaster he said Roberts gave us Obamacare it might as well be called Roberts' care\nHe did not say that in a positive way another time he claimed that Roberts and voted to uphold Obamacare the Affordable CARE Act because he wanted to be popular inside the beltway um\nYou write that Neil Gorsuch nearly with drew his nomination after Trump insulted him\nAnd this was after Senator Richard Blumenthal had had his me meeting with nominee Neil Gorsuch and said that Gorsuch had called Trump's attacks on the federal judiciary disheartening and demoralizing\nWhat if anything can you tell us about how the justices feel about what the president has said about judges\nWell every single one of them that I talked to to the extent that I could get I'm Talking a little or use some body language are all Paul by him how can one not be appalled by him generally\nIn terms of his attacks on the federal judiciary I think they are especially\nAnnoyed perturbed and I went to some extent agree because they think it wound the integrity of the judiciary which has a limited capacity to fight back I was struck by something I report in the book that Roberts chief justice Roberts during the two thousand sixteen\nPresidential campaign ... confided to a friend\nThat he was outraged by candidate Trump's attacks\nOn Robert Robert shouldn't affect saying I've been a loyal Republican my whole life I worked in the Reagan Administration I helped the Bush campaign in Bush Gore how can anybody seriously question\nWhy credentials I was struck by that that the chief justice of the United states would particularly care what the presidential candidate thought because long after that candidates gone weather is elected president or not chief justice Roberts will still be occupying the Senate seat of the marble temple and will be there for decades\nSince this is the era of the John Roberts court in two ways one is that he's the chief justice but also he is now considered to be the swing vote so he is really the most decisive factor in the court now right\nCorrect he will be the first chief justice in eighty plus years who is in the middle such as that is of the court it'll will truly be his court and he will have the potential for quote unquote greatness\nAnd he's demonstrated at his greatest moment on the court and the Obamacare ruling has he demonstrated in any other moment\nNo [laughter]\nNot really it may be on the margins of some rulings but the two important projects for this chief justice have been deregulating campaign finance Citizens United and all that\nAnd removing a racial preferences from American Life whether it's in college admissions or a how the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty sixty five is applied and he\nFirmly believes in the conservative agenda on those two issues if you look at what he's done in those areas don't confuse him\nFor a moderate he's not but I think he holds the potential to apply the brakes and I think to the extent we see the court\nFurther placed into the male strum in coming years now but it's got five votes on a lot of issues I think you may see this chief justice take his views about the courts integrity and place them ahead of his own particular views on this or that issue\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision\nThat gutted the voting rights act and that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise] um so ... and future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to this\nCourt did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the ring writes active Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous him or arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nUm you can like or dislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states with with discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices\nBut Congress passed a law\nAnd Rio the law uncontroversial ... periodically why is it the court's role to override that democratic\nPreference why is it\nUm that those who brought\nThe challenge against the voting rights act somehow you need to have their alleged writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts has a high mark\nSaid John Roberts was the swing vote on of holding the Affordable CARE Act and you write that he had to draft of his decision what what's the difference is between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nWe knew that Roberts from prior reporting had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though we initially voted to strike down the law\nHe immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks\nTo draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down\nBut a second opinion that resulted in the ... being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because we're four justices on each side he knew\nHe was the swing vote he knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions\nLooked like and sometimes as justices will say Roberts it otherwise the opinion just doesn't right\nAnd he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best sense of the word in a close case decided\nI'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter to strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack in the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\nIf you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most
