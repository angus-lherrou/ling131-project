airline seats there's only so many flights out of Alaska for the Senate's final vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation for NPR News I'm less risk and\nWalk into the national portrait gallery here in Washington right now and you will find a painting that has been ripped to shreds and those shreds nailed to the gallery wall\nAnother one nearby hangs halfway loose from it stretch church rumpled it's a portrait of Thomas Jefferson and behind it you glimpse exceeded black woman\nThe piece is called behind the mess of benevolence of these are works by the artist Titus ... far he takes familiar images and re makes them maybe pulls a hidden figures to the front\nAs of today for his work has been recognized with a MacArthur Award these are the so called genius grants and Titus ... joins us from New Haven Connecticut\nFirst of all welcome and second of all congratulations thank you so much I I Want to ask what was going through your head what was your honest reaction when the phone rang and you've got this call\n[laughter] the truth of the matter is I did not believe the person on the other end ... said\nStop it who is is ah but no they reassured me that in fact there was real I Wonder what people here a little bit more about your work for people who aren't familiar with it so start with that portrait of Thomas Jefferson that I described talked to me about what you're trying to do here so I had a conversation\nWith a um American history teacher\nAnd somehow within that conversation there was this phrase that she authored yes but Thomas Jefferson was a benevolent slave owner\nAnd I I I was sort of shocked by that I didn't really understand what she meant and I asked her to elaborate on it but she couldn't she didn't and we sort of sat there and silence for a little bit I went back to the studio and this is the painting that I made\nAnd so that particular piece is kind of\nPulling back the curtain on these ideas these illusions these stories that we tell ourselves about the founding fun to do that you're literally pulling pulling the canvas of the traditional portrait down that's right that's right and that really has to do with trying to for myself\nFind a way in to these concepts that physically I'm so if you were asking yourself a question about what is it how do you make a painting about torture then you change that and that's just a question what does it mean to torture painting\nRather than making paintings about something you make paintings that reflect that thing it it sounds like if I'm hearing you write your point is and\nWe got to forget the past we're going to erase it it's we have to shift or gays and confront it why did well I mean why does it matter to frame it in quite that way [noise]\nI don't think that pretending like it didn't happen is beneficial I think it's in fact damaging I think if we are not honest about our past than we cannot have a clear direction towards our future\nAnd so you know we're having a sort of a national conversation right now about public monuments and in this discussion we are talking about a we have to sort of binary conversation about keeping we sculptures up or taking them down\nAnd I I actually think that the binary conversation it's problematic I think there's another possibility and I think that possibility\nHas to do with bringing in a new work that speaks in conversation with this all work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they first panicked really there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered whether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they discovered something important\nWhich is that in order to punch through that wall they have to come up with a whole range of new ways of accessing\nNew populations people who wouldn't otherwise have been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply had to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries around the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they crossed this barrier that smoked which had prevented other social media sites from growing\nBut it did something even more important which was the data stabbed wished\nThe sacred important really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a team called the growth team which became as of this former Facebook executive said to me it was really the coup crowd this was\nThe team everyone wanted to be on was ... was about really sank defying the idea of growth as an end in itself that if Facebook stopped growing than its whole reason for being would cease to exist and that idea\nEnded up becoming the dominant fact of the next decade from two thousand seven until today when\nFacebook became a extraordinarily focused on whatever it could do to continue growing year after year\nAnd one of the things they did was that they made it a platform for outside developer so that may be able to explain what this means so that ups other software developers could pitch in to Facebook and use it\nThey made a big choice which was that instead of saying we're just going to be our own\nSight we're actually going to try to become a platform like almost like an operating system the way that windows used to be the you know the way that everybody went on on to their personal computer and then you would build applications on top of that and that decision to open themselves up as a platform\nMeant that they were then sharing data to a much larger group of ah of developers of programmers than they otherwise would end\nThis turned out to be a fateful decision because if you fast forward many years later to and what we all now know is the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was\nIt was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they'd done was they allowed an academic research or to use some of the data on the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold that data to the political consultancy known as\nCambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door\nOr has created much of the crisis that now engulfing the company today\nAnd you're right that the executive within Facebook Cindy ... kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at the developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users who you know plugged into their games what did he find\nWhat he found unnerved him a Sandy Park illicit joined Facebook in twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way we're\nYou know where people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nAre in other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this feeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told a that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that\nData that they didn't really want to discover the full reach out and and Sandy Park hill is left\nBut in in many ways his warnings turned out to be prophetic because exactly the kind of undisciplined use data which he had warned about and and and try to raise greater alarms about internally\nOr turned out to be the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal which became so I'm so consuming for the company this year\nSo a lot of resources within the company devoted to pushing growth not so much into doing in response of\nYes exactly as he said that you know I needed people I needed engineers to help me try to police where this data was going but all of their resources we're going to gross he said at some point\nAnd he told me that the growth team had engineers coming out of their ears they had everything they wanted everything was devoted to growing and it was not devoted to making sure that what they were doing at the time was say\nWhat are some of the of the things the company did to keep growing that kind of pushed the boundaries of privacy\nWell they begin to build in lots of ingenious details into the design of the site things like a auto play video this is something as simple as\nChanging the nature of Facebook so that when you scroll down your page that the videos would begin to play without you having to click on them what that was was essentially taking advantage of\nSome of our own psychological wiring that means that just eliminating that small obstacle makes much more likely to stay on the site to watch that ad and ultimately to consume whatever advertising is around it\nAnd they did other things they for instance you know you remember in the very beginning Facebook used to have pages single pages you'd have to click onto the next page they got rid of that so it's just a continuous scroll\nAnd all of these little tiny details um\nWe're in a way making Facebook into a new generation of behavioral experts they figured out how to you tweak people's vanities and their passions and their susceptibility and their desires in order to keep them on the site the most important thing Facebook could do\nAnd this is how they measured it was made sure that people were\nWere signing on and staying on whenever you joined the company in your orientation you were taught about something very important metric known as el six of seven\nWhich means the number of people who logged in six of the last seven days and whatever you could do to try to raise that el six or seven that was the priority [noise]\nUm but as somebody put it to me\nThe problem with that is that eventually you exhaust the positive ways of boosting that engagement\nAnd eventually you start to look at what this person described as the dark patterns the ways that you can use anxiety or vanity or to try to get people to sign up one of the things they discovered for instance was if you send somebody an email that says\nThat Facebook friend has uploaded a picture of them to Facebook that people are almost incapable of resisting the temptation to look um and that sort of tweak that just minor behavioral nudge turned out to be um really hugely important to the growth of Facebook\nHave an ...

J. C. T. your community your world\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Evan ... he has a piece in the magazine called ghost in the machine about ... and Facebooking his current controversies it's in a recent issue\nNow Facebook isn't a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors you don't give us an example [noise] this is a big\nChange for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who was Facebook's first president he's sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he'd become a conscientious objector to social media he said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong that our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nUh it really became a powerful new ingredient in a dangerous new ingredient in some cases into these longstanding ethnic and religious\nRivalries I'm In ... for instance when Facebook arrived it really became an effect the Internet that there was only about one percent of the population that was on line before Facebook was there and then over the course of the next few years\nIt grew rapidly and um and people who were interested in fomenting this kind of ethnic hatred between Buddhists and Muslims\nFigured out how to use Facebook to great effect and they would spread hoaxes or rumors and\nIn there were cases where a rumor hoax that was spread on Facebook directly contributed to the outbreak of a riot and and what you heard over that period was the people in Myanmar\nBegan to talk to the company warn the company that this was a problem as early as twenty Thirteen people began visiting Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park giving sly presentations talking about\nThe problem of ah ethnic violence being trafficked on Facebook in the in the company would listen and in some cases they would give a hearing to that\nView and it would be over the years they continue to visit activists and technology entrepreneurs from me and more but they didn't see any fundamental change and and and they were started every time they went they would they would hear very often the same message which was we're going to hire\nDozens of Burmese language speakers to be able to police this kind of thing more effectively but still fundamentally it didn't change and [noise]\nAnd eventually it became so pronounced the role of Facebook as a catalyst in this violence became so serious that ah earlier this year at the un investigator in charge of I'm\nProbing the persecution of there were hang a Muslim minority and me and mark described the role of Facebook as in her words a beast she said it has become something that it was never intended it and is actively contributing\nTo this what the un now considers a genocide\n... did you talk to Mark Zuckerberg about this\nI did and I asked him about it and and and at first he was he was a frankly a little clip about it he said look this is a problem that is similar in a lot of places and it's one that we're that we're dealing with I'm paraphrasing there and I I pushed them on and I said well I talked to people in me andme are just a yesterday in fact um\nAnd they're baffled about why a company as big as as rich and as innovative as Facebook has been unable to deal with this problem\nAnd what he said was we take this seriously we we really do understand this is a problem but it's not something in which you can just snap your fingers and solve it\nOvernight it takes a process you have to build out these systems in order to allow artificial intelligence to detect hate speech and then hire the kinds of people who can\nWho can solve the problem and he said that they are going to have over a hundred people a Burmese speakers who are going to be policing um the uh Facebook in ... but I think it speaks to a broader\nA broader dynamic at work here was which is that for a long time as one of march afterwards friends said to me when there were complaints about the company\nHe either thought that these were just ... these were people who are slow to embrace technology or in other cases they were exaggerating are overstating the role that Facebook was playing he looked at a place like me and Martin said well they were probably going to be fighting anyway I'm I'm putting words in his mouth or does or not words he said to me\nBut I think over time he has come to this realization and by his own description of belated realization that Facebook is not just a tool on the table is not just an of a new implement it is in fact a fundamental and very ... by its nature it has\nTo be responsible for the forces they did on leashes [noise] um but then building the systems to try to get control of this is is hard and they have moved much more slowly than they should have a in some cases by their own admission\nLet's talk about the twenty sixteen elections did Facebook was when the election was approaching see this as a big revenue opportunity\nThey did they saw this as a an important moment they Sheryl Sandberg and call with investors and analysts\nCompared it to the world cup or the super bowl was a case operating officer of you know she is yeah she's sort of arguably the second most powerful person at Facebook and\nAnd and what she said was this was going to be a major opportunity for them to sell at a political ads protections at the time were that\nAs candidates and political organizations became more aware of the importance of the Internet that they were going to shift a lot of their spending from television into the Internet and that that you were going to see a a nine or ten fold increase in how much spending was going to be available and Facebook want it to be a big recipient of that\nRight and and it had gotten a special exemption 'em to print ads which didn't disclose who paid for them right so this was it was kind of a wide open opportunity\nYeah Facebook had used its lobbying power it had\nUm it had argued to the federal election commission that it should be exempted from rules that require television advertising to be identified by the source of the funding you know that point at the end where they say who who pay for the they said we shouldn't have to follow those rules because we're in New technology and in their filings they said you don't want to stifle the growth of new\nInnovation but as a result that meant that it was in a sense a very dark terrain that things that were being posted on Facebook that were ads are around politics\nWhere in many cases of mysterious orange and it was very hard to know who was posting them and why\nAnd Facebook offered to embed Facebook employee with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to help the campaigns use the platform effectively how did they respond\nWith the Clinton campaign or rejected the offer um [noise]\nThey thought they had more or less enough of their own technical capability to do it but the Trump campaign embrace it eagerly they were much smaller almost sort of shoestring operation they had very little uh of the season political expertise that was rallying around other presidential candidates\nAnd so Facebook moved employees into the Trump campaign headquarters and they helped them craft their messages they help them figure out how to reach the largest possible audience how to\nTest different messages many many messages a day um to figure out just what small differences changing the background color or changing the tax or the fought how that would impact the number of people that would click on it and ultimately might give money and support the candidate\nSo later in the end when after Donald Trump won the election the senior campaign strategist were very clear as one of them Teresa ... said to an interviewer without Facebook we would not have won they played an absolutely essential role in the process\nHow did the Trump campaign itself you use the platform to affect things like turn up\nBut one of the things they did was the Trump campaign bought an ad campaign on Facebook that was designed to suppress turnout among constituencies that they expected to be important to the Democrats including African Americans and young liberals and and white women and [noise]\nBy by targeting that population using these incredibly powerful tools or persuasion that Facebook has which are really we have been engineered to to optimize to to get people to respond I'm\nIn the view of the Trump campaign that was an important piece of their success and they've talked about it ever since [noise]\nThat are for the New Yorker we'll talk some more after a short break
