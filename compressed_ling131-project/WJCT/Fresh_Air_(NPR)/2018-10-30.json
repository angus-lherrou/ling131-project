W. J. C. T. Jacksonville sunny today a heightened you're eighty degrees this evening staying clear with a low around sixty and another sunny day tomorrow Halloween was a high and you're a detail\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia and Terry Gross with fresh air today Jonah Hill co star of super bad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid nineties that's the period when Jonah Hill was skateboarding but he says he was never great\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and\nWriting and directing had always been his ambition ... detour to acting after taking an acting class which he was told it was really good\nA compliment can reroute you for sixteen years [laughter]\nDid you find the right complement for the right insecure person and they can change your life and Marine Corps again reviews the book about the murder of fourteen year old Emmett Till\nIn Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi which helped lead to the civil rights movement [noise]\nSexism and disrespect\nRight which is very deliberate and\nThe difficulty of watching it is deliberate at times and also these young men are also very there for one another and my point is that things aren't so black and white people can do horrible things and still do the kinds of things\nPeople can do ... things and still do horrible things these kids in danger one another's lives very seriously and they're all\nSo asleep at the hospital when they wake up and I'm not judging these characters it's not my job to judge them I wanted to show for better or for worse how people spoke and behave in the mid\nNineteen nineties in this culture\nSo the teenagers who you cast as the skaters in the film most of them seem like they're like professional skate boarders I they skating competitions they represent various um companies how did you find them [noise]\nUm there's a young man who worked on the moving him Mikey Alfred who are we made a co producer who owned escape company in LA and he ah brought a lot of local Los Angeles skate boarders into audition\nAs well as I went to skate parks and did my own research but a lot of these kids came from him being an escape scene in Los Angeles and bringing in tons of people and\nI guess me seeing the potential for these young skate boarders as actors I saw how bombastic how funny how smart how damaged how raw how joyous how painful\nThe soles in lives are of the people that I noticed within this world which made me even want to tell the story in the first place\n[noise] my impression watching the movie is that a lot of the lines might have been improvised that you might have said here's the basic stuff I Want you to communicate but say your way\nBecause you know a lot of what they're saying to each other isn't really about the content of what they're saying it's more about the attitude and there's a lot of expletives in it and like some of it on the page would it you know what I mean I like I wasn't sure if you were writing that out word for word if you were saying just like go with it and then filming and editing\nI take that as a massive complement because that style of writing is so deliberate and I wanted the kids to improvise but they were obsessed\nWith becoming great actors and becoming these characters and learning this screenplay and for me it took three years in twenty draft you deliberately right every I'm In like an expletive within reason behind it wow really and uh-huh\nAnd that's very intentional and that's you know capturing very realistic dialogue that seems improvise is a compliment to these young performers acting and you know really deliberate thought and how these people speak to one another\n[noise] did you learn to speak that way\nYes I think I was taught and maybe culturally we were taught at that time if you're a man and you express\nYour feelings are you express it something hurts you then you should be made fun of\nAnd that kind of repression leads to anger and anger leads to bad behavior and I think I wanted to show a film about young men with an inability to express themselves\nThat this thing is like you or\nAs a child and then as a young teen you were writing like scripts for The Simpsons I'm\nNot on a professional level who you were just like writing for The Simpsons so ... had both ambition and also a a facility for words you lived in a world of words\nYou wanted to communicate on the page and I'm thinking one must have been like for you to have this urge to write to communicate to make written jokes\nReferring to pop culture with characters in it I mean that's what The Simpsons is all about and at the same time feel like but you're not supposed to express yourself because you're a boy\nYeah and I'm not I'm not victimizing myself I think as a straight white male I have more privileged and I can't even comprehend horse yeah ... my last\nYear you were kind of suppressing something they came really natural to you that you really valued\nRight and I also I have always been expected to be a certain type of thing and I played right into that out of my own and security as a person and\nAs a kid was very funny identifies a writer first and foremost in my life after just brother person uncle and stuff like that first occupation I Would lift it would be a writer [noise]\nAnd then going into a culture where that kind of verbal communication or emotional communication is mocked\nAnd then on top of that you know even when I became a well known public figure I think the duality of comedy and being overweight and all this stuff allowed for jokes and punches to be made about me and towards me\nWhich turned me angry here which made me communicate worse\nAnd then when you're funny\nYou become a bit mean all speak for myself you think of the thing to hurt the other person 'cause you assume they're about to hurt you\nIt all plays into each other in this very weird cyclical thing and then I became famous as an overweight comedian and then I felt like I wasn't given the respect as a human being\nA lot of humor as like self deprecating humor and self deprecating humor doesn't go over and that kind of like teen masculine I'm like athletic culture\nI say this is an outsider to all of that [laughter] but but anyways did you have an impulse toward self deprecating humor but no\nI knew that that wouldn't be appropriate to the scene that you were in\nI think my point is I'm trying to even in my twenties even going through a career publicly going through my twenties publicly either being mean and defensive or self deprecating to a point where you are beating yourself up to feel like you deserve a see the table are both unhealthy\nFor me because obviously being mean makes you feel bad when you go home if you have a heart which I Do and then and being defensive or beating yourself up gives you a real problem with your self esteem\nAnd the way I related that in mid nineties or tried to express that\nWithin the character of Stevie is this person's currency in his life is his ability to take abuse and to take pay and I don't want to give away the end of the film but the film along with my own journey has been a tremendous amount about self acceptance\nDo his issues are are different than yours and his way of resolving is different than yours but that's the the core emotional issues that you're getting at\nIs that we all beat ourselves up I explore male self abuse in the film was something that I found after doing a lot of research very troubling and fascinating um literal sibling abuse troubling and fascinating\nAnd why skateboarding is a natural draw to someone who takes hits whether inflicted from someone else would themself\nWhy do you think it's an actual draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and\nThere's something punishing about that in self punishing about that and there's a great\nReward that is true we earned even if it's just for you where are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life\nMore emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm I'm cars aren't have cars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just the general recklessness which are related to not related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my store\nAnd director to say this is a dream what's happening now is like an understatement um\nAnd when I went to new school in New York I Would write these one act play and we would often put them up bars and um\nWhen I Would have actors read I had really bad bedside manner because I didn't understand\nWhy they wouldn't do it in the way that you wrote it and my friend pulled me aside really generously as a good friend and was like look like you need to learn how to talk to actors they don't like\nThey don't like auditioning you know and they don't like working with you\nSo I took an acting class to learn how I'd want to be spoken to\nAs an actor so maybe I could speak more eloquently and lovingly towards actors and I was such an insecure person that I got such positive feedback in acting class\nThat have derailed me for sixteen years [laughter] and and and this amazing derailment in this amazing education in film and film school and also finding a new expression that is another creative expression that I Love\nThat is so interesting that you really wanted to direct and you took the acting class just to learn how to speak with her to actors that's that's weird that's crazy that's interesting\nA complement can reroute you for sixteen years [laughter] do you find the right complement for the right insecure person and they can change your life did you agree that you were a good\nYes I Am struggle with taking complements ah my instinct is to make a joke or say no\nI'm but where I'm at in my life is I don't really want to be so negative towards myself and try and be kind to myself and the truth is I I I did think I was good acting mhm\n[noise] and then is it fair to say that you kind of found\nA different kind of try and then the skateboarding tried that you found like maybe your real tribe was Judd Apatow circle of actors and writers even though you weren't in freaks and geeks you are in so many Judd Apatow directed and produced movies how did you become part of the ... tribe\nWell I met actually the Kashmir dry hair to mid nineties Alice and Jones is judge catching director and that's why I hired her for my first film because she she's the one who introduced me to judge I after I did I heard how could these I met some casting directors because uh\nYou know I got like an Asian off of that and then ... and introduced me to jot and brought me in to read for that little one line and four year old virgin and I don't know then I stuck around\n[noise] so there's one specific line I'm going to ask you about because this line fits so well with what we were talking about before about\nHaving to learn a kind of masculinity and attitude that you hadn't learned and skateboard culture and you might be able to guess the line I'm going to ask you about\nThis from Superbad which you start in with um with Michael Cera and um [noise] you're you're you're a high school kid and this and you know you're not part of the cool crowd at all and one of the really popular high school girls play by Emma Stone who you know ... or within the Netflix series maniac\nI Love her yeah I Am from a distance I Love her to [laughter] from the\nDecision if you're already has the honor for as a person could use a an actor\nGood good good that always makes me happy to hear but anyway she's going to be throwing a party while her parents are gone and she needs somebody to buy alcohol and even though you're under age you just said you're going to get the alcohol you know bring it to the party and be the hero and so you're you're trying to tell the Michael Cera character\nA about this and he's kind of skeptical of this is a very good idea the Iliad and be able to do it\nAnd then you say and I'm going to say like the really clean version of this because it's much too expletive laced for us to play this on the radio that you basically say\nYou know how girls say I was so drunk last night I shouldn't have had sex with that guy we could be that mistake so gosh that sounds you know I mean women are so furious about ... teenage boys an adult men try to get girls and women trunk or drug to get them into bad\nI mean it literally horrified [laughter] what a hard thing to hear because the idea behind that is this young man is hoping the young woman is showing ... braided that her judgment would be so poor that she would make a mistake by sleeping with him\nAnd that is incredibly wrong and I didn't write that film so I think comedy has a really hard time in the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at\nUs times change that was never right\nBut for some reason there was okay to make a joke about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound to you\nAwful [laughter] but it didn't sound good to me than either I didn't like the idea that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded setting up yeah\n[laughter] I was deeply upsetting I you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I not that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity to understand that those words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality\nI don't think I ever thought of that as a reality 'cause it's not my experience and so now thinking of that as a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that so um so it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have evolved you\nKnow and that and the subjects you've all taken on since then because I I think things have changed [noise]\nYeah and I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is\nThat I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger hard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know\nThose people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\nOne only take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but he's now a director and screenwriter his directorial debut is called mid nineties we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise]\nMm\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from YouTube originals and roadside attraction presenting fiber club

and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director in this directorial debut is called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first the kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties\nYeah and and now like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you've set up playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you are interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices\nYou know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me\nAnd then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and cast me and money ball\nAnd then in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nSo more than ... we like to say\nTo afford its own space the collective asked for donations and loans they got what they needed and more after securing enough funds to buy an old bank building they asked for a few supporters to help them move the books to the new location\nWe were hoping to get sued to maybe a hundred people on the day we had a two hundred people turned out which was like to hold\nReader by readers they formed a human chain and book by book transferred the books to the new location\nIt's um no she just the distance it's about a hundred and fifty made his you'd say within within show up this does still creeps me out a fair amount to people so to or we didn't like the ...\nPeople waiting at bus stops came to help and passers by also joined this literary chain the whole process collectively took about an hour\nIt was really sort of surprising and positive and just a really amazing experience to see people chipping in\nBecause they wanted to help and they want to be part of something bigger it's something you didn't see that often people talk about things I thought that she thinks the turnout was something quite different [laughter]\nThe grand opening of October books new location is this Saturday\n\nOkay today on all tech considered an all out battle in the world of online dating [noise]\n\nIf you're looking for love you are not going to find any at least not between the apps bumble and hinder you might know how these apps work you look at someone's photo and you either swipe left\nOr swipe right well bumbling tinder are now fighting in court over whether bumble swiped ideas from tinder NPR's community ... explains that this fight raises questions about how patents work in the Internet age she\nHas tried a number of dating apps there are tons of them and they're all equally horrible dating is hard but using the apps is pretty easy in both bumble intend our users see a picture of a possible date when\nYou swipe left it's not so many are interested in and if you swipe right than you are interested in their interest in as well then you connect [noise]\nThese or snap decisions oh now that's used wrinkle shirt not my type into very rapid fire like trying to find\nThat swipe was a key feature of tender which launched first and then in early tender employee who is dating her boss one of the co founders broke up with him left the company alleged sexual harassment she went on to found bumble like tinder accept women move first\nThe apps very similar maybe two similar\nMatch the parent company of tinder is suing bumble for almost every type of IP infringement you could think of\nSarah Bernstein is a professor at the University of Oklahoma College of law and by IP she means intellectual property tinder has patent and trademark covering the way it works but bumble has counter suit and called those IP claims bogus\nYou don't own the concept of swiping rights or swiping left you don't own the concept of matchmaking\nThere's a lot of money at stake Forbes values bumble it over a billion dollars in tenders worth even more so tender didn't invent matchmaking or swiping but Kennedy on the idea of swipe based dating apps it turns\nIt's a complicated question and it raises much bigger issues patents are supposed to cover specific inventions they aren't supposed to cover abstract ideas Daniel neither is a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier foundation\nSays you don't get a patent for saying cure to ensure with a drug you have to say what the drug is\nThen along came the Internet and people discovered they can patent some pretty abstract ideas as long as they added a computer like you couldn't pat and the idea of meal planning but you could a patent meal planning on line you can't patent restaurant menus but you could patent on line menus\nThe patent system at started really handing out patterns for solve this problem with software\nThat changed four years ago a company called the Alice corporation had some abstract online banking patents and the Supreme Court threw them out the court ruled that an abstract idea plus the computer is still an abstract idea\nNeither says the Alice decision could be bad news for tender tenders patent is just the abstract idea of matchmaking but online that's no longer allowed but did I mention that it's complicated\nWhat is abstract is itself pretty abstract and challenging question\nYou can patent software your idea just has to be an innovation so of course tinder says that swiping to match people was unique in innovative\nThe swipe fight is still working its way through the courts but in the meantime it's clear the Supreme Court's decision tightened the rules for software patterns which has had a big impact way beyond the dating industry neither argues it's been a positive change promoting healthy competition\nBut others worry that good patents are being thrown out as well Michael Risch is a professor at Villanova university's law school\nIf you apply the definitions courts used it for abstract many of our most famous and would wind up being on ... like the telephone\nSarah ... says this push and pull it goes right to the heart of patent law is this sort of internal tension we have between trying to get the rights not too broad a lot too narrow but really trying to get them just trying to find the right balance\nAlmost as hard as trying to find the right match [noise]\nCommute on NPR hands\nThat considered comes from ultimate software

emotional issues that you're getting at\nIs that we all beat ourselves up I explore male self abuse in the film is something that I found after doing a lot of research very troubling and fascinating um literal sibling abuse troubling and fascinating\nAnd why skateboarding is a natural draw to someone who takes hits whether inflicted from someone else or themself why do you think it's an actual draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something punishing about that in self punishing about that\nAnd there's a great reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you where are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and more emotional [laughter]\nGood for you [laughter] yeah I'm\nCars aren't have SARS or inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general recklessness which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community has deep\nFlaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any that for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and and learn some of this stuff\nAnd he's just made us directing debut with the new film mid nineties which he also wrote it's about a subculture skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill\nWas skateboarding so um we were talking about loving movies wanting to write and to direct how did you start acting and how old were you when you started to realize not only wanted to do it but that you were good at it\nOr I think there are two very different answers to that question my goal my whole life was to be a writer and director\nTo say this is a dream what's happening now is like an understatement um\nAnd when I went to new school in New York I Would write these will not play and we would often put them up bars and um\nWhen I Would have actors read I had really bad bedside manner because I didn't understand why they wouldn't do it in the way that you wrote it and\nMy friend pulled me aside really generously as a good friend and was like look like you need to learn how to talk to actors they don't like\nThey don't like auditioning you know and they don't like working with you and so I took an acting class\nTo learn how I'd want to be spoken to\nAs an actor so maybe I could speak more eloquently and lovingly towards actors and I was such an insecure person that I got such positive feedback in acting class\nThat have derailed me for sixteen years [laughter] and and in this amazing derailment in this amazing education\nIn film and film school and also finding a new expression that is another creative expression that I Love\nThat is so interesting that you really wanted to direct and you took the acting class just to learn how to speak better to actors that's that's weird that's crazy that's interesting\nA compliment can reroute you for sixteen years [laughter] do you find the right complement for the right insecure person and they can change your life did you agree that you were good\nYes I Am struggle with taking complements ah my instinct is to make a joke or say no\nI'm but where I'm at in my life is I don't really want to be so negative towards myself and try and be kind to myself and the truth is I I I did think I always get it acted mhm\n[noise] and then is it fair to say that you kind of found\nA different kind of try than the skateboarding tried that you found like maybe your real tribe was Judd Apatow circle of actors and writers even though you weren't in freaks and geeks you were in so many Judd Apatow directed and produced movies how did you become part of the ... tribe\nWell I met actually the cashier dry hired a mid nineties Alison Jones is judge catching director and that's why I hired her for my first film because she she's the one who introduced me to judge I after I did I heard how could these I met some casting directors because uh\nYou know I got like an Asian off of that and then ... me to judge and brought me in to read for that little one line in four year old virgin and\nI don't know then I stuck around\n[noise] so there's one specific line I'm going to ask you about 'cause this line fits so well with what we were talking about before about\nHaving to learn a kind of masculinity an attitude that you hadn't learned and skateboard culture and you might be able to guess the line I'm going to ask you about\nThis from Superbad which you start in with um with Michael Cera and um [noise] you're you're you're a high school kid and this and you know you're not part of the cool crowd and all and one of the really popular high school girls play by Emma Stone who you know ... or within the Netflix series maniac\nI Love her yeah I ... from a distance I Love her to [laughter] from the\nDecision if you're already has the honor for as a person could use a an actor\nGood good good that always makes me happy to hear but anyway she's going to be throwing a party while her parents are gone and she needs somebody to buy alcohol and even though you're under age you just said you're going to get the alcohol you know bring it to the party and be the hero and so you're you're trying to tell the Michael Cera character\nOr about this and he's kind of skeptical of this is a very good idea the Iliad and be able to do it\nAnd then you say and I'm going to say like the really clean version of this because it's much too expletive laced for us to play this on the radio that you basically say\nYou know have girls say I was so drunk last night I shouldn't have had sex with that guy\nWe could be that mistake so gosh that sounds you know I mean women are so furious about ... teenage boys an adult men trying to get girls and women trunk or drummed to get them into bad\nI mean it literally horrified [laughter] what a hard thing to hear because the idea behind that is this young man is hoping the young woman is showing ... braided that her judgment would be so poor that she would make a mistake by sleeping\nWith him and that is incredibly wrong and I didn't write that film so I think comedy has a really hard time in the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at\nUs times change that was never right\nBut if for some reason it was okay to make a joke about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound to you awful\n[laughter] but it didn't sound good to me than either I didn't like the idea that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded so upsetting uh yeah [laughter]\nI was deeply upsetting or you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I\nNot that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity\nTo understand that those words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality I don't think I ever thought of that as a reality 'cause it's not my experience and so now thinking of that as a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that [noise]\nSo um so it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have evolved you know and that and the subjects you've all taken on since then because I I think things have changed\n[noise] yeah and I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is that I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger\nHard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know those people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\n[noise] what do we take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but he's now a director and screenwriter his directorial debut is called mid nineties we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise]\nReal loving each year you would do we ensure veterans you know we appreciate the sacrifices we made a wise keep our country for\nHe'll do did you see
