{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Appear to be independent on face like the ones in New Jersey Washington state they're actually simply conditions that allow both sides too gerrymandered together under the guise\nOf non partisanship that does not make a better system either there are lots of other ways we could go about this um you know congressman done by or has a bill up called the fair representation act that involves you know larger\nMulti member districts and folks elected by rank choice voting you know that's another way of looking at this and going about it but um there are going to be you know a lot of\nOf changes here I think as\nAs Brett Kavanaugh takes a seat on the Supreme Court you've had reformers for the last decade pinning their hopes on on Anthony Kennedy and a national standard there that road for a national standard\nAppears to be closed and in fact\nI'm you might now have five justices on the court who frown on the very idea of independent commissions at all so what you might be looking at our legislative fixes as well you know something that opens up the process that you know guarantees transparency that you know mandates that\nAre folks who are joining these lines can't favor or does favor any political party or candidate there are all kinds of supercomputers that can draw you know twenty five thousand sample lines and perhaps\nForced politicians to test the extreme districts that are they draw up against non partisan on right so I mean I think we're going to have to look at other ways of doing this especially as we run out of states that are allowed to take this on the ballot\nYou may also be interested in our program that we did on ranks choice voting earlier this year you'll find that on line at the one a dot org I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one day\nI Know what time is short but read Wilson I wanted to get your sense about how the U.S Supreme Court has factored into redistricting it has never struck down a map for\nPartisan gerrymandering whereas now a new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh on the court which are read of the future of redistricting gerrymandering figuring out this whole thing before the U.S Supreme Court\nYeah as David Was mentioning I we were we were all sort of waiting for Anthony Kennedy to come up with some kind of standard that could be applied\nAcross the country but to a number of cases in places like Virginia and North Carolina have been reminded back to lower courts so we're still waiting for a a real honest to God challenge that actually makes it to the Supreme Court ah and and resolve itself in some way other than a sort of a punch back to a to a lower court\nI mean you can read I I I'm Sorry to interrupt I Know we're short on time but it seems like the issue is really just trying to define gerrymandering in a legal sense like we have an emphasis definition\nOf obscenity from Miller versus California in Nineteen Seventy three like there's a there's a checklist literally there's just a checklist you go through something is obscene if but we don't have a checklist to define the line between redistricting and gerrymandering\nAnd and and we don't even have a definition as to whether or not gerrymandering is illegal or or a unconstitutional and by the way let's also defying the phrase fair what are we looking for when we talk about a fair redistricting process is it\nCompact districts is a district that encourage competition I'll tell ya in my home state of Washington this the commission that gets together is appointed by the house and Senate Democratic and Republican conference as\nThey get to get those four people get together and elect a fifth a nonpartisan person they always come up with a five nothing map\nThat that everybody gets along with and their goal is to create a a district that will be or at least a few districts that will be democratic any few districts that will be Republican sold at Washington state has a member of the majority party in Congress so that they can get something back in ... when\nA when they need to but the fact is that what is fair use it is it competition in November is it having representation from minority groups there is a district in in the Chicago suburbs\nThat looks like an alligator with its draws open that district makes sense because it's about Seventy two percent Hispanic so the very large Hispanic population in Chicago that lives in different neighborhoods has a representative in Congress I'd argue that's fair\nOne last question David Bailey that we've gotten quite a bit of you mentioned computers and I asked instead of allowing people to redrawn districts why not give the task\nTo artificial intelligence they could probably draw much fairer evenly distributed lines based on square mileage and the process would no longer be partisan day but I Wonder if the challenge with that is figuring out what to tell the computer to do or are we at that point now before we I think\nI think read is right I think that there are so many competing values here and that people have to decide what values they want out of representation these are very basic questions and sometimes those values are in conflict with one another uh do you want districts that are contiguous in contact\nThat well a district that has compact around the city you might you know simply elect all Democrats of 'em so those districts might not necessarily be competitive I'm so a lot of these values our intention and we as people ought to talk about them and work out\nOf those values supercomputers are amazing in this though I think what they have done is they have shown that the maps that politicians are produced\nAre very extreme and in a state like North Carolina or in Michigan you can run you know twenty five thousand draft maps off of the criteria that the politicians are given\nAnd you can see exactly how ... you never get the extreme outcomes on one hand if I could work into the process of supercomputers that would be great but I Would not turn it over to them\nAnd before we go speaking of Michigan Katie ... if you're initiative passes will you be involved with the commission in any way what will be next for you briefly\nThe biggest thing is if you want to make sure that people now know that they can serve on this commission so will want to go out and keep raising awareness that you can apply if you're registered voter\nUm and also then people actually for the first time be invited into this process so they can go and give testimony about how they want their communities you represented so we're going to make sure that we're making sure that uh people now that they could now be involved in redistricting\nJudy

[noise]\nI Love his poetry I Love his words I Love the way he marshals language I Am I'm weary of discussing my father I always have been a especially when you have a a person who\nHad such an inevitable wave I'm command of language so I'm hesitant and I didn't even know whether I should I I'm not certain I should be speaking about him\nBut um but it's a stirring up\nThat and I have been enlisted time enlisted in the\nIn the campaign to let everybody know how wonderful I think he was\nDo you feel protective of his privacy 'cause in my opinion like your father was very\nUm elliptical in his writing and\nA pretty private about his life he alluded to a lot of things in his songs but never quite came out and said them in a direct way\nOh I I I'm not certain that that's true in terms of the use of the word direct\nOkay but I Will say that um\nTo speak on his behalf feels like a little bit of a transgression you know you have a man who has designed his life around trying to not demystify a process um and uh his work really does speak for itself\nSo you know of course I urge people to just consulted if they're interested in it uh it's it yes it's complete with\nContradictions you know you go from things that are actually quite direct to things that are mysterious and elusive and designed to be transcended because of it um but he was preoccupied with the uh the broken this of things the ah the symmetry of things [noise]\nYou know as he says forget your perfect offering [noise]\nThere's a crack in everything\nOr and his most famous song hallelujah\nIt doesn't matter what you heard a whole year the broken hallelujah so he was always preoccupied with the idea of the imperfection of things\nYeah there's there's a crack and everything and that's that's where the light gets in\nI don't have the line exactly at my fingertips but I mean it's\nThe ring the bells that still can wring forget your perfect offering there is a crack and everything that's how the light gets in\nYeah so like whatever like can get through the crack test you know I mean you see the light but he sees the thing that only has a crack that lets the light and ... you know it always had the duality of everything as I think what I'm trying to say I'm so\nOh yeah I I I remember him dancing so beautifully around these kinds of questions which I think he uh was irritated by [laughter]\nVery core and when I say that I don't mean to be disparaging of the person I'm constructing the questions I think it's natural for us to be curious and to articulate our concerns or thoughts are questions but I think it's also natural for the quote unquote artists to\nPreserve the kind of mystery I'm seemed to not talk about the mechanics almost like a porno you know this goes in here that goes in there there's something bigger than the mechanics and that is the end the end result the stirring quality of of what is the result of an artist's work\nAnd um you know I think he uh has he said you know I put my paper had on my concussion and dance he tried on many occasions to to dance around questions or a cooperate Tibet as best he could and I feel like such a shabby posture trying to\nUm be the ... for him you know the ambassador of this particular book which I had very little to do with frankly others and offering a title for it or he wrote a very\nEloquent introduction which I Will be quoting as time goes on here [laughter]\nThank you so I ... I think you've said he left behind like lockers worth of notebooks what are you dealing with them I mean you ... like he was always riding there's always a cocktail napkins in pages and\nIn his pocket she found a notebook in the freezer ones um so what what are you dealing with the findings\nWell it's amazing there's so much paperwork to go through a from the simplest point of view is the ... the archival work which is assembling everything and trying to pay homage to it for posterity then there's a the completion of works of his in this instance it's the flame this book\nUm and then there were also some songs which I was tasked with finishing you know you may know I ha I produced his last record the\nCold you want a darker and while working with him many many poems were red sometimes to a mere kicked Trump you know just for a meter for tempo and so there's this sense of responsibility to keep the songs alive is he always used to say\nI Want to play the title song on the final album that was released when your father line at Khan was still alive it's called you on a darker and then we'll talk about working\nWith him on hand and this is it's what can I say it's a great song [noise]\n\nIf you she means\nMind because if\n[noise]\n\nAh I was in [noise]\nIn the human\nA million candles and burning for the middle of the game\n\nRead [noise]\nAs Leonard calling from the final album that was released while he was alive the title track\nYou want a darker I guess his his son Adam ... wrote the introduction to a new collection of ... final homes ... lyrics and drawings called the flame that China so much about facing death ended up having a God who allows suffering and accepting\nThe suffering but yet not being like happy about it are trying to make it seem like sufferings great [laughter] you know he's not trying to be spiritual and dismissive way of of all the suffering that we indoor\n[noise] um I I Want to read\nWhat he wrote about you for the liner notes\nOf this album he wrote that without your contribution that would be no record he said at a certain point after over a year of intense labor\nBoth pat who wrote the melodies and coincidentally broke down with severe back injuries and other disagreeable visitations in my case the situation was bleak the discomfort acute and the project was abandoned\nAdam sense that my recovery if not my survival depended on my getting back to work he took over the project establish me in a medical chair to sing and brought these unfinished songs to completion preserving of course many pets hunting musical themes\nAnd it's because of my sons loving encouragement and skilled administration that the sun's exist in their presence for 'em I cannot think enough\nWhat were you able to do for him physically to make it possible for him to record the album he mentions you put him in a medical ... can you describe to say about that that you helped create for him\nI think maybe the more interesting things certainly to me would be to to just say that\nWe were writing some kind of mysterious wind and the grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire\nMission and of course it had to do with a serious health issues he was a mobilized you had a multiple compression fractures of his spine and it involved an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did\nThere's something about his work in general not just on the last help them but in this book and in general\nHe he invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously he's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become ...\nAnd are there to always be versus to consult and I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time I didn't want to put out um\n[noise] isn't that amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have have grown you know he lived in a kind of like comic anonymity if you buy those too if you buy that unlikely union\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to have\nSet on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to in my forties um the whole canon of his work is is living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah as you say there's there were eighty four versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four but did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it complete it because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because\nThere's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nAs the popular a poem states a poem is never finished would rather abandoned\n[laughter]\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think frustration\nWas expected um ... the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as I say he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages and uh and gave up\nAn enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised enormous amount of go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patience and my family my master piece on signed\n[noise] you know you call it that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought desk thought and that's often attribute it to a one of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter]\nYeah he he edited and take all the edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic it was a constant process of filtration and refined for certain\nSo why why don't we hear hallelujah your father's version sure\n[laughter] Atlanta yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right is that fleet transgression yet yeah refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something or you know or you know give give some other songs a chance to get played [laughter] um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family has on hello yeah I think I think I'll play it anyway are you okay with that\nOh God I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay I heard it\n\nReally\nAre like oh man\n[noise]\nOh oh\nThat's ... singing hallelujah and my guess is when it comes son Adam Cohen and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion mislead published Leonard cone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until Jack Buckley recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\nYeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nOr he was a seeker I wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you had this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself and that's what made the end of his life that more ... surprising and delicious you know this is a unexpected\nAbility to have to fill the twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and\nTo see him take his hat off you know and I think the Juba\nWhen audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and two things the larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone\nEnjoy your solitude and I thought like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say such a lovely way of sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone enjoy your solitaire\nYeah maybe songs find you and your solitude yeah\nThat's why I made a blood ... actually the the exact quote has made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful\nWell this is a man who has he says and I think you've you've just played it um you know although we had a reputation as a ladies' man you know he was he had the greatest teeth to ten thousand nights he spent alone he understood something about solitude\nWell let me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard ... a final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished\nAnd it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nWe're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back this is

standards are for every town throughout throughout the United states\nAnd these maps were looking at our from from Nineteen thirty and as you mentioned there are maps from many other years so it sounds like these could be a very valuable tools for researchers today\nAbsolutely in fact uh the Sanborn fire insurance maps are really the only collection of of maps in the United states that are historians demographers can use\n'em to understand the evolution of a single property or a single area so for instance we can look at a map from say Eighteen eighty five of the city of Jacksonville and compare that to a map from Nineteen fifty five of that same are the same area within the city of Jacksonville\nUh and if you look at every volume it depended on the size of the city or as to when a new volume will be published\nA book for a larger city like Jacksonville that was more frequent than say St Augustine but we can look at every volume you know when the ten year segment and literally see the evolution of an urban area and that is vitally important to a A R understanding of how\nUh the growth of of cities within the United states occurred in the late nineties and early twenties centuries\nAnd it's a vital important for for historians for genealogist as well ah for folks who are or even historic preservation is in those involved with a restoration of historic buildings you know a lot of these buildings still exist so how do we know that you know which ah where windows were place and whether or not there was a garage attached to restructure things like that\nAll of that can be found on these Sanborn a fire insurance maps now\nAt the library of Congress probably has the largest single collection of these maps but there are a few other firms throughout the throughout
