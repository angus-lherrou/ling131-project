{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "The likely false content so that it's not likely to become violently and it won't be seen by as many people on Facebook\nNow how do you walk that line in terms of making sure that content that is likely falls is actually false or it's not something that I don't know I wrote as a satire piece that people are just overreacted to\nGreat point it's really hard for us to know and we want to make sure that there's room for satire and we know that people will have different\nUh some people might call a story sensationalist and others will say no this is just passionate and so that's why we're not removing this content generally what we're doing is putting related articles and information about the publisher that content there where people can see it and access it readily\nThe very first interview we did on this program when we first launched was with Jeffrey Rosen who's the CEO of national constitution center and the first question I asked on the very first episode of one I was what does something people think they know about the first amendment but they really don't\nAnd the first answer he gave was people think the first amendment applies to Facebook yes and it does not the first\nAmendment does not govern social media it governs governments\nFacebook is not an arm or the government is big enough some people feel like it is but it's not and the first amendment does not bind\nFacebook I Wonder how the company deals with the tension do between our expectations under the first amendment and analogous laws around the world and the policies that Mark Zuckerberg wants for Facebook how does that tension workout\nLooks like a bird's desire always wind is the first amendment sometimes when like how does that go\nYou know most interested in in our content policies but he also recognizes that what we want from these policies or is it is for them to reflect what the global population using Facebook wants\nAnd so that's why our policies are crafted after consultation with a lot of extra colonel I'm people and organizations around the world that's what drives the policy creation now you're right people often think that the first amendment applies to Facebook and it doesn't\nAnd in fact if you look at our policies hate speech lawful in the United states not allowed on Facebook what we try to do is just be very open about that that's why our policies are public so people will know that this is a social being apart from that has different rules than us criminal laws\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nYou get the sense that the team realizes the scope of the task I get the feeling from talking to people outside of Silicon Valley far outside of Silicon Valley\nThat engineers do really get it that the kind of playing with code and they don't understand all the time that there are people on the other side of that code do they do they get that they're playing with a personal private information\n[noise] they do I mean and keep in mind they're not working in a vacuum so if you look at my team who are writing the content policies and overseeing their enforcement on my team I have people who are experts in you know I've got human rights lawyers I have a rape crisis counselor I have a former middle school teacher\nI have a terrorism academic as somebody with a PHD an extremist hate organizations so\nThose people come to Facebook because these are the issues they're passionate about and those are the people who are working with the engineering team's directly on coming up with ways to find violating content and the waste review it so I'm so yes this is it is pervasive\nPeople really do care about creating a safe environment and a good experience\nSpeaking of extremist organizations a few more things I did want to ask you about before I let you go particularly the counterterrorism part of your role at Facebook talk about how Facebook deals with terrorists what you define as terrorist activity and how you address it on a global scale\n[noise] our policy is we don't allow any violent organization so if it's an organization that has proclaimed to violent mission or engaged in documented acts of violence\nIt doesn't matter what their ideology is whether it's um you know religious or political they are a violent organization and our terms that means they cannot use Facebook if we see a credible threat of violence we will reach out to our legal team they'll assessed that and if appropriate they'll actually send that to law enforcement proactively yes one\nMore thing I didn't want to ask you about before I let you go one of the new efforts that's been made to address biased content is this new policy on political ads which as it turned out inadvertently labeled some journalism as political content but Facebook announced it will be retooling that policy that announcement was made this week\nTalk through what this process has been like of of assessing this making changes figuring out how to deal with political ads especially after the twenty sixteen election\nThe idea is making sure that you know who was behind ... who's paying for that\nSo now if somebody tries to run a political ad in the United states we will first verify their identity they actually have to send us a government ID so we know who they are\nAnd then we will also um put on the ad who has paid for the ad kind of like that paid for that you're used to Sandra Johnson I approve this message exactly um you can also go to the site and if you look at at I think it's Facebook dot com slash political content ads\nYou'll be able to see an archive of political ads that are running or have been right and who's been behind them\nThis is all geared towards keeping people more visibility into political ads they're seen\nAnd any time that we launch a policy like this we know there will be some glitches um you know for instance how do you define a political advertiser and what if somebody doesn't readily Abyei readily available government ID so those are some things that were working through but we do think transparency is really important Monica thanks for talking to us thank you\nBut it's Monica bigger to vice president of global policy management at Facebook\nFor those of you who are new to one day

J. C. T. Jacksonville your community your world\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air today growing up with an absent mother who is addicted to heroin we talk with Jared J. ... about his new graphic memoir for young adults hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction\nHis mother started doing drugs when she was Thirteen his new book is nominated for a National Book award and assigning for one of his earlier books his wife overheard a woman telling a friend\nI was his mother's parole officer and I went on the house to do a wellness check\nAnd he was a baby crying alone is created by himself no one else somehow\nThat's an example of why of course asked his grandparents assumes legal custody when he was about to turn three welcome to being the child of an addict that's coming up on fresh air\nThat I grew up in to pursue my dreams via art college uh so it seemed like a natural for me to tell that perspective from the Seventeen year old self\nThe story is holds the perspective of the the Seventeen year old Jared and you know it it's funny I didn't really think of it as a quote unquote you know grown up book but really are a lot of grown ups have been reading it and responding to it and identifying with it because you know addiction touches\nOh so many of us are either directly or just we're just one degree away from it it seems\nSo are the details about your mother that you felt were too upsetting to put in a book for young people\n[noise] I've been working on this book in one way or another since the early early to thousands and every time I Would sit down to write it\nI Would stop and hesitate because I Would I Would worry to myself well why aren't people kind of thing and at first it was what are the people in the book going to think you know if I'm writing about them\nAnd um and I was shopping hesitate and then as my career grew in I became known as the the lunch lady guy I have a series of graphic novels about a lunch lady who fights ... crime and his campaign it's funny and\nI thought wow is this is writing a book on the subject matter going to be in such contrast to that [noise] those happy books that I Would be putting my career on the line um\n... as I've traveled the country and I met more and more and more young people who are dealing with this I realized that this was sort of a responsibility for me to write this book I mean\nYou know to go with a theme of comic books with with a great power becomes great responsibility now I have an audience of these kids who grew up with my books I'm able to deliver the story in a very unique way\nAnd I and I feel like I owe it to these readers to to put myself out there and I realize that if I if I was going to write memoir had just write it without any inhibition and I I wrote down the expression and all that will censor this for the radio but I said right like you don't give an ass\nAnd not that I don't care about the craft or care about the readers but I Can't worry about negative opinions you know I have to just write this and put out there so there are some things I learned about my mother later on in life\nUm but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother\nAnd uh but there there is one particular scene a because I did have to explain how really how my mother fully went away you know why would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult and I was able to find a way to share that and the story but not give that knowledge to the protagonist\nAnd when I was when I was a toddler she was on a very abusive relationship and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they'd murdered somebody\nAnd uh my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's a big reason why she went away\nYou're heading that would have been seen as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of\nYou know what let me just mentally shelf that we can focus on being a dad to the human being but I don't know how to take care of and then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book I realize narrative Lee I have to explain to the readers\nFully why she's going away for so long um\nYou know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall or or for stealing batteries from a convenience store\nUm and I'll tell you like you might be the ... six or seven person I've ever so the outlaw how to Terry and I and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heady issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody of you 'cause they were afraid you'd become a ward of the state\nThat's exactly it that's exactly it and they were and they also afraid I Would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be ten soon ... and ... has been this sort of the forbidden fruit in our house I'm just really wanted to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child ah\nSo I sat down with her and I explained her a lot of the aspects of this book before she would read it and and also made sure she read it before the book was published do a classmate didn't come in and say oh I Know this about your family and she didn't\nAnd so he is so intuitive and she has such a big heart when she heard the story she immediately said well she probably went along with it because she was maybe afraid that she would get murdered or maybe they would murder you as a baby as well\n[noise] well [noise] ... one of the stories you tell in the book is that when you started living with his grandparents either shot that they made breakfast free because even before you were three when you were living with your mother and you'd wake up to an empty house and have to make your own breakfast\n[noise] that's true and uh I remember them telling me this and you know again sometimes things in that as an adult come at you and you learn about these different aspects of your your youth and this is an in the book because again this is something that um I Would have learned later\nI'm after my grandparents passed I created an art scholarship in their name but the Worcester art museum where I attended classes and to sort of kick start the scholarship and let people know this was happening I had an exhibit at the ... museum and it was also coincided with my ten year anniversary of getting published\nAnd a woman came through the line with her children index settled they got their book signed and after they got their book sign they you know a couple of steps away and they were chatting with their friends or they didn't realize they were within earshot at my wife Tina\nAnd this woman said you know the last time I saw him he was a baby and I was his mother's parole officer\nAnd I went on the house to do a wellness check and he was a baby crying alone in his crib by himself no one else in the house well there I was you know signing books so it's it's wild you know there was certainly moments when\nYou know I was in more physical jeopardy than I'd ever realized but thankfully I had\nWhile I didn't have my birth parents take care of me I had other family members who took care of me as if they were my parents\n[noise] All right let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jared J. ... he's the author of the new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction will be back after this break this is fresh air\nAmerica [noise]\nUm\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jared J. 'cause ask the guest picture books and a graphic novels for young adults his new book is a graphic memoir is called ... how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction\nHis mother was a heroin addict his grandparents took a legal custody of him when he was a turning three\nAnd this is a story of his childhood\nFill your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but that they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\n[laughter] yes I my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and I very much keeps me afloat [noise]\nThey were tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell him to go in their hat [laughter]\nThe time I was in third grade and it sounds\nPresents and stuff and and also based on my teeth I mean I'm really looking back in my family photos and then looking at my children and where they are with losing getting teeth to try to try to pin down certain dates on how old I was at certain moments so you know I came to live with my grandparents\nAre just before my third birthday which was at Christmas Time they gained legal custody of me within the next year and so there are probably a couple of years where I just had zero contact with her as a very young child\nWhat was your understanding when you visited her at the halfway house was it was a halfway house or are we have recently\nI I Believe it was a ... place she didn't live there's a spectrum house and listen to her and what's interesting is some of\nI just had a release party in a book signing for kiddo in my home town of western some old counsellors actually attended and identify themselves to me so I was able to thank them for taking care of her back then um [noise] I Wonder what did you learn about her from them it was it was very very brief interaction um\nYou know I'm hoping to circle back and and get in touch with them if they can share what they can share with me but um I just remember how thrilled and excited I was to see her\nAnd then how devastated I was just separate from our knowing that she wasn't coming home with us and knowing that I had no idea when I Would see her next [noise]\nWhere are you afraid that you'd be using ... your mother did and because she had grant grandparents drank a lot like how did that affect you and when you got old enough to consider alcohol or drugs\nYeah I I you\nKnow I always feared that I Would fall into that those those same step so it was always very prudish about you know having having a drink or anything like that and um\nI I knew addiction was in the family I knew was hereditary\nAnd I I knew that it was dangerous territory to to dabble in things so uh you know come college member my freshman year of college and I I was at University of Hartford I wasn't it rode on school of design just yet I remember that you suddenly given this freedom when you're drinking all the time\nAnd I remember sort of hitting a wall of like ... like I'm I'm drinking almost every single day this is unhealthy this isn't good I Need to get out of the situation um because I don't want to fall into that same traps of the uh my my both my parents had stuff in addictions and\nTheir addictions on both sides so\nAh so I was always very wary and very careful of that and um\nYou know so [noise] ... because of\nMy mother I mean um my mother was a very talented artist and when she was incarcerated or we she would send me letters and she would draw cartoons for me and a big part of how we communicated for many years was um was through art so\nShe would draw say she would drive me Snoopy and then she would request I maybe I draw her the pink panther so then I Would draw her the pink panther and then I Would write back and request Garfield\nAnd I remember as a very young person seeing how talented she was\nBut she had such squandered that talent or because of because of the drugs and and that really was my driving force to to want to get published you know I was I was submitting book proposals to publishers when I was a junior in college\nSo I'm the first cartoon that you had published is when you were a freshman or love this\nStarted school [laughter] and the school newspaper was having a theme for prom so it's like a prompt team and you submitted a prom cartoon that was published in the local western newspaper the telegram in cars that\nThere is an editorial cartoon contest that was all across the city for high school students than Mr ...\nWas so brave to submit this you know who taught at holy name central Catholic high school this comic of mine a was chosen to be printed in the in the city paper so so terrible you know you read the first line I'll read the second kid line\nHey man you got any protection what times guns knives or condoms yeah\nThat is so great and if it was amazing that they published that fewer high school freshmen\nSo was that well it's a local paper that was the first place to publish any of your work is that the same paper in which your grandparents read that your mother had oh deed and was found face down on the sidewalk that's the same newspaper yeah I mean it was she survived the ... but um\nIt was I'm sure horrifying for the family to read about this in the newspaper they they probably didn't know before they read about it right\nThey did and that wasn't the first time they they learn news about Leslie in the newspaper I mean that's something that happened quite frequently and that's something that happened to me and my adult life for for the last few years of her life really the only way I can keep track of her was to go to the west or telegrams websites\nAnd type in ... into the search field and find the latest court records\nOr if you're just joining us my guest is Jared J. ... and he's the author of picture books and he's the author of graphic novels for young readers his new graphic memoir is for kids a little bit older like what age would you say\nThis focus young adults so that would be twelve in up um but they were they're difficult truths in this book but there are young people dealing

into a film and the ... went to the ... police squad and that's it and perform yes so [laughter]\nUm you know I I should say um your mother died of an overdose asking you were married and had children how did you find out about that\n[noise] a phone call so um\nI had while I initially learned about the fact that she was tripping up\nFrom her directly I don't think she realized that she kind of let her secret out to me but she had these new housemates that she knew from the clinic and she did tell me the one summer that I'm One of her house mates had oh deed on heroin\nAnd that to me was all I Need to know because she really was a chameleon she had this great boyfriend for so many years they were both clean and sober together but when he died and then she took care of my grandfather some and then he died and then she started hanging out with these other people I just knew it was going to be a downward spiral and\nWhen I saw her at a book event of mine um she she had all of these track marks on the back of her hand on her arm and she she blamed on the dog jumping up on her but I just knew in my heart I knew and oh surely after my second child was born\nA this was December of two thousand and eleven she started getting arrested again and so in January of two thousand twelve\nHolly who is who she is my aunt by lineage but my sister or by heart and soul called me on the phone and she said did you see the paper today\nSo ... I live in North Hampton I live in our in western no wait and see the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies\nAnd I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she has she assured me that she was not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here\nAnd I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know why I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd uh and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the a police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again or the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nI played the role of translator an advocate for my family and for my parents and how that really developed my sense of social responsibility and my sense of wanting to do work that would have a contribution to my community and the people who need that the most [noise] how\nDo you think Harvard's admissions policies helped you or affected you as an applicant to be a student\nWhen I was applying to to college I\nI remember getting a lot of really confusing in conflicting advice I mean for one thing I think my counselor said people with higher scores don't get into Ivy League schools really consider\nSome backups and another counselor who said don't write an Asian immigrant story don't write something that's already been told before and it's been heard before and it isn't going to be compelling I think those two things were really unsettling I think at the time to think that there is this idea that\nMy story you're experiences would not be valued or would not be interesting\nAnd you know with scores that weren't valedictorian scores it was a really tough find to be in despite that\nI I decided to speak most honestly about what made me who I Am and when I interviewed my admissions file and major viewers really kind of saw the value in the ways in which I was making these connections from my experience as to what I wanted to do\nIf a student says to look I Want to be judged on my merits alone I Want to be judged solely on my accomplishments how do you respond to that\nI think there is a really beautiful fine at the valley that I helped organize at said merit means nothing without context conversations on campus have evolved a lot to reflect this idea that we should\nYou know beyond this case rethink how we are structuring our education systems and how we are viewing merit as if it is something that is reflective through test scores through reductive quantitative methods only the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of\nThe ways that they overcome and work despite these various I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can\nSucceed and can lead\nThere seems to be a good chance that this case could reach the Supreme Court where there appears to be a solid majority opposed to affirmative action what are your fears about what happens if this lawsuit proceeds\nI think knowing that you know when it reaches the Supreme Court\nThey won't take additional evidence\nSo students voice that comes through here will be the only place that they hear when it gets to the top there whichever way this case ends up\nBeing decided I think that in the long term thinking about how I think I Want to get a message to future applicants that their stories matter and that they have mattered\nSally temp thanks so much thank you so much

the child of an addict that's coming up on fresh air\nThat I grew up in to pursue my dream Soviet art college uh so it seemed like a natural for me to tell that perspective from that Seventeen year old self\nThe story is told to their perspective of the the Seventeen year old Jared and you know it's funny I didn't really think of it as a quote unquote you know grown up book\nBut really are a lot of grown ups have been reading it and responding to it and identifying with it because you know addiction touches so so many of us are either directly or just we're just one degree away from it it seems\nSo are the details about your mother that you felt were too upsetting to put in a book for young people [noise] I haven't\nWorking on this book in one way or another since the early early to thousands and Everytime I Would sit down to write it\nWould stop and hesitate because I Would I Would worry to myself well why don't people kind of thing and at first it was what are the people in the book going to think you know if I'm writing about them and um\nAnd I was shopping hesitate and then as my career grew in I became known as the the lunch lady guy I have a series of graphic novels about a lunch lady who fights ... crime and it's camping it's funny and\nI thought wow this is this is writing a book on the subject matter going to be in such contrast to that [noise] those happy books that I Would be putting my career on the line um\n... as I traveled the country and I met more and more and more young people who are dealing with this I realize that there's a sort of a responsibility for me to write this book I mean\nYou know to go with a theme of comic books with with a great power becomes great responsibility now I have an audience of these kids who grew up with my books I'm able to deliver the story in a very unique away\nAnd I and I feel like I owe it to these readers to to put myself out there and I realize that if I if I was going to write memoir had just write it without any inhibition and I I wrote down the expression and I'll I'll censor this for the radio but I said right like you don't give an F\nAnd not that I don't care about the craft or care about the readers but I Can't worry about negative opinions you know I have to just write this and put out there so there are some things I learned about my mother later on in life\nUm but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother\nAnd uh but there there is one particular scene a because I did have to explain how really how my mother fully went away you know why would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult\nAnd I was able to find a way to share that in the story but not give that knowledge to the protagonist and when I was when I was a toddler she was on a very abusive relationship and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they'd murdered somebody\nAnd uh my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's a big reason why she went away\nYou're heading that would have been seen as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of\nYou know what let me just mentally shelf that we can focus on being a dad did this human being but I don't know how to take care of and then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book\nI realize narrative Lee I have to explain to the readers fully why she's going the way for so long um\nYou know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall or or for stealing batteries from a convenience store\nUm and I'll tell you like you might be the ... six or seven person I've ever saw the outlaw how to Terry and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heady issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody of you because they were afraid you'd become a word of the state\nThat's exactly it that's exactly it and they were and they also are afraid I Would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be ten soon and ... has been this sort of the forbidden fruit in her house um she really wanted to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child ah\nSo I sat down with her and I explained her a lot of the aspects of this book before she would read it and and also made sure she read it before the book was published so a classmate didn't come in and say oh I Know this about your family and she didn't\nAnd so he is so intuitive and she has such a big heart when she heard the story she immediately said well she probably went along with it because she was maybe afraid that she would get murdered or maybe they would murder you as a baby as well\nWow ... one of the stories you tell in the book is that when you started living with your grandparents you were shot that they made breakfast free because even before you were three when you were living with your mother and you'd wake up to an empty house and have to make your own breakfast\n[noise] that's true and uh I remember them telling me this and you know again sometimes things in that as an adult come at you and you learn about these different aspects of your your youth and this is an in the book because again this is something that um I Would have learned later\nI'm after my grandparents passed I created an art scholarship and their name but the Worcester art museum where I attended classes and to sort of kick start the scholarship and let people know this was happening I had an exhibit at the ... museum and it was also coincided with my ten year anniversary of getting published\nAnd a woman came through the line with her children and they suddenly got their book signed and after they got their book sign they you know a couple of steps away and they were chatting with their friends or they didn't realize they were with an ear shot at my wife Gina\nAnd this woman said you know the last time I saw him he was a baby and I was his mother's parole officer\nAnd I went on the house to do a wellness check and he was a baby crying alone in his crib by himself no one else in the house well there I was you know signing books so it's it's wild you know there was certainly moments when\nYou know I was more physical jeopardy than I ever realized but thankfully I had\nWhile I didn't have my birth parents to take care of me I had other family members who took care of me as if\nThey were my parents [noise] All right let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just

was a heroin addict his grandparents took a legal custody of him when he was a turning three\nAnd this is a story of his childhood\nFill your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but that they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\n[laughter] yes I my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and very much keeps me afloat [noise]\nThey were tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young and then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell him to go in their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in\nThird grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nI got to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crass though you know they'd curse around but\nWas never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we were okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men\nYou know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather\nJust be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say to\nI probably was in kindergarten and and I and I say that just based on the fact that I remember being super obsessed with smart so I have photos of us visiting her at Christmas Time and and I was getting opening ...\nPresents and stuff and and also based on my teeth I mean I'm really looking back in my family photos and then looking at my children and where they are with losing getting teeth to try to try to pin down certain dates on\nHow old I was at certain moments so you know I came to live with my grandparents are just before my third birthday which was at Christmas Time they gain legal custody of me within the next year and so there are probably a couple of years where I just had zero contact with her as a very young child [noise] what\nWas your understanding when you visited her at the halfway house was it was a halfway house or are we have facilities\nI Believe it was a ... place she didn't live there's a spectrum house in Worcester and what's interesting is some of I just had a a release party in a book signing for a kid on my own kind of western some old counselors actually attended and identify themselves to me so I was able to thank them for taking care of her back then\nUm [noise] I Wonder what did you learn about her from them it was it was very very brief interaction um\nYou know I'm hoping to circle back and and get in touch with them if they can share what they can share with me but um I just remember how thrilled and excited I was to see her and then how devastated I was\nTo separate from her knowing that she wasn't coming home with us and knowing that I had no idea when I Would see her next\n[noise] where are you afraid that you'd be using drugs 'cause your mother did and because she had grant grandparents drank a lot like how did that affect you and when you got old enough to consider alcohol or drugs yeah I\nI you know I always feared that I Would fall into that those those same step so it was always very prudish about you know having a having a drink or anything like that and um [noise]\nI I knew addiction within the family I knew it was hereditary\nAnd I and I knew that it was dangerous territory to to dabble in things so uh you know come college member my freshman year of college and I was at University of Hartford I wasn't it round school redesign just yet I remember that you suddenly given this freedom when you're drinking all the time and I remember sort of hitting a\nWall of like ... like I'm I'm drinking almost every single day this is unhealthy this isn't good I Need to get out of the situation um because I don't want to fall into that same traps of the uh my my both my parents had stuff and addictions and their addictions on both sides so ah so I was always very wary and very careful of that and um\nYou know so [noise] ... because of my mother I mean um\nMy mother was a very talented artist and when she was incarcerated or we she would send me letters and she would draw cartoons for me and a big part of how we communicated for many years was um was through art so\nShe would draw say she would drive me Snoopy and then she would request I maybe I draw her the pink panther so then I Would draw the pink panther and then I Would write back and request Garfield\nAnd I remember as a very young person seeing how talented she was\nBut she had sort of squandered that talent or because of because of the drugs and and that really was my driving force to to want to get published you know I was I was submitting both proposals to publishers when I was a junior in college\nSo I'm the first cartoon that you had published is when you were a freshman or love this started school [laughter] and the school newspaper was having a theme\nFor prom so it was like a prompt theme and you submitted a prom cartoon that was published in the local lister newspaper the telegram in cars that\nThis was an editorial cartoon contest that was all across the city for high school students and Mr ...\nWas so brave to submit this you know who taught at holy name central Catholic high school this comic of mine a was chosen to be printed in the in the city paper so such a while you go you read the first line I'll read the second kid one\nHey man you got any protection what kind guns knives or condoms\nYeah that is so great and amazing that they published that you were a high school freshmen\nSo was that was the local paper that was the first place to publish any of your work is that the same paper in which your grandparents read that your mother had oh deed and with down face down on a sidewalk that's the same newspaper yeah I mean it was she survived the Ellen de but um\nIt was I'm sure horrifying for the family to read about this in the newspaper they they probably didn't know before they read about it right\nThey did and that wasn't the first time they they learn news about Leslie in the newspaper I mean that's something that happened quite frequently and that's something that happened to me and my adult life for for the last few years of her life really the only way I can keep track of her was to go to the ... telegrams websites and type in ... into the search field and find the
