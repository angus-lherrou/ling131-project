T. dot org slash support to become a sustaining member\nIn the kids get their hooks into the families and get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me\n... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nAlso film critic Justin ... reviews the new fantasy thriller film superior\n\nNow one of the parts of the story is the relationship between shoe end apparel companies and big time college\nBasketball programs what's the relationship\nAdidas Nike and Under Armour a shoe and apparel companies\nThey fund the grass roots basketball circuit that's the circuit in which these players come from the Web of youth teams are they fund all of that and then they pour a lot of money\nInto the college programs themselves you know a hundred and sixty million two hundred million dollars over a ten year period and that is in return\nFor the players on the teams wearing their gear so if it's a Nike school and this is what they're called you're either a Nike school and Under Armour school or in a de to school so let's say you're a Nike school and you're basketball teams in the NC double a tournament\nWell you've got the Nike swoosh on your sneakers that's on your trunks\nIt's on your Jersey or if you're aware a wrist bands it's it's on your wrist bands if you wear a head band it's on your head band so what they get in return for this money is the right to turn players who are ostensibly amateurs into human billboards\nRight and the contracts are very detailed right the players have to wear only their gear and they give the university bonuses if they do well the shoe companies didn't\nWell if the teams do well if you're a Nike school and and you\nReached the final four or if you win the national championship\nYour coach is sure to get a hundred thousand or a two hundred thousand dollar bonus on top of his multimillion dollar salary the assistant coaches are probably going to get a bonus the school may get more money the only ones who don't benefit monetarily or the players\nBut ... does that bonus come from the shoe company or no I mean they they\nIt comes from the shoe company yes directly from the shoe company and these are\nReally not big sums of money for the shoe companies you know Nike\nIs a multibillion dollar global company so it was a deed is Under Armour a little less so but these are huge businesses and the money that that seems to to us perhaps so big\nIt's not that big for them and it also means they don't really have to advertise like they used to I mean if you've got temp players on the court and there are running around in your insignia is why bother to advertise you know these are human action figures wearing your stuff\nFor tens of millions of Americans to watch and it makes advertising are\nReally redundant at that point and it's much cheaper way to do it\nBig time college basketball programs obviously want the best players so they're scouting and competition in recruiting them and I think most of us would figure this would focus on\nHigh school players you know juniors and seniors who who prove that they have the chops and visit their families they do what whatever to try and get them interested in their program I learn from your book this starch much much earlier how young are players when they started getting attention\nFifth or sixth grade players are as young as ten or eleven years old when the basketball ... the scouts start looking at them and saying are you a future college prospect are you a future NBA prospect and there are several reasons for this one of them is\nThe size of players who make it to a big time college basketball and the NBA\nYou know there's somewhere between six foot three and seven feet and up so that really narrows the population so if you're looking at a young kid you're going to mostly look at a kid who's already begun already athletic\nAnd for that reason and some other reasons it has a relatively easier and basketball to look at a sixth or seventh grader and correctly say this kid's going to be at least the college player so it becomes worse it for the scouts to then proud of the sidelines of\nFifth and sixth grade basketball tournaments\nAre their national publications or online sites that actually rate these players that have a lot of readers\nYes there are publications and scouting services that look at kids as young as fifth grade or one of them is called who scoop it's run by a man named Clark Francis who I encountered several years ago and you know there are elements of Clark\nWhen you meet him that that you may not take him seriously he's a guy you know\nSpends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from five or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who review rated the highest\nLotta them are in big time college basketball now or in the pros so we certainly not write all the time but he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what clerk Francis does whether you take him seriously or not is he lays down a foundation\nFor people who then scout high school and middle school players and he sort of sets the sort of\nNumber of players who may be looked at and\nThe recruiting services are and other business another way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots\nBasketball network explain who runs that how it works\nMain recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds it's no longer high school basketball you know a high school game features maybe one star the kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid so what\nSponsored the college team they were going to in this case Adidas although there was evidence in the trial that strongly indicated that Nike and Under Armour are engaged in the same kind of activity\nSo in the ... three cases that will\nBe tried there are four assistant coaches at major programs charged and there are several\nOther figures on the grass roots circuit sort of sometimes called St runners or go betweens or consultants for the shoe companies they have also been charged and the question in each of these cases is\nWhere their federal crimes committed or where they're just violations of the NC double lays amateur ism rules which are not federal crimes\nRight so it seems clear from the evidence that there were relationships which seemed to violate recruiting rules and that money changed hands right\nAbsolutely there's no doubt that money changed hands\nBy the way relatively small amounts of money in the grand scheme of what these apparel companies generate and and making profit\nThis young man named Brian Boeing junior who went by the nickname tubs a was a much sought after recruit ultimately signed um with the University of Louisville which was poached by Rick Pitino said before the indictments and\nThe events leading to his signing are among those in ... in the criminal case what kind of money went to his family\nAre in front of them\nOne hundred thousand dollars was promised\nTo Bryan bowing juniors father that would be Brian bone and senior of that one hundred thousand dollars only Nineteen thousand five hundred was ever delivered\nThe money was to have come from a deed is that Nineteen thousand five hundred dollars is one quarter of one percent of the nearly eight million dollar annual salary than coach Rick Pitino was making so that to me\nIs a pretty stark reminder of the inequity of\nThis whole youth basketball scene\nAnd then there was evidence that that wasn't the first time that buying bones dad had taken money based on his son's athletic ability\nIt was clearly not the first time the Brian bones senior had taken money he testified in court or under immunity from prosecution that he had taken money repeatedly um four in return for his son planning for particular used teams\nOr particular private high school in Indiana and there was a moment in court where\nThe defense attorney of Christian Dawkins one of the the runner these street agent said Brian bow and senior on cross examination so you've been pimping out your namesake since he was fourteen years old\nAnd Brian bone senior only quibble about the age she paused for a second and then he said well maybe Fifteen or sixteen years old right\nAnd is there any evidence that Brian bone and the kid himself knew about this or saw any of the money\nBrian bone junior had told the FBI and he told\nMe when I interviewed him and he has told everyone he did not know the money was exchange that money was received by his father there's been no evidence that he did know he went from\nThe University of Louisville to the University of South Carolina he transferred last year the fact that the University of South Carolina\nTook him in is an indication that they certainly believed that that he had no knowledge of this but the NC double a still said\nYou can't play basketball last year and then ruled that he could not play college basketball this year and Brian bone junior has gone off to play professionally in Australia a end is over there now in Sydney has become one of\nA thousand overseas player is trying to attract the attention of NBA scouts he missed out on what is by far the easier route which is to play in college to be on TV to be known and just take that glide path right into the NBA\nSo Rick Pitino is the the coach was on the cover of the book um\nThe book is kind of about this system of corruption and recruitment Pitino is a fascinating character um you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\n\nRick Pitino one to national championships won the Kentucky won at Louisville\nHe also coach the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises and professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville\nHe did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intensely he was a motivational and a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the ball as it came by\nBut he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is a a predictable and and be\nTragic [noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\nAnd she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just met in a bank at ... for the rest I was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate\nAnd what's replicate was was four years\nThe basketball dorm not very far from ... office\nSponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the ... in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was ruled to be\nPermissible benefits to amateur players and Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over strip brigade so that was sort of and that was sort of strike one strike too and this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involved Louisville ... was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n... and in the strip or gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees of sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case a stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\n... and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Pitino has a pending case against the University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary\nAnd he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nWell it's interesting because this book collects portraits photographs that you've done from from many years a long career in many cases countries you've gone back to again and again and again and watched um as as they change and I assume as you as a photographer\nChange when you look back at at photos from say your first trip to a country like Afghanistan differences\nWell first of all I wasn't as adept with the camera so I didn't understand how to read light and to anticipate shots the way I Do now\nYou know the photographing under the Taliban was illegal the only thing that was legal was photographing destruction so buildings any inanimate objects and so for me of course my purpose was to photograph life under the Taliban so exactly what was forbidden\nAnd so I went into women's hospitals a photograph women in labor photographed women at home you know all these things that I Wish that I just um [noise]\nDo had to work a situation more\nAnd that's just the wisdom of experience figuring out what worked and what didn't know how hard you can push against the boundary of what you're being told\nTo do exactly exactly and those are things that it's not only about photography about reading human beings and reading people and and understanding how to express the importance of you know this job\nWe'll talk more about how you think about that because you also capture women and incredibly candid more vulnerable moments women in childbirth women being treated for for severe self inflict burn um what's your etiquette for for photographs like that do you always get their permission before you raise your camera\nAlways before I take any pictures I introduced myself I explain that I'm working for whatever publication it's four and not the images will be seen by a lot of people\nAnd they can be on social media that something that I now have to talk about because it's not only for the publication out and they just spread\nVery quickly over social media so that's something that's very important for the subject to know because\nYou know there's Facebook and most of the countries I work in and I talk about why I'm doing these stories you know I don't just walk in there like I have the right to take their picture I talk about\nYou know I think it's really important to see how women are suffering or how women are dying and childbirth and so that's the first thing I Do and a lot of women say no and that's totally their right to say now is\nThat where you operate standard among war photographers understanding there is no playbook that everybody gets their should but I'm curious you mail photographers take that much sensitivity and advance\nI've been told that it's rare that people work the way I work that they take the time to be very respectful and to ask people how they feel comfortable being photographed you know I also have to discuss the nudity for example I was shooting maternal mortality recently in Somaliland\nAnd that's a very deeply conservative country in place and they're the women you know they said okay if you photograph for example the baby coming out and I don't want my face or you have to cover or you know and they gave me the rules and that's what I Do\nYou're making me think of a photograph that you took a ... a woman named I pack\nAbs was yeah she was raped during\nWar and South Sudan Iraq by the time you met her she was very pregnant yeah as a result of that rape you spent several hours photographing her address and then you thought you know if I'm trying to show her belly her pregnancy if that point here\nDo we do this without close um and you as you were photographing her showing images on your camera correct to make sure she understood what it looked like\nAnd I also before I even approached her with sort of what I envisioned I went to Kimberley\nIt was the woman who had sort of rescue her and given her the safe house and said you know does this seem insensitive how do you feel about this is this\nSomething that would be rude to ask and she said no absolutely not let's take this to her and see how she feels and so we went and sort of talk to her through it and before I even finish my sense she had taken her dress often was like totally she completely understood\nAnd you know as a woman I haven't been raped but I I have been assaulted in Libya I was groped repeatedly and I made a decision to talk about that very openly because I think\nYou know as a survivor it's important to try and strip away the stigma and I think different women feel comfortable with feeling different things about themselves and some people do and some people don't and that's one thing I've learned over the years and I think with Iraq\nIt was something she wanted to do she wanted to show what had happened to her to sort of talk about it it was part of her therapy and I think it's very important for me as a photographer to not make those rules for people and everyone has the right to decide how they want to portray himself you've\nTalked in past about what a huge advantage it is if anything to be female and a lot of the places where you're trying to work because as we're hearing you have access to half of the population that are male photographer might not have access to\nWhat I loved and that kind of surprised me in this book as you also get great shots of American women there's a photo going here of a navy lieutenant in the nurse corps she's stationed in Helmand Province of ... Amy okay the shot describe or you've caught her in the ladies' room\nAmy I mean this is after a very intense or I was on a medivac in bed and um they would bring wounded soldiers out and Amy was a navy nurse until she was you know they're in the trauma hospital\nAnd so after a an intense night I sort of followed her back to the showers where the women go and I you know I was like I Want to just shoot what your life is like here and she was completely like fun and open and got it\nShe's she's I should explain she's got shaving cream ... up are lagging shaving it made me I look at it and I'm thinking why would you bother to shave and hell no [laughter] well\nI can tell you why because as a woman who has worked in like a very male world and in a war zone for Twenty years I Do everything I can still try and feel like a woman you know whether that means like sneaking eye liner on in the middle of Helmand or lipstick or\nPerfume I always carry perfume in my camera bag H its psychological because I have to sort of maintain some semblance of myself\nYou're right they're shaving and the and the next shower stall [laughter]\nYeah and that was the fun of photographing women in the military because it's like it was the first time that I actually had women to hang out with because for so many years and it's just me or me and my colleague Elizabeth Rubin or me and whoever the only two women for miles [noise]\nThat's Lindsay Oreo talking about her new book of love and war thank you very much thank you so much thinking\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Trader Joe's offering new products in every store and new episodes of the original podcast series inside Trader Joe's at apple podcast or where podcasts are available more at Trader Joe's dot\nCom [noise] from constant contact\nWho's automation feature allows small businesses to deliver emails or a series of email campaigns to their customers\nLearned more it's constant contact dot com [noise]\nAnd from El severe for one hundred forty years partnering with the health and research communities to curate and verify knowledge committed to helping them manage complexity\nAnd get knowledge out of the lab and into society el severe dot com\n\nDo horizons offering id programs designed to start your career in three months federal funding may be available more information out New Horizons days ... dot com or five six for nine five zero zero\nComcast Business providing the gigs speed network that gets business gun Comcast Business beyond fast more Comcast Business dot com\nThe pond or major concert hall and the Florida Theater present max Weinberg jukebox live friday at the bottom major concert hall max Weinberg legendary drummer of Bruce Springsteen's e street band will play requests live on stage tickets ticket master dot com\n\nRain and thunderstorms in the forecast overnight lows in the low seventies scattered showers and thunderstorms friday high in the low demand eighty ... eighty nine ...

recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds\nIs no longer high school basketball you know a high school game\nFeatures maybe one star the kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid\nSo what the shoe companies created was the grassroots basketball circuit and that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations that's where the college coaches go to scout\nAnd the person who created this was sunny ... sometimes called the godfather of grassroots basketball\nAnd sunny was a brilliant salesman in a in a brilliant sort of hustler in his own way so he realized the two things one was that to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realized that\nBig time college coaches really don't want to go to a small town after small town that scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando and stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that the coaches loved\nRight so you have these tournaments that occur I'm In Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the ... and we're talking about middle school kids in a lot of cases right\nAnd there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of specialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of

their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular\nCollege can I associate him with a particular NBA agent and this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre their kids to win\nOr you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of

was to have come from a deed is that Nineteen thousand five hundred dollars is one quarter of one percent of the nearly eight million dollar annual salary than coach Rick Pitino was making so that to me\nIs a pretty stark reminder of the inequity\nOf this whole youth basketball scene\nAnd then there was evidence that that wasn't the first time that Brian bones dad had taken money based on his son's athletic ability\nIt was clearly not the first time the Brian bones senior had taken money\nHe testified in court or under immunity from prosecution that he had taken money repeatedly\nUm four in return for his son playing for particular used teams or particular private high school in Indiana and there was a moment in court where\nThe defense attorney of Christian Dawkins wanted the the runner the street agent said Brian bow and senior on cross examination so you've been pimping out your namesake since he was fourteen years old\nAnd Bryan Boone senior only quibble about the age she paused for a second and then he said well maybe Fifteen or sixteen years old\nRight and is there any evidence that Brian bone and the kid himself knew about this or saw any of the money\nBrand bone junior had\nTold the FBI and he told me when I interviewed him and he has told everyone he did not know the money was exchanged that money was received by his father there's been no evidence that he didn't know he went from\nThe University of Louisville to the University of South Carolina he transferred last year the fact that the University of South Carolina\nTook him in is an indication that they certainly believed that that he had no knowledge of this but the NC double a still said\nYou can't play basketball last year and then ruled did he could not play college basketball this year and burned bone junior has gone off to play professionally in Australia a end is over there now in Sydney and it's become more of\nA thousand overseas player is trying to attract the attention of NBA scouts he missed out on what is by far the easier route which is to play in college to be on TV to be known and just take that glide path right into the NBA\nSo Rick Pitino is that the coach was on the cover of the book um the book is kind of about this system of corruption in recruitment but Pitino is a fascinating character\nUm you say he it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships won the Kentucky won at Louisville\nHe also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises in professional basketball\nIn college basketball particularly at Louisville he did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational on a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know his head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came\nBy but he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is\nA a predictable and and be tragic\nNow he lost his job he was not charged in the ...\nThe case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\nAnd she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the rest I was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate\nAnd what strip the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from his office sponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the ... in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was ruled to be\nPermissible benefits to amateur players and Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of in that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involved Louisville ... was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n... and in the ... case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees of sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this in the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Pitino has a pending case against the University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary\nAnd he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract",
