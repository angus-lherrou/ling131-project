H. N. dot org I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one day\nRead I Wonder if you can answer a question from Bobby on Facebook who writes on the ballot measure in Massachusetts on the nurse to patient ratio\nThere's a direct correlation of pacing to nurse ratio and patient safety and outcomes this would reduce the patient stay with in the hospital because the nurses will be able to focus on recovery and education for them\nThere is a ballot measure in Massachusetts that's kind of divided the health community in terms of whether hospitals should limit the number of patients that nurses can help\nCalifornia's the only other states passed a law like this can you just summarize kind of what the core argument is here\nRight when this actually may be a a a discussion better left to for next week on labor issues because this is all about a labor issue right the nurses unions in both California and uh and Massachusetts are very powerful politically\nAnd by limiting the number of patients that any one nurse can handle a they are also expanding the number of nurses who need to be in hospitals and therefore\nA growing the pool I'm ... and therefore growing their union membership at at the on the back end as well um this is the Massachusetts initiative and a separate initiative in California that has to do with the amount of money that a kidney dialysis firms can\nAh can charge their patients are both part of a new\nA sort of avenue that a lot of public at a special interest groups including labor unions are taking which is to qualify something for the ballot in hopes of coming up with some sort of legislative compromise\nThere essentially using the ballot measure as leverage to get what they want through the state legislature instead of on the ballot so the legislature will say All right we don't want to take all of these steps that you're proposing but we'll meet you're halfway and give you pretty much everything you want it in in the beginning\nBecause if you don't then we arranged the votes to do it without\nExactly and and the measure in California was sponsored by that measure on on the kidney dialysis front was sponsored by the state nurses' union which wants a leverage in this different fight about a\nRatios of nurses to a patient so fascinating power politics if you will in states where especially nurses unions play a huge role in state\nPolicy Scott I Wonder if we should also be clear often with ballot initiatives\nYou know uh sometimes there to write items since the law sometimes to amend they states constitutions and if a ballot initiative gets to the constitution lawmakers can't just pass a law through the legislative process to undo it you kind of have to meet a constitutional amendment with an amendment so I guess we should be clear that depending on the item mistakes can vary\nYeah that's right but uh it it is interesting we're seeing a lot in recent years legislatures are fighting back against\nA voter approved ballot initiatives so we mentioned a governor loop agent in Maine earlier and er here in DC in fact um there was a paid leave measure that uh that the voters approve that the council decided was unworkable so um [noise]\nUh it's not always the case that uh what the voters approve a ends up being the final word\nWe should know by the way the Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced last week that he would vote no on this pace patient Turner's ratio item in Massachusetts noticed question one here's part of what governor Baker said\nI'm going to vote no because of the word or raise three issues that I was frankly are not aware of the first was the Massachusetts of higher earners to patients and racial already in the state of California does\nThe second was implementing the nine hundred million dollars\nA month or and was something I had heard from many of my colleagues in the community ...\nThat many community hospitals and nursing homes and even some rehab\nOr what have they are operational future jeopardy lowered a\nMassachusetts Governor Charlie Baker let me get to a few more frequent comments before we go ... razor tweeted as someone who has moved state to state multiple times in the last ten years I'm a huge advocate for Medicare for all moving is a pain and insurance makes it even worse\nJane tweeted ask your guests about the results of Medicaid expansion from the early states do states have had great results Julie I Wonder if you could respond to Jane\nWright quick uh yes most I mean it particularly hospitals are in states that have that we're serving a lot of uninsured\nPatients and losing a lot of money now those patients have Medicaid they're getting paid for 'em to it is\nMost of the states that have expanded Medicaid Medicaid have seen a boost to their economy from doing it before we go Scott I Wonder what you think is around the corner like we're talking about these trends and terrorists or anything you think it's already actually any of his review anything's flown under the radar that seems like\nIt's heating up to be the next big fight in healthcare in states or are these kind of the core issues\n[noise] well I think we've had a lot of the core issues um\nBut uh as we've as we've talked about I mean a politically speaking in the end with the midterms coming up everyone's focused on\nOn the politics of this health care has a proven to be\nA very potent issue again I mean certainly when the Affordable CARE Act was passed a bill became law in two thousand nine I think many of us are certainly did figured oh well we're done with healthcare here's a page ah we're never seem to be done with the health care to reap\nThe biggest thing I'm going to be watching in any legislature next year is the fight over single payer Medicare for all in California the state Senate passed it last year without a pay for it would have been hundreds of billions of dollars now it's going to go to the assembly it's just fascinating talk and pull between sort of establishment Democrats and the liberal left\nA it was going to be the biggest fight in any state legislature next year ...\nJulie Rovner of Kaiser Health

walk [laughter] check and make it so ignorant and and so just kind of like\nYou know when your earlier like oh I got to be provocative I have to be edgy I have to like if I'm going to talk about race have to do and like this crazy way that I think has never been done\nAnd make people uncomfortable or make people like really just kind of laugh out of shock rather than laughing out of I truly like enjoying that joke thoroughly\nAnd that is a joke around my maybe you just don't need to joke about slavery like that\nI'm sure there's a great slavery joke but I haven't cracked that not yet and it's fine for me to not tell garbage ones in the meantime so you're talking about your discomfort\nAnd comedy clubs performing when you started out and it took you to like last year [laughter]\nYeah like you can really do it but you and Jessica William started\nThe comedy pod cast to do queens and you know you you also talked about wanting to do comedy in an environment where we're clear people and trans people could come and not feel like they risk being the butt of a joke\nBut that's how it is on to do queens I mean when you and Jessica Williams who's your partner on that show\nUp put it together like what was your goal in terms of the kinds of comics he wanted a showcase because it starts with you and and her you know talking in a funny way of I think that recently happened to you and then you bring up several um you know stand up comics to perform it and it's done from a theater [noise]\nUm so so what was your what was your goal in terms of showcasing comics and creating a type of environment for the audience and for the performers\nThe fact that it's on HBO Now is it we started working together four years ago is truly bonkers crazy\nBanana sandwich and the best way possible and um when Justin I'm Matt\nWell you know\nI I just want to preface\nI most of my life is me not getting us out like you know what I mean just to be clear I'm not really on our guys are throwing themselves at me um so I just think in general like knocking asked that a lot and um\nI used to just be like I Will just wait for a guide asking yeah like I really was sort of in my ... my mom didn't teach me that sort of like cuckoo behavior but I was like I'm just going away for a guide to so that's like ... truly\nHow I was dating and I would just wait for someone asked me now and if no one asked me I just wouldn't day which is so ignorant and also like huh what's he talking about you got a job you can ask people out so you know that's just really where I was and so\nYou know I think interracial dating is just really tricky for a lot of people because I think a lot of times people want to find a reason for why you're not dating within your tribe and\nI'm always just kind of like you just meet who you meet and if the timing is right like I met British bake off\nA YouTube ... third L O L truly like hilarious 'cause his band was opening for you to at the time and\nYou know we sort of hit it off like not eat like not even right away I was like I don't care about ... focused on you do but I can visualize British bake off with that kind of dope and then we just ended up dating from nearby again that\nWas not it just wasn't pre planned I like didn't even like really\nGive him a second glance way I I met him so I mentioned that you and Jessica Williams hosts to Des Moines you have your own podcast I'm caught so many white guys and which you interview people as opposed to doing stand up and\nI interviewed you and I was really fun I really enjoy that a lot I was really glad I did\nThat um so I had it in so many white guys get its name\nWell because you know most podcast are hosted by white guys and then they interview other white guys and you're like\nCool [laughter] so you're gonna have you're gonna have steak and eggs every day okay enjoy your life um\nAnd so I just kind of wanting to be like I'm going to poke fun of like there's so many white guys but actually the thing is there's only one token white guy for seizing the rest of the episodes are just women where people people color and those like the majority of the guests\nSo now that you're I'm starting to be cast in roles\nUm do you look at\nThe casting calls or the equivalent and because um you write something very funny about that and and your first book but are there are kind of casting calls were you know I Know that they are not there definitely like not entertaining the idea of having a black person in that role like is there any kind of coded language\nThat you can see when a black person would even conceivably be cast in the real\nThe lead [laughter] you're like oh so the leaves gonna be ... cool okay so I'm the best friend okay cool cool cool I got that\nYou want me to sound like this okay I'm not going to do that but I think there were two big things that I you know when I started acting like pretty recently I\nHad to have a conversation with myself before I even like going to my agents or whatever and I was always like I Do want to think was part of a wife answering a damn phone\nCall from her husband and giving him some motivation I don't want to do that I don't want to be on the other line being like you got this baby I have no ... no life I'm just at home holding unfolded laundry\nI Will never you will never see I I hate to use the word never but you will never see me on screen\nHolding a basket of unfolded laundry I Will not do\nIt if you were living alone and doing your own laundry that would be perfectly fine\nThat's okay but if I'm like on the phone with Chaney taint um and he's out you know freaking saving the president and I'm at home at stepping on\nA lego but Foley in his you know gym shorts that's not the part for me um you know I think the language and ... ... a casting call is like\nAll American is white beautiful but doesn't know it is white ah and then usually obey like open to all ethnicities is when you know that that is\nOh that's a robot so that they can envision someone not white doing it but it's like all the rules should be open to ethnicity\nDo you know what I mean like there there is no reason why it took you know twenty some odd years for that it'd be crazy Rich Asians there's no there's no excuse for that\nThey could have been ... leads a romantic comedies this whole time and so whenever I see that stuff I always think about like ... and she's five as long as it's like not inappropriate in terms of language or sex is this the part that when she gets older\nWould I be embarrassed to show her that I did you know what I mean and so that's kind of always like sort of my needle and how I operate and it's it's hard being in an industry where\nYou know if you're not the mainstream sort of thing you're just not going to be considered but I think on the flip side what's great right now is that\nThis is an industry where creators shine where they can swim where you can have like an Easter ray you could have you know a Phoebe adjusted could do to to queens you can have an ad in a lot of you can have all these sorts of people sort of just creating their own opportunities in their own lanes\nPhoebe Robin said it's just been great to have you on our show thank you so much\nTeri and honestly this has been a delight in my life and we got to hang out I Know we're supposed to see Bruno Mars together and we couldn't do it now because we're both working so [laughter] yes let me know that he's on his feet deaf leopard who do you want to pass on that one [laughter]\nLet's go get a day

I just will always known as they go all washes late night shows and it usually be you know straight white guys getting these opportunities and every once in a while I see a woman or every once in awhile to see like a black\nGuy and I would just see it and I'll be like oh okay yeah all these people are fun I'm not taking anything away from the people that did get those spots\nBut I'm like I'm surrounded by so many funny women so many funny people of color so many funny we're people who might not get the same opportunities to submit their tape to a book or to get green led to talk about different things from their perspective\nAnd so when Jackson I met we were just kind of like we know so many hilarious people who don't have\nMaybe the platform they they can to express themselves in a way we're like well it would be really do hope no pun intended but it'd be really up to not only have a show that sort of the show cases you know my improv injustice improv abilities both\nSingular an together but also use the shows a platform to just bring our friends along it'd be like we're supporting everybody this is a show for everybody if you are funny there's no reason why you're not going to be on the show and I think a lot of times you\nWould just here you know and the industry oh they're just like our desert Ernie ... funny black women are we just don't know where to look and I'm like that ... there are so many talented amazing people and if you're not ... it's either out of laziness or the fact that you really don't care\n[noise] so you're pretty successful now in comedy\nAnd with your podcast and HBO specials of to do queens but for years you made next to nothing as a common yes um yeah and and you were getting like dining calls from the student loans that you owed you were nearly evicted from your apartment but you were given a reprieve of like several weeks or a couple of months to raise the\nFive thousand dollars that you needed to stay in your apartment how did you handle the anxiety\nOf not being able to pay your student loans and then not being able to afford to have an apartment and nearly ... ...\nYeah you know there were a lot of tears just like not being able to sleep at night there's a lot of feeling like a failure of feeling like\nMaybe me trying to pursue comedy's a little nutty because I really didn't start making a really solid living doing comedy until eight and a half years in and um\nYou know I was kind of like well maybe it shouldn't take this long there are other people around me where it's like it is not taking them eight years to like sort of like you\nKnow get their career going the way that they want to and you know looking back on and now I'm just kind of like you can't control when that happens I think\nYes it was kind of irritating that it took me this long but I think I was\nSo fully ready for the opportunities that arose by that point so like you know to to queens being a HBO didn't scare me having to write a book didn't scare me it's like a cabin blogging in writing for three\nFour years making what fifty bucks a blog post okay yeah I can just writing this book is going to be hard but I'm not going to run away from it\nLet me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is comic an actor Phoebe Robinson who hosts the podcast and HBO specials to queens with Jessica Williams and she has a new book which is called everything's trash but it's okay we're going to take a short break and then be right back this is fresh air\nAnd the bread is clear I'm not denying climate change but try explaining that President Trump you have to show me the science is because they have a very big political agenda\nExplaining the facts behind climate change is not enough to convince Tonight Show what would it take a reality\nCheck on debating climate change next on on a\nWeekday for ten after first post summit on eighty nine nine to ... your community your world\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is comedian and actor Phoebe Robbins and who hosts the podcast to do queens with Jessica Williams they closed it together and they also have a series of four HBO specials by the same name and they have four more set for twenty Nineteen right pd yes\nI'm so excited and now he has a new\nBook called everything's trash but it's okay you and your brother went to a private Catholic high school and you say that you were one or two or three black students and the whole school and you were the only black person and you're graduating class what if your parents and you there\nOh it was the only black girl in my graduate oh okay okay yeah so there was four four ... four of us black students graduating class I was only black girl I'm\nYou know my parents are huge into education and they are just like that is the key to everything they were like if you want to have like a really full\nBe like fulfilled life education is a way to go so they send us the Gilmore academy and it was my brother totally like excelled and you know was like an a student and like Mr popular and like ... truly just like rocked it out and I was a hot mess\nLike like with such a slacker but yes I Am going to go more than I was kind of like hosting and like not\nReally like living up to my potential which infuriated them so much but yeah I they I think they just wanted to have like all the advantages they could possibly give us in life and I think\nEven though it was kinda like a a crummy student there I think I did learn a lot like it did work study there so I think from like a young age like fourteen Fifteen\nAlways like was learning you have to earn your keep you have to like work hard to be able to be in a place that you're you're in\n[noise] so when you weigh the discomfort of being like the only black girl and you're graduating class with the fact that you probably did get a really good education ... um how does the balance come out\n[noise] I think in the end I think it was worth it I Will say it would have been nice if there was another black girl\nAnd my great I think there was like one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and one Asian girl and I'm sure will be you know not to be like\nIt's nice to have like a matching sad but it would've been nice if we can of each like you know looked across you know during mass and saw someone else who looked like us [noise]\nWhenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people fully understand\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would have been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman L O L\nIs thirty four but I'm like the young black women [laughter]\nBut you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes\nAnd high school with like Laura she doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has to be flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be\nYou know\nI just want to preface I most of my life is me not getting us out like this you know what I mean\nJust to be clear\nI'm not really on our guys are throwing themselves at me um so I just think if you're on like knocking asked that a lot and um\nI used to just be like I Will just wait for a guide asking yeah like I really was sort of in my ... my mom didn't teach me that sort of like cuckoo behavior but I was like I'm just going to wait for a guide to so that's a truly\nHow I was dating and I would just wait for someone asked me out and have no one asked me I just wouldn't day which is so ignorant and also like huh what's he talking about you got a job you could ask people out so you know that's just really where I was and so\nYou know I think interracial dating is just really tricky for a lot of people because I think a lot of times people want to find a reason for why you're not dating within your tribe and\nI'm always just kind of like you just meet who you meet and if the timing is right like\nI met British break off at a YouTube concert L O L truly like hilarious 'cause his band was opening for you to at the time and you know we\nSort of hit it off like not eat like not even right away I was like I don't care about the guns like focus on you do but like eventually I realized British bake off with a kind of dope and then we just ended up dating from nearby again that was not it just wasn't pre planned I liked didn't even like really\nGive him a second glance way I I met him so I mentioned that you and Jessica Williams hosts too dumb queens you have your own podcast I'm caught so many white guys and would you interview people as opposed to doing stand up\nAnd I interviewed you and I was really fun I really enjoy that a lot I was really glad I did that\nUm so how did so many white guys get its name\nWell because you know most podcast are hosted by white guys and then they interview other white guys and you're like cool [laughter] so you're going to have you got to have steak and eggs every day okay enjoy your life um and so I just\nKind of want to be like I'm going to poke fun of like there's so many white guys but actually the thing is there's only one token white guy for ... and the rest of the episodes are just women where people people of color and those were like the\nMajority of the gas [noise] so now that you're I'm starting to be cast in roles\nUm do you look at\nThe casting calls or the equivalent and because um you write something very funny about that and and your first book but are there are kind of casting calls were you know that they are not there definitely like not entertaining idea of having a black person in that role like is there any kind of coded language\nThat you can see when a black person would even conceivably be cast in the real\nThe lead [laughter] you're like oh so that leads going to be ... cold [laughter] okay so I'm the best friend okay cool cool cool I got that\nYou want me to sound like this okay I'm not going to do that but I think there were two big things that I you know when I started acting like pretty recently I had to have a conversation with myself before I even like going to my agents or whatever\nAnd I was always like I Do want to think was part of a wife asked rain a damn\nPhone call from her husband\nAnd giving him some motivation I don't want to do that I don't want to be on the other line being like you got this baby I have no ... no life\nI'm just at home holding unfolded laundry I Will never you will never see I I hate to use the word never but you will never see me on screen holding a basket of unfolded laundry I Will not do\nIt if you were living alone and doing your own laundry that would be perfectly fine\nThat's okay but if I'm like on the phone with Chaney Tatum and he's out you know freaking saving the president and I'm at home at stepping on a lego but folding his you know gym shorts that's not the part for me\nUm you know I think the language in it or a casting call is like\nAll American is white beautiful but doesn't know it is white uh and then usually obey like open to all ethnicities is when you know that that is\nOh that's a robot so that they can envision someone not white doing it but it's like all the rules should be open to ethnicity do you know what I mean like there there is no reason why it took\nYou know twenty some odd years for that it'd be crazy Rich Asians there's no there's no excuse for that\nThey could have been leads and romantic comedies this whole time and so whenever I see that stuff I always think about like ... and she's five as long as it's like not inappropriate in terms of language or sex is this a part that when she gets older\nWould I be embarrassed to show her that I did\nYou know what I mean and so that's kind of always like sort of my needle and how I operate and it's it's hard being in the industry where\nYou know if you're not the mainstream sort of thing you're just not going to be considered but I think on the flip side what's great right now is that\nThis is an industry where creators shine where they can swim where you can have like an Easter ray you could have you know a Phoebe adjusted could do to to queens you can have an ad in a lot of you can have all these sorts of people sort of just creating their own opportunities in our own lanes\nPhoebe Robin said it's just been great to have you on our show thank you so much\nTeri and honestly this has been a delight in my life and we got to hang out I Know we're supposed to see Bruno Mars together and we couldn't do it no because we're both working so
