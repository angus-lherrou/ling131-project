I got an area and that's why\nI'm not sure which way to or do we do that as Arthur tribes supporting remember where we\nAre the tribes supporting them and three uh basically when it comes to amendments three uh the yes the tribes are foreign penetrated a double check a yes the seminal try this for a minute three correct Derek the dog tracks the NFL teams the sports betting firms are against it\nAs right actually in the ... to try to drive but as the tribe is sixteen million dollar more than sixty million dollars and in saying that uh they didn't want this to pass so they're they're very\nYeah very for it OK yeah and then you you had to and you had a question about Thirteen as well\nI yes on her pain it's not something that's going to happen today but what would make a lot of sense to me is why don't we use people instead of do I mean people run track what a battle people going to have like ... [laughter]\nI'm Serious I mean are you mean like at the Olympics and then bet on it\nMore like just your regular whether college for ... yeah yeah\nAnd people that have to pay the runner ... it wouldn't be as profitable as as right now where they get the dog basically for free but um\nTo me that would make a lot more Time Warner cable real or a member for which I'm not talking about it may be more important than a year for for governor for her 'cause you can ... franchise over Mariette yes\nThank you for that Anthony I didn't mean to laugh at your idea um yeah I mean why not um\nYes amendments for which does look\nThe uh beyond pays to pass would restore fell on voting rights Eric uh we haven't gotten into that on this program although we have another shows that now let's point out all of these amendments Eric require sixty percent voter approval so a ... most of them are probably not going to make it hard to say but you know it's a it's a high bar right\nIt is it is a high bar up you know speaking with the the um the folks who actually John Morgan in Ventura who were responsible for the uh medical marijuana amendment that passed and sixteen they tried that in fourteen\nInto them fourteen election which was a mid term one of the reasons why it failed because it was a mentor and voters aren't out that much um it's it's just harder it's harder to get the number of people out there so you can get the ratio that you need you need that sixty percent I'm that's why you're going to see the uh the legalization of marijuana will likely be on the twenty twenty about\nThose are the big amendment so yeah but when in a midterm election it's it's it's it's pretty tough to get it passed which actually brings you to the amendment three debate to which 'cause it's not easy to do uh to do a referendum\nIt ... yeah it's tough now and when it comes to these gambling and dog racing amendments based on what you you reported do you think either one of them is likely to pass or not\nBased on what a team of polling uh\nThere's there's polling that will show of the amendment three will definitely ... the most reliable polling that I've seen of a mammoth Thirteen has been a that it's going to be shaky so\nThat one of the biggest problem we have that we do have so many amendments on the ballot and people are actually will get kind of literally they just stopped they stopped really care for a while yeah amendment gave him yeah\nYeah or even a yeah it's you know as one of the callers yeah go\nRight because it's at the end of the ballot it's the last one on there a doctor so uh you know but judging by the volume of calls we've received from all over Florida we can't even get to the mall Coral Springs Miami Jacksonville St john's or\nA veto lots of people waiting to weigh in on the on amendments search team which would phase out\nGreyhound racing in the state of Florida by twenty twenty we just don't have time unfortunately to get to every one but there were folks waiting on hold other veterinarians people that want it to a express their support for continuing greyhound racing in in Florida so\nUh this is such an intense issue uh we'll we'll we'll wait to see if it translates into a lot of ballots cast on this uh as you said it is the last time and on the ballot Eric so people need to Wade through it But Eric a stark has seen a political Florida we thank you so much for being on the show today Thanks for being with us\nThat he was an honor\nAnd that is our show today the floor to round up is produced by W.

J. C. T.\n\nWHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air\nToday we talk about Lou Reed with Anthony to Curtis author of a biography of read which just came out in paperback the Curtis is a music critic and his reads friends\nThen he reads velvet underground songs and solo song whereabouts sexually trans breath of characters heroin and other drugs and stage persona played with his own sexual fluidity\nTo sexuality was something I think as you get used to have you so you want to see you know I think was open to going wherever that was\nThe Curtis interviewed many people read new including two of his former wives\nNeedy there's a word that came up a lot of talking about lose relationship with lovers and I'm part of that was loose hated being alone that's on fresh air\nA and it was you know I think the kind of issue ... music would always raise which is you know can you just send you introduce underground describe it and not climber Russia\nBut he he kind of lived part time in that in that underground you certainly do used heroin to use it yeah and he was the first person to inject John Cale his bandmates undeveloped that's\n... yeah [laughter] I mean all of that is true they the I mean it would never really was his particular drug of choice I mean he always preferred or amphetamine he likes to be do drugs but\nHe did use heroin and the song does come out of his own experience which is you know I think another element of lose work you know it was grounded in his own life\nShe would make the point and it's a point worth making that uh you know he is not all the characters in these songs but you know close enough\n[noise] you know one of the things that's so fascinating about ... okay so this is one of the really early songs that he writes heroin\nAnd at the time he's working for ... writing songs to order he's writing like knock off to have like surf songs and found out about Detroit in California and a song called the ostrich which was supposed to be like a novelty dance on to start a novelty craze that never got started [laughter] and ... and before that\nUm he was discovered at like a high school dance um that he was playing with like an early high school band and he was brought to ... to record producer who is also good appetite\nGrandfather [laughter] ... yeah yeah and ... like record a few things like writing a record iffy things and one of the songs I really want a plane is [laughter]\nWell that's I just called merry go round and so how old is Lou Reed when he recorded this\nWell he began recording really well he was in high school you know and he you know kind of continued to make records after that but you know you could really see the kind of influences that he was working with at this point\nI mean in a certain sense is working pick quick helped him 'cause it was like working in a songwriting emergency room you know they would you know just kind of okay you know surf music is happening you know right ten surf songs or love do up you know write a bunch of due out songs or write a bunch of songs about cars are songs about teenage love tragedy\nAnd so merry go round is kind of an expression of that period of his writing where it's identifiable as we read but also you can hear him working through a you know the various kinds of genres that he was a kind of task to work\nWith it's just so the guy who writes like heroin and writing for waiting for the man writes this lyric from merry go round I walking home every day from school but still you treat me like a fool [laughter]\nSo absolutely this is a very interesting thing about Lou I mean I think [noise]\nThey were those both those part I mean people would ask me I knew him\nAnd you know people would ask you know so you know if you run into ... read what is ... ... talk about how we talk about like Lesley Gore law rollercoaster of you know he loved pop music and that was true at the same time as he also wasn't always doing that by any means but he was taking pop elements\nEven on that first of all but underground record if you listen to attract like you know there she goes again nobody lifts\nMarvin Gaye hitchhiked for the risk\nThere's an element of loving what pop music is and all of those teenager motions in a certain way you know this is the kind of overstatement it's a little sentimental but in many ways it's kind of true I mean lose deep\nPassionate love of doo wop and that kind of adolescent swept away on the wings of love and it was very essential emotion for him and it remain that way\nSo let's hear merry go round 'cause he really hearing Lou Reid's point but he hasn't quite be calm\nVery popular so that's here in about ... [noise] really [noise]\nMy\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThat was read before the velvet underground when if he's still in high school any records that\n[noise] um I think so yeah All right I'm\nOkay and and I guess as Anthony to Curtis who has a new biography of read\nCalled Lou Reed alive we're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back this is ...\n... an entire family worked at the same auto plant in Michigan until it closed during the recession what somebody who's in your life you know now with unemployment near record lows what does the recovery look like to them\nThat seems like a fantasy world or something in an area and I'm Ari Shapiro in Michigan when news of the economy and the midterms this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nToday at for an eighty nine nine W. J. C team your community your world ...\n\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Anthony ... Curtis a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and now the author of a new biography of lead\nI Want to ask you about a period of Lou Reid's knife and a lot of people have spoken about I think he chose not to speak about it publicly\nAnd I'm Talking about the period where he had electroshock therapy electric ... therapy when he was in college and I always heard that this was because his parents were afraid that he was gay\nWhat did you learn about the electric shock therapy and why he had a\nWell I think that Lou was acting out in a variety of ways while he was in high school you know she was certainly using drugs wild mood swings you know we definitely enjoyed getting under particularly his father's skin\nAnd he also was acting out like you know people would see his kind of gay life almost didn't perform it of terms you know he'd walk around and you know limp arrested and you know shaking his hips and all this stuff in front of his father is a way to\nEssentially aggravate him\nBut they were more serious problems with him you know I think that's a you know certainly the drug use and the rebellious is\nThe family was very conventional and you know as a kind of you know middle or upper middle class a Jewish family in the suburbs you know they went and consulted doctors about the kind of problems that they saw\nAnd the doctors are advised this you know electro convulsed with therapy which read so as a kind of torture he wrote about it he wrote a song called kill your sons about it which is kind of an an Sexton palm center abuse it\nAnd to him it was a ... you know it was a very decisive dividing line in terms of his relationship with his parents but one thing I learned from talking to his sister and other people who knew him well back then it was parents really loved him and his father\nI mean his mother felt guilty about the shock treatments for the rest of her life until she died I think his father thought that he did the best he could do this you know Lewis creating a lot of problems and he needed to address them somehow\nBut you also write that once when we came home from college that he was\nBasically like non functional\nHis parents were concerned that he was in a terribly deep depression the doctor said hey you know he might have schizophrenia am I getting this right yes and that that that that that also figured into\nThe the shock treatments and his sister tells you oh our parents were were very liberal and they weren't homophobic so it wasn't about their fear of him being gay but I was thinking what like everybody was homophobic then\nWell that's right and that's the thing I don't think they were more homo phobic than that you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban ... Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you\nKnow lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out\nAs a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we are going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWere mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really\nI mean it's a very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nSo you think he was on like flu it in his actual alley\nI mean one of his girlfriend's ah describes him as inter and [laughter] it's kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay and the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with ...\nI think one thing that ran through those relationships a loser early relationships with women was his desire to subsumed them you know to make them part of his world\nUm you know needy is a word that came up a lot a and talking about lose relationship with lovers and um [noise]\nUh you know part of that was you know he I mean ... hated being alone\nA at any time and so you know that obviously put demands on the relationship but also he wanted\nYou know these women you know in in certain instances to come and work for him you know was lighting designer our manager or just be with him all the time or you know record companies would call them and just say look lose you know feeling this or doing that is it possible for you to calm and you know calm him down\nI'm so there was that but there was also you know they also talked for about a kind of sweetness\nI mean Shelly all than his college girlfriend um there's just a delightful person I've gotten to know are a bit uh\nTalks about you know it's just the difficulty I mean ... would hide drugs in her dorm room you actually gotten kicked out of schools could have gotten arrested you know it was you know it was not a nice thing to do to somebody that you cared about\nBut you know and she was talking about the difficulties of him and you know he's having affairs with boys and with girls and using drugs and and that you just said you know but still like Lew is the only boyfriend I ever had\nWho on Valentine's Day gave me you know this gigantic red heart shaped box of chocolates you know and\nHe loved the I mean there was a kind of convention analogy to him you know he would of gesture like that would you would seem really meaningful to him he married his second wife on Valentine's Day\nAnd you know those kinds of aspects of who he was um you know ... what ran through this kind of double ... you know this this kind of burying these women in himself at the same time as you know the kind of sweetness that you wouldn't necessarily anticipate\nThat ... that his first wife told you that he physically abused her\nWhich is he did which is actually finally left him right did you hear that found from any of the other women humans with\n[noise] ah no I did not uh and although you know there were other instances of other women who were less casually involved are with him or you know it was you know I'm a part of who he was I mean that kind of anger and desire for control manifested itself and that\nYou know obviously despicable way er and\nYou know the Betty certainly felt it you know there was a um [noise] you know\nI don't this is not to justify this there's a song called Caroline says two on Berlin and or the lyrics go Caroline says she gets up off the floor you could hit me all you want to but I don't love you anymore\nAnd first of all I mean in four lines that's like a little movie and it gets at the kind of desperation in hitter you know I think that\nThere was a an incredible level of fear of abandonment and\nAnd terror and that's what motivated his violence you know it it was you know the no way I mean it was I mean it doesn't matter what the motivations were to a certain extent unless you're trying to understand this person\nUm you know it's it's a heinous act but it it's coming out of a kind of desperation I mean it's less about hostility than ah than it is a ... about a kind of self hatred and and fear\nAnd he's out there like me and drinking and using drugs and who knows how how that's affecting him to certainly out of you know I mean every much had a cat or not that's not helpful if you have a bad temper and if you have a tendency to be out of control [laughter]\nCertainly not yeah certainly not and it was a [noise] you know that was very much part of his life um you know in those days I'm One\nOf his partners for about three years was transferred his um\n... Shaffir yeah yeah yeah she was\nAnd so they were together for three years and um he dedicated his em Coney Island baby to her her name uh west Rachel\nI'm what can you tell us about Rachel and her relationship with me well\nThat's a you know that kind of story\nRight it is extremely complicated subject and I'll Try to distill it you know it um\nYou know he met a Rachel in an after hours bar and just really fell in love with her and this was one of the revelations of the book\nTo me you know I knew about Rachel I mean he wrote about her so uh yeah I was aware that she existed but you know in my mind you know in a casual ... Lew he's wild he'll do anything but in fact you know there was a real depth to that relationship and you know they had\nYou know they live together or they entertain together they went out together it was bowl I mean if uh you know if a if a rock star of loose stature did that now it would be\nYou know regardless of their shocking and you know certainly in the seventies you know it was you know just kind of unheard of\nBut um you know it was genuine affection there and also ritual is kind of also a kind of road manager for the very interesting thing I was a contemporary peace where a a writer named Caroline Kuhn a British writer was writing about being with Lou and Rachel never kind of arguing like Louis saying\nWhat's going on here like you are supposed to take care of me like why am I taking care of you and it was sort of playful and it was a fight and that was also a reality to it you know like\nYou're supposed to be arranging the cars to the venue and you're supposed to be talking about what I Need like\nThey'll you know uh\nWhy am I looking after you know you and your problems\nBut Rachel how the secret life you know Rachel was out on the street and would um you know she pulled a knife on a girl who was looking at Lew backstage at the bottom line you know just wanting to her off\nOr you know people recall seeing a Rachel I'm you know beaten up not as a result of a relationship would lose seemingly but you know just out of the other kind of\nA situation that you would get involved in and it was a you know in that kind of thing I think really has an appeal for Lu the idea that I think anybody who didn't fully um submit to him who didn't fully become part of his world who kept something to themselves\nUh I think that that only kind of enticed his interest and uh you know a Rachel's life as a hustler was who was something I think that had a real appeal from\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Anthony to Curtis the author of Lou Reed uh life will be right back this is fresh air balloons\nCherish the trade war and corporate profits which one of these is not like the other we are not an island and who are so [noise]\nWe need our trading partners for everything\nUp to and including making money on ... on Wall street meets read more testing Simon marketplace\nWeek nights at six on eighty nine nine W.

based on a high in the nation based on history and and they I mean there should be a boy as senator within one of those committee\nOn the campaign trail Nelson and Scott has sparred over health care

Clark has more\nOf a new report from AAA which looks at advanced driver assistance ... that's technology like automatic emergency braking blind spot monitoring and lane departure monitoring\nThe tech used to be an extensive upgrade but now comes standard and many new vehicles through apart shall after collisions cars with the advanced technology can cost two or three times as much trip pair as

they're also changing the way some people drive\nAnd now they study from AAA sound Florida drivers with advanced systems don't know about the technology and limit\nResearch has found eighty percent of drivers of blind spot monitoring thought the system could detect bikes people in cars passing at high speeds but the systems aren't able to\nIn addition the study found about a quarter of Dr refusing

Jackson down your community your world [noise]\nWHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry ...\nToday we talk about ... read with Anthony ... author of a biography of read which just came out in paperback it Curtis is music critic and his reads friends\nMany reads delve it underground songs and solo song whereabouts sexually transgressions characters heroin and other tribes and the stage persona played with his own sexual fluidity\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you get used to have his you so you want to see you know and I think it was kind of hoping to going wherever that was\nThe Curtis interviewed many people read new including two of his former wives\nNeedy there's a word that came up a lot and talking about lose relationship would lovers and I'm part of that was loose hated being alone that's on fresh air\nBut he he kind of lived part time and that and then underground you certainly do use heroin to use it yeah and he was the first person to inject John Cale his bandmates and development\nYeah [laughter] I mean all of that is true they the I mean it would never really was his particular drug of choice I mean he always preferred a amphetamine he likes to be the drugs but\nHe did use heroin and the song does come out of his own experience which is you know I think another element of lose work you know it was grounded in his own life\nHe would make the point I mean and it's a point worth making that uh you know\nIs not all the characters in these songs but you know close enough\nYou know one of the things that's so fascinating about Lou Reed is that okay so this is one of the really early songs that he writes heroin\nAnd at that time he's working for pick with writing songs to order he's writing like knock off of like surf sons about Detroit in California and a song called the ostrich which was supposed to be like a novelty dance on to start a novelty craze that never got started on ... and before that\nUm he was discovered at like a high school dance um that he was playing with like an early high school band and he was brought to ... to record producer who is also good appetizers grandfather [laughter] ... yeah yeah\nAnd and ... has them like record a few things like writing a record iffy things and one of the songs I really want to play this [laughter]\nAnd I thought it was called merry go round and so how old is Lou Reed when he records that\nWell you know he began recording really well he was in high school you know and he you know kind of continued to make records after that but you know you could really see the kinds of influences that he was working with at this point\nI mean in a certain sense is working pick quick helped him 'cause it was like working in a songwriting emergency room you know they would you know just kind of okay you know surf music is happening you know right ten surf songs or love do up you know write a bunch of do up songs or write a bunch of songs about cars are songs about teenage love tragedy\nAnd so merry go round is kind of an expression of that period of his writing where it's identifiable as we read but also you can hear him working through a you know the various kinds of genres that he was a kind of task to work\nWith it's just so the guy who writes like heroin and writing for waiting for the man writes this lyric from merry go round I walking home every day from school but still you treat me like a fool [laughter]\nSo absolutely this is a very interesting thing about Lou I mean I think\nThere were those both those part I mean people would ask me I knew him and you know people would ask you know like so you know if you run into we read what is ... ... talk about how we talk about like Lesley Gore ... roller under you know he loved pop music and that was true\nAt the same time as he also wasn't always doing that by any means but he was taking pop elements even on that first of all but underground record if you listen to attract like you know there she goes and nobody lifts you know Marvin Gaye hitchhiked for the risk\nThere's an element of loving what pop music is and all of those teenager motions in a certain way you know this is the kind of overstatement it's a little sentimental but in many ways it's kind of true I mean lose deep\nPassionate love of doo wop in that kind of adolescent swept away on the wings of love and Bush [laughter] very essential emotion for him and it remain that way\nSo let's hear merry go round 'cause he really hearing Lou Reid's voice but he hasn't quite be calm\nVery popular so that's here in about ... [noise] really [noise]\n\n\nGod [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThat was read before the velvet underground when if he's still in high school any records that\n[noise] um I think so yeah All right I'm\nOkay and and my guess is Anthony to Curtis who has a new biography\nOf read called Lou Reed alive we're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back this is ...\nBe investigation continues into the suspicious packages and critics of President Trump will have the latest also Russian trolls try to influence Americans by reading about football players who kneel during the anthem\nWhat their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord so if you're attempting to divide people this is a pretty great subject\nSaturday on weekend edition from NPR News Saturday morning at age an eighty nine nine W. J. C. T.\n\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Anthony to Curtis a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and now the author of a new biography of lead\nI Want to ask you about a period of Lou Reid's life that a lot of people have spoken about I think he chose not to speak about it publicly\nAnd I'm Talking about the period where he had electroshock therapy electric ... therapy and this is when he was in college and I always heard that this was because his parents were afraid that he was gay\nWhat did you learn about the electric shock therapy and why he had\nWell I think that Lou was acting out in a variety of ways while he was in high school you know she was certainly using drugs wild mood swings you know we definitely enjoy getting under particularly his father's skin\nAnd he also was acting out like you know people would see who's kind of gay life\nAlmost in formative terms you know he'd walk around and you know limp arrested and you know shaking his hips and all this stuff in front of his father is a way to essentially aggravate him\nBut they were more serious problems with him you know I think that's a you know certainly the drug use and the rebellious notice\nThe family was very conventional and you know as a kind of you know middle or upper middle class a Jewish family in the suburbs you know they went in consulted doctors about the kind of problems that they saw\nAnd the doctors are advised this you know electro convulsed with therapy which reads so as a kind of torture he wrote about it he wrote a song called kill your sons about it which is kind of an an Sexton palm center abuse it\nAnd to him it was a you know it was a very decisive dividing line in terms of his relationship with his parents but one thing I learned from talking to his sister and other people who knew him well back then it was parents really loved him and his father\nI mean his mother felt guilty about the shock treatments for the rest of her life until she died I think his father thought that he did the best you could do was you know Lewis creating a lot of problems and he needed to address them somehow\nBut you also write that once when we came home from college that he was\nBasically like non functional\nHis parents were concerned that he was in a terribly deep depression the doctor said you know he might have schizophrenia am I getting this right yes\nAnd that that that that that also figured into the the shock treatments and his sister told you oh our parents were were very liberal\nThey weren't homophobic so it wasn't about their fear of him being gay but I was thinking what like everybody was homophobic then\nWell that's right and that's the thing I don't think they were more homo phobic than that you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban ... Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under\nWhich they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out\nAs a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it were mentioned when\nYou mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nThat's true and that there are people I mean this was a really\nI mean it it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nThey think he was on like flu it in his ... yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter and she kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of blue but he was really gay\nI think one thing that ran through those relationships a loser early relationships with women was his desire to subsumed them to make them part of his world um you know needy is a word that came up a lot a and talking about lose relationship with lovers and I'm\nA you know part of that was you know he I mean ... hated being alone\nAt any time and so you know that obviously put demands on their relationship but also he wanted\nYou know these women you know in in certain instances to come and work for him you know it was lighting designer our manager or just be with him all the time or you know record companies would call them and just say hello clues feeling this or doing that is it possible for you to calm and you know calm him down\nI'm so there was that but there was also you know they also tried for about a kind of sweetness\nI mean Shelly all been his college girlfriend um there's just a delightful person I've gotten to know are a bit uh\nTalks about you know just the difficulty I mean ... would hide drugs in her dorm room you know she could have gotten kicked out of schools could have gotten arrested you know it was you know it was not a nice thing to do to somebody that you cared about\nBut you know and she was talking about the difficulties of him and you know he's having affairs with boys and with girls and using drugs and and that you just said you know but still like Lew is the only boyfriend I ever had\nWho on Valentine's Day gave me you know this gigantic red heart shaped box of chocolates you know and\nHe loved it I mean there was a kind of convention analogy to him you know he would a gesture like that would be would seem really meaningful to him he married his second wife on Valentine's Day\nAnd you know those kinds of aspects of who he was um you know ... what ran through this kind of double ... you know there's this kind of burying these women in himself at the same time as you know the kind of sweetness that you wouldn't necessarily anticipate\nThe ... that his first wife told you that he physically abused her\nWishes he did which is actually finally left him right did you hear that from from any of the other women he might as well\n[noise] uh no I did not ah and although you know there were other instances of other women who were less casually involved are with him\nOr you know it was you know I'm a part of who he was I mean that kind of anger and desire for control manifested itself and that you know obviously despicable way er and\nYou know yeah Betty certainly felt you know there was a um [noise] you know\nI don't this is not to justify this there's a song called Caroline says two on Berlin and or the lyrics go Caroline says she gets up off the floor you could hit me all you want to but I Love you anymore\nAnd first of all I mean in four lines that's like a little movie\nAnd it gets at the kind of desperation in hitter you know I think that there was a an incredible level of fear of abandonment and\nAnd terror and that's what motivated his violence you know it it was you know no no way I mean it was I mean it doesn't matter what the motivation for her to a certain extent unless you're trying to understand this person um you know it's it's a heinous act\nBut it it's coming out of a kind of desperation I mean it's less about hostility than ah than it is a ... about a kind of self hatred and and fear\nAnd he's out there like me and drinking and using drugs and who knows how how that's affecting him to certainly out of you know I mean every much out of that it's not that's not helpful if you have a bad temper and if you have a tendency to be out of control [laughter]\nCertainly not yeah so in ... and it was a [noise] you know that was very much part of his life um you know in those days I'm\nOne of his partners for about three years was ... she has um\n... Shaffir yeah yep yep she was\nAnd so they were together for three years and um he dedicated his em Coney Island baby to her her name uh west Rachel I'm what can you tell us about Rachel and her relationship with me well that's a you know that kind of story right it is extremely\nComplicated subjects and I'll Try to distill it you know it um\nYou know he met a Rachel in an after hours bar and just really fell in love with her and this was one of the revelations with the book\nTo me you know I knew about Rachel I mean he wrote about her so uh yeah I was aware that she existed but you know in my mind you know in a casual ... he's wild he'll do anything but in fact you know there was a real depth to that relationship and you know they had\nYou know they live together or they entertain together they went out together it was bowl I mean if uh you know if a if a rock star of lose stature did that now it would be you know regarded shocking and you know certainly in the seventies\nYou know it was you know just kind of unheard of\nBut um you know it was genuine affection there and also Rachel was kind of also a kind of road manager for a loop very interesting thing I was a contemporary peace where a a writer named Caroline Kuhn a British writer was writing about being with Lou in ... they were kind of arguing like Louis saying\nWhat's going on here like you are supposed to take care of me like why am I taking care of you and it was sort of playful and it was a fight and there was also a reality to it you know like\nYou're supposed to be arranging the cars to the venue and you're supposed to be talking about what I Need like\nYou know you know\nUh why am I looking after you know you and your problems\nBut Rachel how the secret life\nRachel was out on the street and would um you know she pulled a knife on a girl who was looking at Lew backstage at the bottom line you know just wanting to her off\nUm you know people recall seeing a Rachel I'm you know beaten up not as a result of a relationship would lose seemingly but you know just out of the other kind of\nA situation such you would get involved in and it was a you know that kind of thing I think really has an appeal for Lu the idea that I think anybody who\nDidn't fully um submit to him who didn't fully become part of his world who kept something to themselves or I think that that only kind of enticed his interest and uh\nYou know a\nRachel's life as a hustler was who was something I think that had a real appeal from them\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony ...
