{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "You you would have got some help ... and today we with peer support groups like the ones on the line of fire department which are people like John ... Jeff orange and others have stepped up and have tried to make sure that this is something that that our first responders keeping in\nNot in the back burner but in front of their head that if there's something you see something feel something\nYou just need to vent their therefore that\nAnd I just got to just throw it out there are ... peer support team has been phenomenal I've spoken to a couple of members and I can tell you I feel like these guys who save some lives of some of our brothers and sisters out there I'm just bragging about the people that I Know and I think that uh for the most part and public safety\nOr if you don't have a good strong fear support then ask why and push and get yourself educated ... to to save yourself as much as your your brother and sister\nWere talking about first responders the trauma that uh they're exposed to after these kinds of a tragic events uh that uh the panhandle is experiencing now with hurricane Michael Florida has\nCertainly lots of experience with the first responders and hurricanes also first responders and mass shootings most recently of course the Parkland shooting and the pulse nightclub shooting a in a South Florida and\n... respectively maybe you are a first responder the spouse or family member of a first responder I share your experiences about the trauma after tragedy three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred state wide it's three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred or you can follow us on Twitter at\nFlorida round up a memorize the health care reporter W. M. F. E. I. J. R. used the phrase they're talking about first responders acknowledging\nThe mental health difficulties that they can experience after a tragedy saying if they're brave enough to stand up to acknowledge talk a little bit about what you encountered in terms of of that in counter or as you were reporting the trauma after tragedy project\nThere are a lot of first responders who who don't want 'em to stand up and say I'm having an issue with this they don't want their crew members to feel like they're having an issue and maybe a week\nOr or you know that they they need help and maybe they can't be trusted on a calm\nAnd so you know that's part of the reason why we're talking about this fear support program or is because the other thing they worry about is from the administration standpoint that you know if a supervisor finds out that they're struggling with the TST or another you know mental health concern\nThat they may be taken off shift that they may be passed over for promotions um they can you know if they're law enforcement that maybe they're going to lose they're gone\nAnd so that's why the peer support programs are important because it's it's coming from within you know it's firefighter firefighter and it leaves the administration out of it which you know will help them a feel a little bit safer to to ask for help\nAnd you know maybe reach out when they when they are struggling um and the other thing that that I've come up come across over and over again with this is as first responders were saying I didn't know that this was a risk for me because\nYou know I show up when someone has hurt and you understand that maybe if someone has been shot or you know it's had some you know trauma to them that they might be dealing with post traumatic stress disorder afterwards but\nYou know there's less it you know real a realization that it can happen just from witnessing that and the aftermath of it over and over again you know for twenty thirty plus your career\nYou are listening to the floor to round up from Florida public radio\nGame ever I let me ask you about the acknowledgement of that link which has been growing and growing to a point of legislation and a state law in Florida that are kind of open some new routes for first responders to seek assistance for P. TST after tragedy tell us about that\n[noise] so early this year after the Parkland shooting and in my opinion probably in part because of that shooting a the Florida Legislature uh acknowledge that workers um that post traumatic stress disorder is a work related condition and therefore should be covered by workers' compensation\nA which is important because previously it was covered for medical so you know if a first responder had post traumatic stress disorder that could get doctors visits um medications covered but if\nThey stepped up and said they were having an issue a doctor could take them off of work but then they would not be eligible to collect even workers' compensation paycheck so that's\nAnd now I'm ... which has I think help spread some of the awareness about this across the state even the existing laws before it um but also importantly with that law as it requires departments now to do training with is um which which is going to help as well to to sort of spread this you know idea to first responders\nJR how important step is that kind of legislation for your colleagues that are still a a working actively as first responders\nIt's exceptionally important that you know it's one of the uh you know looking at the statute one of the unsung heroes that are always left out\nUnfortunately or do you tell a communicator dispatchers ... and and you know I was a fortunate enough had the privilege to be the manager over the communication center during the polls and I can tell you the effects they had on\nA on those personnel those men and women in there to have to deal with that\nHearing on credit hold a hearing those phone calls\nWell you you you got the phone calls from people inside\nBegging for help you got the bad guys Satan himself you know making phone call call it in a you know and then days later families\nGet toll called the land for department they know where your family members that it was just it was just a very very tough time and that's one of the\nElements in in that statute that I think is falling a little bit short of and and maybe that's something that they'll they'll take a look at and re examine nephews there's there's definitely people in it let's put aside the just the polls\nIncident you know these dispatchers and our first responders they go on incidents that\n... ... when they see a big deal with it they handle it it but it just leaves an indelible mark on the back of their head and then they have to I think the the biggest issue with with ... a PBS the is the feeling of hopelessness yeah\nHow we feel hopeless because we're not we're not there to lose people were either to lose bodies and and to lose somebody and not being able to rationalize the fact that you did everything you know some time so close and paying\nJR ... we appreciate your transparency your openness you're willing to talk to us here today thank you for that an evil saves a junior Jay are retired from the land of fire department assistant chief there have ever I healthcare reporter with her sister station WFDD in Orlando you can look for the project trauma after tragedy gentlemen thank you for your time here today on the floor to round up\nThank you I appreciate the opportunity is well\nThat'll do it for our program this week the Ford roundup is produced by ...

J. C. T.\nOn a friday it's eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. Jacksonville your community or world highs will reach the mid eighties today with a light north easterly breeze mostly sunny overnight lows drop to the low sixties along the coast\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia this is fresh air I'm David being ... in for Terry Gross on today's fresh air John Waters there's a new retrospective of his art photographs and more\nWater set new lows in bad taste with such films as pink flamingos in which drag queen divine plays a criminal whose title is a filthy his personal life is threatened when she gets a disgusting package in the mail\nHow fast\nAre no longer the personal lives of all this I thought what I\nWill listen back to our interviews with\nJohn Waters I always like the villain I Love the stepmother I Love the wicked whereas for with all my movies and all my photographs really there is no such thing as ... as the villain also our review met Weiner's new series the Roman us [noise] person who's\nWilliam Castle safe and that has Alfred Hitchcock mastering because everybody accused William Castle\nWho was king of the gimmicks Center for films of ripping off\nAlfred Hitchcock but in a way it was the other way around because offered his cards people forget one psycho came out the ... campaign was but no one can enter the theater wants to feature has become which was unheard of at the time you forget people used to go to the movies at any time and just stay through to the next part of a film they never clear the fear\nSo there was a clock and every box office or you know and it was a big big gimmick so in a way he was king of the gimmicks also and he copied William Castle who went away did it first so I've always been away liked\nThe second rate better I mean William Castle law like more of an offer Hitchcock Jayne Mansfield I like to more than Marilyn Monroe\nFell menial I liked him really a lot though I didn't feel he was inferior but he was maybe I like so many you know we've been more than James Dean I always like the wrong person I always rooted for the wrong person that I always thought that the people that other people ... ugly were better looking that's always been my wife and and my career is kind of been based on that\nI Know you really like the Carney pitch for a movie like the William Castle come on but we're there movies that you felt really cheated by because they promised like thin and sex and sleeves and and they didn't deliver it\nI I never feel cheated when I go to the movies even if I hate it it's an experience of cinematic experience and and that's why I started taking these pictures there's no such thing\nThat's a bad movie if you go to a movie watching detail only if you really hate the movie just look at the lamps in it and pretend the movie is about lamps and and and and then never as it boring it's always exciting and it's always surprising you can even see continuity mistakes within the lamps\nUm you also have a series called into um that or if this is still is from a Swedish close our films\nWell art some art meant dirty when I was young and that's the way it should stay anger was one of about squeezing\nYou know the Bergman movies when they first came out and Baltimore were sold effect films because they had a little bit of nudity in them and Sweden became a code word for dirty still the dirty bookshop in Baltimore is called the Sweden bookshop [laughter]\nNot making this up so so I Love the idea I tried to put in the end but I just showed the back of somebody I showed known nudity I showed the one shot in a\nSex film that you would never reproduce that would never become a still is is the sexy girl walking away from you out of focus a shop that no one would ever produce all the still in the show are ones that would never be produced I did a whole theory called marks\nWhere I just took photograph off the floor when I was making that movie Packer of the tape marks that the crew puts down that the actors have to hit the stay and focus and that's the only thing in the shop everything that would be in a movie is called the actors the costumes props and all that's left is the one thing you can't show in a movie still\nSince a few of the shots in your book allude to you know erotic movies or or porn movies I'm Wondering how you discover pornography as a kid\nShe discovered point as a kid Peyton place was the first dirty book I ever read it and I had heard about it certainly meant bingo was another one and that's like kind of a great movie\nUm and playboy mean playboy was the first thing that you could ever really see now gay porn was a very very different thing there was a store called Sherman's downtown that had those magazines like them and vigor and they were supposedly muscle man magazines but it was it was kind of a coded\nThing was the first gay magazines I ever saw\nDid your father have a pornographic books or or men's magazines when that you could sneak peak sat\nNo he didn't but he did have Peyton place and I did read his copy of Peyton place everyone had Peyton place my grandfather had pain types Peyton place was the biggest number one bestseller for weeks and weeks and weeks and it led to Jackie Suzanne led to Jackie Collins that led to that entire genre of work\nBut um but she did it first and she did it best and she had such great titles another one of her books with the tight white collar about appraised at such a good size [laughter]\nBut but she didn't handle success so well I mean she divorced her husband she moved to a plaza hotel and she drank too much and died basic rights so that's not the best of success story but the book was so famous that when I went back\nTo New Hampshire where where she wrote the book they still talk about her [laughter] and the town in the library I only had one tattered copy\nBut I did go to her grave and uh I grace has been a\nGreat heroine of mine\nWhen you started finding pornography and straight pornography what was like what was it like reading or seeing photos that were ... women's bodies when women's bodies weren't when it was an out for you\nWell when I looked at those pictures I always looked at it in a way to see how far could go the same way I went to\nUm heterosexual sex location movies all the time that had no male nudity to see how far could go I was interested in how the taboos would fall how it started with a new discount movies where the first things I saw an and you would see bare breast some limit on some times ashes\nBut once in a while a male asked but they had to be playing volleyball so you know that was not so erotic to me but I've never had a night where I met horny let's put it that way [laughter]\nYou get to see the new this can't ... and these with these ... these were movies at 'em ups extensively for supposed to be documentaries about healthy alternative lifestyles and yet when they were really about the nudity where do they play where did you get to see them\nI can tell you right where one of my favorite theaters but rex movie theater in Baltimore which is now at church when I was young it started out by saw the wizard of Oz there but it later became a new the movie theater I not only saw ... movies I saw the early Russ Meyer movies\nI saw a ... and it was one manning loan to who fought the censorship or we had the mail and censorship board and um censorship has always been something I fought so um I've always dealt with censorship so direct theater was where I got a lot of my film education in Baltimore\nJohn Waters speaking to Terry Gross in two thousand four more

town has just launched a three month retrospective exhibition of his visual art it's called John Waters indecent exposure and runs through January six\n[noise] did you feel guilty for for your ... your taste that about violating all the standards of decency\nNo I never felt guilty um I always knew I told the story before but I was young I heard my parents talking about me you know you listen to the top of the steps and my mom said oh he's just an odd duck\nAnd I thought well that's it you know so I I didn't really ever care\nThat the other kids weren't interested in what I resent because as I had a very rich fantasy life\nAnd my parents I'm allowed that I had a little stage even as a kid uh I I my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because I was a real the real tape recorder\nTape songs off the radio but then so I could sing them on lip sync from basically so I always was a ... here as a kid I had a I had a job I had a career when I was twelve years old a puppeteer\nSo I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing was not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you got\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction if he could well I might as well plan up to the hilt and envy you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took on\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have any advertising no one knew what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people was history it was hippies that didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's\nOh little moment you view\nSays on\nA\n\nBall generalize welcome back to a fresh air and it's great to have you can make it so I'm going to start by asking you to read from the first chapter of role models in this chapter is about Johnny Mathis who was shockingly [laughter] one of your role model so why should we didn't accept our parents\nI Wish I were Johnny Mathis so mainstream so popular so on ironic have perfect effortlessly boy I should over Seventy years old with a voice that still makes all of America or want to make out heavenly warm yes I'll say it out loud wonderful wonderful\nIs it because Johnny Mathis says the polar opposite of me a man whose greatest hits album was on the billboard charts for four hundred and Ninety consecutive weeks versus me a cult filmmaker whose core audience no matter how much I've crossed over consists of minorities who can't even fit in with their own minorities\nDo we secretly idolize or imagine opposites\n... reading from his new book role models I was shocked to see that Johnny Mathis [laughter] that was the lead chapter he probably Russia well I mean he's as a singer he's such a like a romantic\nAnd you're still not in your art I Can't speak about your private life so what is the attraction\nWill because Johnny Mathis is the opposite of me because\nJohnny Mathis to me is the kind of mainstream that I Will never ever be able to have an everybody wants to have hits like that but at the same time John enough it's said to me I always wanted to be a jazz singer\nSo in a way you're opposite sometimes isn't exactly what you believe him to be too so I didn't know Johnny Mathis and to get to meet him was not easy because I'm sure that Google man I'd be nervous too [laughter]\nSo um he was lovely though when I went to his house and everything\nSo I always assumed that the reason why Johnny Mathis didn't do a lot of interviews with because he was in the closet and didn't want to have to well I wrote\nThat saying that I was not coming to him with any agenda sects of moral ... racial anything and I didn't and I didn't\nAnd I never asking those questions I don't really think obviously if you wanted to talk about any of his personal life he did he he just said some of my ... you know and I know what he meant what does he have to share his public life with I'm not always for that\nYou know I get weary of reading these people that tell every personal thing to reporters they just met that day\nAnd that's what I really don't have friends that's what friends are foreign our borders\nSo you mentioned Tennessee Williams he's a chapter in your book role models and I'm going to ask you to read an excerpt of your chapter in Tennessee\nWilliams this one is called ... okay the kindness of strangers\nLet me just say this is John Waters think asked his new book is called role models in each chapter is about somebody else who in one way or another was a role model or an inspiration for him so this is Tennessee Williams\nYears later Tennessee Williams saved my life the first time I went to a gay bar or was Seventeen years old it was called the hot and it was in Washington DC some referred to it if the chickens and it was filled with early Nineteen sixties gay men and fluffy sweaters who cruise one another by calling table to table on phones provided by the bar\nI may be clear but I invest I remember thinking still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote I knew he would understand my dilemma\nTennessee never seem to fit the gay stereotype even then and sexual ambiguity of turmoil were always made appealing and exciting and if it were my type doesn't know who I Am he stated according to the gym and even if the sex lives of his characters weren't always healthy they certainly seemed party\nTennessee Williams was in a gay cliche so I had the confidence to try to not be one myself gay was not enough it was a good start however [laughter]\nSo he gave you confidence to be gay but not set a stereotype of what was going to have\nMe the confidence to be a beatnik revert to beatnik or to not even be to be a beatnik was gay that's very different you know you went into a field of all different kinds of rebels\nAnd their sexuality was always still my friends are doesn't matter if they're gay or straight if I'm friendly with somebody that has literally no interest to me whether I like the person or not\nI'm and I'm always amazed by people that say um oh you should go this age and he has all gay people were when I go where they're going to drive all black people that are being good or bad I mean that's what counts [noise]\nSo um I I always liked the gay people that had trouble even sitting in the gay stereotype because I don't like rules of any kind and I see people that break some with happiness and I'm not bringing pain to themselves\nSo well how have you changed in terms of what you want to do with with your fame and with people's interest in your life because in some ways you've turned yourself into your art in it because you've you'd do shows yeah when that shows you've written personally\nUh you know over the years and the people are dying here that you\nWell I don't know I'm I use my own personality to find out about others\nMy personality is wide probably not for me in the house or why the outsider pornographers I left in the house let me in and trusted me\nAnd I think I've only written about people that that I look up to about ... even if they've had terrible things happen in my life because they've had a more extreme life and I've ever had and I respect people I I as a writer every day I think\nWhat would you like to be that person and if you're a journalist or a writer you get to be that person wouldn't everybody liked a barge in people's health and they have some personal questions I don't get why everybody doesn't want to do that\nBut when you're running a book you're allowed to do that that's acceptable and that's why people tell me everything on airplanes strangers confided to me the most deepest darkest secrets and I think because they think oh understand and I generally do understand I've taught in prison I've counseled people I I\nI actually would be a good defense lawyer I Would be a good count for I Would be a good shrink actually and I believe in all those things I've been arrested I've been to a psychiatrist [laughter] so I think you have to participate in whatever business it in you were you were trying to be involved in\nSo getting back to Tennessee Williams you've read all of his books and you've read the love lots of people [laughter] you collect books you have over a thousand four hundred bucks a catalog\nI'd like to read books I don't collect bird sometimes struggles service for like ... from what I read them yeah I like to read um people always say to me how can you reached\nAnd it's easy you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you don't watch television simply read all the time and I'm On airplanes all the time so it it's I Love to read as how I relax I don't find that a compulsion cataloging them as being just being nice to my airs\n[laughter] do you have ... of\nCourse as much of a control freak 'cause I Am you don't think I have my death plop and I even know where I'm going to be buried we all bought plots a lot of my friends were like people's temple graveyard\nWell I Know and you say that a ... ... is it the same salmon herring that defined as in um so why do you why if you don't mind me asking why do you want to be buried\nBecause I Love the idea of graveyards I like people visiting I used to going through graveyards when I was young and find would still flowers for parties we'd have a couple of beers I like the atmosphere I liked the worms go in the worms go out I'm ... maybe I Believe in the resurrection the only thing I've ever talked to ... sounds like a good idea\nBut then I panic about real estate prices and run we're supposed to wear on our renewed so I go into that in the ... my paranoia about the recession\nYou're the only person I've ever asked I too who wants to be very ... like you really liked graveyards [laughter]\nOh yeah I Do like a lot of people like grave as a peaceful they're quiet um and we're all going to be birds or friends kind of one stop shopping\nYou know if you want to come you can say Hi main Kaiser everybody around and um I I liked the idea of it some and my mother at first I thought it would be strange to tell my own family 'cause I think it's a great idea because not your sister's going to be buried were has been a you know so\nSo um I I liked the idea here is field there that you're not getting buried next no I was afraid\nTo tell them they thought it was a fine idea they're totally understood I went to the graveyard where he is buried and when I\nQuoted lining my father we find it and making motive\nMeat prices that I didn't I never brought a great but it felt like a rip off to me and they showed me like tunes like they thought Rudolph Valentino is coming out there they were going to come and um and I thought wait a minute so I went and asked the woman were divided up 'cause I like the ... and she told me a price I said I'll take a double [laughter]\nI got like a lot of room around me triggers the prices quite fair bathrooms [laughter] you're better [laughter]\nTo have you thought it through like what kind of like ten soon\nYou know if I I kind of want it to be modeled after ... and I want mine to just say my father's is the same and I didn't realize until I saw recently his grave or 'cause he only died a few years ago just said John F. waters junior today I was born the day I was like who wants to risk a joke that has to laugh at trinity humor changes\n[laughter] talk about an old joke was on your I think it's the only time it should be quite simple on your grave stone what's on divine stone I'm praying hands but his parents put his real name and divine on around them and loving and people oh my God\nThey read stuff all over and they leave stuff it and leave doughnuts and dresses and it's it's um visited quite a lot\nWhen the U.S economy is growing and doing well our trade deficit goes up because we're buying a lot more from the rest of the world and try and of course is a major supplier\nIrwin says part of the reason people are spending more as the Trump tax cuts which have put more money in people's pockets the dollar is stronger against China's currency and there's another reason that trade gap is wider when the U.S imposed tariffs on China China retaliated with tariffs of its own\nA U.S exports to China really taken a hit particularly soybeans and other agricultural commodities when they are ... they're terrorists um those exports really were stopped in their tracks\nThis dynamic could change as the year goes on the U.S is scheduled to increase tariffs on Chinese goods even more in January if trade talks with Beijing haven't yielded any results\nThat may finally make Chinese products expensive enough that American consumers buy fewer of them Jim Zarroli NPR News\nOf instead of compulsively reaching for your phone you can reach for a book\nWe wanted it to just be this object that was this kind of comforting thing that kept people companies wrote their day\nThat is Johnny son he's an illustrator who collaborated on such a companion with Lynn man well Miranda as in Hamilton Lin Manuel Miranda\nI was aware of him much earlier than he was aware of me [laughter] but eventually I think we just we started realizing that we were kind of floating in the same space and um that's sort of how we got to know each other\nThat space was on Twitter of all places and that space with a happy encouraging one Miranda want it to collect his daily tweets that he called the morning and night in a book he writes things such as good morning good gracious are smiley it's contagious and\nConnect then good gracious year one for the ages\nSon tweeted at Miranda that he had ideas about how this book could come together and that is how Johnny son ended up illustrating Miranda words in their new book can morning goodnight little pep talks for me Andy you Johnny sun explains some of his thinking behind it\nThe Twitter feed and kind of social media in general is\nMeant to be ephemeral and I think when when I moved from like on line ... and it becomes more of like this capsule or something and it's meant to be visited and it's meant to be a little more time with and I think the difference between like the morality of social media and sort of the permanence of a book was the reason to do the book\nI Love that Twitter can be memorialized tastefully [laughter]\nSo do you have a favorite illustration in this book or our favorite pairing between when a your drawings and when Evelyn sweet\nOh man there are so many I think the\nThe real joy of it was really working with Lynn to make sure that the illustrations were reflective of him we spent some time going through each of the tweets and he kind of gave me like the director of commentary of each kind of passage and told me like here's how he was feeling this day here's what he was thinking of\nUm the drug for me was taking all of that stuff and trying to fit it into an image\nSo I was flipping through this book and I came across this tweet do not get stuck in the comments section of life today make do create the things let others tussle it out neither Lin Manuel Miranda it's words that they made me think of you\nBecause you started your whole public persona on Twitter any by definition you were stuck in the comments\nSection yeah oh why Twitter why did you choose that medium to introduce yourself to the world\nIt's it's funny that they do even frame it as like choosing to do this thing because I think for me I just had turned to Twitter as this organic way to sort of connect with people\nThey had um just moved to the U.S for school I had a a grown up in Toronto\nAnd um I realized I had lost touch with a lot of my comedy friends and a lot of my writer friends in Toronto and so I've sort of turned to Twitter because I've found a lot of people doing really interesting stuff on Twitter they were writing\nUm humor and writing fiction and just sharing interesting pieces and thoughts on that aspect of their lives on line and I thought like this is such a great space\nAnd community to play and and I just wanted to like I just wanted to be part of it all and optimistic [laughter] I mean the\nSame things are dying out and say this is so vital and toxic and poison [laughter]\nRight absolutely and like I absolutely don't mean to discount any of that because that is such a huge issue with um with Internet culture and just like the social media space in general um\nI I Do think though that there are pockets of of genuine like goodness and I think that's that's the really hard part to find is to is to is to find those find those people and find those communities that are just people trying to connect with each other and I think that's really powerful\nYou talk about dealing with depression on Twitter were you able to find a community of people who\nGot what you were saying got your struggle like has Twitter helped actually deal with that part of your life\n[noise] [noise] yeah absolutely I think it's actually it's I feel like it's the other way around where like Twitter was the thing that made me understand my mental health better ... like I had not grown up knowing that therapy was an option for

exhibition of his visual art it's called John Waters indecent exposure and runs through January six [noise] did you feel\nGuilty for for your ... your taste about violating all the standards of decency\nNo I never felt guilty um I always knew I I told the story before but I was young I heard my parents talking about me you know you listen to the top of the steps and my mom said oh he's just an odd duck\nAnd I thought well that's it you know so I I didn't really ever care that the other kids weren't interested in what I resent because as I had a very rich fantasy life\nAnd my parents I'm allowed that I had a little stage even as a kid uh I I my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because the real the real tape recorder type songs off the radio and but then so I could sing them on lip sync from basically\nSo I always I was a puppeteer as a kid I I had a I had a job I had a career when I was twelve years old so puppeteer\nSo I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing was not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor but will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you got\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the\nYou mentioned figured well I might as well play it up to the hilt and and be you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising that no one knew who was ... we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three it was hippies that didn't like hippies it was it was always the\nOh little silly little moment oh man who\nWas on\nA\n\nBall generalize welcome back to ... to have their government go to I'm going to start by asking you to read from the first chapter of role models in this chapter is about Johnny Mathis who was shockingly [laughter] one of your role model so why should we didn't accept as far as\nI Wish I were Johnny Mathis some mainstream so popular so on ironic perfect effortlessly boy I should over Seventy years old with a voice that still makes all of America wants to make out heavenly warm yes I'll say it out loud wonderful wonderful\nIs it because Johnny Mathis says the polar opposite of me a man whose greatest hits album was on the billboard charts for four hundred and Ninety consecutive weeks versus me a cult filmmaker whose core audience no matter how much I've crossed over consists of minorities who can't even fit in with their own minorities\nDo we secretly idolize or imagine opposites\n... reading from his new book role models I was shocked to see that Johnny Mathis [laughter]\nThat was the lead chapter he probably Russia [laughter] well I mean he's as a singer he's such a like a romantic and you're so not in your art I Can't speak about your private life so what is the attraction\nWill because Johnny Mathis is the opposite of me because\nJohnny Mathis to me is the kind of mainstream that I Will never ever be able to have an everybody wants to have hits like that but at the same time zone enough it said to me I always wanted to be a jazz singer\nSo in a way you're opposite sometimes isn't exactly what you believe him to be too so I didn't know Johnny Mathis and to get to meet him was not easy because I'm sure that Google me and I'd be nervous too [laughter]\nSo um he was lovely though when I went to his house and everything\nSo I always assumed that the reason why Johnny Mathis didn't do a lot of interviews with because he was in the closet and didn't want to have to well I wrote\nThat saying that I was not coming to him with any agenda sects of moral racial anything and I didn't I didn't\nAnd I I never asking those questions I don't really think obviously if you wanted to talk about any of his personal life he did he he just said some of my fans things ... you know and I know what he meant what does he have to share his public life with I'm not always for that\nYou know I get weary of reading these people that tell every personal thing to reporters they just met that day\nAnd that's what I wrote us they don't have friends that's what friends are foreign reporters\nSo you mentioned Tennessee Williams he's a chapter in your book role models and I'm going to ask you to read an excerpt of your chapter in Tennessee Williams\nOkay this one is called ... okay the kindness of strangers\nLet me just say this is John Waters think asked his new book is called role models in each chapter is about somebody else who in one way or another was a role model or an inspiration for him so this is Tennessee Williams\nYears later Tennessee Williams saved my life the first time I went to a gay bar or was Seventeen years old it was called the hot and it was in Washington DC some referred to her to ... and it was filled with early Nineteen sixty of gay men and fluffy sweater who cruise one another by calling table to table on phones provided by the bar\nI may be clear but I invest I remember thinking still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote I knew he would understand my dilemma\nTennessee never seem to fit the gay stereotype even them and sexual ambiguity in turmoil were always made appealing and exciting and if we're my type doesn't know who I Am he stated according to the gym and even if the sex lives of his characters weren't always healthy they certainly seemed hearty\nTennessee Williams was in a gay cliche so I had the confidence to try to not be one myself gay was not enough it was a good start however [laughter]\nSo he gave you confidence to be gay but not set a stereotype of a well what do you have\nMe the confidence to be a beatnik revert to beatnik or to not even be to be a beatnik was gay that's very different you know you went into a field of all different kinds of rebels\nAnd their sexuality was always still my friends are doesn't matter if they're gay or straight if I'm friendly with somebody that has literally no interest to me whether I like the person or not\nI'm and I'm always amazed by people that say um oh you should go this age and he has all gay people were when I go where they're going to drive all black people that are being good or bad I mean that's work out\nSo um I always liked the gay people that had trouble even sitting in the gay stereotype because I don't like rules of any kind and I see people that break some with happiness and I'm not bringing pain to themselves\nSo how have you changed in terms of what you want to do with with your fame and with people's interest in your life because in some ways you've turned yourself into\nYour art in it because you've you do shows yeah when shows you've written were personally uh you know over the years and the people are dying here that you\nWell I don't know I'm I use my own personality to find out about others\nMy personality is wide probably driving now for for me in the house or why the el Pato pornographers I left in my house let me in a trusted me\nAnd I think I've only written about people that that I look up to about ... even if they've had terrible things happen in our life because they've had a more extreme life than I've ever had and I respect people I I as a writer every day I think\nWhat would you like to be that person and if you're a journalist or a writer you get to be that person wouldn't everybody like the barge and people's house and they have some personal questions I don't get why everybody doesn't want to do that\nBut when you're running a book you're allowed to\nThat's acceptable and that's why people tell me everything on airplanes strangers confided to me the most deepest darkest secrets\nAnd I think 'cause they think oh understand and I generally do understand I've taught in prison I've counseled people I I I actually would be a good defense lawyer I Would be a good counselor I Would be a good shrink actually and I believe in all those things I've been arrested I've been to the psychiatrist\nSo I think you have to participate in whatever business it in your you were trying to be involved\nSo getting back to Tennessee Williams you've read all of his books and you've read the love lots of people [laughter] you collect books you have over a thousand four hundred bucks a catalog\nI'd like to read books I don't collect books sometimes struggles overkill I moved from being read them yeah I like to read\nUm people always say to me how can you read so much and it's easy you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you don't watch television simply read all the time and I'm On airplanes all the time so um it it's I Love to read that's how I relax I don't find that a compulsive cataloging them as being just being nice to my airs\n[laughter] do you have ... of course as much of a control freak because I Am you don't think I have my ... and I even know where I'm going to be buried we all bought plots a lot of my friends for like people's temple graveyard\nWell I Know and you say that a ... ... is it the same salmon herring that divide doesn't um so why do you what if you don't my asking why do you want to be buried\nBecause I Love the idea of graveyards I like people visiting I used to going great graveyards when I was young and vibrant still flowers for parties we'd have a couple of beers I liked the atmosphere I liked the worms go in the worms go out I'm both maybe I Believe in the resurrection the only thing I've never taught the sounds like a good idea\nBut then I panic about real estate prices and road rules of the way are on our renewed so I go into that in the ... my paranoia about the recession\nYou're the only person I've ever asked I too who wants to be very 'cause like you really like graveyards [laughter]\nOh yeah I Do like a lot of people like grave as a peaceful they're quiet and then we're all gonna be birds for all her friends kind of one stop shopping\nYou know if you want to come you can say Hi main Kaiser everybody around and um I I liked the idea of it it's um and my mother at first I thought it would be strange to tell my own family because my mother said I think it's a great idea because not your sister's going to be buried were husband that you know so\nSo um I I liked the idea is field there that you're not getting married next no I was afraid\nTo come and they thought it was a fine idea they're totally understood I went to the graveyard where he is buried in quote China and my father we find it and making motive meat prices that I didn't know I never bought a great but it sounds like a rip off to me\nAnd they showed me like tunes like they thought Rudolph Valentino is coming out there they were going to go and um and I thought wait a minute so I went and asked the woman were divided up because I like the graveyard and she told me a price I said I'll take a double [laughter]\nI got like a lot of room around me took the prices quite fair bathrooms [laughter] you're better [laughter]\nTo have you thought it through like what kind of like ten soon\nYou know if I kind of want it to be modeled after ... and I want mine to just say my father's it's the same and I didn't realize it until I saw recently his grave or because he only died a few years ago just say John F. waters junior today I was one of the day was died who wants to risk a joke that has to laugh attorney humor changes\nTo talk about an old joke was on your I think it's the only time it should be quite simple on your grave stone what's on divine stone\nI'm praying hands but his parents put his real name and divine on rising and loving and people oh my God they read stuff all over it and they leave stuff and then leave doughnuts and dresses and it's it's um visited quite a lot", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "12"}
