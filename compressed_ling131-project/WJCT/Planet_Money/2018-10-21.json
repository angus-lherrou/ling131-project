J. C. T. F. M. Jacksonville listen to anywhere on your computer or mobile device at W. J. C. T. that\nGuy rise if I were to tell you that today's show is the best show I have ever heard in my entire life would you believe me well yeah well why wouldn't I Will because you know it's easy to make up a fake review they're everywhere I read them all the time and we don't even know so it is today show not\nThe best one ever noted on today's show is the best one ever but okay what if what if there were a computer program that could didn't have a\nFake review on line that would be cool I'm Kenny Malone and today our planet money someone did exactly that\nBike and ride a computer program to do all this in seconds and I could pointed at any product and I'm Guy right today on how I built this we need a man who knew exactly what people wanted for lunch\nI see an opportunity\nI wait out into the water and I try to figure out where that opportunity is going to take me\nRun shakes turned into one of the most successful that casual a change in history we've got an hour of economics and innovation on Planet Money and how I built this from NPR\nI Am sure that this will be the last day I take the I have high palpitations and I'm not sure if tomorrow I Will wake up overall rating five\nOver all reading five I don't know I mean it's it's a pretty good [laughter]\nOkay well ah not everyone thought that same powder tasted good\nThis stuff give me a strong urge to vomit some sort of strange circus going on to my stomach overall rating one\nThere's a lot of talk of stomach issues yeah bloating is bloating a big problem yeah yeah yeah\nBody builders were writing reviews and Tommy got a referral fee when customers found products they liked through his site\nIt was going so well for me that he decided to just run the side fulltime\nThen as it grew at started climbing the ranks and Google you know rank number one for the term supplement review\nIt must have been a big day the day that happened yeah [laughter] yeah it was\nBut as the website became more and more prominent supplement companies became more and more aware of Tom you cite and how their products were being reviewed on his site\nSays at the time is maybe getting like twenty maybe as a day look he wasn't meeting every single one of them but he was meeting a lot of them and he started to see these suspiciously positive reviews creeping in\nThis one for example university proven study\nAnyone can test the product but to prove that it works is key\nAnd it almost reads like a sales pitch and you kind of read it and you think are I was at a rapid that wrote this or was it someone that just drank the Kool Aid\nOf a marketing campaign I never get loaded farming despite its sometimes take two times as much as the serving during and after my work out the taste of it is very good as well as mix properly\nTo for telling me these kinds of reviews were sometimes hard to deal with because it sounded like a person from the company had just come in and written this but what if it was someone who had tried the product and really did believe the hype\nAnd that's the problem with online with these and and not ... it's almost impossible to tell from the content alone if the reviews fake or not\nBut Tommy knew if a company was coming in and pretending to be a regular bodybuilder who happen to love their product the entire idea of his website would fall apart so I Would really have to\nDo a bunch of investigative work on each one to really see where it originated in whether it was from the company or not so Tommy goes to work basically the first thing I check out as the email address that they used to register for the site\nWhere they don't want them to use the company email address that happens sometimes [laughter]\nYes it didn't take\nLong to realize that these companies were coming in and basically they were just writing press releases\nAnd it kept happening these fake reviews were flooding in and starting to overwhelm the real reviews\nAnd I just thought it's not fair that you know people that actually leave feedback that as you know real honest are are getting silenced\nTommy took all this time and created this place ... honest feedback and now it was just being turned to the exact opposite\nYeah yeah well it's my you know it was my work it was my life's work and uh it's just it's been painful to see somebody just disrespected like that in the name of of money\n... pretty small site in the grand scheme of things but he started to wonder like if this is happening to supplement reviews dot com I Wonder how big of a problem this is at other sites\nSo he went into the belly of the beast of online shopping Amazon dot com\nAnd I looked at this testosterone booster that had five hundred and sixty reviews\nIt was actually five hundred and eighty reviews Tommy starts to scan through a little bit and he's the preview spite he senses are going bonkers and he's like okay I'm going to inspect every single one of these views is going to be a lot of work and I'm gonna need my special Pandora station for this\nBased off of a song from I call 'em dead\nMouse five with other people call them dead mouse or it's called take care of the proper paperwork is the name of the song [noise]\n\nThis certainly must be in the top ten song named after paperwork and I think yes there's a mind numbing sound of ... ... is pretty accurate so Tommy\nHe's going through every single review and essentially asking himself how do I know I can trust is\nI've got an excel spreadsheet open and I got Amazon and I've got like five hundred tabs open on Amazon and I'm sitting there just look at the extra view tally updated look at the national review tally up\nTo and as he does is he starts to learn the tricks of online fake reviewers some of them are not so tricky for example one review he noticed there was a before and after picture before super skinny guy after super ripped\nTommy doesn't reverse image search and he finds the earliest example if the photo on her bed\nAnd I'm message that user on read it and I said hey did you also uses image for review and they said no\nSo fast it yet is stolen before and after picture obviously fake\nAs he investigates time he's also starting to notice that some suspicious reviewers have almost like an M O that he can identify and he started naming these different types of questionable reviewers\nOne category at the brand monogamous so these are people that only review products from one company over and over again\nSure maybe that person really likes that company or maybe that person works for that company another fake reviewer profile the one hit wonders these are people who review one thing and then never review anything again\nI mean obviously there are people that just review one thing that's totally a a normal thing that happens but if it happens a lot and if those one hit wonder is they're giving the product a five star across the board than you know again maybe there's something unnatural about that\nYeah like if this testosterone booster had a bunch of one hit wonder is that we're all really positive that is pretty unnatural but the most unnatural pattern Tommy found was this suspicious flood of positive reviews around the exact same time\nYou know it was like three days of you know the super high volume where I think like thirty percent of the reviews were submitted\nAnd that's fishy because it is way more reviews than any other three they stretch and they're really positive reviews so it looks like maybe taught me says somebody paid for a bunch of fake reviews around that time\nThe way they sometimes works as bad as salary might want to boost their rankings they want to sell my pot act and then eat my positive ... so there are sites where they can buy these fake reviews but then those positive views are posted on the same time\nAnd so for Tommy after reading through all those reviews learning the tricks with the ... trade what percentage of those five hundred and eighty reviews did he think were tainted or biased in some way probably all of them [laughter] like nearly a hundred percent or maybe a hundred percent\nYes our something is wrong with them\nSo Tommy was on this mission to clean up the fake TV is on his own website and they looked at Amazon and he finds out even Amazon has this gigantic problem of BS reviews not only that\nIf she ever wants to go on Amazon and buy something again he's ... he's going to have to spend hours going review by review to figure out what is even trustworthy\nOr I could write a computer program to do all this in seconds access these pages automatically pull the data and give me you know a much better picture of the reviews and I'm sitting there thinking like an F. I wrote that computer program to do all this in seconds I could pointed at any product\nAnd so Tommy noon and went back to work and in essence he coded uh version of himself and Internet review detective that can help any of us pull up an item on Amazon and cut through all the BS reviews to find just the good ones he started a new website that he called review met\nTo dot com art he'll show me how review meta can help me get over my finger do anxiety Kenny ... um [noise] I just was on vacation and my phone died four times because I Do not actually do have the iPhone cables anymore\nGot so you're going to Amazon and you put in iPhone cable [noise] um yes so we have a over twenty thousand is I'll Try find chaos that's a lot\nOf 'em are the anxiety starts so we're going to click on the one that we like All right so this one has a hundred and Seventy seven reviews for stars like that which is great on the surface\nAnd then you take the URL copy it and then you pasted into vehement okay and then I hit my report and events that report right and they do\nComputing computing bleep bleep bleep bleep whatever's going to take a wild reading like a hundred and Seventy seven reviews would take me like five hours at any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noonan on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flagged about these iPhone cable reviews\nOkay so for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average these\nReviews of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average movie it was their way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it\nSo the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nAfter them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was with us\nAnd this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the courts do but that's probably a good thing that is not you know that you should see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise]", "show_name": "Planet Money", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "21"}
