resource cause personal data or data in general\nAnd there's an interesting kind of a self reinforcing dynamic you land as if I'm trying to acts by and sells it acquires data about its consumers and that enables it to grow by producing more personalized products\nBy advertising more effectively\nAnd that brings in more customers which brings in more data which then and there was there for them to grow even further and that leads to the behemoth um status [noise]\nAnd that is what Franklin four and a growing chorus of other critics are so concerned about four recently published a book called world without mind the existential threat of big tech its part memoir part ... greed against the dominance of the big tech firms\nIt's not a particularly empirical book and it's hard to say how much of for his argument was informed by personal experiences like the New Republic disaster it also turns out that for his family in addition to encouraging his love of books encouraged his distrust of monopoly [noise]\nSo my dad was a a University of Chicago trained lawyer who worked in the antitrust division of the Carter administration then so I grew up in this household where\nAnti trust was part of the family religion and my dad would drive around in a car that had a bumper sticker that said bust the trust on it it\nWas a real obsession and passion of his and\nFor a long time he was lonely activists who is railing for greater more aggressive enforcement of these laws prohibiting a monopolistic behavior and um I I always admired him for this quixotic stand that he took but I never really fully bought into his arguments\nUntil Amazon got in this fight with the book publishers when it started to hit close to home\nThis was the ... deal yes\nYeah yeah exactly let's just say something about book publishing which is that book publishing is an incredibly or comical industry that they're you know four or five big companies that dominate book publishing and\nThey're often times jerks and so it's hard to have a whole lot of sympathy for the book publishers\nBut suddenly you have these five big companies that were up against one big company which was Amazon and Amazon basically controlled their access\nTo the marketplace and Amazon was renegotiating their e book contract with the publishers one by one trying to strong arm them with their market power into pricing their books that were in lower and so to me it was grotesque and ominous that\nAmazon was just able to use its market power to try to dictate\nTo the publishers and this incredibly aggressive sort of way\nSo where where do you draw the line between winning\nOr competing and being evil right persuade me that it's not just in case of big companies being really good at what they do and winning and you kind of having sympathies with the people who are not winning\nMy book in some ways is a Valentine to competition that I I Believe that uh marketplaces most healthy when you have a number of market player so I might not love\nBook publishing it might be to concentrate in some ways for my taste but at least there are five companies competing against one another for the marketplace and so if I don't like the way that one company is treating me\nOr if I don't like the goods that one company is selling I can go to another company\nAnd the problem with Amazon and the problem with Google and to an extent with Facebook is that they become the only market player and so the choice that we have is consumers is limited\nAnd competition is limited so my book is uh my argument is against the big technology companies which\nReally are racing to expand into every ... any of our lives\nAs it happens this expansion has just released into Franklin for his own life we spoke to him last year just before his book was being published and there'd been a plot\nTwist the New America foundation supported in my book\nThe New America foundation is a center left think tank devoted to quote renewing American\nPolitics prosperity and purpose in the digital age it's run by the political scientist Anne Marie slaughter who's a former top official in the Obama State Department yeah one of the cool\nThings at New America does is that they give money to journalists who are writing book projects so uh you know I didn't get a lot of money from them but I got a small some and they were especially generous to me because I just been fired from a job at the at the New Republic\nAnd the partial funding for his book about the dominance of firms like Google suddenly became relevant because\nThat's since become relevant just because they fired a ... for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because you America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavowed them when they've been so nice to me but\nThis does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired his name is Barry Lynn and he ran something called the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very vociferous critic of ah of Google\nWe used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of North America and that is Barry Lynn now directs the open markets Institute\nSo the name of his project has not been taken away but his affiliation with the New America foundation has for\nWorking at a we works on the uh fourteen hundred bucks a G street and Washington\n[noise] coming up next week on freakonomics radio the story is not as nice as the headlines would happen\nDid Google for any fun to tell me to fire very land\nHow much gratitude do philanthropists and foundations

T. ...\nNow you know sometimes it's the little things that get you know yes like like targeting and yeah or like when you buy something and you don't get the full time I'm sad when Dallas Anton am Planet Money we know\n... recalled the smartest people we know and we asked him what TV thing would you change about the world and to make our lives better\nAnd says we gag Jean Jean\nAnd I'm Guy rise to the end how I built this we meet a man who got a lot of pushback when he tried to start is organic yogurt company\nNo no no we've already got a hippie yogurt maybe somebody in Vermont in their TV with their ... you know they didn't need another organic yoga from some crazy people in a hamster\nGaithersburg went on to make stony feel farms a multi million dollar six\nAnd innovation on the Planet Money and how I built this\nEver heard anyone go through personally right like a normal person a non celebrity quarterback there like I Know this is a good problem to have I Know I'm getting a good job but this is the most stressful thing I've ever gone through a ... or whatever someone will fix it for\nMe yeah and I think the thing that popped into my head was more people should have someone like this\nAbbey was next week is all of us not just famous people should have agents\nNow she's not saying this has to be your own personal Hollywood agent or even an expensive lawyer we know about those kinds of jobs she's saying maybe there's a different job that doesn't exist yet it'd be some intermediary you pay a flat fee to and then they'll have a couple of conversations on your behalf when you need it\nRight and this may sound like a union but this is someone who's going to individually negotiate not collectively bargain so imagine every gets a call hey it's the University of Michigan and we'd like to offer you a job\nI Would say thanks ethics siting\nI'm using this news service this third person is going to contact you with my questions\nIs it a is it weird to think about actually saying that to someone offering you a job\nIt is weird um but it's all weird right\nAbby thinks that having this intermediary negotiate for you could be a huge benefit over the course of your career\nFirst of all it would be this person's job to study your field and to know what you're worth and this takes a little advantage away from your employer\nSecondly she says there's research showing that if you make less at the beginning of your career you're going to make less down the road and so the sooner you bring someone in to negotiate a great salary the better that it's going to be for you\nAlso says this intermediary could help deal with some of the things that add to the gender pay gap\nWell it's clear that two things happen one is that women don't quite asked for the same things that men will ask for in a negotiation but there's also evidence that when women ask it's not receive the same way as one man ask\nSo again an intermediary helps to fix that a little bit I think socially it just kind of James the signal a little bit\nIf we're going to name this new profession do do you have an idea like what we call this thing\nNow negotiator I think is maybe better than agent in terms of just capturing more what's going on\nIt's good to talk to my negotiator than I could do that\nYou could say neutral party but I'm not sure these people are really going to be neutral\nIntermediaries accurate but also kind of bland yeah so yeah the negotiators good I like to go ... and not in marketing yeah everyone\nNeeds a negotiator love it the negotiator also in Nineteen Ninety eight movie starring Samuel L. Jackson what happens [noise]\nGo by the way I don't know [noise]\nKenny has left the studio we assume to go watch the negotiator the Nineteen Ninety eight movie by Samuel Jackson\nAnd in the studio now is Sarah Gonzales hey Sarah how Nick you're tweak is about the wedding industrial complex and we gave you this assignment because you're about to get married congratulations\nThanks and might tweak comes from day mine Jones He's an economist at the University of Chicago and ... year planning a wedding right now right [noise]\nI just recently was married in June\nYou'd just oh so you're ... you're in the clear\nI Am in clear but I Do have the right thank you notes or you behind schedule apparently you have up to a year to send a thank you notes yeah who makes these rules and that the timeframe down from the wedding God I don't know that I Would call them the gods it would be like the wedding gremlin yeah\nThey mind sweet cats to do with the way we think about wedding registries\nI hate wedding registries everyone hates them yes it feels like the sideways way of\nAsking people to reimburse you for like their dinner and their booze\nYeah and the mine also says that you can't even ask for what you really want to earn a wedding registry because it's just a little tacky\nThere's some gifts that are not acceptable to ask for you know can you give me season tickets to the Knicks but for some reason plates and forks are acceptable um we have enough place we have enough forks we don't need any more of those\nI feel I'm here on the force in place like maybe that made sense when those things were handmade in Pennsylvania but like this stuff is getting cheaper and cheaper\nAnd throwing a wedding is getting more and more expensive so here is ... ...\nI say let's discard the registry and maybe it does have some tickets good old fashioned tickets for the wedding\nWeights what sell people take it to ten year wedding\nWe wouldn't use the word so I'm going to be popular by says\nInstead of a wedding registry so like don't buy me a gift just pay for your plate of food at the wedding\nDon't buy gift just help us to to have the best wedding\nEver you want to you after writing gift you may want to charge different prices okay so no less\nAre different people okay so flat prices easiest but it's not fair\nLike maybe you want to cut your undergrad college cuts in a break but your investment banker friend she's painful price\nThis guy is cold and calculating and I kinda liked it he's\nAn economist [laughter] but here that\nYou have plus ones okay oh the last one to ... wearing yes yes so the issue\nIs you have a really good friend that you want to invite tier wedding but ah they have a new boyfriend or girlfriend\nAnd that you don't know they you know and now you have to spend like about three hundred person for their food their booze their chair their table their fork\nYet and if you have to pay for your new girlfriend's ticket maybe she doesn't have to come after\nAll maybe she's not going to you anymore and there's another big benefit no shows\nCan you believe that you're going to go through this entire process and only to have someone maybe not show up\nNo don't tell me why ding okay so I understand that at the risk I'm taking\nYeah so why not share their risk you have a deposit that's non refundable on your ticket and if you just sign up to show we understand and we also appreciate that your deposit is going toward the food that's going to be sitting there cold and an eating at the wedding\nOkay so you're getting married in about a month or you're going to take them on suggestion and charge for entry to your wedding\n[laughter] no no I Can't I'm not even asking people to give me get but I Am going to go on the record right now and just said this publicly if anyone RSVP to my wedding and bales at the last moment like that is not call\nWe're not going to be okay at least tell me two or three days before that I can let all the vendors now Sarah thank you so much muscle tough [noise]\nAnd when you're out there just to come back and [noise]\nAnd now a modest proposal baseball is more interesting\nFor the next week Nick I'm I Want to introduce you to lieutenant Danny Rome and he's a\nTop hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department I'm just kidding I just telling you the plot of shows how was it I still have a lot to watch\nAnyway are actual final week is about baseball is also\nProbably our most controversial tweak\nYes major league baseball knows that his games are a little too long and so they've been trying their own tweaks to speed up the game\nLittle things like limiting the number of warm up pitch is making the commercial breaks between innings shorter\nAnd that's all fine but if they really wanted to speed the game up they would be a little more serious about listening to tweak proposed by this man\nEr my name is David ... professor of politics at New York university you like baseball I'm a fan a about a rabid fan [noise]\nNo not one who is willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose\nYou know I propose some reforms Steve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the\nCatch up rules yeah like you want to catch up with mustard on that guy just not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up\nSteve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch a parole\nAnd baseball and works as follows her that if you're the team ahead in an inning and you're a bad then you get only two outs rather than three outs in that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back\nTo Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyze a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the catch approve of been in place\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter\nWith these games are better than the average game which now about three hours in five minutes would be caught by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost an hour from a game and a half an hour of the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help
