S. and relatively terrible return on investment to the government at least\nIs that still a current argument is it still the case that agencies lake DARPA NSO or parallel versions are still I'm so strongly involved in the innovation or was that a golden era of\nGovernment investment in research that now needs in your view to be repeated\nSo the first part of the answer is business has changed it's become increasingly financial as this is a huge problem or the two sectors where this is the biggest problem is precisely pharmaceuticals where companies like Pfizer and Amgen a are spending over a hundred percent of their net income on areas like share buybacks and given a path\nAnd of course energy with the big possible green tech revolution of now in terms of the government investments on the one hand they they continue to be absolutely fundamental so and you know the the emerging green economy it was actually aren't they eat which came out with one of the biggest innovations and battery storage against fracking\nWhich has changed the international or a landscape around energy was also find us by government\nTo what degree with fracking for instance um funded by the government\nTo what degree will ... issue remember that the main thing is when so when it was still extremely uncertain extremely risky where there was no private\nGovernment was making those early investments\nI'm so in terms of the actual amount um percentage of the total that's not really the issue it's who took on the early ... and so that's why we should stop using words like lender of last resort for government financing and use more words like investor first resort 'cause that's in fact the ... the role it plays now on\nIn terms of all these organizations like an ss\nDARPA and the national institutes of health they're still spending a lot of money especially in the high risk high inserts and phase is high capital investment phases however they've been under attack\nBut the real issue shouldn't just be the budget should be the ... the ability of these organizations to continue to really lead the way to have a missions which aren't asked\nIn the budget Appropriations Committee you know what is the economic value going to be because had they thought about net present value in cost benefit and you know economic value as economists think of it in terms of jobs today and patents et cetera then there is no way we would have done them out on a mission\nThat actually require at a certain level of ambition of imagination of a willingness to dream so any country that's interested in tackling areas around climate change or rethinking twenty first century healthcare systems\nTackling the aging demographic crisis these are all brought challenges which I'm less we really framed them as missions and then we're not going to be able to tackle any of these grand challenges\nThat's what we should be learning instead of oh we need more venture capital\nSo you're making an argument that the U.S government um is not getting enough credit for investment in the past through agencies like DARPA NASA and then in the ... area and so and\nYou also argue separately that they're not getting enough return on the investment which but that sounds you know ... but you are\nSo argued that the high return and relatively low tax environment for entrepreneurs and investors is not a big driver I'm and I want to know what the evidence is for that I mean\nI look at the U.S as you know one question you ask 'cause we're Europe's Google's what happens differently in the states than in Europe to produce these companies like Google Facebook et cetera there are certainly a lot of people in private equity in venture capital in the start of culture\nWho say that because of the capital gains tax environment because of the carried interest loophole um that that that helps create the very large incentive\nTo make these companies that turned out to be super rich and I'm not even saying\nThese handful of companies that turned out to be super rich or necessarily so good for society I think that's a a bigger discussion for another day but I just want to know what's your evidence that that incentive is not really important and is perhaps a key factor in why this is happening in the U.S and not in Europe\nSo my answer is first of all what happened in the U. S. is that there was a system of the nation which lacks in many European countries\nWhere you had patient finance but also active mission oriented agencies which really thought about big problems so going to them on\nWhich required many different sectors to innovate including clothing not just aeronautics and an instruments including prizes and ... policy which allowed start ups to scale up\nRight start up in and out themselves who cares [laughter] because you have a start up with interesting as a given them an entrepreneurial ecosystem I don't believe in entrepreneurs I Believe in entrepreneurial ecosystems which actually allow start up to scale up and\nSo you know interestingly Europe has learned the wrong lessons from Silicon Valley and this is partly because of how the U. S. talks the U.S talk Jefferson but an ax Hamilton [laughter]\nUm so you know Jefferson talked more about getting the state that it away and Hamilton before getting into his dual with Burr\nWho is buried by the way in the town I grew up in Princeton New Jersey was very much about an active industrial strategy so Europe interestingly I think I've learned all the wrong lessons China on the other hand this is really curious China has learned to write like China's actually doing for the green economy with the U.S government did for the IT revolution\nAt the same time that Trump Donald Trump is dismantling what I call the entrepreneurial state ...\n... coming up next week on freakonomics radio will continue this conversation and talk about how you the taxpayer lose out when it comes to for instance pharmaceuticals and\nSo what we actually have the taxpayer paying twice for the very very very high basic research funding and then for these extremely high prices\nMan what kind of solutions says Mexico have yes so I think it would be good if I around the world [laughter]\nIn the meantime check out the freakonomics radio archive at freakonomics dot com more an apple pie calf\nBitter for any other ...\nAnd remember to be very nice the public radio station on what you're listening to the show especially if and when they ask for your financial support thanks for listening to talk to you next week [noise]\n\nThe Florida Times union editorial stuff probably presents Jay a new magazine dedicated to the rebirth of Jacksonville downtown on newsstands at select gate dailies and publications more info at Jacksonville dot com\nFloridians are still feeling the effects of the reconstruction era I broke my ankle and coming up on our frontiers the weekly radio magazine of the Florida Historical Society we'll talk with this story in key Steven prince about the period following the civil war\nWill discuss the book Florida in ten minutes from Nineteen oh wait and the Melrose ladies literary a debating society\nThat's Florida frontiers Monday evening at six thirty or eighty nine W.
