apprentice to windmill\nTechnician to executive director and and I saw them on the cutting edge of um [noise] of how we were going to need to grow food in the future [noise]\nIn and around the time you also meet sand came in right right and he he is the guy who's going to become your business partner who is ... and he he's also running his own organic farm\nRight so he was mostly teaching organic farming methods are raised beds are biological pest control or\nA greenhouse season extending basically kind of back to the land type stuff with a with an organic focus and he's older than you do yes he's about sixteen years old or ... or at that time a has six kids\nAnd I was a single guy but um you know we became fast friends and they he asked me if I were joined the board of the ... center to help him with his money racing and so we would\nSit at Samuels board meetings at up at the role education center I'm ... and by the way critical to this whole story he had one cow\nAnd then ... and ... was experimenting with yogurt and he was a a fermentation a nut case I mean he made sauerkraut beer or wine a Kim chi ... if it for granted he made and when I say he made he made incredible\nFoods and he made this wonderful yoga from his cow or miss one cow\nAnd I'm just to back up one step\n... originally from Brooklyn\nI'm grew up very poor\nAnd slapped Bush but he got to know a lot of these old Jewish yogurt makers down there\nAnd ah they taught him yogurt making and what they explain to him as it's very simple it's all about them that the uh meaning times and temperatures it's about the weather and the humidity the temperatures and he and ... for his family and for the school experimented with yogurt for many years\nAnd one day and and unfortunately none of us can remember who but one of us said gee why don't we start selling this stuff to ... you know make up for the lack of\nGrant money 'cause it was now impossible to raise money during that period and um you know seem like a pretty good idea so Samuel ... was able to get some Catholic nuns\nOr to provide a twenty five thousand dollar grant white nuns yeah the sisters of mercy and which is you'll hear in a moment the appropriate name or they were taking mercy on these two crazy entrepreneurs\nThey were selling their monastery and they were wanted to turn their principal into a\nLocal community action and some of the use that money to build the first yoga works so the\nSummer of eighty three you move to New Hampshire to to to start doing this fulltime\nRight I moved into a three story would hit a\nLog cabin or with 'em no plumbing and I put solar cells on it and ... and the Cayman\nFamily lives there and Senate and our interns are there's one big kind of happy crazy cow milking yogurt making\nA operation so I mean how did the yogurt system started I mean it was being being being sort of put into jars and how did you how did you get it to customers how did you sell it how did you British and go out and say yogurt for sale\nWell we started with one cow semi is the money to buy six more cost so now he's milking seven he finances this little tiny factory in a tiny little room that you could only really described as a closet in a\nSeventeen Ninety two barn\nWith the ... wood fired boiler\nAnd the way it worked was he put it in a fifty gallon stainless steel tank we bought plastic cups\nAnd semi it was a very charming and persuasive guy and after paying for his first shipment of cups he managed to somehow get continue to get shipments for five months without\nPaying for any more so he started producing April nine Nineteen eighty three and took his first\nSix packs of yogurt and drove down to the local supermarket to her with and said would you guys sell this stuff well they didn't know what the heck is was and they said what price should we sell it to them is that I don't know whatever whatever price do you think\nMaybe we were not businesspeople so we started selling\nAt a a dollar forty nine of court which is the same price down and was selling for it was like ambrosia guy was the most incredibly perfect product still the best thing we make [noise]\nYou guys just start to\nYou know basically\nHeld locally and\nAnd ah eventually the hardwood people cause that gosh you know this is good at selling a by the way way below the price we could afford but he couldn't keep up and he was out of cash and of course he wasn't paying bills when I arrived on September fifteenth of eighty three [noise]\nHe Samuel had these old army surplus desks and this farmhouse\nThat the the three desks were piled high with envelopes on open mail\nYou said okay I'm now the executive director of the ... center and the vice president to study feel farm and I'm going to spend my first that was the the name of the farm stony feel ... Oh yes the farm sorry yes of course and it's still there so I spent the morning separate and I thought the checks from the\nBills the only problem was there were no checks or ... any money that had come in here to use it to buy feed or or you know lubrication equipment fuel would whatever and\nEleven AM that morning my first day I calculated that we were Seventy five thousand dollars in the red huh so what did you did well I did what any self respecting entrepreneur does I called my mother and I borrowed thirty thousand dollars\nFrom her which she could ill afford as I told you before she was you know her own business for was\nFor you know family but you know I had a good fundraising scale so I went to many of my former funders and many of his and I said look can we\nThey these were the the ... farm that they had run back\nIn Massachusetts right well Samuel had a handful of\nA folks who had been his ... like I said he he raised a hundred and twenty five thousand a year so they were there probably twenty or thirty wealthy individuals and then I had raised a million dollars a year so I had [noise]\nYou know high net worth individuals out there and I look what I told them was very simple I said\nTen years of our work was all about proving that you can grow food organically\nBut if we're going to be successful with this revolution I said to the funders who had gotten this there\nThen we're gonna have to prove that you can actually make money doing it and we're gonna have to build a model enterprise that will show that you can avoid the use of\nPesticides avoid the use of hormones with cow's support family farmers not depend on fossil fuels et cetera et cetera all the things that we were doing in the nonprofit context\nI said you know this is I I'd like to ask you to join us in the next phase which is helping us to\nBuild a successful business and and instead of asking for a grand I'm asking you for a long [noise]\nAnd I wound up borrowing a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars [noise]\nAnd then I went out to our lenders\nHave the hundred and twenty five K.\nI said look I'm Will you take stock in this company and we did our first private placement [noise]\nYou know through a dart at the Weill figured out the value of the business\nWill what is your value but at the time [laughter] well\nWe thought we were going to value at at a million dollars but then in Nineteen eighty four our sales were up to around two hundred and fifty thousand a year and this is just in in New Hampshire or all over New England\nWell by eighty four we were starting to push the boundaries were selling to about twenty stores and eventually we started selling to a\nAn independent grocers seven stores and uh this will give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night we were having dinner at\nThe Caymans after milking and the phone rang and a ... the nephew of the\nOwner of the ... market basket and chain ... calls and says ... why are you selling to my competitors and not to me that he had thirty four stores at the time is up and say well how to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows he said well get some\nCows and he's land the phone down and we took that as very good business advice so we\nWent out and grew are hurt even further and well then so we now realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed to lease a small refrigerator trucks and started delivering actually to the market basket where warehouse\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing\nNow about three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and a case like twenty four cups six ... six packs of court so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range which you\nWere probably spending more money than you are bringing in right\nOh my God you have no idea yeah we were burning I mean I kept not weekly cash flows not daily casualty I kept hourly capitalism yeah I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon in order for us because by then the guy had figured out", "show_name": "How I Built This", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "14"}
