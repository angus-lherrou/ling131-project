I I wanted more\nWhat was your vision for cookie jar did you imagine it being like that cookie company worked for and Ohio that it would be a big chain of cookie stars was that what you were thinking long term you know it's so funny I have never started\nWith a tight goal in mind what I have always done and to this day still do I see an opportunity I wait out into the water and\nI Try to figure out where that opportunity is going to take me a little like body surfing when you go on vacation you go to the ocean\nYou know you get out by far enough away from shore\nYou'll start to watch the waves come in then you choose a wave and you think that's going to be a powerful wave\nAnd then you get on that wave and you see where it takes you and you start to to navigate and negotiate your way to shore and so for me the cookies or was not an end but it means to take me to the next place\nI just loved the process of figuring it out I Love the doing of the work I was working a hundred hours a week and and it never felt like work it was joy [noise]\nYou'll just a minute ago that you that it wasn't enough that you want and more of what like what was your plan to take the cookie jar\nYou know to the next level\nWell it was really interesting I mean\nI saw these fifty thousand people a day going by but nobody book cookies before twelve noon that I thought to myself wow what can we do with this I thought you know why don't we put in French they could say seem to be growing in popularity people were buying croissant and the like and I went to a local\nUm a to a company called old bump and it was a small just a local Boston chain like two or three located at that\nPoint where they had three locations and I became their license the for the ... square block around my little cookie she's looking at\nThe words you sold what their croissants\nI actually converted my store to where it had to logos it had the old bulls logo and had the cookie jar logo and you could get French baked goods that we baked um premise or you could get\nThe cookies in the afternoon and the thing started doing very well [laughter] um but um as an operator and I'm an operator up or is it got runs these businesses\nYou know which of your vendors are any good and which aren't and these folks at ... I was very clear to me they were out of control huh I Love their product the product was great but as a ...\nIt was they were disorganized they they sometimes they delivered sometimes they didn't sometimes they'd build me sometimes they did\nTo this day I'm sure I still own money they just didn't have the basic processes and disciplines and that's typical in many small businesses and I saw a powerful opportunity and I thought to myself wow I really could strengthen his business out I really could operate this so what ended up happening guy\nI became friends with the gentleman who was running the the three ... later became a partner bouquet who came and it was clear to to him and to me that ... was not going to be able to continue growing\nOr staying in business there and so I came to them and said look I think I can fix this\nYou give me sixty percent of the company you and your investors keep forty percent I'll put my cookies store which was making money in with your three open on pins and will create a new company and it was in that process that we created what became so\nSo once you did the deal with with Lou in an open pan what did you do like how did you even start\nWell I knew I knew how to fix their business I was committed to doing whatever it took to to get this thing off the ground so after we took over ... ... it was a mess\nYou know we didn't have a way we were making ... finished croissant we buy the spinach frozen we didn't have a way to to get rid of the water and somebody came up with the idea well let's let's buy\nA dozen dryers like hair dryers are no clubs drivers and we'll put this finishing the clothes dryer and um that will dissipate the water from from you know I was like well that was a great idea frozen spinach into clothes dryer than what we let it to for us for a guy\nBut we've put to frosted spit in an enclosed drivers um letting it run off the water was a great idea until one day we blew the top off the uh the drier and ended up with the spin engine in all three thousand square feet of the production I I used to love the spinach croissants at a ...\nYou didn't know how they were married did you pile but I could literally remember guy we didn't even have the ability to maintain our equipment and I would use my auto mechanic to help fix it 'cause I didn't know what else to call and we had a do divider\nThat was a centrally being held together with bailing wiring paper clips on a mechanic was trying to keep it going and we were using anger as the handling this do divider I was in a bakery it about three in the morning\nAnd all of a sudden you see sparks come off this do divider and this guy the the individual who was working the dough to fighter jumps like a deer that have been shot and he\nFalls on the ground like a rocket and a while and I and everybody else in the production or came running over to this guy\nAnd I can just remember thinking to myself", "show_name": "How I Built This", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "21"}
