businesses and the employees that helps them thrive ... verified dot Gov slash go [noise] and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nIt's how I built this from NPR's guy rise\nSo if you've recently walked to the energy bar section of the supermarket you might be surprised or\nRather overwhelmed by the number of choices I mean for starters there are hundreds of different types of energy bars which is kind of crazy if you think about their protein bars in paleo bars whole thirty and began a gluten free and cow\nAnd fused with macho powder\nThere is probably an energy bar out there for each and every one of us and that whole revolution it really got started in the Nineteen nineties with cliff bar and if you've heard previous episodes of the show you might've heard our interview with Gary Erickson who actually invented those clips bars\nWell in the early to thousands of Americans came up with a pretty simple concept that shockingly was really out there in the world it was an energy bar made from two or three ... like all men's or cash shoes\nAll down together with date ... may not seem like a big deal today right you can get them pretty much anywhere any seven eleven but back in the day they were kind of revolutionary and how she even came to inventing them to building this brand well there was no direct path\nLaura never intended to start our own business or even to sell a product she grew up in the Denver area\nHer parents ran a pretty successful high and clothing store and Laura was really into sports you was actually good enough to make the USC women's volleyball team ... but after she graduated from college with a degree in psychology and\nShe wasn't really sure what to do so she came back to Denver and got a job as a social worker and she started to work with kids and teenagers who needed help it was hard\nI mean just emotionally difficult job it was intense it was always chaotic um we were on call every six weeks I had to ... this is at a time where I had to carry a patriot around remember the patron days\nAnd if the pager went off at two in the morning because somebody ran away from our tree but the ... had to answer the phone call but it was it was intense work and to see you know\nFifteen year old girls for actually Thirteen year old girls with kids and I had to manage their care with the judicial system I went to court a lot I made recommendations it was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had in my life and I was in my early twenties how long did it take you before you got burned out and\nA year and a half a year and a half you're doing this and you just decide this is not this is not for me\nI I knew I needed to change what the landscape looked like so I wanted to help these kids but I wanted to do it in more of a recreational component I didn't want to feel like I was the police all the time [noise]\nAnd so I became a\nCommunity involvement leader and I got these kids involved in the community [noise] it was really fun I mean to this day I still think about these children and I wonder\nWhere they are what's happened what they're doing so during this time that I was being a social worker working as a social worker I was also cultivating this passion for natural foods I did that happen\nWell so let's go back to college college volleyball ours are coach had a rule of no sugar and no red meat\nSo at the time I was totally in the junk food I was Eighteen years old you know my favorite place to eat was any fast food restaurant you can name\nAnd then I opposite ... sugar and no red meat [noise]\nIt it was really an interesting experience so I start feeling better so that was the first light bulb went off for me\n[noise] so then I started thinking to myself in the background of going through this whole experience and feeling better I thought\nI don't know I Love natural foods to make such this is common sense to me why do people know about this why is it somebody teaching us about\nAnd so my passion started to build\nSo I I guess at a certain point in you stopped working with kids in in ... did you find another job or did you\nUh [noise] it's kind of start to just like you said think about what you had to what you want to do\nI knew I had an excitement and passion for natural foods I just didn't know how it was going to make a transition between\nBeing a social worker and natural foods I needed to find the courage to take a leap of faith and somehow some way I figured that out for myself and I left my marriage I left my job\nAnd decided I'm going to go back to school and I'm the study I Want to get into naturalistic\nMedical school and and that's like a like a natural homeopathic remedies and stuff yes so I'm On my path\nOf taking classes and I made a friend of mine who a dear friend of mine now one day eating to help local health food store eating lunch and he dragged me to this raw food class and I have one of the most amazing meals I've ever had in my life at this class and I thought\nFoods are kind of amazing and it just never had occurred to me and then I went back to Colorado over Memorial Day weekend to visit one of my dearest friends and um [noise] I went hiking and\nI was just kind of eating a trail mix and thinking of food and raw foods and thinking about moving to Seattle and all of a sudden I'm On this mountain in this life goes off for me and I think\nWhy isn't somebody made something of fruit and that's and spices like something very just\nPure simple real foods but it's portable inconvenient but it tastes indulgent like shouldn't be eating it like don't junk food I mean I don't know that day at that moment it was like\nThis surge of energy I got I could feel this excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason and bad day and that time and all those little experiences that built tough I I just felt and\nWhat you do did you like run home and and and and sort of like in writing things down or trying nature's or did you just kinda mulling over for all for a while\nSo I ran down the mountain I got a new book and I started writing\nDown ideas and then when we got back to Denver I\nThought how can I take fruit nuts and spices and the and turn them into something really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay how do I take cherry pie and make it just getting my quizzing are basically a raw raw and processed food\nAnd make it taste like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining it's going to do a lot of cooking and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nothing there and you're just gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like being like Dicky ball of a match", "show_name": "How I Built This", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "28"}
