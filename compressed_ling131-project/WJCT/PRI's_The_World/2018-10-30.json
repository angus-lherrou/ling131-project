schoolteacher about this because in the event of a of a real locked down at public schools would what a bad guy come for his class first because he was Jewish would they know do\nChildren process these types of events differently than adults do\nYeah and in a word yes they do children of course depending on a trait of\nChildren aren't able to understand that\nThings like this are statistically rare and while we're all scared as a country right now children and adults alike are scared about what's going on we're all having a really hard time processing this children\nAnd the younger the child to the harder the says to understand has no sense that\nThis statistically probably won't happen to me it feels very immediate it feels very scary and they don't have the tools to make sense of of what's gone on\nYou mentioned you said were all scared and I think um I think that's true for a lot of people and I'm assuming you mean just generally across the United states with what's happening today\nAs an adult how much of that of your own fears should you show your children or not show your children how honest should you be with your kids about your own concerns\nI think there's a fine line that we want to walk as as parents and I'm answering this as a parent first not as a as a teacher I think as a parent if we want our kids to understand that feeling scared sad confused\nIs a really healthy and normal reaction while walking that really fine line of it's okay to go to synagogue it's okay to go to Hebrew school it's okay to go to a grocery store and not worry about being killed not worry about violence\nAnd at the same time this happened unfortunately I don't believe that this violence is slowing down necessarily in today's political climate I think that the rhetoric the polarization Israeli amped up\nAnd so we want to let them know that they're safe that they're in a community that protects them that cares about them\nAnd they should take comfort in that and understand there are also procedures in place to help keep them safe\nYou talk about dropping off your kids at an emergency session of Hebrew school say after the massacre how helpful was that um and how helpful with the community response or for your kids to understand what had happened it was helpful\nIt was particularly helpful for my older son who was in middle school now and took comfort\nFrom the fact that he was with lots of other Jewish kids\nAt the same time that he was processing that they talked about the fact that they were community that they were safe that they were instituting lockdown and evacuation procedures both from the religious school classrooms and the synagogue building\nAnd he came out and reported that that was helpful\nHow do you\nTell children about something that's this random read it it's very pervasive but it's also very random it feels like you mentioned it could happen in a supermarket it could happen in a synagogue it could happen at a movie theater ...\n... ... what do you do with the randomness how do you help children understand that and also how do you help them not feel anxiety about this because I can tell you as adults I feel ... about it right\nYeah I think that what you just said is exactly it right this is not something that happens every day as a country we tune into this extraordinary gun violence we don't tune into everyday ordinary gun violence unfortunately we privilege gun violence when it is\nHuge and when it happens in a movie theater in a synagogue\nIn a supermarket and I think we need to amp down a little bit of of the rhetoric around that it is so scary and it does also so statistically small that it's going to happen to our children and I think we need to really help them understand that\nThat it is scary and also we're doing everything that we can to keep them safe I don't think we can promise them you're always going to be safe because unfortunately that's not the case in two thousand and Eighteen in America\nAnd that's a new reality I mean how is there a specific approach the parents should be thinking about I I was thinking about this segment there's a friend of mine who had a very extensive script for how he was going to think about talking to his children um what approaches do you think works best\nI think giving children the facts about what happened is really important I think kids are going to hear the fax anyway\nKids are going to hear about what went on in school and their classrooms on the playground on the bus in the lunchroom in the locker rooms have you with us today we can get away from it they're they're going to hear about what went on so I think we as parents we really need to talk to our kids about what's going on we need to give them the facts we need to give them space to\nQuestions we need to try to focus odd for kids especially kids that are nervous about this a plan how do we stay safe we stay safe by knowing our surroundings we stay safe by going to an adult if were nervous about something by if we see something say something I\nThink we also can empower children and and students by giving back\nIn other words having them contribute to ensure unity that have lost something\nAbsolutely and so that doesn't keep them safe but it does give them a sense of empowerment so something bad has happened something scary has happened and now I Am becoming a helper in X way and especially for younger children I think that's really empowering it gives them an action\nYeah it sounds like they Mr Rogers thing always look for the hollers look

America notes of an undocumented citizens burgers was born in the Philippines and has lived in the U. S. without papers since he was twelve\nVargas was part of a team of journalists who won a Pulitzer Prize at the Washington Post in two thousand date when he spoke with my colleague group of ... he began by describing the role Jewish Americans have played in his life story\nI got to this country and in the early nineties I I didn't really know anything about Jewish people and especially when it got to high school there was it was a family the Greenstein weighed family\nIt was the first time I'd ever had a Jewish friend but I didn't know what that meant either a in a friend was not only her name's Natalie weighed my classmate then I ended up meeting her mom Gail Gail ... reader and read his husband he lie\nAnd then they adopted me into their family and then when I got to the Washington Post I was assigned a professional mentor and his name\nPeter Pearl and he taught me the meaning of the word ... which I didn't know if that was\nAnd he was the first and only adult at the Washington Post that I told that I was illegally and he made a very crucial decision that basically saved my career to accept you coming out as undocumented yeah\nAnd I told them everything to fake papers you know everything I had to do to live my way into a job at the Washington Post\nAnd I expected him to report me today charge department\nInstead Peter said this is now or a shared problem don't tell anybody else just keep going [noise]\nYeah you describe in the book how you almost have to families why apart from your actual family and the family of partially Jewish and other people\nThey kind of helps you survive while being undocumented but then at home your family was frustrated with you for coming out is undocumented\nAnd you were getting these conflicting messages how did you navigate that\nWell I mean it was I think a lot of people who grew up in immigrant backgrounds can can relate to this because there's the there's the dynamic at home in a immigrant households that were told that we should watch too much\nAnd she put her head down don't make too much noise we're here to just work we're not here to be visible to be seen [noise]\nAnd yet I had this other family that was mostly for my high school ... high school and then Peter Pearl the Washington Post who just wanted me to succeed in all the waste could succeed you know it's like if I didn't have all those people in my life\nTo told me to keep going right that these immigration laws didn't make any sense at all I'm not sure I Would have allowed myself\nTo be courage and to kind of pursue what I wanted to do\nWell is that an important point to make that American citizens helped you survive and thrive in this country\nBecause when we talk about undocumented people like me in this country it's almost as if we exist like islands on torso ... when the reality is people like me in this country cannot be in this country\nWorking living surviving thriving without all those us citizens who help us out at every juncture at school at work at the church and yet when we talk about immigration special illegal immigration\nThe role of us citizens are are actually not much part of the conversation\nWe're looking at this quote unquote care than coming up from yeah Central America\nAnd the president saying we're not going to let them in and things like that one thing you did in your book is explain the history up into the point of your own name and how you ended up being part of the family that wanted to come to the states and how it was influenced by the west can you tell that story\nI think that when we explain why people move to America or why migrants are moving to Europe I think we have a very simplistic way of doing it in America which is what I Know people assumed that migrants know about the statue of liberty or the American dream\nI didn't know anything about that only knew was when I was a kid America was coke it was Nike it was spam it was the first she's kisses it was all the stuff that my grandparents in America who are natural as citizens you know set to the Philippines to my mother and I\nSo American Capitalism was there was was very presence since I was a kid McDonald's was their right\nAnd I think we don't kind of interrogate what American foreign policy and American economic policy in addition to the wars that we fight that we fought what those reasons have to do with why people move\nYou know I was I was in North Carolina a few years ago when I was doing this Tea Party that and I ended up saying that there are four million Filipinos in America where the third largest immigrant Mexicans Chinese and Filipinos\nAnd this man got up elderly white man and he said why there's so many of you here and I said well you know sir we are here because you were there to Spanish American war\nMy name is a product of Spanish colonialism will say I'm throwing your Vargas but hosts it doesn't have an accent and they eat because when the Americans to go over after the Spanish American war there typewriters did in ... so my name is a marriage of Spanish colonialism in American imperialism\nUm just to circle back to the beginning we started out talking about the people who helped you become online and go places where\nPeople wouldn't think you'd be able to go like the Washington Post newsroom and now we have this a synagogue that was attacked people who did help refugees\nI mean do you think people are still helping young people like you American citizens are still playing that role and do you think that's going to change\nAbsolutely they're helping I notice I noticed as they follow me on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and they sent me messages I Know this because\nIf it weren't for the generosity of all these people\nIncluding choose who know a lot about homeland and the search for home if it wasn't for that generosity I don't really know why the sky hasn't fallen\nYou know at a time like this I have to believe in love I have to believe in the generosity of people I have to believe\nThat we don't struggle alone I Would argue that after this horrific horrific\nTragedy I bet you that more people are going to be more willing to help\nJose

GBH here in Boston operation faithful patriot that is the name of the Pentagon has chosen for the deployment this week or more than five thousand troops to the U.S Mexico border a deployment order but President Trump just days ahead of the midterm elections\nThe president says the troops are needed to protect the country from an invasion of migrants she's referring to that group of thousands of migrants from Central America currently making its way north through Mexico the migrants by the way are still more than a thousand miles away from the U.S border and they're not expected to arrive there for weeks\nThe president's critics were dismissing the deployment as a political stunt ahead of the midterm so what practically can those troops do\n... is a reporter with the defense new side military dot com a dean of the defense department likes clear mission so what does the mission of these troops\nWhile the request actually came down from the department of homeland security and it sounds like we're going to be happening with these active duty for says is that they're going to be staying border patrol agents on the ground\nThat are going to have the military police unit will combat engineers and aviation support and medical personnel who kind of that at the border patrol agents I got to try to address this caravan it that makes its way toward the U.S border\nThe defense department has made clear of these troops will be carrying live ammunition what's the justification for the\n[noise] well apparently a secretary of defense Jim Mattis made that call and as long as the troops normally carry weapons they're authorized to do so on that particular mission\nNow it it doesn't sound likely that they're actually going to be coming face to face with any of these people it sounds more like they're going to be at the thing that border patrol agents and their mission and they'll actually be the ones on the front line so that's a little unclear\n[noise] so the president as commander in chief there is nothing legally to prevent him from doing this but once the troops go to the border what legal authority governs what there'll be able to actually do\nThey do face them legal restrictions as part of the past ... fact and that tape back to the Eighteen hundreds with basically limits troops from carrying out domestic\nPolicy is inside the you at now there are some there is some wiggle room and not on us northern command which department of homeland security has call to send these trips down to the border has some authority to partner with agencies like that when it comes to defending a U.S security interests from inside the U.S\nThey're already several hundred National Guard troops on the border so why did the president ask for more guards rather than going straight to regular forces\nThat wasn't really clearly addressed during yesterday's press conference and it's a good question uh there are as you mentioned about twenty two hundred I Believe National Guard troops along the border and they've been in place since early this spring\nAnd those trips are mostly unarmed and there are there are also assisting you know the customs and border patrol agents on on the border\nA President Trump in an interview with Fox News last night made an interesting comment that previous presidents have called up the national guard but he's actually called up the military and it's really one in the same you know there are a part of the military so it's a little unclear why I'm\nPresident Trump won active duty forces and play for National Guards men it it could be for um maybe a political deal with it\n[noise] ... the other thing is that critics have been saying is that the deployment is going to negatively impact training and readiness or what have you heard from your sources about the\nWell I think that is a definitely a concern you know when troops are in their home base is they are typically training and they're they're gearing up for a whatever deployment they're going to be carrying a net\nTaking them away from that mission and putting them on the border that take them away from you know not only training in the field but also some of the military education\nThat they need to carry out to further their careers and some of their other requirements so it is a fair point\nDo you know has any one of the Pentagon discuss how they selected the name of this operation faithful patriot because it doesn't sound totally random [laughter]\nI have not heard anything about how the name uh came came about\nJuno harkens with military dot com thanks very much thank you for having me\nThe midterms and immigration remain top of mind for President Trump less than a week from election day today though he made room on a schedule to travel to Pittsburgh in the wake of the attack on a synagogue there on Saturday his visit was controversial even before he landed the rabbi the tree of life synagogue welcome the president\nThere were also protest from some members of Pittsburgh Jewish community is that Trump was not welcome we also noticed that the reaction in Israel after the attack exposed them devise between Jewish communities there and here in the U. S. we ask Dina craft about this she's a reporter for the newspaper Haaretz and based in Tel Aviv\nReaction on the official level was where my condolences and shock but there was also a lot of ... ear going on I mean starting with the chief rabbi Israeli ... chief rabbi who ah refused to refer to the tree of life synagogue conservative synagogue in Pittsburgh and the tax as a synagogue\nYou said it had some sort of essence of Jewish character but he would not hold synagogue\nAnd ... why not call it a synagogue\nBut pretty ultra orthodox Jewish men which he represents in Israel conservative and reform Jews or or or reconstruction issues or any Jews are not Orthodox Jews are not really considered old Jews in their eyes [noise]\nSo what do you attribute some of these ten year reactions as he put it to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI think it's cynical politics and you have somebody like Naftali Bennett who's the diaspora administer a officially he's also former aide of nuts and Yahoo and now turned rival and uh he tries to always play to a base it's even more right wing the nuts and Yahoo\nAnd she should I Would argue no better but yet he's still found a way to compare the hand that shot down a lemon juice preying on a Saturday morning to the same forces that fire rockets from Gaza into Israel I ... which I think also shows like a disconnect incomplete and understanding of history\nYeah I mean not totally Bennett also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S a ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nOf the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and those ants of anti Semite so usually not neo Nazis on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's civil rights or whether it's on similar yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews would be no firm hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic these important till it was really due to the Trump support Israel into Trump's support the strong Israel so I'm ... comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDidn't tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nUm say overall although there has been expressions of condolence to the next person the shock of higher than the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nThat has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews and synagogue is a second home it's a place for kids grow up and Hebrew school\nOr they hide as I did like yo hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play kind of come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I put a share story I could do a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from where all hell and I'm One of the stories that move me most of the story of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "30"}
