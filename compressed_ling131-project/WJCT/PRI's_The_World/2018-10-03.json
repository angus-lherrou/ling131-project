{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Right well the first thing you really want to do is\nStart talking about why college is still beneficial maybe your kids have been hearing stories of indebtedness and they're frightened about the idea of even applying for college maybe they're worried about what effect will have on you as their parent do you think it's worth it it's so worth absolutely worth it I mean I was on a book tour\nI like to call it the ... effect because all these parents are like well he didn't finish college can't my kid not go and\nAnd the truth is and I looked into the research and studies show that those who graduated from college or in an average a million dollars more than people who don't go to college\nAnd no matter how you slice it even if you factor in you know student debt is still advantageous to go to college but you have to be careful to pick the right school and to pay for it in the right way and that's so difficult for so many parents because it's such a ridiculously complicated system so\nI was uh when I went to college undergrad I had partly paid for it through a scholarship ... and the rest of it was just me you know working around my parents weren't able to give me anything I'm sure there are people in that situation what do they do if their parents are like look it's just not\nFeasible right and I think more and more parents should feel comfortable saying look we're not gonna take on debt for your college you know and we we try to say but we don't have enough saved because it's really really expensive\nAnd I think that's a conversation that parents have to have with kids up front again because I mean I Know a lot of adults who have told me yeah I remember I applied to my dream school like I didn't and my parents told me at the very end we can't afford it and\nYou know it's better just to prepare up front\nBut I Do think as a family first of all parents can get a sense of what they might be asked to pay for college by looking at each college that their kids might be interested in them this is early like eighth grade ninth grade and just as if you've been looking that early yeah okay just to get a feel for what it'll cost of this thing called the net\nPrice calculators that give you a sense you have to fill out your income your assets all but you will get a sense of what the colleges will expect ... to pay I Wonder is it\nThat important too I mean I went to city and state school because that's what I could afford ... um it was very clear that if I had got and I still came out with a debt for my graduate degree so you know which took more than ten years to pay off regularly paying it off so I Wonder when young people say are people who are about to go to college say I want to go to this school\nRight and I keep thinking how are you going to pay for that exactly and I think\nThat's that's a really important thing to talk about like what is it about this school oh you really want a football team\nWell have you haven't seen a football game like you know just kind of really talking at three with kids I think sometimes parents feel somewhat guilty like oh I Want my kid to have this\nYou know this experience that they really want but they often don't know what they're talking about right so really going through the options and generally speaking you know if you can get\nA good education at a local school that is a wonderful opportunity and even starting at a two year community college I think these are the kind of conversation we have to have now because it can get so ridiculous expensive so quickly for not much of a good reason [noise] what\nAbout another option or two other options delaying starting college right yeah and or working during that time to save up your own money or working while you're in college or either of those options things that are on the\nTable right is honestly I think that you know I Know more kids are taking gaps years for a variety of reasons it makes me personally a little nervous because what if you get in the job and you're sort of sat on a track and you're like oh this is kind of fun to earning my own money and then you don't go back to school and again we know\nYou know people who graduate from college or in an average a million dollars more than those who don't but absolutely working in school we also know from research that kids who work here than\nAnd the hours a week in college on an on campus job they have slightly higher GPA's and kids who don't work at all so working and working in your summers that's a great time to really stashed away if you can get a job in your home and live with your parents and use that time I mean I think of all this\nYou know jobs I had over the summer and here and you you try to save as much as you can um and I think that that's so important to have these conversations now so there's no horrible surprises down the road but I think that you know look\nI think that the vast majority of people get financial aid I think the farms are enjoying the process is annoying it is sort of this black hole you don't know what's gonna happen\nBut still you want to fill out the FAFSA prepare up is that in advance and have the conversations up front so that you can get a better sense of where you're going it's not a perfect process but I tried and let's talk college to\nCome up with ways for people to figure out you know how do you have these conversations how do you apply to schools how do you pay for it and how do you choose\n[noise] best thanks again for joining us and

loans\nPrefer just the subsidized possible of course they don't want to hear how I graduated in Nineteen eighty four was three thousand two hundred dollars in loans and pay for the rest but working in the summer this is not possible now\nMy name is Maureen Kingsley and I'm calling from El Segundo California my twelve and a nine year old kids already know that if they go to college the expectation is that they will do work study and found kind to help pay for it we also watch their five twenty nine pro albeit slowly\nAnd talk about scholarship\nAnd actually pretty panicked about how on earth will afford college but I Try not to let the kids see that\nMy name is Mary I'm calling from Westchester we started planning for college for our children when they were\nBorn and it was very challenging at times and many times throughout their lives when we opted to go on vacation we would explain to our kids that we did it so that they would eventually college money now we have a college

reach millions and millions of people say that\nThe world whether you're a mental leader thanks very much thank you\n\nThe courses through all of us and you know people on this planet blood is also the center of our next two stories about tainted blood\nIn the u._k. there was a scandal that began in the seventies and eighties back then a new treatment became available for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders and the treatment involved blood clotting products made from donated plasma\nBut demand was so high that Britain had to import ... from the United states than included plasma from high risk donors would sold their blood in the U.S\nThe time there was no process to heat treat donated blood to kill any viruses\nThousands of people with him a failure and other bleeding disorders were infected with HIV and hepatitis nearly three thousand three thousand of them later died but it was only last week that the British Government held a public hearing on the scandal\nJason Evans was there his father died in Nineteen Ninety three after contracting hepatitis C and D HIV from contaminated treatments Jason Evans is now an advocate for victims of this scandal Evans has long push for a government inquiry he says blood donations used for those clotting treatments in the seventies and eighties was not properly screened\nThese donations coming from prisons from cosmic collection centers in Skid Row locations where you would have all the drug use in the sun is a higher risk\nDonors I'm being paid full that donation so when you take that higher risk Darnah and you multiply that by ten thousand people and place it\nInto a ball so the risk of infection to the recipient of those products was actually one hundred percent for hepatitis C and also a very high so hate choice the when it began to break out in the early eighties as well\nYou were personally affected by this uh with the death of your father does how you became a campaigner\nMolly journey into campaigning in research really began in twenty Fifteen when a there was an inquiry in Scotland when\nThe Enquirer reported it basically set that I was told that could or should have been done differently and\nPersonally when I got involved I become a journey with one goal in mind and that was\nTo take this line of list who could or should have been done differently that came out Scotland 'em to turn that into an official wreck court that said though was a lot that could and should have been done differently and that this\nEvent was actually completely avoid ... had the pharmaceutical companies\nFocused on making products safe\nBefore they focused on making cash\nThing that is what we will put on the record out of this inquiry and that's what people want they want the truth first and foremost\nJason Evans or an advocate for victims of contaminated blood scandal in Britain that dates back to the Nineteen seventies and eighties a much larger scandal also involving contaminated blood unfolded in the Nineteen nineties in China\nFor American journalist Kathleen McLaughlin that crisis was personal she documents at all for the guardian enter story my career as an international blood smuggler\nKathleen McLaughlin joins us now you went to China as a journalist in two thousand four but you've got a nerve disease that requires periodic infusions um I Hope I'm portraying that accurately ... what did you see what your options to take care of yourself\n[noise] [noise] well to be honest you weren't can't accurately and to be honest I didn't really think about it in the beginning um I knew that China had a blood borne AIDS crisis I knew that it had something to do with class not um but I was also I think a tiny bit in denial\nOn and I thought well I'll never get\nSick right when I'm there and I did almost immediately so in the beginning it kind of started out as well I Can't get it in the U.S because I have health insurance there that will cover at my insurance in China might not cover it and then I started digging into more\nThe story of what had happened in China's plasma banks and then I knew right away that there was no chance that I could ever use Chinese made plasma products\nIf it was so dangerous in China in terms of blood why did you go\n[laughter]\nBut it's a really good question and I don't know I mean I was extremely interested in China as journalists um I also think there\nPart of me that wanted\nTo explore the story because it was a story that was part of my life um played it was also so I I Believe\nThat time it was so completely different to my own experience in the U.S and how I found it intriguing and I found it interesting that China at that time was a place where I could kind of create my own medical bubble where I can bring this up then\nI can bring it to a hospital and they would infuse it for me but I ... I mean I Would say starting right away I started reporting different elements of the story about the AIDS crisis and health care in\nChina and drugs and counter drugs and it's all tied together\nAnd so sensitive story or to the Chinese government any way that you're only telling it fully know\nSo give us a little bit of background on China's bought scandal it's got some similarities with a blood scandal in the u._k. we just reported on so it's the early nineties China's opening up pretty fast the capitalism and blood especially for poor country people in China became a way to make money in this new economy take the story from there if you would\nStart so in the in the beginning has capitalism\nEach local place each local government kind of looked around for what was the most abundant natural resource and in ... and that just happens to be people with less populated province in China and also one of the poorest\nSo someone and we still don't really know who got this idea that they could create what they called a plasma economy where they were paying farmers who never got paid for anything farmers have nominal income and with mostly subsistence living for farmers are they could pay them a small amount for their\nBlood and blood plasma and that everyone would get rich and the process now a lot of farmers did get rich but pretty quickly into the system I'm HIV entered the plasma pool and because the system is so ramped up and moving so quickly\nThey were using to bang ... needles they were often times in five minutes donation you re inject the donor where the red blood cells\nAnd in some cases they were actually injecting healthy people with tainted blood cells and how it was almost a perfect storm away to read a blood borne virus through\nA donor pool on according to one she paying the doctor who actually discovered H ... in the plasma her that she warned provincial officials she won central government officials in Beijing that HIV was in the system and people were getting infected\nAnd in spite of all that it took three months to officially shut down the system so there was this\nPeriod I mean you can kind of argue about what the government knew when but there is a period of three months before the government closed down all of the officially sanctioned plasma stations in ... where they absolutely knew what was happening and let it continue so it's a\nYeah it's similar to what happened in the u._k. and we had our own problems in the U.S I mean there has to do with uh yeah it would there have been tainted blood scandal all around the world um and it's a\nIt's kind of revealing look at how governments respond when these things do happen in China's response has been to shut it down and cover it up quickly could which in public health crisis is the last thing you want to do\nJournalist Kathleen McLaughlin wrote my career as an international blood smuggler for\nThe guardian thanks very much for being with us and thought Marco\nOr\nOn the radio and at the world dot O.

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston\nWe've been hearing a lot lately about tensions between China and the U.S there is a trade war going on right now after all but earlier this week things got more serious\nNavy ships from China and the U.S had a near collision in the south China Sea and American destroyer was cruising past the disputed spradley islands when a Chinese warship forced to ship to change course\nAnd it was not an isolated event\nThe U.S military routinely patrols in the south China Sea and China routinely accuses the U. S. of violating is territorial sovereignty the world's Matthew belt looks at what's behind all of that\nChina says most of the south China Sea something like Ninety percent of it belongs to China\nBut the U.S doesn't recognize those claims and neither do China's neighbors Brunei Malaysia the Philippines Taiwan and Vietnam all have their own claims over parts of these resource rich waters that's what you need to know to make sense of incidents like this\nAround I don't want to raise\nThat warning from the Chinese military to an American navy plane earlier this year telling us crew to leave immediately here's the response\nTo ladle aircraft or activity on the national air right here in la operating with regard to the right on\nA BBC News team was on that flight and the pilot told them this sort of stand off in the air happens all the time it happens on the water to on Sunday it was the USS Decatur a navy destroyer and the Chinese warship according to the American military the two ships came close to colliding\nThe U.S navy was conducting what's called a freedom of navigation operation that's a mission to underscore that the south China Sea is an international waterway not Chinese sovereign territory\nWhat the United States is upholding the principal and it's a global principle international principle of feeding the navigation\nElizabeth Economy is the author of the third revolution Xi Jinping and the new Chinese state she says the Trump Administration is doing the right thing by ramping up these operations in the south China Sea and it's not acting alone\nThis is not simply an issue between the United states and China\nIt is an issue of international law the u._k. and France Japan are all undertaking similar feeding the navigation operations in the south China Sea and again these are disputed areas and territory that the international court has ruled that China's sovereignty and did not extend hear\nThe dispute is about resources fishing rights offshore oil drilling rights but this is also one of the busiest international shipping lanes in the world and the U.S navy has been sailing through the south China Sea for decades\nWhat has changed in recent years is that China has built artificial islands there and put military outposts on them a Chinese foreign ministry statement this week warned the U.S against taking further provocative actions to avoid undermining China us relations and regional peace and stability\nStill Josh you dawn of the China Institute for International Studies says there are many areas where the U.S and China can and should be working together\nFaith not China's impatient you know the challenge\nOr ... even you know it's a challenge and they exist in international order wagging the same boat which showed a role in the same direction that is what you call parade\nWhich had to lie all gold steam could not agree more he's at the U.S Naval War college and the author of meeting China half way\nI Do think we're in danger here of missing the forest for the trees in U.S China relations are so many other issues that really need careful attention I mean let me just mention North Korea quickly but I think the U.S China cooperation very badly needed on North Korea and I'm\nQuite concerned that all this focus on the south China Sea tends to take away from serious kind of cooperation negotiations I needed on other issues like North Korea\nGold steam points to an immediate crisis where the U.S and China could be working together and that's the aftermath of the recent sue nominee in Indonesia\nI Would like to see the Chinese Navy in the U.S navy\nIn a kind of crisis response mode where both navies are are quickly I'm moving forces into the area where they can render aid hopefully side by side and cooperation that's the kind of security architecture that I Would like to see in the western Pacific that could really deal with real problems not ...\nYou know about Roxanne reefs and you know various legal lipstick definitions of different zones but really helping people who are in need today for its part the Trump Administration appears prepared to stick with a confrontational approach to China especially on trade\nA White House official speaking at the Chinese embassy in Washington last month said\nFor us competition is not a four letter word\nFor the world I'm Matthew bell\nSo we all remember our civics classes in junior high school writes\nIf it hasn't been hammered into a slightly let me remind you Supreme Court appointments are for life supposedly\nTo prevent political interference if you're a justice and you're not worried about being fired or getting reelected you're free to rule on the legal merits even if it's unpopular all good points of course but as we've seen with the cabinet nominations the appointment process can still become a political mess\nSo what happens everywhere else in the world ... Smith is a senior research fellow at fickle that the British Institute of international and comparative law so you're in London young let's start there and of course America's judicial system evolved out of the English system briefly tell us about the origins of lifetime tenure for judges over there\n[noise] yes well this is a country which had its battles or apartment of judges and they're mostly happened a long time ago so the English civil war of the seventeenth century\nWas the midpoint of a century of struggles and at that point the judges served at the pleasure of the king so that can could dismiss them at any time so when parliament became more powerful\nIt's pasta framework in Seventeen hundred and in that act of settlement it provided that they can't could no longer dismiss them interestingly it led to simulate change in the U.S at the time of independence\nLet me just clarify their of so basically the judicial system in England evolved for the same reason we kind of say here to prevent the monarch bullying judges\nYes that's a great way of putting it on there was some brave judges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail or just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents of the king when that hadn't commit a crime that\nType of behavior which was driven by their sheer dismissal one could say looking at the big picture\nAnd today in England or those lifetime appointments still the situation\nSuddenly enough not serve lifetime appointment was the main safeguard for nearly three hundred years but in the Nineteen eighties it was realized that\nAs more judges were reaching advanced age that I'm a ... ... ... and that's one of the most famous English Czechoslovakian and the leading judge of the ... century started expressing some very a socially conservative views and books he was writing\nAnd the feeling was that if judges were going to do this at MIT hunt edge they could bring the reputation of the courts into district periods so every time and age was introduced it currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa have they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "03"}
