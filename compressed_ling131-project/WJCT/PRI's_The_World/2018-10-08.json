{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "And he's really struck me because it's part of this whole myth that there was a right way even though you know back when he bought it was the right way on what happened was there was a potato famine and Irish people showed up in this country there was no border patrol there was no green card there was no peace process right they showed up\nThat's where this question of who gets to be home and it was to belong and how we define American is really fundamental into the kind of understanding our own history\nJulie so what about you who who does get to have access in this country who gets a sense of ownership and belonging and the United states\n[noise] yeah so you know it's an interesting question for me because when I first came to the u._s. I went to Texas San Antonio Texas and and learning the his taxes I saw this quote recently that set the Americans have taken possession\nOf practically all of the eastern part of Texas in most cases without the permission of the authorities\nAnd growing up in Texas and learning about the history of Texas is was there was this real sense of\nPride that Texas had gained independence from Mexico and now as an adult learning it not from the history books but learning it through much broader lens\nI learned so many new things for example that even though there was a sense of pride about taking over a without the permission and calling a place home because you felt a sense of belonging that place\nTo me that's what it means to belong to find a home and frankly I felt American before I had a U.S passport that set that I was\nOh they tell us a little bit you you have a a new book out what are you sharing with the American public that's new\nAbout your story well you know I publicly came out as an documented more than seven years ago and the book for me really started to say we don't really want to write it I I I resisted writing this for years I figured I'd already come out of the New York times more than seven years ago I told my story you know I Need to do this\nAnd then the election of Trump happen and I was living in LA also the downtown LA and the building manager of the apartment I was living in a texted me about a month after the election and said hey I'm not sure if we can protect us ice showed up\nIn the apartment building\nOn it may be best for you and for us if you you know found another place and so that I'm really thinking about what's home and then for a while actually really contemplated moving to Canada\nAt that point had been in this country for twenty three twenty four years and undocumented undocumented yeah I I I have not adjusted miss out is um just there's no way there's no line\nAnd even marriage even those same sex marriage I'm gay even those same sex marriage is legal now because I had come out seven years ago against the advice of lawyers who said that the moment you come out and say what you're going to say we can't help you there is no way right\nSo I had to really think about home so then this book kind of gave birth and the fact that\nI'd be spending more than two decades in my life living in this country lying passing in hiding\nYou kind of gave me license to write about myself in a way\nIt's way more personal that I had intended but also in a way that speaks to the larger experience of what this feels like it's just what the American public doesn't know what this feels like the most part\nI I Would have to agree and Julie so what about your thoughts on that and what is it that the American public still doesn't get about what it is like to be undocumented in the United states\nI think that the number one question that I get is why were you undocumented for fourteen years why why didn't you apply sooner why you get in the back line and I think what people don't understand is that that line that we often talk it out it's really a mythical\nBased that doesn't exist there isn't the line you know I I was able to adjust my status because I got married from a more emotional standpoint I didn't realize and I didn't understand what it meant to be undocumented at each fourteenth which is when I found out I was undocumented and\nIt was days is not meaning to sleep and and days of not being able to think of anything else other than my immigration status since ... and so it does take a very big emotional toll on you we have an incredibly resilient spirit which makes it possible for us to be in this country\nFor such a long time being able to have lives despite being undocumented\nAnd I guess I Would ask you both um to close the segment how do you define this idea of home is home the place that you came from um is it the place that you end up in is it defined by the people you surround yourself with what is home [noise]\nIt wasn't until I when I was writing this book when I got arrested in Texas four years ago back in the Obama era when people weren't as angry as the were the past few months because of the kids that were locking up in cages in South Texas I was sharing jail cell would would boys ages five to about fourteen and I convinced myself\nThat to be in this country from age twelve to adopt point thirty three that I have to um being here\nAnd it wasn't until I was in that job so that I actually concluded that home wasn't something I had to Oregon I actually have a right to have a home\nIn the same way that migration is a natural human rights it's why this country was founded right so home is not something you have to earn and home is the people that I surround myself with the people who make me feel at home who defined what home ins and at this moment who defines what American is for people\nAnd Julie ... what about for you yeah I used to think that as soon as I became an American citizen I could officially call American my home\nAnd I realized that I didn't need a passport to call America home because even now that I Do have a task for people still want me to get started and\nAnd they don't think that I I'm good enough to be an American citizen and people are so tell me to go back to where I came from and I realized that the lifeless struggle of an immigrant is wanting to be two places at once went on in Mexico\nI feel like I'm at home and when I'm hearing in Los Angeles that with my husband and my two cats I feel at home and I stopped thinking of being an immigrant as\nSomething that is less than something that is more than because how beautifully said that I get to call so many different places my home\n... is author of someone like me how one

Interpol it's an organization that gets easily associated with crime and intrigue solving crime mysteries is their job after a while but now the chief of Interpol is smack dab in the middle of a mystery himself\n... way is his name and his wife live in ... in France that's where Interpol headquarters are located and last week ... wife grace reported to the French police among had just disappeared vanish while traveling in China\nThe latest is this ... who's also a Chinese security officials seems to be the target of an anti corruption crackdown\nThe Chinese Communist party said yesterday that it had detained him on suspicion of violating the law\nEdward wrong has been covering this for the New York times I asked him if the charges are legitimate or more of a political move by Chinese President Xi Jinping\nAt St Clair there's since she took power in twenty twelve to anti corruption campaign touched on all aspects of the party and some of the people that have been taken down our political rivals has and some are people who are genuinely guilty of corruption but so many officials\nWithin the party system um so it's unclear right now why they've targeted Mr among\nSo you you wrote in the New York times that quote the detention of Mr mom is an audacious step by the party even by the standards of the increasingly authoritarian system under the leadership of president Xi Jinping those are pretty strong words can you just put this move this detention by the Chinese government in context for us and in the frame of this anti corruption a\nBattle sure I'm there have been very senior officials who have been taken down and have been detained or and then eventually in prison for life under this campaign and bill and other political purge that she has been carrying out but there hasn't been an official that has helped such a high position with the international organization\nWho has been taken down China's been trying to gain legitimacy in the world stage four years out and it seeks to hold high positions in world organizations whether it's in our poll or the world Trade Organization or the IMF\nFor them to do this to pull this person put them in detention not be clear about the reasons why did this this is in my view it's a huge blow to sort of like the quest for legitimacy on the world stage I China is undertaking yes so\nWhat does this situation I mean for any recognition that trying to gotten through amongst position that in trouble\nI think I'll be set back I think that organizations will question what might happen if they decide to put a senior Chinese official in\nThese positions are in power um there's no telling what the party might do and there's no transparency about their process or any sort of legal process or ... or a process that they undertake so I think people will have second thoughts about this\nInterestingly a few hours after the Chinese Communist party announced that had Dr among in custody Interpol than announced that he had resigned as their chief what do you make of that\nI think that the Communist Party and at the anti corruption agency specifically must have put pressure on Mr among to issue resignation letter to Interpol\nAnd Dr among was also vice minister and the Chinese ministry of public security does he still hold that role\nWhat usually happens he investigations is at this anti corruption agency announced or the Chinese and in that it out so I don't think that they stripped him of his party membership of official titles and of its political rights\nAnd what what are you hearing among experts and trying to watch or do they believe Dr among isn't any danger\nIt depends on how you defined danger or he\nProbably is at risk of imprisonment once they start this type of investigation it usually becomes very serious especially if they made an announcement of very explicit announcement about him\nPossibly violating the law so ah we're looking at some sort of prison time for him because once they move it to the criminal process in a court will almost certainly find him guilty and send them to present it could be prison for life depending on the circumstances\nI'm I'm sure is that what what can you tell us about what Chinese think about Xi Jinping's crack down I mean the sensibly it's anti corruption but do many Chinese see it that way\nYou know Chinese can be fairly skeptical about people in power so that can play both ways one they're skeptical about local officials and they really believe local fishes or crops so they think that any crackdown done by Beijing has a good thing\nBut also they can be very skeptical about the motivations behind such crack down so I think that Chinese can see both ways but in general because they see\nA local officials as being corrupt in many places around China then he welcome to crack down like this\nEdward won diplomatic corresponded with a New York times very much tax\nWaiting to see now whether among faces trial in China in Spain a verdict today in a case that's grab people's attention there for a long time the defendant an eighty five year old gynecologist he's charged with stealing babies from New mothers during the dictatorship of general Francisco Franco\nThis one case though is part of a much wider scandal that involve thousands of babies stolen from left wing opponents of Franco's regime and given to conservative couples for adoption\nThe BBC's Lucy Williamson is in Madrid where the verdict was announced\nThis story that began in Nineteen sixty nine when a woman called in is not to

mother told the truth and she has been investigating campaigning to try and get up to their that pulled brought to trial that will happen today we had to take in the trial of ... and he was found guilty\nOf all the time she was charged with an related to him is but in a twist he was also able to walk free because the court ruled that the statute of limitations didn't allow them to put him in jail\nThe woman at the heart of the lawsuit in Madrid go says she will appeal but ... also says she feels some measure of justice already even if the doctor who stole her from her parents was allowed to walk free today\nI mean the main thing is I don't mind that he's not going to jail that's not the most important thing it'll be very difficult thing to leave the house because everyone move recognizing everyone will know what he did say to me he can get in any way but I'm you know\nDr ... is the first person to go to trial for illegal adoptions under Franco dictatorship reaction was mixed today from people whose families were affected again here's my BBC colleague Lucy Williams and\nThere were lots of mothers outside the court today who they themselves believe that ah that you bring babies were taken in a similar way and the campaign is saying that that may be thousands tens of thousands even as children who were taken in the same way as in his state reading their reaction that was that was happiness that this had\nHappened to told somebody had been found guilty as a crime like this has been a very long journey to try and get any official recognition but of course the fact that he was able to walk free um was was a source of of distress one mother said it's like being slapped in the face\nThe BBC's Lucy Williams in reporting there from Madrid [noise]\nComing up un

they find it much more difficult to tolerate dissent from as Saudi national down\nHere and criticism let's say from the American media the fact that your mom I suppose we had a lot of influence in Saudi Arabia and you had at one point six million followers on Twitter\nHe is very wet respected boats are in the middle east as well as in western circles and in Washington and so his criticism hurts
