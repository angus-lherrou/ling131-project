could go to community based on density based on need how does that work\nCorrect I mean it's based you know that this is you know whether they build a school whether a business decides to open up a new store and in an area based on how many people live there you know whether they put a post office there I mean there's a lot of money that's spent in areas that based on the latest census numbers\nDoesn't back in July there was a federal district judge Jessie from and who will allow the lawsuit to proceed against the department of justice which is why did he allow it to go to trial there are actually six\nLaw suits that were filed after this decision was made in March challenging question\nAnd this lawsuit is the first to go to trial and it is is Eighteen states in several US cities and other organizations including the conference of mayors\nAnd the reason is he allowed it to go to trial and among other reasons but but what happened this summer was that some documents came to light and the discovery for this lawsuit showing that the reasons that the government had stated for why they were adding the question\nDid not line up with internal emails that that came to light\nThe lead up to the twenty twenty census before a President Trump took over there were lots of questions about questions like how do we define Latinos and whether or not there should be an Arab question on the census but what was the specific concerned about the citizenship question that came to light that allowed this judge to uh to uh let this go to trial\nThe specific concern was that during the spring when there was a question about whether this would be added and secretary Ross had not yet made his decision he was testifying before Congress and he said that\nThis did not come from him this was just him responding to a request from the department of justice to add the question so that they could better enforce the voting rights act\nAnd then later these documents show that actually\nHe had been in discussions months earlier than that with people like Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach Kansas who is is it you know kind of has had a hard line against immigration\nTalking about the addition of a question like this and talking about how to get the department of justice to request it so it's sort of the reverse of what he testified to Congress\nAnd I'm Wondering there are five other legal challenges that have been mounted against the citizenship question what are they and where do they stand\nThere are six lawsuits total and they've all been consolidated into three now two there's one in California there's one in Maryland and then there's one in New York which is this big one that we are talking about so this is the first one to go forward and there'd been a lot of challenges from the government\nDuring the discovery for this one up until this past week where the government has challenged the deposition are questioning of the commerce secretary which this judge in New York had said go ahead last week\nThe Supreme Court put a stay a temporary stay on his deposition and for the moment he is not being questioned in advance of the trial although they have not made their final decision on\nIf this lawsuit does make it to trial you just mentioned the Supreme Court temporarily blocking an order that called for Wilbur Ross to be ... for his deposition um if this makes it to the Supreme Court how likely do you think it is that the court would rule against the Trump Administration\nUnclear on the order last week was an sign so it was hard to see kind of where the justices were falling on either side and some interesting news did come to light however at the end of last week this\nIn court did allow John Gore who was the acting assistant attorney general\nEarlier you know during during all this discussion did allow his position on friday and as NPR reported he said during this deposition that a U.S attorney Jeff Sessions had actually\nBlocked a discussion that the census bureau's acting director had requested to set up a meeting with the Justice Department to find out\nYou know what they wanted and and talk about a better method for gathering citizenship information and basically he testified that sessions had personally made the decision to direct the deejay not to even meet with the Census Bureau to discuss alternative approaches so that's sort of a bombshell\nTara ... poor is a Washington Post reporter focusing on aging generations and demography thanks for being with us thanks so much for having me [noise]

about where to go\nWith the rhetoric from the president and the reception as some of his tweets are getting with people like the alleged attacker in Pittsburgh as well as the alleged bomb maker last week where do you sit in the middle of all this rhetoric and how do you deal with it\nSo I think the only way that we deal with it is to stand up to it I think that we believe learn at a time and time again and particularly this weekend is that heat speech can lead to hate action and violence and we can't give it a pass any more\nThat's really are only weapon we need to stand up and fight against hate and make sure we don't do any of it a pass anymore because the consequences can be so\n... ... the senior vice president for public affairs highest thank you very much for your time today really appreciate it\nThank you very much will Carlos covers extremism for reveal from the center for investigative reporting he's based in Brazil where there is another big story today the election of far right candidate ... narrow as president more on that later\nFirst I asked well how the Pittsburgh synagogue attack fits in with his reporting on extremism in America\nObviously it's a particularly violent episode I mean we do see\nAnti Semitism really ramping up over the last couple of years really you know following the election of president Donald Trump you see awful amounts of anti Semitism on social media or on on right wing social media but also a mainstream social media like Facebook and Twitter\nAnd so you know it's not too surprising I mean this isn't the first guy to walk into a synagogue or a Jewish center and start shooting people and Saturday I don't think that he'll be the last but the scale of this attack was west than anything we've seen at least in recent years\n[noise] I I Know it can be difficult to connect violence to political rhetoric but looking at events like the mail bombs last week in the synagogue shooting to what extent can you make that link because we've got to remember Dylann Roof went into a Charleston South Carolina church and killed people there before the election of Trump\n[noise] yeah I you know I don't find it difficult to make that link at all I mean you've got president Donald Trump re tweeting and spreading\nCompletely full anti Semitic theories about George Soros the Hungarian Jewish multi billionaire saying he's you know funding everything from the caravan of migrants who's making their way to the southern border to protesters and you know that trickles down that trickles down we see\nFor example the Pittsburgh she took on his gaps social media accounts\nIn the days leading up to the shooting was posting about George Soros\nOf Trump mega fan Santa pipe bomb allegedly to George Soros is home so\nI think there are clear connections and I think the media just needs to stop don't sing around this subject and just lay it out very clearly the president is spreading malicious rumors and that is trickling down to his fan base and people are going out and killing people it's as simple as that\n[noise] so you mentioned the social media site gab and we've heard a lot about it since the shooting in Pittsburgh and tell us more about gab what are you know\nThat basically an old right twist to I mean that's the way to think about them\nNow they're ... they're all about free speech and the reality is\nThat it's a collection of neo Nazis racist anti Semite people who like to get on and spread most the fake known since about Jews about people of color and I mean I think most people would be absolutely a poll by most of the content on there\nI mean they've been shut down but one of the people who go to gab want they just go somewhere else to find a like minded community\n[noise] [noise] yeah this is a tricky debate has been going on for some time now you know to what extent is it ... to deep platform these guys to shut down that places of congregation\nBut I mean I kind of think that that misses the point I mean ultimately the people who hosts gab their private company run by individuals like you and me but if they don't want to hurt\nPeople who are spreading hateful stuff then that's their prerogative these guys are not being sent said it's not as if a government forty or entity is coming in and saying hey you guys can't spread your message they'll find someone else to hurt them I think we just have\nTo acknowledge that every time a Republican congressmen you know read tweets a conspiracy theory they make these people feel\nAs if they're legitimate as if they're saying is true and that's something that five years ago didn't really exist you know these people lived on the fringes\nAnd were treated as out cause and today that being legitimize by mainstream politicians\nAnd in some cases by the president himself\nWell let's turn to Brazil now I mean you've got an interesting perspective on extremism covering hate us and living in Brazil especially now that there's been a selection yesterday but lead to a victory for populous right wing candidate drier above narrow what parallels do you see between ... and Donald Trump\nI actually think that the parallels has been overblown because I think Dr Laura makes Donald Trump looked like Mr Rogers he says openly homophobic things he once said that he would rather his son would dead than gay\nI mean he's told a female congresswoman on the floor of the national Congress that he didn't think she was with raping because she was basically not attractive enough for him\nI mean this is a guy who is very open about his hateful speech and it was also we've seen added fuel to the far of racism and ... and and especially anti journalism violence in Brazil over the last few months a Brazilian investigative journalism organization has tracked at least fifty\nHate few crimes committed by ... and our support is across the country\nThere's certainly political violence connected to ...\n[noise] so what is the mood like in Brazil or this day after the election they're\nHonestly the mood is pretty jubilant I mean especially in the neighborhood that I live in Brazil like America is very divided right now you've got the north west and to some extent the north east of Brazil to sort of more rural areas\nThat really didn't support ... came out in favor of the people's party and then you've got the southeast Web most Brazilians live and megacities like Rio and some Powell\nAnd they heavily supported ... the crowd outside ... house last night had I Would say equal numbers of African presidents and white present day and\nAge surprises a lot of people who don't fully understand the political dynamics hit me included you know I mean I'm not personally and\nI look at some of the things that ... said and I think you know how can I represent in support him how can write the algae Beatty community support him but if you talk to those people basically what it is is that other

crime all the ... neighbor who's which are also disproportionately afro Brazilians\nAnd these are the people who desperately want their lives to become safe or and that's what\n... is promising them and people by that and it sort of over rules any other considerations they have\nMost of the Brazilians that I speak to this either ... apathy there are just so completely given up on the present and

filed last week against Exxon Mobil alleges they defrauded shareholders by downplaying the climate change threat to its bottom line\nJeff Colgan is a professor at Brown university who specializes in energy and environmental policy what exactly is Exxon Mobil being accused of Jeff well\nThey're specifically being accused of deceiving the investors in the center which climate change might hurt the profitability of ... but of course that's related to a larger story about how\nExxon Mobil public relations campaign have deceived the public about climate change\nA Exxon Mobil was instrumental in some of the campaigns led by the American Petroleum Institute which is the kind of industry lobby group\nIn the Nineteen Ninety that set a specific goals to try to um get the public to recognize uncertainty to the climate change as it on certain issue where there wasn't clarity around\nThe science of it and that was very much inconsistent with what Exxon Mobil own scientists were saying where there are saying look the science settled and we understand the climate changes coming at it caused by humans\nWhat what is Exxon Mobil been saying in his defense\nWell a ExxonMobil has\nChanged its tunes overtime or when the c._e._o. with Lee Raymond in two thousand\nHe was very much opposed to the idea of global warming impact even said publicly that he feared a coming ice age more than he feared catastrophic for me so he had a really kind of tough lied on climate change since then\nThings have changed so when Rex Tillerson who later became secretary of state when Tillerson became the c._e._o. the Exxon Mobil changed its tune and they started to\nWithdraw funding from the groups that had been deny the science of climate change that Exxon had been funding in the Nineteen Ninety One early to pass\nPresumably this lawsuit focuses on those earlier days is there a smoking gun like a memo where higher ups of the company said at one point look this is this is our plan\nAll that interesting because the New York attorney general has been requesting internal documents and we don't know what all of those documents say by the deputy attorney general has said exactly those words that you just said smoking guns plural so we don't know what the heck that that is\nBut it sounds like the prosecutors are\nConfident that ExxonMobil did deceive shareholders\nSo Exxon Mobil is all over the globe is this the New York attorney general's office acting alone or have they been hearing from interested parties all over the globe\nThe New York state attorney general is of course very powerful because the New York stock exchange is governed by New York state law and so other parties have been weighing including other eight and presumably other countries are going to be watching this case closely\nJeff Colgan professor at Brown University Thanks very much for your time thank you\nDespite what Exxon might have suggested the big picture science of climate change has been clear for years carbon dioxide and other kinds of pollution from human activity helped trap more heat in the atmosphere that warms up the planet\nThere is uncertainty though about some of the details things like how all that warming is affecting the natural systems of the earth\nPermafrost for example the freezer of the planet\nAnd you know what it's like when you leave your freezer door open for a while the Arctic is a freezer we're looking at the world is focusing on the Arctic and climate change in a bunch of stories produced with the podcast threshold and its host Amy Martin today Amy heads to

Jenny Golding trade off doing the rolling their masters students at Stockholm University and they're studying Arctic permafrost soil that's been frozen all year round for at least two years\nThey're
