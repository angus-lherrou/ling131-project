{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Tell my personal story of of why I go to the DNC when I noticed that there were a lot of systemic issues not being addressed as far as opportunities for black women in leadership positions at the national party\n[noise] I'm Wondering I'm we knew in the twenty sixteen elections that the majority of black women Ninety percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton\nWas there any frustration in the women that you talked to about that about their support of the Democratic party in record numbers and then not the support that you're describing\nThere is a lot of frustration out there there's frustration in the Democratic party's response to the twenty sixteen election where you had an overwhelming majority upper Ninety percent of African American women voting for Hillary Clinton voting for democratic candidates\nAnd not having the narrative that came out of the twenty sixteen election really to recognize that\nAnd the narrative that did come out of the twenty sixteen elections for many Democrats and and for many of the Democratic party institutions was focused around how the party needed to invest in white male voters\nAnd as you can imagine you know that sparked frustration I think also for me personally watching the DNC chair race take off and not have\nAny woman of color on that stage in those forums when everyone and and it's a very well known phrase says that women are black women are the backbone of the Democratic party but it's not reflected in\nThe leadership selection in the investments to ah recruit and train and support black woman running for office I mean even today I don't think those frustrations have been addressed in any\nReal significant way from our party institutions when you have four out of the eighty four targeted races for the Democratic congressional campaign committee only four out of eighty four or a black woman\nGiven those numbers of support coming from black women to democratic candidates that that that's just not acceptable\nYou of course ran for chair of the DNC because someone say well uh you're just frustrated that you didn't get the chair and that's your that's the basis of your critique I have to ask the question to move\nThere can be anything further from the truth I I think my entire professional political career has been focused on really amplifying the voices of disenfranchised and vulnerable communities and\nI I've always made it very clear that\nMy work and politics has very little to do with me as an individual and everything to do with communities that need a greater voice greater representation everything that I'm focused on right now is how we can correct the strategic mistakes that have been made\nAnd amplifying black woman in places within the Democratic party\nSo the interesting thing is um you in your piece you've written about this process with you know trying to work with the DNC and you said that chairman Tom ... and his deputy Keith Ellison who by the way are both men of color\nMade decisions on the future direction of the party without really getting input from other folks what would you like for the DNC to do\nWith the current leadership certainly I think I think it's great that we have men of color in leadership positions are within the Democratic party that that's a good thing and and and should continue\nIt's just when you look at the numbers of votes the Democrats get from black women and you look at\nThe activists behind the scenes who have been you know doing the bulk of the work for our candidates and and and for institutions the leadership doesn't reflect\nThat same perspective and\nI I Would hope that you could have men of color like chairman for as like deputy chair Congressman Ellison recognize that it's a problem and and proactively\nNot in reaction to critique but proactively say we need to do more we we can do better as a party\nThere is a DNC initiative that was launched over the summer called seat at the table and it's one of these I guess initiatives that was sent to really try to rebuild and train black women to uh enter into the DNC do you think that that's enough what's your sense of what seat at the table is doing\nThe DNC should be on the forefront of putting opportunities on the table and the seat at the table initiative is great the more they can be done the better\nIt's not something that is revolutionary it's not something that is you know even relatively new to have events where you talked about\nBlack women and they're important to the Democratic party we have to get past events we have to go into a very strategic reckoning around how are we as a party recruiting\nBlack woman to run for office how are we as a party redefining viability I think that is a serious question that needs to be answered because when you talk to\nThe political operatives at the party institutions specifically the Democratic congressional campaign committee you know they're very focused on viability the ability for candidates to raise money is is unfortunately the number one indicator of viability in a race\nWe have to change the definition of viability to allow for more black woman to get into the pipeline of running for office and running as Democrats\nThat the last thing the Democratic party can afford is for black women to stay home on any election day in any ZIP Code in any state in any place in this country\nTo move green is a founding member of vote run lead an organization training women to run for public office to move things for being with the takeaway thanks for having me [noise]\n\nThat's our chauffeur today but we hope you'll come back tomorrow for more as always we'll have a lot more conversation\nTo get through remember I'm On Twitter at ten Xena Vegas and we are asked to take away on Instagram Facebook et cetera and join us thanks so much for listening I'm dancing to Vegas [noise] this is the takeaway I Am

its was to kill them\nThis team showed up at the ... just before he came in and then rush back to the airport and less\nStumble and another disturbing details among the team of Saudis there was the head of forensics general security in Riyadh so basically corner was there the grim suggestion is that this was the guy in charge of cleaning up after they did a number on them off the show\nThe disappearance of a Saudi journalist and what it means for international relations today on the world\nIt turns out that hush hokey earlier this year founded an Arab pro democracy NGO\nAnd so there's speculation that he was about to launch some initiative that would call for democracy renewed the spirit of the Arab Spring to the Saudi leadership that must have sounded very dangerous\n[noise] some of his friends are speaking out his fiance ... recently wrote an op ed pleading with a White House and Saudi officials to get to the bottom of his disappearance and Turkish officials of course are pointing the finger at the Saudi Government how is Saudi Arabia reacting to all of this\nDenial they're basically trying to hope that this goes away and there are kind of online trolls attacking the journalists who are reporting the story accusing them of anti Saudi by as they were attacking both had teacher changes the fiance as well as other friends\nJim ... who spoke out to the media I think the nature of who Jim also show was his connections to elites in academic near the think tank world and journalism make it very difficult for this to go way the way the Saudis would like\nHow are journalists like you and assemble feeling at the moment\nJamal ... if someone I Know it was a source of mine someone that I talked to for a few years now\nYou know I talked to him when he was a strident supporter of the regime I Would call them to get a pro Saudi comment I talked to him when he was Saudi Arabia under been saw him on and said I'm Sorry I Can't say anything and I talked to him once he left and you know wash just sort of evolution and read his columns\nAnd read his commentary spoke to him and so on just on that level I think it's horrible I think it's terrible this is someone I knew someone that I considered her colleague as well as a source so it's devastating that there's something like this could happen\nI think I've some measure of protection from this kind of saying because I'm an American but I you know fuel for the other dissidents journalists and activists who are in Turkey the Arab Spring\nProduced a lot of dislocation of many people people were you know spread out across the region and across the world and they you know suffered enough having to say goodbye to their homes and their families\nNow they have to be living in fear that the government that they escape from is going to hunt them down and kill them were kidnapped them with impunity\nReporter ... either and assemble President Trump has invited show gets destroyed fiance to the White House you a secretary of state Mike Pompeo was called on Saudi Arabia to support a thorough investigation of ... case and to be transparent about the results\nMembers of the Trump Administration would seem to be on the same page but to what end\nI think they're unified view is is\nA pull off the side of the road and ... and maybe find shelter in a ditch if you can or move into a structure that ... that safe this is a confirmed tornado\nOn the ground just east of la de we've got a tornado warning that it now has been extended up into a northwestern portions of clay county southwestern portions of a Baker ah actually that's Deval county\nUntil four o'clock this afternoon oh that's a tornado warning until four o'clock for pretty much if you are on thrill one between ... and a ... a Baldwin were three of one intersect I ten\nYou are in the past of a tornadic storm it has been confirmed once again a tornado has been confirmed\nI'm I'm Jeff often from these storm center I'm going to return it back to the local stations and then we're going to give you another quick update\nAnd about five minutes or with all stations from the Florida public radio emergency network storm center\nAnd you're listening to eighty nine nine cuddly Jaycee key in Jacksonville, Florida and we will hear another update from Jeff Hoffman and the floor to public radio emergency network coming up in about five minutes so stay with us\nBest friends are most reliable friends are most valued friends our fellow democracies that's been a standard refrain in American foreign policy I'm pretty much since the end of World War two and and strengthened since the end of the Cold War\nAnd that's the language that President Trump has thrown out the window in essence a he's made it clear including in his speech at the U.N General assembly a couple of weeks ago that he's really not concerned about how other governments govern their own societies he just wants to know what's in it for him\nI guess I Want to know what difference it all mixed because I mean the Trump White house has been described as enthusiastically pro Saudi but are there really shades of being\nGross out because it's the world's biggest arms importer and one of the biggest exporter of oil I mean that's a that's a wild combination that you're either in or out where the U.S is in right and we've been in for decades\nWell the United states has been happy to have a very close relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia since the end of World War two the U.S and Saudi worked together to develop those Saudi oil fields and yes the kingdom of Saudi Arabia purchases quite a lot\nOf weaponry from the United states President Obama in fact sold a record dollar amount of weapons to the kingdom during his eight years in office and Trump looks like he's ready to top that record\n'em so there is continuity but there is a substantive difference in the Trump administration's approach in that\nPresident Trump has really signal that he's willing to give the Saudis have free hand not just in terms of repression at home but in terms of regional policy as well under Trump the Saudis basically have a blank check\nSo what are you seeing as reaction from the White House right now about what could well be an assassination of this journalist ...\nLook a lot of misinformation that seems to be leaking out of turkey is still unconfirmed and as someone who knows ... I have to hope that this is not true but there are increasing or indications that what we're looking at here is a very brazen\nAssassination of a journalist on foreign soil\nThat's shocking not because autocrats don't try to shut down their critics but it's brazen because it appears to have been a planned murder if the reported information is accurate\nAnd it spreads and also because ... is someone who is well known both in Saudi Arabia and in the west and Roosevelt to the state of Virginia\nYes and he's been living in Virginia and writing in the Washington Post and\nI think that the swift and fears outrage among all these other sectors here in Washington pushed the White House into a response where we might not otherwise have seen one\nThis is notable because it's the first public criticism that we've seen from the Trump Administration at any senior level of Saudi human rights behavior\n[noise] how much did U.S intelligence know about cause she'll be safety before he walked into this consulate in Istanbul\nThis is a very important question and one to which I don't think we have a complete answer the Washington Post reported last night\nThat uh sources were telling them that U.S intelligence intercepted communications uh among Saudi officials talking about their desire to lure them all back to place where they could get their hands on him\nThat's very disturbing is true because it raises the immediate question of when the intelligence community and learn this information and what if anything the U.S government did to warn a resident of the United states about the fact that a foreign government was plotting against his safety\nAgain if it turns out the Saudi officials plant and executed this assassination what's going to mean to other allies in Saudi Arabia get away with this on the world stage\nIf the United states is not willing to stand up against the violations of basic human rights if the United states is not willing to stand up for a a journalist who was merely exercising his right to free expression then other governments that also believe in these right\nMichael from the Florida public radio emergency network throughout and following the storm will be here to keep you up to date with the latest information from our storm center working in coordination with Florida's public radio stations to give you\nThe latest live local information as well joining me in the storm sooner is meteorologist Jeff Hoffman along with Sean Morrison Geoff what's the latest on Michael\nAnd what's the anticipated impact here over the next couple of hours swelled\nMost pressing information right now is they confirmed tornado Randy that's on the ground the clay county ... a fire chief just confirmed that so that as they confirmed tornado on the ground just east of la de moving up us thrill one this is a situation where you need to move inside protect yourself this is a tornado on the ground\nRight there in northwestern sections of clay county so keep that in mind over the next few minutes also we have extreme wind warnings as the core of hurricane Michael now is approaching the ten quarter I tend to close west of Tallahassee extreme wind warnings mean that these are not just under ... these are the winds they can\nIs it a damage to structures a category three strength Windsor one Fifteen or possible approaching I ten or right now west of Tallahassee\nLet us information about the hurricane about sixty miles west of Tallahassee about thirty miles east north east of Panama City one hundred and fifty mile per hour winds so this officially remains a category for hurricane\nThe current pressure is nine hundred and twenty two middle bars are slowly but surely the storm continues to pick up the pace to the northeast\nAt about Fifteen miles per hour that's some good news uh and hopefully this will exit the region as quickly as possible in the meantime though the effects are extraordinary in terms of what's happening around Panama City in Bay county engulfed county and then\nYou know when you're a ways away from the coast sometimes you don't you don't tend to have that same level of concern is if you're on the coastal this is a situation where are the weather services issued this advisory for high winds that couldn't exceed a hundred a hundred and ten miles per hour and they've issued that for a very good reason\nMy name is Randy right with Jeff Hoffman and shiny Morris and we're broadcasting live on the floor to public radio emergency network storm center we are going to send it back to your local public radio station\nFor more live and local news and information regarding hurricane Michael\nAnd you're listening to eighty nine nine of the J.

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston\nFor the second time in a month a major hurricane is lashing the southeastern us hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle this afternoon packing wins over a hundred fifty miles an hour experts say Michael could end up being the worst storm on record in the region if this frightening situation sounds familiar it is\nWe begin this hour continuing to track Hurricane Florence has it gets closer to making landfall in the eastern United States\nHawaii dodge the direct hit by Hurricane Lane which became tropical storm lane over the week at\n... at that another storm it's weakening now in the office like I said Mexico hurricanes ... threatening the southwestern us with heavy rain this week he's already sending powerful waves crashing on the Southern California coast\nAll those storms they all hit the U.S in just the last few weeks there's no evidence of course that we're getting more tropical storms as the world's climate warms up but there is strong evidence that these storms are getting stronger as sea levels rise in oceans warm that was part of the message delivered by the un climate panel this week\nA report made it clear that climate change is here and will only get much worse if we don't move much more quickly to deal with it\nThe report was drawn up by many of the world's top scientists for an organization that won the Nobel Peace prize but when asked about the report President Trump seem skeptical of its merit\nIf it was given the man I Want to look at who drew it which goes through it because I couldn't give you a report that are\nFabulous that I could give you report that are so good but I Will be looking at it absolutely\nTrump has dismissed climate change as a hoax and does reverse major policies to tackle the crisis but the U.S military takes climate change a lot more seriously they see it as a threat to national security and hurricane Michael is an example of that threat\nAs the storm barrel toward Florida military bases in the region were evacuated\nJets from ten dull Airforce base flew to Ohio to wait out the storm and thousands of other air force and navy personnel at nearby bases were told to stay home today it's all just one example of how vulnerable many US military installations are too extreme weather\nThe world's Carolyn Beeler joins me now and Carolyn we've got this big hurricane system in the Gulf of Mexico where there are a lot of military bases but the U.S has bases all over the world so how will they all cope with the future impacts of climate change\nThis is a bit of an open question Marco there are a lot of military installations clustered on the coast around the world and as sea levels rise which makes storm surges worse and as hurricanes are expected to grow increasingly intense\nThese military installations are at risk there are some Seventeen hundred military bases and coastal areas all over the world from Florida which is being battered right now to the Marshall Islands event\nAnd just put a dollar figure on at the navy alone just that one branch of the military figures it has about a hundred billion dollars worth of assets at places that could be damaged with a meter of sea level rise which could come and the next few decades\nSo with the navy obviously the ships are mostly going to be fine of sea levels rise what are the main concerns\nRight the ships are built to be in the water so they're going to be fine the main concern is the physical infrastructure\nOn these bases and actually getting workers and naval numbers and civilians who work at these basis from inland in the face of increasing flooding on roads a couple of years ago I visited that Norfolk naval base in Virginia to talk to the Navy's head engineer in that region pat ... and this is what he told me\nI could make the space impervious to rush I'm an engineer and I believe that all things are too but this base is not an island\nThis base is not an island meaning people out to get to it from somewhere and already I Norfolk there are days when the main road going into the base floods and people can't get to work which means they can't resupply ships that are docked there so this is already seen as a military readiness issue\nThe military has long been considered a one of the most proactive parts of the federal government when it comes to planet for climate change I mean the Pentagon very clearly a number of years ago called climate change a threat multiplier is that still the case are they still proactive\nI Would say yes and no one I was standing on up here with ... sat Norfolk naval base he said you know it's not my job to ask why sea levels are rising right now it's my job to know what the projections are and plan for them and so this is sort of still the\nThe attitude of the military so even today secretary of defense Jim Mattis has said that climate change is a national security issue and we do need to plan for it\nYeah I mean planning a suggest the military has a really different attitudes are from the White House on on climate change what does that actually mean though on the ground\nSo there are directed being given an instruction being given to the military and the Pentagon to plan for climate change so for example the navy right now is required to plan for a sea level rise and all of its forward planning and Congress recently directed the Pentagon to identify the top ten sites\nThreatened by climate change but these directives and is planning doesn't always translate to action or money allocated in terms of preparations for climate change\nToday I talked to David Titley who's a retired rear admiral who actually headed to the U.S Navy's task force on climate change for a while and this is what he told me about the military's preparations\nSince I'm now in state and I was going great students I Would give the military might or its preparations they done so many for work\nThey have pulled out some overarching documents who say what are going to do but at the end of the day funding these type of infrastructure improvements is very very hard\nTo lead did point out one tidbit of forward momentum on the funding aspect here which is that Congress authorized military spending to prepare for climate change\nIn outside of defense applications so if we go back to the naval station Norfolk\nThe problems with people getting to work on that naval station how to do not with a military site but with infrastructure outside of the military base so there's been some funding authorized for helping military readiness when it occurs off of military bases\nSo I think this is an example of how what's happening with Congress regarding climate change specifically on military readiness as a little bit different than the rhetoric that's coming out of the White House\nWell for the good people along the Gulf Coast we wish them an a plus for dealing with the effects of Michael the world Carolyn Beeler thanks very much You're welcome Marco\nHurricane Michael comes in the wake of two related events this week the un climate report that I mentioned earlier which urge much quicker action to avert serious climate change consequences also a Nobel Prize in economics go into Paul Romer who's focused in part on how innovation can help us tackle the climate crisis\nNew approaches and technology can definitely help but it also pays to look back to the way things used to be done\nThat's what's happening in some remote parts of Australia\nA changing climate and damaging farm practices have degraded a lot of land there now the Australian government is hired a group of people with deep ties to the land to rethink the way it's managed and practiced and protected you might say their consultants who knows the land best aboriginal people using traditional techniques handed down over centuries\nHere's reporter ... Fernandez\nIt's a one morning in the remote community of ti tree\nI mean a jeep with a group of aboriginal women they're all ranging one line women from the local aboriginal community who spend their days tremendous thing a large swath of land and ti tree and doing general land maintenance was nothing\nTo these ranges different and how they do that job see family caught a degree in land management they don't study textbooks to learn land protection techniques\nThey stopped the week by consulting with The Elders the traditional owners of the land", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "10"}
