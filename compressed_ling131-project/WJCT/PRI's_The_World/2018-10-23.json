{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Since two thousand sixteen we haven't made as much progress as I Would like him replacing those systems\nJeanette I Want to ask you when you hear the challenges the physical infrastructure challenges that Larry is pointing out do you make a connection there between the physical infrastructure and voter suppression are those two things connected and if so how [noise] yes I think they're quite related because they\nAll are part of what I call a crisis of integrity in our election system there are concerns not only about\nHow votes are cast and counted but also how people are able to have access to the polls and whether the equipment is equitably distributed whether the opportunity to vote or equitably distribute it and what we're seeing across the country\nAre numerous devices to keep the American public from the polls and particularly minority communities they are becoming the largest portion of the electorate\nAnd it's extraordinarily concerning that there are so many different ways in which we make voting difficult for eligible voters in this country what we know is that this electorate is is slowly being curated and hand crafted\nBy election officials who can manipulate who get on the voter registration rolls and once they get there who has an opportunity to cast a ballot in a fair and free an equal way\nAnd why do at the federal government take that role I mean I I I feel like we're talking about something that\nHas this many holes that disenfranchise a people and it's so critical to what this country is I eat a democracy or republic then why isn't this taken care of\nWell I I mean I I I Would say that it should be that there should be some minimum standards when it comes to both of election system security and investing in our infrastructure and making sure that I'm Susan have the right to vote but in fact\nIf anything we've seen the opposite I'm In recent years you have the Supreme Court striking down critical sections of the voting rights act which has made it much easier\nFor local jurisdictions to frankly manipulate the process and for ... to decide who can vote and who can't vote and and you've got the same thing when it comes to election infrastructure Congress basically saying\nYou know it's the state's responsibility and and the state's often saying it's it's the county responsibility on what happens is you have vastly different\nStandards not only between states but even within states\nLarry I Want to ask you about cyber security we hear about this a lot um there's been all this talk about um how vulnerable our\nSystems can be two hacking for example to international interference so foreign interference what are the vulnerabilities today and are they different than they weren't twenty sixteen\nBut there are any different than they weren't twenty sixteen the election infrastructure has vast so there's a lot of focus off and on voting machines themselves but if you look at what was targeted in two thousand sixteen and frankly has been targeted in elections abroad in the past few years\nIt's things like the voter registration database election websites electronic pull books which we use and thirty four states always things that\nPeople use to figure out where they should be voting and then a lecture and officials used to make sure that people are entitled to vote and interference with any of these systems can create confusion making more typical for people to vote and\nOften what the intention is create out in the integrity of a system I do want to say\nYou know because there's all this doom and gloom talk about these things we we do have procedures in place that should mean that even if there is some kind of\nA cyber attack 'em or interference or or frankly mistake right no election is wrong perfectly ever um that people should still be able to vote and have their votes counted um so I'll just give you one for instance because we've seen this in past elections if there are problems with electronic pull books where people are showing up\nAnd their names aren't on the registration rolls but they believe they're registered\nThey're entitled to a provisional ballot under federal law under the help America vote act if if you were told that you are not registered to vote and you believe you are you can fill out a form\nA and they can vote a ballot and they can figure out later if there was some kind of problem and nobody if they see a problem with their registration and people should check their registration online you can do that virtually everywhere in the United states\nIf they see a problem they should tell their election officials but there is a an election protection hotline um the phone number is eight six six hour vote\nAnd there are experts there that can help and that can make sure that you get to cast a ballot\nJeannette what about you what is something that you would like voters to know about this system going into the mid term\nYou know we pay a lot of attention to foreign interference in our elections as we should\nBut we cannot ignore the fact that many voters and especially voters of color are at greater risk of being disenfranchised by state and local officials and that's something that should be absolutely unacceptable and our democracy today so we at the end of the ... are encouraging everyone to be prepared to vote that is\nCheck your registration in advance do everything you can't be prepared when you go to the polls and be prepared to stick it out to wait it out if necessary and to cast her ballot\nLarry Norden is the deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for justice and Janine Nelson is the associate director council of E.

GBH here in Boston\nBe self sufficient that's basically what the US government demands from some immigrants coming into this country is at the heart for example of the Trump administration's latest proposal to limit who is allowed to stay in the U.S permanently\nFor the next several days on the world will be hearing stories focusing on one of the key factors for anyone hoping to be economically self sufficient education recalling the stories brain gain\n... has been working on these stories with us so what would you say is a threat that runs through the stories are not\nAll these stories are really about immigrants trying to pursue their education here in the U. S. a lotta times when we talk about immigration we are hearing about deportation or illegal immigration and people coming into the U. S. but\nThere are a lot of immigrants who are already here who are trying to get their footing in the U.S and in into the economy and\nThey're doing that by pursuing their education and so we'll be listening to stories about that whether it's people who've just recently arrived and trying to navigate the education system or people who've been here for a while and essentially want to learn English and want to better their skills in whatever job it is that they're doing\nAnd what are some of the obstacles on the way to that brain game\nSo there's a range of issues that we've heard about while reporting the story then one of them is that immigrants sometimes come to the U.S with skills in education but they can't necessarily use those skills because their education doesn't match or there are certain requirements that they have to meet working here\nSo one person we talked to what's ... she's from Haiti she lives in the U.S now but in Haiti she was a nurse she went to school and actually in twenty ten\nWorked as a nurse during the earthquake how medical international medical teams and help deliver babies I'm coming here to the U.S she essentially had to start over\nSo they not consider or my studies together so they just consider my only my nursing school and so I have to come in for my bachelor degree\nYeah professional certification recognized by the U.S oh just one of the many obstacles so we'll be hearing more from France summit later this week uh what are we going to hear him the first story today you reported this one from California right no no\nThat's right so the first story is about young immigrants students young adults are often refugees and sometimes when they come to the U.S they hit a wall in high school because of age limits\nMarta ... thank you for the set up and here's your report\nWell my name is Mary I'm Arizona and in Nineteen years old from Syria Mercer was Thirteen and war broke out in Syria she stopped going to school it's risky and special training other schools that that will bomb than like anytime\nEventually Mersenne her family moved to my desk though in California's Central valley\nWhich you started high school there oh like all is terrible I did not know like how to communicate with others with teachers I did not know what teachers need to do but I was actually motivated because I wanted like\nFrom the bottom of my heart to go back to school\nHelped her most though was being part of an English immersion program with other students new to the U. S. citizen her English was flowing and she did well outside of the classroom to allies of all the programs gloves activities for the\nInternational a scholarship club tennis\n... also wanted another year to take classes like statistics and biology and become more eligible for state colleges it's often called a super senior or fifth year\nBut it's also mean that Merce that will be a twenty year old senior too old for high school that wasn't possible according to the school district which you wanted to send her to an adult at program for a GED and she couldn't graduate at Davis from ... it mean leaving the only school in the U.S\nShe'd known I was crying all week I'd ... last\nAdd wouldn't offer the advanced classes Murtha wanted or the same clubs and activities\nMRSA isn't alone though older immigrant students sometimes doing well in high school and wanting to stay another year can hit a wall in the U.S because of their age lawsuits and Florida and Slovenia and New York have challenged is seeing the ruled unfairly funnel out certain immigrants students\nIn Pennsylvania one school district blocked older refugee students from enrolling in regular high school if they insisted\nAnd again they were told to go to an alternative high school be told vault check an attorney with the ACLU represented the students\nIt was only the older students the school district was really\nTrying to build up its graduation rates\nIn other words if the refugees students couldn't graduate and time and had to stay beyond a senior year that'd be seen as the knock against the schools graduation rate the students sued and a judge sided with them school officials began accepting students at age Twenty one at the regular high school\nI mean the dilemma that faces every school district in the United states is the issue of students aging how\nIt's also hard to pinpoint how often students like Marie emerged faced this dilemma over Asian out but it's clear that many like her can need more time in high school because of gaps in English or in their schooling caught that poverty or war\nOkay so we'll see I don't know\nLindsey bird teaches high school in Modesto, California at the same school Murray emerged from Syria went to last year bird random schools language immersion program and says that twenty students found themselves hitting the wall over age limits since from Syria Afghanistan\nEl Salvador and Pakistan it troubled bird to see them trying to adjust to a new school and then feel pressured to leap\nWe're using an age I'm a birth date to push kids out of what is obviously the best education\nEnvironment for them for their success there is no other reason you would not want a student who has a proven track record of you know excellence and behavior academics in attendance why would you push them out\nBut some school officials say these students can succeed in other settings and wonder if that isn't put adults who didn't like those who are Twenty one in classes would fourteen year olds searing Gucci is Modesto school superintendent she said that adult at program shouldn't be considered negative move\nIf you build an adult and program such that they're learning all the skills necessary\nThan adults at can be a bridge for these students she says especially if they can't get up to speed and high school but Merce said during adult add would have ripped her away from her high school other refugees students wondered just two and went to school board meetings asking to change to age limit rules\nFor some of the students it was her first time pushing for change in the U.S good evening\nMy name is ... and I'm from Syria I'm Nineteen years old and I'm a super senior high school\n... my ...\nMy name is ...
