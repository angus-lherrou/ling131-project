{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "That make it less reliant on Saudi oil and so in some cases the Saudis have an diversify that economy to other areas including a arms manufacturing and buying a military arms and bombs and in in in planes from the U.S\nWell I Want to talk a little bit about those defense contractors because writers reported a couple of days ago that they were quite concerned with the idea of sanctions and I'm going to play a clip here from a President Trump talking to Lesley Stahl about that issue this week on sixty minutes\nWould you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed what depends on\nWhat the sanctions or give me an example they ordering military weapons\nSo would you cut that off like well what I don't\nWant to do rowing Lockheed racy on all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a politician to use a word that's a pretty harsh words for the show\nSo we looked at the financial statements for Boeing Lockheed Martin and read the on three of the biggest weapons manufacturers in the United states and we found that they made a lot of money I mean combined they reported more than a hundred and sixty nine billion dollars in revenue for twenty Seventeen\nBut Trump has said that under his administration there have been more than one hundred billion dollars worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia is that even accurate\nYeah part of the problem with the president's argument is that he it it starts with a number that's not actually based in reality it's going to use his term it's fake news this hundred and ten billion dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nIt's realistically never a number of that's going to materialize last year we saw less than ten billion dollars to Saudi Arabia so I have no real idea where were the other hundred plus billion dollars in arms sales are supposed to come from\nThe other problem with the idea is that arms sales are not a great job creator\nA lot of these firms that he's mentioning you know your Lockheed Martin's and your radio and at the same time their their revenues I've been going up they've actually been cutting jobs here in the U. S. and some of these jobs have been going overseas to places like Saudi Arabia\nSo the ... the net economic impact to the U.S I think is negligible at best so the idea of saying that if we cut off these arms sales it'll crippled the U.S economy I think at the very least that's hyperbolic so Ben\nAbout President Trump and the Trump Organization what personal economic stake do they have in Saudi Arabia\nThey have a men's personal steaks and Saudi Arabia and in fact uh it goes back decades between Trump and Saudi Arabia he's been doing business there for at least two decades that we know of\nUm he's famously said things like well he he loves the Saudis they by twenty thirty forty million dollar condos and some of his hotels\nUm during the campaign alone he started a new businesses and Saudi Arabia related to a hotel ventures there um in in my new that was just during the course of his um less than two year campaign\nSo you fast forward to when Trump takes office and he starts this great the Saudis started this great lobbying NPR enterprise I'm In the capitalize on a lot of that ... they know Trump has not fully divested from his businesses and they know they can use that as leverage against him\nWhat would sanctions or could sanctions look like that would actually have an impact from a business standpoint\nI think there's a lot of options for sanctions um in in in I I think it's important for folks to real\nI bet if the U.S that has the advantage here not the Saudis the Saudis rely much more on us then we rely on Saudi Arabia [noise]\nI'm In uh as I mentioned previously they're trying to diversify their economy right now I'm In this conference that but it's been reported in the news of so called ... and the desert conferences plan for a couple of weeks from now\nI'm a lot of American businesses I've already pulled out from that um and other foreign businesses to Richard Branson pulled out from it for for example\nUm and so even independent of what Congress does with sanctions I think you're already seeing plenty of blowback from the business community in I think that's only going to continue if the Saudis continue this very misleading storyline that they've been on\nCan you tell us about Saudi economic influence inside the United states especially when it comes to lobbying are lawmakers do you think that that's something that will prevent sanctions\nIn twenty Seventeen when Donald Trump was elected president the the Saudis really doubled down on they're already very large lobbying in public relations campaign that they were renting in the U.S\nIn twenty sixteen for example they and they spend a little under ten million dollars a lobbying in public relations firms\nBy the end of twenty Seventeen they had spent a over twenty seven million a year so you see almost this tripling of of their influence operation\nAnd what they did they hired a lot of a lobbying in public relations firms or\nWith a folks that were close to the Trump Administration in just other large very well connected firms on both the Republican democratic sides of the Iowa my organization a document in many instances where lawmakers took campaign contributions or from Saudi lobbyists on the exact same day they met with them\nBut I think despite that there is a very good chance that Congress will actually passed sanctions 'em and they will that and they might also punish the Saudis and other ways including cutting up arms sales and cutting off US military support for the Saudi led war in Yemen\nAnd very briefly I Do you see this having an impact on the market's been\nThe Saudi markets for sure we've already seen some pretty injured and dramatic impacts on a on the Saudi economy\nBut in terms of the U.S economy again we we just don't rely that much on Saudi Arabia um economically for business ventures yet I'm certainly in the arms manufacturing industry or Saudi Arabia the number one buyer of US military equipment in in arms sales\nBut I think there's plenty of non economic reasons to question those to begin with uh the war in Yemen has been declared the largest humanitarian crisis in the world in us bombs had been found to have killed civilians in that conflict\nSo to stop those bombs from blowing to Saudi Arabia could protect the lives of civilians in Yemen\nBen free minutes the director of the foreign influence

GBH here in\nBoston here's a story we're probably going to hear a lot about in the run up to the mid term elections next month another caravan of migrants heading north from Central America [noise]\n\nGuess we could chanted the migrants after crossing from Honduras Guatemala yesterday today\nPresident Trump threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if the migrants continue their march Guatemalan journalist Louisa ... has been watching the progress of the caravan\nIs heartbreaking to see\nMarching thinking\nPraying with children in them babies and they'll learn people feel\nThey are just walking and then you'll see the issues\nThat closing not appropriate to the weather conditions dealing with 'em all we have a lot of rainy seasons right now so they will reach the Mexican border I think on a Sunday and then we'd be a very huge crises in the border\nSo they're on their way now to Guatemala City the sixteen hundred marchers right what what is the scene as they're walking along or they're walking along a highway\nNight days that then if you were left left is a big seating near the border with ...\nAnd there were around two thousand people on the car and a shelter and everywhere they they were sleeping almost three\nSo the caravan started in San Pedro Sula Honduras San Pedro Sula was once the the murder capital of the world it's still a dangerous city why do the marchers say they're fleeing Honduras\nFilings the gang violence and the other part is they are with nothing not having jobs not having any money\nMakes them very bold liberal\nYeah so are fleeing poverty we've heard a lot about that and the violence as well I mean there was a a Honduran congressmen highly ... who tweeted they are not seeking the American dream they're fleeing fonder a nightmare so that certainly squares with violence and the violence stories we're hearing\nLuis why are they doing this march this time of year why now\nIn what Randall they gather people begin to march\n... it is legal to seek asylum in the U.S even if you don't have papers so people who present themselves at ports of entry or not violating any laws how much do these migrants no that large segments of American society are not going to welcome\nAs far as I can see only a few of them know about ... the other ones I just marching to the border I think they believe they can just entered the countries I don't think they are aware of the of the nation on the border\nVice president Mike Pence told presidents in the region in Central America this week to stop migrants from ... north and President Trump has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras but our leaders in the region able to stop these marchers\nAs far as I can hear in Guatemala and they are not doing anything to stop them because it's not possible\nWe don't have enough resources to solve them and\nGet them back to the border with them and that's because they are there are a lot of family a lot of children a lot of elderly people they are just crossing every road they can\nThe United states provides a about a hundred and Seventy five million dollars in aid to Honduras that was the last fiscal year if President Trump cut off aid what would that do to Honduras do you think\nOh it's going to be very very bad for the doors economy\nHow would Guatemala feel if a these Honduran migrants were to just stay in Guatemala how would people feel about the\nPeople that are not happy with\nWhere us marchers here there are of course a lot of people helping them giving\nFood water medical and because they are just crossing the country but if they want to stay with no resources window money just staying in the part that is a huge crisis minutes aren't that crazy\nI'm On a journalist Luis ... keeping his eyes on nearly two thousand\nThe Honduran marchers who are moving through Guatemala is being with us from Guatemala City Luis thank you thank you\nThere is a lot of uncertainty facing migrants who make it to the U.S Mexico border especially families with children under the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy\nThousands of families have been separated at the border in fact according to a recent report by Amnesty International thousands more families were separated and the government has previously disclosed\nBrian ... is a researcher at Amnesty International\nI imagine this a Brazilian grandmother named Maria ... death threats by a police officer who was involved with criminal groups in Brazil\nShe had a developmentally disabled grandson over whom she had legal custody we visited her in detention in El Paso she'd been there for almost a year after simply seeking protection at the U.S Mexico border\nAfter a day or two in detention is separate from each other and they remain separated for most of the next year\nThe grandson was put into the custody of the Connecticut state children's services and they'd even sought to strip her of her legal guardianship this is clearly not the best interest of the child and it was something that was done fairly also to compel her to give up her asylum claim and go back to Brazil a few years ago this would've been a clear cut asylum case\nWill get back to the case of Maria and her grandson but first I wanted griffey to tell us about the new and it's the international report\nBasically what we know is that the department of homeland security has not made public and official count on the families and the number of children affected what we hear from authorities are kind of a patchwork\nOf conflicting statistics the department of homeland security from April nineteenth to August fifteenth alone separated over six thousand family members who cross the border regularly but from the numbers they shared with us it appears that number is about twenty twenty five percent higher at a minimum\nEven when they provided us with these statistics they couldn't tell us whether they were talking about the number of individuals or the number of families separated that's a big difference and they also went to back to a class action lawsuit under which there'd been about twenty five twenty six hundred families that were separated\nBut it appears that about eight hundred other people were separated beyond what they'd just listen to this class action lawsuit\nYour report lays out three ways that the Trump Administration policies affect people coming to the U. S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWill the reason that the Trump Administration was separated families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present and you kind of risks of society or viscous lead that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nEnds in right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border\nThe Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico and telling them that it's safe for them to wait there we also found that the U.S authorities have been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport those asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death\nAnd that's flat illegal under both US law and international law so there were these three interlocking policies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress have come to is asking for more information we're hopeful that\nAs we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson brain griffey says Amnesty International was president of Murray's final immigration herring and it wasn't looking good for\nWe actually witness as the judge such compel her", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "16"}
