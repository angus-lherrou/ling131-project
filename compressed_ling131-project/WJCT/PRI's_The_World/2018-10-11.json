{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "But Damien ... is a really good filmmaker and his ideas I\nWith these movies now in twenty team like what you\nWant to know is why does this person wants to make this movie until this story and I feel like we his challenge was to make the least boring looking conventional bio you know Hollywood historical fiction film he possibly could\nRefer you're nodding yes yeah I I I agree I I thought if there's a lot of good things about this movie amazingly directed a hitting in terms of technology the production the miniatures sets the designed to look at this thing\nThe fact that it was shot on actual honest to God film it looks beautiful it's amazing and it is one of these movies that really does\nPut you in the capsule I Know it's a corny thing to say but you really do feel like you're there it's a real tooth rattler of a movie and it's it's great for that reason you know my objection was Neil Armstrong ... never comes to life for me in this movie you know I think she has a very no nonsense get the job done\nMan of few words you know very very archetype all kind of you know post Eisenhower kind of American and I think that made him probably a great astronaut I think that makes them slightly less compelling traumatic figure for a film and I felt there was a bit of an emotional vacuum at the center of this film\nThat sort of left me a a little cold at the end\nWhat I mean we it's not like we haven't done space movies before right so there's oh I feel like there's always a space movie at some point you know where where are the heroes the Americans are sort of the\nYou know the main heroes here what does that tell us about American exceptionalism like when we see these movies are we supposed to be inspired like we were by the fact that we Americans had made it on the moon is that still relevant today\nWell you know what the one thing I thought well I was watching [laughter]\nThat's how I felt when I watched gravity of the U.S raise yet I most I because\nWhat what the movie actually does show you all of the things that could that did go wrong with with previous attempts to to make this journey\nAnd the things that are at stake ... like even a successful version of this doesn't seem fun right and every time somebody goes an average for something particularly about gravity and the sort of worst case scenario that plays out in that film I mean you just there is something and I don't know if it's inherently\nA matter of American exceptionalism although you know part of what the space program was about was a race between us and the Russians so this movie is aware of his movies thoroughly aware of that but it is also entirely aware of the sort of political\n... of of this moon landing taking place in Nineteen sixty nine and it cheats a little bit to get that Gilles Scott herring song in the movie there's they use while he's on the moon yeah I'm at some point and it's it's it's really powerful because at the exact moment some people in the audience were like\nWell I mean I came for this but do they know what else was going on Ninety\nSixth one was just gonna say Nineteen sixty nine wasn't exactly the most peaceful year on record I mean I have an entire textbooks dedicated to Nineteen sixty nine sure you're not in your head again rate for what's what's that\nWell I mean I I I think the film does like Wesley saying it makes this kind of late act nod toward\nTurmoil it is it is a little sudden you know all all of a sudden you're like oh yeah the hippies but like\nI really loved how sudden it was that he liked the I really do because the movie is not about that that's a whole other movie but there how many how many movies have you seen where there's just a complete divorced from what's happening in American society\nLike Apollo Thirteen right\nIt was not right I that I saw that I recall being totally divorced from up\nIn in terms of news we just had a pretty bad astronaut thing happened yesterday right I mean there was a mission that had to be a boarded like are we are is this sort of space idea really divorced from where we are with space today does it mean the same thing as it meant to kids you know who are growing up back in the sixties and seventies\nI think this might go to the controversy about ... not showing the planting of the American flag he does show the American flag planted we see it there on the the moon's surface but he does not show us a Buzz Aldrin Neil Armstrong planting the flack and\nShe still has said that that was just a a choice what he wanted to focus on where the private moments of Neil Armstrong and not the well known public moments that we've all seen a million times but I Wonder\nIf maybe ... at the age of I think he's thirty three is so young that maybe this idea of the American flag being planted\nJust seems like a very kind of corny very old fashioned and possibly a little colonialist of an idea it was a pretty old fashioned idea in Nineteen sixty nine I mean even the idea that we're going to go up to some there was no place left to go but we found that the moon and we went out there and we stuck a flag in it\nEven then that seemed like an idea from a few hundred years ago I'm One of our manifest destiny act like that exactly and I wonder if to someone of ... generation\nThat maybe that just doesn't give him that same kind of flood hurry feel that maybe it's got more negative connotations even if that's just subconscious\nI also think that that's just not the movie made I mean there is a case to be made for the same movie planning the flag if it's explicitly a movie about racing the Russians to the moon racing the Russians to outer space but again to the to the\nLike the question of whether the Neil Armstrong story matters and twenty teens I I watch this I went into this movie skeptical of the entire enterprise because my first thought was demi inches oh very exciting and filmmaker why the hell is he making a movie about this\nBut he can do whatever you want he's an artist I don't I respect that the other thing I thought was you're going to call it first man you know what's going on in this country right now\nBut it's a movie about the alarm strong what do you what else are you going to call it but I mean arm I tended to think about all that stuff simultaneously as real genuine human curiosity about this larger existence way way beyond us and also brought about why he's on the moon you know\nAnd you know I watch this movie with\nWith it and in both states and\nTo have the movie sort of meet me were half my brain was was actually I I really I got a little ... from that because the movie really didn't have to acknowledge what else what's happening in this country at that point\nOn that note ... film critic for Newsday and the take away and Wesley Mars is critic at large for the New York times thanks to you both for being with us thanks for having

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH in Boston\nA Chinese national is in an American jail today he's being prosecuted on economic espionage charges this is a big deal is the first time a suspected Chinese government spy has been brought to the U.S to face charges\nJim shoe is accused of trying to steal technology from G. E. aviation through one of their employees he was caught in a sting operation in Belgium and extradited to the U.S on Tuesday according to Justice Department officials Katie better is covering the story for the New York times Katie this is pretty amazing how did this thing actually go down\nIt's unclear whether or not the employee at the aviation was working with the government but it's clear that GE Aviation shelter subsidiary was working with the government and was tracking communications between one of its own employees and the Chinese by Mr shoe and eventually\nMr she began to ask the employee for more and more information and much of which was proprietary which the employee himself up\nHim or herself recognized a but still their communications continued and they eventually agreed to meet while the employers coach be on a business trip in Europe that allowed the authorities to arrest Mr shoe while he was not in China in a country that had an extradition treaty with the United states\n[noise] so do we assume the employee was about to go to Belgium and then the authorities came in and said no we're actually doing the sting operation do we know kind of at the point that the employee was let on that there was going to be a sting operation\nWell it's clear whether or not the employee actually went to Belgium him or herself we don't know that and again we don't know the extent to\nWhich the employee was taking part in a sting operation or it's just being closely monitored by his or her company but we do know though from our reporters on the ground in Belgium is that Mr shoe was arrested while he was out\nAh just shopping and Dell Gemini he claimed that in fact he wasn't there to be anybody Bush of suffocation he remained very quiet he fought the extradition which is one of the reasons it took so long to get him from Belgium to the United states he was rushed starch April first April Fool's day and uh he was extradited and arrived in the United states on Tuesday\n[noise] now this accused spy ... issue of who is the end what's he's supposed to have done [noise]\nSo you don't your shoe works for a China's\nLeads by agency or their equivalent of the CIA and he he was supposed to be\nCollecting intelligence for the Chinese government and one of the ways in which he would do that as she would pose as a representative of science and technology ...\nInstitute a think tank that were court the employees of ah of defense contractors to come to China to give talks of academic toxin reports and do you do some sort of intellectual exchange and then once the employees were brought to China they'd be wind and dined whereas we all know people can\nA maybe a little bit too forthcoming with information on their devices could also be compromised and at the end of the day he was also looking for employees like this employee edgy aviation who at least seemed amenable to giving him information that they shouldn't\nAnd is he a big fish or a little fish in terms of Chinese intelligence\nWell I think that even though he was a regional director it is a huge deal to the United states has charged and\nArrested this man because he's not going to be tried in open court so what that means is the government is going to have to bring forth all sorts of very compelling evidence that they've gathered that we don't yet know from the indictment would prove that this man with not only by\nThe was trying to steal business secrets that could be horribly embarrassing to the Chinese government and it can reveal sort of of the extent of of a larger ring or a larger scheme\n[noise] now you mentioned that we don't really know much about the GE Aviation employee or do we know is there any details about this person know wow\nNow in reading the story I notice that there's someone described as an uninvited co conspirator is that the GE Aviation employee or another Chinese singer\nThat his Naka G aviation play it's another Chinese figure are one of the question is whether or not ... figure is a cooperating witness and the government\n[noise] what's gonna happen too young to shoo now the alleged Chinese by\nYellow await trial and you must court and he's in a U.S court so he titled representation and I would assume that he would find a very good attorney\nAnd what's been China's reaction to this\nSo far muted but that could change\n[noise] now the extradition of ... shoe is believed to be a first but Chinese industrial espionage is nothing new\nOh why hasn't this kind of arrest an extradition happened before\nWell we don't have an extradition treaty with China and technically we can't take their\nPeople out of the country so you know in this case\nThe U.S government was very lucky to have set up a situation where Chinese fly was willing to travel to a country with an extradition treaty with the United states once we indict a Chinese military officials are Chinese government officials generally it makes public their role in the case but what it doesn't do it\nDoesn't allow us to necessarily bring them to open court it restricts their travel however and in some cases districts are financial or their ability to to make money around\n... with the New York times thanks so much thank you [noise] so how common is the theft of trade secrets by the Chinese\nIn some respects I think it's overstated and yet it is prevalent at does happen\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the American chamber of commerce in China it's a nonprofit that represents U.S companies and individuals doing business there previously he was minister for commercial affairs that the U.S embassy in Beijing\nWhen I worked in the U.S embassy\nWe had cases of trade secrets heft and they were not done actually however by folks in the ministry of security but rather by business people for commercial gain so it was a little bit different\n[noise] you know this this case involves somebody who's seems rather senior\nUm what the perpetrators usually after\nIn some cases it's technology that is\nPatented in some cases it is a no how a which is not patentable but which is so important for actually producing product when I was in the embassy or we had a case of a major with a major us commercial glass a company\nAnd employees had actually taken these trade secrets and had used them to build a factory in a third country and we're producing products\nAre you able to tell us the name of that company [noise] I don't think you know cases though where American companies who had a things stolen from them in ... you know technology and and secret and have they ever been able to litigate the cases as a matter of fact they have and uh the situation\nIs really improving in China you go back Twenty years and the Chinese didn't have much in terms of\nA legislation for protecting intellectual property\nBut over this period the legislation has improved quite markedly now enforcement has remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving\nThe big exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area ... intellectual property that is difficult to protect why\nBecause there isn't a proper legislation on this and uh I Know that the Chinese are working on it to us or over the years have worked with the Chinese in capacity building\nIn other areas of pie and this one seems to be\nLike the last frontier but uh but we're all working on it still [noise] what's the threats that comes with trade secret theft is it a security threat an economic one or both well", "show_name": "PRI's The
