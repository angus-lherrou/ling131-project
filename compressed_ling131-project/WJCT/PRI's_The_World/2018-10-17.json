I mean what you've been describing is a very deliberate charm offensive by mum had been so long to get us investment into Saudi Arabia so wouldn't be very surprising if the Saudi Government sponsored a hit on ... of of all the signs appointed to that\n... you're not the only one scratching your head I had been walking around for days wondering why they would do something as stupid\nAs it is but it seems that this is in fact what has happened and it it goes back to what people have said about ... style that he is\nArrogant that he sees Saudi Arabia as a top tier country and looking around the world he sees the Russian government bumping off people who they don't like the Turkish government is the leading jailer of journalists in the world the Chinese have disappeared the head of Interpol\nAnd can find a million ... says are Muslim Chinese in concentration camps none of those governments have paid a price\nSo one can imagine the Saudis thinking that they wouldn't pay the price for killing journalist I think it was a a a terrible miscalculation on their part but one can imagine that is the way in which they perceive the world around them and their place in it\nSteven Cook of the council on Foreign Relations his latest book is false dawn protest democracy and violence in the new Middle East thanks very much Steven ...\nAs I mentioned earlier there's also a lot of Saudi money invested here in the U S Eliot brown of the wall Street Journal has been looking into that and what's at stake so first of all what do we mean by Saudi money are we talking about the country's own money or money invested by private sector businesses and people\nYes the former so it's actually out of this fund that they have called the public investment fund which is Saudi sovereign money it's called the sovereign wealth fund that spends the country's money in its country and around the world\nSo how much money are we talking about in the sovereign will fund invested in the U.S in us markets and businesses\nSo it's a little hard to track precisely what do you know it's in the order of low tens of billions of dollars a week ... this is just relating to start ups which is sort of the the biggest chunk of investment they happen to us that we can find is in the order\nMore than eleven billion so far\nSpread around pretty wide variety of companies\nYeah where do they put their money like how does the Saudi sovereign investment fund different from say a like a pension fund\nSo if they actually work relatively similar where they'll give a large chunk of money to individual companies and it just takes takes them and then often not have too much saying how the company works so some companies people will have heard of a they own a\nSteak and Tesla they own a large steak around ten percent and over\nAnd then there's a very large chunk that has gone to a different fund run by the Japanese company softbank\nAnd they've given them forty five billion dollars to spend on start ups in tech companies around the world so that's where a large portion of of their us investment has has found its way is through the soft drinks on\nYour end as you've looked at to where this money goes what sectors of the U.S economy are the Saudis invested in most heavily\nSo most heavily its tack and start ups at that because of a couple of years ago the the crown prince in Saudi Arabia decided to really sort of take some of their money is derived from oil and their wealth and try to invest in the future economy sort of out of the realization that\n... in the future oil will run out people will shift to electric cars or people just stopped by oil and they will need and waited for by their own economy\nSo we've long known about the the kind of money for human rights trade off with Saudi Arabia prior to this episode with ... ... ... ... how ... what an American started be to get Saudi money would they be happy about it\n[noise] so I think it ... they they they certainly aren't very eager to talk about it right now those that have taken it we reached out to twenty two of them and the only one that got back\nWas over a my sense is that generally they had been sort of believing hoping that the crown prince was a reformer\nAnd Saturdays darker days were behind it um but they also probably just didn't think about it much because they were offering a lot of money and a lot of it was coming through a different party that being that the soft banks on them and\nSo Elliott relations between the U.S in Saudi Arabia become strained how could these massive investments be impacted\n[noise] so the ones that are already invested such as they over investor I'd rather have a seat on the company I think it's sort of what's done has done it it's not like a campaign contribution where it's easy to return it\nThe question that we're interested in is what's gonna happen going forward for a lot of the tech sector a lot of a start up sector\nWhich has been sort of expecting a lot more Saudi money to be the rain down on it through to softbank fun which has been really powering valuations and a frenzy out here in Silicon valley and so if if there is a lot more strained relations if it becomes toxic to accept Saudi money\nThat can sort of slow things down out here in Silicon valley\nJust slow them down um and could U.S companies force the Saudis to divest if they suddenly saw the real liability\nIt possibly if it's a pretty difficult mechanism that would have to happen for that or especially with private companies you know it's sort of hard to see how that would even happened but I'm a lawyer but yeah I Do think it's more of a sort of going forward type thing\nAnd of the relations between the U.S in Saudi Arabia became really strained would it make any sense for Saudi Arabia to divest itself in order to maybe hurt the U.S economy\n... you could see that I mean ... in in the trade war with China uses it seemed sort of pulling investment\nAs a lever a negotiation\nAnd certainly just in the past few days it seemed like the Saudis have tried to sort of hurt some of the companies that have pulled out of their conference or at least send a message to them but yet it is a bit of a guessing game here\nElia brown with Wall Street journal really appreciate your time thank you thank you [noise]\nSo can the U.S economy run without Saudi

World Service P. R. I. N.\nDouble your GBH here in Boston we've been talking a lot about the suspected murder of Saudi journalist Jamal ... and how concerns over the role Saudi Arabia's rulers may have played in that murder is straining relations with the U.S both politically and financially now let's talk about the first thing many people think of when Saudi Arabia is mentioned\nOil and yes oil has been a key part of the U.S Saudi relationship for decades so let's learn more about the U. S. and Saudi oil and for that we turn to Jeff Colgan at Brown university starting point the price of oil right now\nWell it's a trading roughly Seventy two dollars a barrel or these days it could rise and it's going to depend on some things that are like fundamentals you know how much oil as applied to the market or not\nBut that claim in the op ed is is wrong I actually the United states is not vulnerable it's ... not furiously vulnerable to Saudi oil news the United states produces more than half of the oil it consumes these things\nAnd of the oil that it imports only ten percent of that comes from Saudi Arabia directly wow a temperature down\nJust ten percent so for Canada is our number one supplier and a far more important player and while Saudi Arabia as significant for global oil prices which affect the United states economy it's not the case that the United states is vulnerable to it\nAnd so these kinds of threats from Saudi Arabia or not terribly credible and can largely be disregarded\nI'm just curious where does Saudi rank global in terms of oil exports he says\nThe threat that the Saudis are making is that they can cause havoc in global oil prices are raising the price of oil overall which would in turn affect the price of us oil and that which you know increase gasoline prices at the pump et cetera\nAnd so that's the threat they're making but it's just not terribly credible because to do that they need to cut their own production that's going to hurt them financially so to raise the price up they have to cut their own uh and so they might be able to kind of that I watch uh\nUh in the short term uh without losing too much money but they're going to lose politically and they're going to lose a reputation as a reliable supplier of oil\nSo let me just proceeded to scenarios with the U.S living without Saudi oil proposal um ten percent with the U.S would go where to kind of short that up to Canada\nThe U.S imports from a huge number of countries and so it could import more from Canada it could import from Mexico or from Norway or from other Middle Eastern countries ... the global oil market is actually very fungible I'd think of it as sort of a bath tub with lots of\nOil pouring in from different ways and it all becomes kind of one big pool and then buyers ... stock markets to select their oil off of that and so losing Saudi Arabia oil for the United states would really not be such a big problem because there's always another buyer available\nAnd of us were to say we can live without Saudi oil and Washington cuts way back its ties with Riyadh um what was that due to security in the region because Washington depends on Saturday for some measure of regional stability right\nYes and and here's where I think that you ... the United states needs to walk a fine line because we don't want to go too far with this I think the U.S Saudi relationship has been one historically that has\nTamped down a interstate conflict in the region it's a very volatile regions of course it doesn't look so good but there's nonetheless an effort by us and Saudi Arabia to reduce conflict but lately and this is under the new crown prince new as a couple of years ago I in Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudis have been much more belligerent causing all kinds of trouble in the region including the sort of humanitarian disaster in Yemen but also hostility with neighboring cutter and ramping up hostilities with those neighboring countries and so\nTraditionally United States administrations have talked to Saudi Arabia and said listen we don't want that kind of instability stopped doing that\nBut the Trump Administration has given them a much freer rain and that's caused some real problems do\nYou think that the war in Yemen is in some ways maintaining the\nTo ship between us and Saudi Arabia and that there are arms deals in there that Washington likes\n[noise] well I think look defense contractors like selling to Saudi Arabia there are a big purchaser of weapons there's no question about that but I wouldn't want to draw to clear a line about that the relationship between\nThe U.S in Saudi Arabia has always principally about oil and us has looked for cooperation from the Saudis on oil markets\nAnd what's changing now is that the U.S has a lot more ability to say listen Saudi Arabia you need to respect what we're saying to you and to to work towards\nPeace and stability in the region or where we were cutting you lose and we can do that because you're actually not able to leverage against us an oil market nearly as much as you might have been in the past\n[noise] Jeff Colgan is the author of Petro aggression when oil causes war is also a professor at Brown thanks very much for being with us Jeff\nIt's been the Tom story in
