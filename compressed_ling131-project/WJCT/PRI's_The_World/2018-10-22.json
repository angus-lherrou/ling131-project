{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "But its fate is uncertain as the latest version is debated in Congress leave says it's time to talk about the way she believes this law has failed fix them by emphasizing criminalization and what can be done to make it work better\nMy argument is really that we've now had about a twenty five year experiment with criminalization and it hasn't appreciably lower rates of domestic violence in fact while all other kinds of crimes have fallen law between two thousand and twenty ten rates of domestic violence felt less than any other kind of crime\nAnd that's at a time when we were putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the criminal legal response to domestic violence\nTo me that seems like good money going after bad\nAnd it's proof that what we're doing isn't really working and so in my book what I advocate for is looking at intimate partner violence as an economic problem as a community problem as a public health problem and as a human rights problem primarily with the criminal system there as a back up\nIn those cases where intervention is absolutely necessary\nI Do want to point out the for some women the violence against women act has actually saved their lives and I think it does become a criminal act at a certain point\nI wouldn't disagree with that and I don't take away from any survivors experience with the police for some people intervention by law enforcement is absolutely necessary but that's partly true because we have an offer people anything else and we haven't thought about the things that causes intimate partner violence\nSo we haven't really addressed any of those things\nI've been a lawyer representing victims of violence for the last twenty five years so I've been in court day in and day out looking at how the legal system intervenes into people's lives\nFor some people that intervention has been absolutely essential for others it's been a total nightmare or the intervention of the criminal legal system has meant that they've had their children removed from their care or that their partners have been arrested and convicted against their wishes\nIn some cases it's meant that my clients have been arrested and charged with intimate partner violence as a function of the mandatory arrest laws that were part of the Nineteen Ninety four violence against women act\nI've talked to hundreds if not thousands of women about the operation of the legal system in their lives and that's what's led me to believe that we need options beyond the legal system\nSo let's talk about some of the alternatives 'em to this level of reliance at least on the criminal justice system I mean what would a balance between criminalization and prevention actually look like according to you how do you see that\nBreaking out no one is looking at an intimate partner violence as an economic problem is absolutely essential it has unbelievable economic facets it costs our economy billions of dollars\nPutting economic wealth into the hands of people who've been subjected to abusive absolutely essential to give people the ability to lead violent relationships\nBut the research also shows that under an unemployed men particularly are more likely to commit acts of intimate partner violence which suggests to me that if we were attacking the issue of under and unemployment among men we might actually be doing something to eradicate intimate partner violence as well [noise]\nIf we think about public health\nOne of the things that correlates very highly with intimate partner violence is exposure to adverse childhood experiences\nAnd so thinking about how we avoid child abuse and neglect how we intervene to make families healthier and safer how we eliminate intimate partner violence in the homes of small children so that they're not having these adverse childhood experiences could also have a significant impact\nWhat that means is investing in parenting programs and nurse him visitation programs\nAnd interventions with men who use violence that are effective in one of the problems that we have is that the research base on better intervention programs isn't great\nBut there are programs that are really making a change instead of by using shame by using men's desire to be better parents were looking at the intersection of substance abuse and intimate partner violence or actually dealing with mental trauma to PCS D. and the ... a perpetrator of intimate partner violence are very highly correlated\nIf we look at the trauma that people have experienced not as an excuse for what they're doing but as a way of understanding what they're doing in a way of trying to help them change behavior we could actually make a tremendous impact\nLet's talk about where the legislation stands to day it's still waiting to be reauthorized we're in a very polarized moment in this country is there a bipartisan effort to reauthorize this and if so what would that looked\nLike there isn't strong bipartisan effort to reauthorize the McConnell has said that it will come back up and I don't doubt that\nOne of the things that they advocates did this reauthorization was to be modest in their goals knowing kind of what the political scene looks like and how unlikely it was to be able to push through major changes and looking back\nAt the twenty Thirteen reauthorization and how\nHow badly contested hotly contested that really was\nAnd so this reauthorization is likely to go through it's a fairly popular piece of legislation it doesn't make tremendous changes but it does make some really important\nThat are in line with some of the\nThings that I've been talking about and what would those look like so there are three provisions and viola twenty eight team that I'm particularly excited about\nFor the first time the violence against women act put money into alternative justice mechanisms like restored of justice restored of justice is really about harm rather than crime it uses the language of harm and it asks three questions\nWhat was the harm how did it affect the person who was harmed and what does the offender need to do to make it right\nAnd there are a number of different processes that are used to bring that theory into action everything from victim offender dialogue to sentencing circles and they provide opportunities to say to people you've done harm you need to acknowledge that harm and you need to tell us how you're going to be held accountable for that harm\nThe second is increased protections for people in federally subsidized public housing that keep them from being evicted if they are victimized in their own homes and allow them some flexibility and looking for new housing if that housing is no longer safe\nAnd the third has to do with guns the violence against women act has been groundbreaking in terms of getting guns out of the hands of perpetrators of violence what the ... team reauthorization does is close some additional loopholes that will make it easier for law enforcement to take guns from those who have committed intimate partner violence\nLeague good mark is the

Tennessee ex ones like Jack Daniels in Mexico\nChina Canada and the European Union all imposed tariffs on us whiskey exports in retaliation for President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs\nThat's got to be painful for whiskey distillers but when I reached out to the whiskey folks they said they didn't want to speak about tariffs several small businesses that filed complaints with the U.S government about President Trump's tariffs also politely declined my interview requests\nFrankly I was a bit surprised Steven Livingston wasn't he's the associate director of the business and economic Research Center at middle Tennessee State University\nWell I I'm actually encounter the same thing when I first started um I Would call these companies up and uh I got the same response so\nAnd as far as I can tell it's just they're worried about the competition learning something about them\nOr maybe tariffs just aren't that important to Tennessee voters for consumers the impacts from tariffs haven't really been felt yet the latest round of tit for tat tariffs with China just took effect in late September I just think it's too early\nAnd I'm a lot smarter retailers bought like crazy in anticipation of it\nSo I don't think the average person um has felt much yet\nBecause a lot of businesses haven't really had to raise prices yet\nAnd so right now I think it's mostly a symbolic thing for a lot of voters\nBut not for everyone Tennessee farms that export to China and businesses that rely on steel and aluminum imports are being squeezed right now\nLeah ... with the Washington
