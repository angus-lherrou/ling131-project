GBH\nHere in Boston what a difference a few days can make and U.S Canada relations last week President Trump was talking about why he didn't want to have a one on one meeting with Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau to discuss trade\n... too high and he doesn't seem to want to move and I've told them forget about it and frankly with thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada that's the mother lode that's the big one a were very unhappy with the negotiations sending negotiating style of Canada\nYesterday with a new U.S Canada Mexico trade deal in hand that icy tone had melted\nI have to certainly\nGive my highest regards to prime minister of Canada adjusted to do a lot of stories came out about the adjusted and I\nI having difficulty together do we did over the trade deal but\nI'll tell you it's turned out to be a very very good deal for a bus and a very very good deal for all three it puts us in a position that we've never been in before\nSo how did Trudeau and Canada when such praise from the White House according to one report the answer is Canada's donut strategy and its trade talks with the U. S. former Trudeau advisor Roland Paris says the donut analogy as close but not quite there\nThe report that described it as a note donut strategy suggested that\nThe effort was to go around the White House and to build a relationship with people in Congress with state governors with mayor is where you know people at all levels of the political system and with American industry the reason the metaphor\nIs wrong is that it's more like a a Danish that that don't up because the whole is sales as well gotcha because part of the strategy was to build strong links with the administration the White House itself and that that did take place\nRight so maybe a ... yeah there you go whatever it's called ... you said at all levels of the U.S political system that included public and private who was enlisted in this project on the Canadian side\nWhile I was quite extraordinary on the Canadian side and there was a degree of unity on the Canadian effort that\nWe haven't seen before that reflected the sense of threat to our economic interests but on the Canadian side most obviously you had provincial premier mayors of city you had a group of advisors pulled together from different\nPolitical parties and a kind of extraordinary display of solidarity among parties that are normally sniffing at each other\nSo this project even enlisted a former conservative prime minister Brian ... yeah\nWell and this from Romney of course was prime minister when the first candidate us free trade agreement was negotiated in the late Nineteen eighties so he had a particular interest in this issue but he also happens to live to have a place in uh Florida very near Wilbur Ross and he has a relationship with Donald Trump\nAnd so uh when he was one of the people that the current Canadian government reached out to and uh as I said he represented a different party than they than Mr Trudeau is party\nYeah do you know any specific details about the actual kind of access that a primal Ronnie got because he has this social circuit in Florida with Wilbur Ross and Donald Trump\nHe was at mar a Lago won the evening and was brought up and actually sang a song as he's been down to do in the past I'm a chatted with a Donald Trump who was present but it you know other conversations are of course private\nSo a former prime minister from Canada who's conservative going to bat for current prime minister who's liberal how rare is that sort of bipartisanship and Canada\nPretty unusual now bear in mind that Mr Romney had a particular interest in trying to\nSalvage asked us and she was a part of negotiating and the first place but it's hard to overstate\nThe extent to which Donald Trump attitude towards NAFTA and towards Canada in general has galvanized Canadian you know this is a core economic interest for Canada Seventy five percent of our exports go to the United states it's about a fifth of our entire GDP this isn't there one truly existential interest in our foreign policy\nAnd I've seen a level of unity and the political class which has frayed a little bit in the last few months but certainly across the country and support for the prime minister's effort that I haven't seen before\n[noise] Canada didn't do this when Obama or Bush were president ... why do they feel it had to do this now with Trump not just play the face to face with the Trump to him but also triangulate around him to get this new NAFTA sorted\nWell the reason for this was quite simple that our\nCore economic interests were at stake that even just the auto sector alone there are a hundred thousand jobs and in many many many more jobs that are dependent on that and the idea of a twenty five percent tariff on a Canadian Arctic go in the United states that sharp and the mind but\nI Do want to emphasize one thing which is we're talking this thing is over from the Canadian perspective this is an ongoing challenge we're dealing with the U.S president whose mercurial and unpredictable there are remaining issues to be resolved including the steel and aluminum tariffs that are still in place\nIsn't as a guard if if Trump tries to withdraw from the deal now\nThis deal seems to be the deal at this point and it's a matter of passing through our respective ratification process but the steel and aluminum tariffs remain and place them or not listed as a result of the deal in our part of the deal and those were main important to Canada and\nAlthough one would hope that this will set a path\nOr a more positive relationship between Canada the United states and Mexico\nWe can't afford not to take precautions and anything can happen as we've seen with this president and part of taking precautions and saying this campaign is going to continue indefinitely\nRow in Paris a former foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau thanks very much for your time\nThanks Marco the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada brings more certainty to the U.S economy that's a good thing but here's something else to worry about new estimates from the congressional budget office show that our government's borrowing is off the charts by historical peacetime standards\nAccording to the c._e._o. and just a few years we'll be spending more money to pay the interest on our national debt and we will spend on our defense or Medicare to put it another way the U.S has become one of the most indebted nations on earth\nWe asked the world's Jason Margolis to help tell us what that actually means\nA few years ago when the Republican Party didn't control all the reins of government deficit hawks like Congressman Paul Ryan work constantly banging the drum about the perils of a rising us debt here's Ryan speaking to CNN in two thousand and twelve\nWhen a debt crisis right in front of us and what brings down great empires past and future in debt and they're doing nothing to prevent it\nAnd here's Donald Trump speaking to CBS when he was running for president\nI Will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue and President Obama has pretty much double the dead since he's been in office and somebody's going to pay a big price we have to start shopping that debt down\nBut once Obama was out and Trump was in the Republicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget\nToday the U.S debt sits at Twenty one trillion dollars a huge scary figure but also kind of meaningless by itself\nWhere the threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable on big problem and we're the only advanced economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason ferment at Harvard's Kennedy School of government steady what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates\nAll the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico
