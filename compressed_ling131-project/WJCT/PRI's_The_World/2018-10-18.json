{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "The economy and and bump up the labor market a little more than it otherwise would have a that doesn't mean it's a good policy uh because it's it's like a sugar high it'll last very briefly it's really bad policy because eventually we're going to have to pay for those tax cuts one way or the other\nThe positive effect will will wear off a within a year or two um both but we we left with will be left with trillions of dollars of more debt\nI think there is a important question task here to there are seven point one million job openings but what kinds of jobs are we talking about here\nWhere they really cover the full range um and and if you look at the vacancy numbers are in that report\nYou see them in a pretty wide range of industry so for instance you see them in professional services for what you usually need at least a ... if not some kind of graduate degree or you see some of them in in places like construction or would you need some skills uh although not necessarily a\nA a post secondary credential and then you see them in places like leisure and hospitality or or even retail trade\nOr were folks without much college or without even work training or can get hired as long as they are job ready as long as they can come in get to work on time every day uh sometimes pass a ... a drug test that cetera\nWe're talking about the labor economy with Harry ... professor of public policy at Georgetown and former chief economist for the U.S department of labor Harry is it easy or people start asking for more money should people start asking for a raise if they already have a job given the job market and what it looks like right now\nWell the average answer that question is yes you know get it always varies from one industry to the next one occupation the next depending on how many other people in that region are ready to replace you\nBut but yes this is these are the best circumstances a in over a decade uh when the labor market has this tight workers have more bargaining power\nUh and and and what it's harder to replace them if they leave the yeah they they they have more more room to bargain to to ask for pay raises ... overall it's not a bad strategy right now\nWhat about wages themselves we often hear that wages have not kept up with productivity with um unemployment or with employment um that workers are making less today relatively than they were thirty forty years ago so we're our wages today have they gone up as well\n[noise] well you know wages have been the most disappointing aspect of this recovery and we haven't seen\nGreat wage growth the last few months it looks a little better uh the last two months or the employment ports have shown\nWage growth in the three to four percent range rather than two to three is that lasts a that looks like we're moving into to a new phase where we're we're everything looks positive uh and and and we'll see the last one to the other thing of course is productivity has actually been\nPretty weak or in the last decade or so so uh it's it's hard to have great wage growth without\nVery good productivity growth but but the news from the last few months or has been more encouraging\nCan you drill down a little bit more into that because I feel like workers are working a locked and and we never stop working so how does a little bit about that productivity number\nWell productivity a is really\nA the output of goods and services per hour worked so it might well be that the workers are are working a lot of hours and that that we have a lot of employment going on it depends how productive each\nWorker is on average in producing whatever goods and services they produce and and those numbers have been pretty flat\nUh we had a good ... good decade in the late nineties and early to thousands around the dot com boom but except for that they've been pretty flat and and we need to figure out how to get productivity up to have long term\nA wage an earnings gains in not just a bump while the labor market\nLet's also talk about two groups of people who often don't get highlighted here there are the long term unemployed those folks who just can't seem to get a foothold in the labor market and also those that say they are under employed they're not working\nOr the hours are the types of jobs that they want to be working or feel they're qualified to work and what do you see for those two groups long term unemployed and those that are under employed\nWell for for both those groups you know we we wish the numbers were a little better um\nIn in the labor market this tight those people have the best prospects there going to have but but but you're right they they have often been left out a lot of the people who are long term unemployed actually left the labor force or they have stopped actively looking for work\nUh for some of them it's very hard to come back and they might have going on disability insurance or they might have developed an opioid problem where they might have a criminal record lots of stuff can keep them from coming back in and even when they do start looking for work\nYou know that that long spell without work up to be a negative signal to employers like a you know the guys that trustworthy depending on who else was applying for that job or they might still get it\nSo we've seen a small number of the people who have left the labor force trickle back in ... by the way I'm not talking about retiring baby boomers I'm Talking about people\nPrimates workers between say twenty five and fifty five a bit of small trickle of those folks back in a a lot have remained out and of course along the route heart or whatever is to come back at the other group\nThe group or involuntarily working part time or or not quite the job ... this is a good time for them or to try to move up move up the ladder especially they have skills or work experience\nTerry Holtz or is a professor of public policy at Georgetown and former chief economist for the U.S department of labor Perry thanks so much my pleasure\nAnd we want to talk to you our listeners about how today's labor market is playing out for you when did you last get a raise what does it mean for you from blue collar hourly jobs to white collar rules with big salaries we want your stories of getting raises
