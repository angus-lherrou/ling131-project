{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "So it's really not feasible to audit every single vote and it just you don't need to either you just need to be able to audit the precise number of votes necessary to confirm the outcome of an election\nBut auditing really is necessary to protect our elections and ensure the integrity of our elections and you know paper based voting systems are incredibly important\nBut I'm the overall impact of a paper based system depends largely on election officials and states ability and commitment to carrying out real bus post election audits that then look at those paper ballots I'm a small sample size for example to ensure that\nVoters intent and a voter's choice are accurately represented in the outcome\nWhat training when it comes to folks that work at the polls how important is that\nTraining for election officials and at the state and local level election officials is of the most important particularly under the current threat environment when we know that the vast majority of attacks and attempts\nAt manipulating our elections are cyber based our election officials at all levels were incredibly hard to protect our elections and for the most part they do really really excellent job\nBut most election officials are not trained cyber experts\nAnd you know we can't really expect them to be there you know the the cyber expert community is is growing by the day in this country but we need a lot of election officials so we really need to begin training and intensively training election officials on how to recognize cyber attacks\nAnd the proper way to respond to any\nFishy or a suspicious activity that they see a either on election day\nWhen they are managing for overseeing the state's voter registration systems so you know showing a video or you know having a conference for election officials once a year\nOr twice a year as it's fine it's a good starting point um but more certainly needs to be done in Colorado for example just a few weeks ago carried out\nOr what they called election war games where it was really role playing a various ah election emergency scenarios including cyber attacks that included election officials from all over the state so that they were prepared and had actually practice responding to some of these attacks\nAnd that's the kind of intensive training that I Hope becomes implemented nationwide for future elections\nAnd what about the federal government I mean I'm Still surprised that we don't have a sort of federal voting system but where the federal government come in and help some of the states\nSo did chess who has sort of been managing the federal government's response to the Russian attacks in twenty sixteen\nAnd ongoing attacks that we know are occurring leading up to these twenty eight teen mid term da just has a variety of services that it offers states to\nBolster their election infrastructure including performing vulnerability assessments which are free to face by the way there was of course earlier this year I Believe a waiting list for states to receive that kind of assistance which which was unfortunate but as far as I as as I Know\nThe H. S. has now sort of caught up and is performing those assessments at a speedier rate which is great\nBut in addition to supplying sort of been banned cyber security measures and task force state election infrastructure\nThe federal government plays a significant role in information sharing with state and local officials federal officials are particularly national security experts are privy to some of the more classified or\nHigher level threats to our elections that state officials and local election officials are not privy to and are not receiving talking points on but also read out\nOf who are who our adversaries are and what they're trying to do to infiltrate our elections so there needs to be a direct line of communication between the federal government what they're hearing what they know and the state and local officials who are working to protect our elections on a daily basis\nAnd there have been efforts since twenty sixteen to better that communication line\nFor example the ... election assistance administration have helped conferences with a state and local officials to sort of talk about these issues how they're going to better the information sharing system\nBut there's always room for improvement ah there are still states and local officials who say that they are unaware of of what's really happening and their locations in their jurisdiction so information sharing still needs needs some improvement between the\nPro government and state and local but I Do think there has been improvements since twenty six teams so that that's always always good Daniel Ruth is with the center for American Progress Danielle thanks for joining us\nThank you very much for having me\nAre on the show we'll be talking about the rise of hatred and this politically divided moment after a series of homemade bombs were sent a former president ...

and it's time to review the rent but it's not really pleasant for the guy on the other side of the cable\nBlood pressure for us universities to rethink their ties to Saudi Arabia stories and more today here on the world\nFor more than a year and one of the big reasons for that is that they're around seven hundred thousand pending asylum claims in the U.S and that those claims haven't been ruled on generally the backlog these days is around two years two to Seventy years it's a really long backlog\nI Know you've heard this question before but it's getting asked a lot right now especially online\nWhy now like given the timing coincides with the final weeks up to the mid term election could this caravan be anything but coincidental\nCan say with near certainty has\nVery or nothing to do with the U.S midterm elections that to the degree that there were organizers I don't think they were thinking about the elections in the United states now it's definitely possible that there were hunter in politics at play and\nSome attempt to embarrass the government that's currently in power but I don't think that there was anything to do with a U.S politics my sense of the matter is\nThat it started with a group of migrants who who wanted to come to the United states\nUh then political leaders in Honduras got involved and they publicized on Facebook that got picked up by the news and then it just snowballs by their so does he agree that there was any political\nMotivation behind did this caravan has exploded beyond anyone's wildest dreams I I don't think anyone could have

much Emily thank you must go\nNow to the latest on the murder Saudi journalist Jamal ... many believe Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered ... killing but today he tried to distance himself from it promising to punish those responsible the prince was speaking at a big investment conference nickname Davos in the desert\nHere in Boston this week the Massachusetts Institute of technology MIT announced that it's reviewing its connections to Saudi Arabia and the wake of ... death the kingdom and Saudi companies have invested in partnerships with many American universities there's also been increasing pressure from academics who say\nOr at the end those partnerships one of those academics is gripped Peterson who's an affiliate of the center for Internet and society at Harvard here in Cambridge which Mohammed bin ... visited actually earlier this year a grip could you just start by telling us about the uh Mohammed bin ... visit\nAbsolutely so in March of this year Mohammed bin salon came on sort of a grand tour of the United states a meeting with universities with\nAcademics with folks in Silicon valley with entertainment industry people really\nPretty much everyone and when he was in uh Cambridge we sort of knew the visit what's happening and when I say we I mean you know concerned citizens but it wasn't really being announced that much and then on a Saturday and marched there was a very militarized police presence around MIT\nI rode my bike down there and I'm sure enough ...\nWas in town so you can see that something's happening but we didn't really know what ... but then if you go on Twitter and you look at the ... the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's ministry of\nForeign affairs Twitter account or the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in graphics account you see all these photos of Mohammed bin ... shaking hands with President rife at MIT outside of the Media Lab of closed door meetings with lots of you know the top brass at Harvard\nWas this a moment that you another academics decided to organized a protest is kind of lack of transparency\nYeah I think this was you know for us this yard in past and I who are we wrote an article about this together\nThis this uh ... example with Mohammed bin salon was just a perfect example of the way that universities are really out sourcing a lot of their work to to sort of closed doors deals with with businesses and government that\nYou are not always in the best interest of the students that faculty and the community on M. I. T. tech which is the student newspaper and MIT are a few days after a visit to publish an incredible op ed called the ... MIT is more or less thing which really\nDug really deeply into this sort of inconsistency between the methods that have a a university like Harvard MIT leads with being a sort of ethical leader in society\nWhy our relationships with Saudi Arabia so problematic\nHave relationships with Saudi Arabia and universities are problematic in the way that I think and his relationship with rape the on the weapons manufacturers is problematic and and to be clear\nRelationships like this are not new they've been they've been going on for for a long time I think that when an institution of higher education takes the perspective that they are values based organization that they have an ethical mandates to sort of lead\nSociety in a particular way building into that opaque partnerships that you know a sense of believe the unrestricted quote unquote but you know in all reality or do come with strings attached I I just think that there's a there's a an inconsistency between the sort of ethical language at the university is using and how they're doing business\nSo that the opinion piece you were talking about that you wrote that was in the guardian correct what kind of reaction did you get\nWe did not get the response that we would have liked from Harvard MIT despite our efforts to get this in front of of leadership um you know there wasn't any public response I Believe president rice didn't make a a response to the MIT students or editorial letter\nBut that was sort of along the lines of well we have relationships with everyone and some Saudi PHD students got the common isn't that great\nAnd of course it's great that Saudi pitch to students can come to MIT but to me that's sort of Mississippi the bigger issue\nSo you are also part of a group of people who urged the Cambridge city council to pass a resolution expressing a its opposition to the policies of the crown prince you even testified why was it important to go to the community around at MIT and Harvard\nIt's important to recognize that when our city is is really being used in a particular way and that's what this relationship with mom and then sold on felt like I felt like the ... the city of Cambridge the institutions in Cambridge we're all being used a basically as one giant photo up to\nContinue to legitimize the you know the power that mom and been someone was gaining that help legitimize and turn things like the war in Yemen um I felt like as a citizen I had a duty to participate in a very proud of one of my um city council members Clinton's on ... for putting forward a very bold\nA policy order which which basically went on record not only against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and they're and they're a record in in Yemen and that sort of\nVery spotty progressive or liberal allies and quote unquote the mama been someone has has undergone but also trying to get to the universities Harvard and MIT and and basically saying\nYou know we are not a playground for you to be having these very opaque a backdoor relationship\nWhat do you think this MIT review shouldn't tell like what would satisfy you\nAt the very least I Would like to see some public acknowledgement that they were voices who were speaking out against this before the ... before the show the assassination and that's not to\nTo necessarily validate you know a Clinton's on urban or I'm Down in myself\nBut to recognize that the signs were there before this this this assassination and an MIT chose not to look at them and that in terms of the legitimate station that's happening with ... these are just very different avenues that he can use to pursue at the same the same goals and I think some sort of recognition that\nUh you know when you're dealing with a country like Saudi Arabia\nAnd all all the relationship is ultimately go back to the same place I think that needs to be recognized and understood because I think when you do that it's been a little harder to sort of justify each little relationship is being innocent\nWell we've reached out to MIT and Harvard for their responses to their partnerships with Saudi Arabia but have yet to hear back ...
