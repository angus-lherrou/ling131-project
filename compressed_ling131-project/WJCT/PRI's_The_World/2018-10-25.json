the us pulling out of a nuclear treaty with Russia\nHas to do with China\nBoth stories and much more today on the world\nMany many people find this entertaining and politicians have always appreciated a laugh line but you're you're not seeing the humor\nYeah look since the beginning of the Trump presidency many of those surrounding Trump and basically told the don't pay attention to what the president of the United states says\nAnd to me a that's flawed analytical because Trump has given us a unique window that we've never had before into the real time\nThinking of a president or he blows everything out and more importantly words have consequences and that example where the president in the midst of the controversy over the disappearance and apparent murder and dismembered men of Saudi journalist ...\nThe president at cheering on violence against journalists was that sort of horror find context of that comment of course it matters in my view the fact that\nUh subsequently we've had this wave of type um sent\nTo Democrats enter media figures around the country at a time when the president seems to be laughing and celebrating violence toward journalist you know it seems to me not

connection to those laws as ms ... um any cult of personality you might have seen at these rallies\nAbsolutely I go back to the comment during the twenty sixteen campaign you know that I could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and they would still follow me and those who have studied this kind of rhetoric from other divisive populace figures\nHave also observed is outside of the United states the context in which a charismatic authoritarian meaning leader wants people to embrace his narrative of the world even and perhaps especially so when he's promoting\nNot facts but an alternative version of reality because that makes them more tied to him and to his view of the world\nSo finally Susan how are you seeing this with Colombian rhetoric reverberating around the globe right now\nNo question you know you have populations in places like Poland and Hungary cheering Trump on and actually endorsing leaders who are quite similar in many ways who came before Trump and so I think\nThis is a phenomenon of political presentation of confrontational ism divisiveness that new politics of fear that is with us in many different\nIs it how much do they inspire each other how

international norms in a really big way in a way that has broken through to the American public and so if we are ever going to reconsider this relationship that we have in the middle east since two

going on now for a few years and you can draw more or less a direct line from all of these authoritarian behaviors of mama been so long to the apparent attempts to kidnap oh Shorty and his murder\nSo if you had Donald Trump's ear right now what would you tell them what would be the way forward\nWell I Would probably tell him that this is the Saudi regime that has\nEssentially violated its various sort of agreements with America and how to do business has made the Senate and the administration look very bad\nWhich I think matters especially to the president it's not a good deal in fact the American Saudi relationship I've argued for a\nFundamental rethinking if not breaking off of the whole thing you've got a president who's very transactional who has talked about hundreds of thousands

teen very small percentage of that has actually been signed or obligated in any way and will create may be some\nThousands of jobs many of those jobs are going to be in Saudi Arabia I think that even from a transactional or realistic perspective\nLeaving aside the human rights perspective it's not a good deal for the United states\nWhat would you like to hear specifically out of the White House right now what would you think would be a good thing to hear\nWhat we need to hear from the White House is that they are first they're going to take the\nLetter from Congress initiating an investigation under the global Magnitsky Act seriously and that they're going to truly investigate this wherever it leads\nAnd then they'll listen to their information being provided by the

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston\nThe Trump Administration said this week it's considering scrapping unimportant Cold War treaty the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty also known as I N F\nIt was signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Nineteen eighty seven they agreed not to develop missiles with ranges between three hundred and three thousand miles the goal prevent a surprise nuclear attack using those medium range missiles are still seems like a good thing so why scrap it now\nAs we reported earlier this week the U.S accuses Russia of violating the treaty but there is a good argument to be made but the move to scrap it may have more to do with China\nChina has never been a signatory of the treaty\nThat's Laura Seligman she's Pentagon correspondent for foreign policy\nAnd so as such it has been able to build up over the past twenty or Thirty years a bath\nArsenal of conventional weapons in that intermediate range that now threatening freedom of navigation in the region and they can threaten us ship particularly our aircraft\nVery vulnerable and the fact that the U.S is a party to the treaty and China is not has really hamstrung that\nUnited States military in the region from protecting ourselves but not just protecting ourselves but also protecting our allies\nSo since Nineteen Ninety seven when the treaty was signed China has been arming up as China ever been invited to sign onto the IMF treaty\nCertainly not publicly and not that that I Know\nSome people I spoke to said this pulling out of the training without even sort of extending an invitation to China and joined even symbolically that came as a little bit of a surprise it probably would have looked a little better for the United states to at least try\nOr up here to try to get China into the treaty but those officials also that there was no way that\nThe Chinese military was going to be willing to give up that missiles that it has developed over the past twenty Thirty years\nYou're just because these are conventional missiles that the Chinese have not nuclear ones\nYeah that's true and why and twenty Eighteen is China's missile arsenal frighten us war planners\nBecause of the ... the U.S has been handcuffed to deploying these kind of intermediate range missiles by ship or by planes and as you know in the Pacific there these vast vast distances that means is very very expensive to fly bombers or\nHave ships going around the the out there so we're we're losing a lot of money were not able to strike at promptly and if we could put conventional conventional like I had not nuclear weapons in the house Tennessee or station then with our allies in Japan Vietnam\nThen that would give us a much more prompt more flexible options\nYeah so what you're saying is that China with what has got right now could potentially force the U.S navy to retreat hundreds of miles with these kind of deterrent missiles\nOut of the in fact they already are that's been happening for the past five or ten years the U.S navy has been warning that that increasing sophistication of that Chinese missiles and and ... anti aircraft that had been for saying\nThat aircraft carrier in particular that carrier strike group further and further from the shore making us less and less effective\nAt enforcing freedom of navigation and the interest of our allies in the Pacific region\nRight so the danger to our allies like Japan or Taiwan or the Philippines if the U.S Navy's forced to retreat from those a Chinese missiles that would expose those hours right\nYes absolutely\nSo ascribing the IMF treaty someone say makes sense on one level but could trigger an arms race with China\nI think that that is certainly something that people are\nAre a little bit concerned about and not just the China obviously with Russia as well\nSo what happens next was Congress to vote before the treaty is scrapped\nKnow that President can pull out of the treaty unilaterally that what happens is that in ... notification to say that it's laying out of the treaty and then I Believe there is a six month period before\nIt actually takes effect so Congress can object and make it difficult but the president can unilaterally collapse and I will I Will just just say that there have been reports John Bolton and knock out\nNow just recently said we're not going very quickly on lists I Know we've announced that we're going to talk to our allies first but it does make this seem pretty inevitable that we're going to get out of this treaty\nLower Seligman
