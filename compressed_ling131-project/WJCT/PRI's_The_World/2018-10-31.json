{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "... said this and I'm quoting here quote there are not a lot of female directors period and even less who are inclined to do harm he apologized for that comment soon after but I Love to get both of your reactions to it\nI mean it sounds so much like the conversation that's going around Hollywood where people are saying oh I don't know where the directors of colors are I don't know where women directors are\nAnd the problem is is that they're out there and people need to actually take the time to find them a Mary what are your thoughts when you heard that\nWell I'm Glad he apologized later for the remark because it's just not true I mean I've tried to pitch projects over there and like been sort of relegated to somebody low level that listen to my pitch and that was it you know ... they know they know I'm Out here\nWell you've done it you've actually done it and so that's that's that's the proof right there you know actually I Want to ask you Monica you've actually seen the new film the new Halloween and I will be honest I'm scared of cats who I I I'm afraid to see some of these films but I'm curious about how the new film dealt with the main characters trauma compared to the original film what did you think\nWell I mean the original film was such a landmark moment and it really like kind of\nKicked off her sort of like serial killer sub genre and that sense but now they're looking at what did the after effects of all that what happens when decades later come in and Laurie is still dealing with that trauma she never got help\nFor any of the things that she experience and it it transferred down to the generation so it affected how she related to her daughter and how she relates to her granddaughter and I thought it was a very interesting concept and I think what a lot of people want to see is what that would have looked like in the hands of a woman writer of a woman director\nAnd Mary I'm again you directed pet cemetery I'm Wondering what is your experience been in as a woman in the genre of horror in Hollywood\nYou know I had a a really big success early in my career with the Stephen King adaptation I had a great experience working with Steven who I wouldn't have gotten to direct the movie if it weren't for state and he had control over who would be the director he had the final say on that and\nI met with him and and now that he\nPromoted me I Know that's the reason that I was hired so I had a big success with that and\nIt led nowhere you know\nAnd we hear this a lot as Monica pointed out earlier when we're talking about communities of color underrepresented communities in Hollywood in general I Want to ... a moment here to the content to get and how women are portrayed Monica I'm curious about your thoughts on this horror movie trope I'm known as the final girl can you tell us what that is and what it represents\nSure so that's a that's a trend when you think you're watching a horror film and then there's using only one survivor and she tends to be a woman and uh you know it's supposed to be this big umpiring figure that she survived everything that took out her friends or took out her loved ones and my take on it right now is that it's kind of\nHas a five for me it's kind of stuck in the past I don't\nYou know see it really progressing that much in the films that I've seen recently when I'm interested in something like this recent Halloween movie where it's not just one Laurie Strode uh at the very end at the United front of women it's to three generations of strode who are standing up against Michael Meyers ...\nSo Mary in terms of the final girl having been you know you did pet cemetery what do you think about that role for women in in ... is it empowering is it's supposed to be empowering do you think it's a trope that needs to be done away with\nCandy empowering I mean the person who is left is the person who the sequel is about\nI think the ... the woman usually is the one who's left to clean up the mess in my experience that's who claims to mess up the women I don't see it something we need to get rid of I just think we need to take a little more interest in what you know what's going on\nEmotionally and psychologically with the the women that would be more interesting to me that's the direction I'd like to see it go and\nI'm curious what kind of horror stories would you want to see women either in or developing or is it more of a thriller if we want to get rid of this final girl trope like how do you see that involving\nI Want them to have the opportunity to be able to do all kinds of stories whether it'd be super bloody whether it be super island or even if it's just a thriller a slow burn just waiting for you know things to pop up or anything like that that's the problem is that we haven't been able to see\nA women get those kind of opportunities and we haven't seen producers investing that kinda money in those projects\n... do you think audiences care about who's behind the camera do you think they really it matters to them\nI think once they see what's out there they well there's you know all kinds of things that just don't make it to the theaters that just doesn't make it to the mid west or doesn't even make it to you know outside of New York or LA and I would love for people to check those out\nI think audiences relate to great storytelling into being entertained it in a new way and to have any ideas subconscious ideas kept\nIn their in their own psyche and unleash and that's you know that's what you get when you put women behind the camera and give women a voice and don't have to know it's a woman that did it I think they relate\nTo the you know that women have different set of social experiences and they tell stories in a different way and it's interesting it doesn't mean that the other ways no good either needs to be a little more fifty fifty\nMary Lambert is the director of the classic Stephen King adaptation pet cemetery thanks so much Mary thank you so much and Monica ... the EU as a freelance film critic for Roger uber dot com great to talk to you Monica great talking with you too\n[noise]\nHi this is Gina from Philadelphia I think women are both stereotypes and empowered by horror film many of these films include it typically ... female either scantily clad or nude\nWho was murdered with little or no character development the empowerment part tends to come in at the end of the final girl this is where we see the magic of them fighting back\nThere are so many final girls to choose from\nThe classics like Jamie Lee Curtis and Halloween other lane camp from the nightmare on elm street also shadow to Campbell and scream and Ashley warring in hell raiser my name is lethal Amman\nCalls on the list is asking Kathy\nOutlast job at the pollster guy and yes women are stereotyped in horror movies that's why why it daily care to take

GBH here in Boston us troops are taking part in too big military operations right now one is faithful patriots involving five thousand plus American troops being deployed to the U.S Mexico border\nI spoke with retired General Stanley McChrystal today who told me what he thinks that operation says about America's leadership these days that's just ahead first way far larger operation now underway in northern Europe it's called the trident juncture [noise]\nDryden juncture involves some fifty thousand personnel from twenty nine countries it's the biggest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War the main part of the exercise is in Norway reporter Charles Maynes is there in Tron time so you been out with the troops as we Charles ... what have you seen in who've you talked to\nYesterday they had a big media Day Adventist was kind of a big ... amphibious assault they brought in air power um all simulating this attack\nAgainst a NATO ally in this case Norway or which triggered article five according to this is the collective defense and this was designed to show the article five still matters today the stage with Norway here as a sacrificial lamb\nWhat was the mood among the troops who spoke with well\nEveryone seemed to be pretty much enjoying themselves a lot of these guys certainly from the United states uh they were coming from used mostly the southeastern United States Carolina Florida and for them I think of course one of the big ... a kind of stunning aspects of this whole thing is being up\nIn a normal way of course in northern climate in fact I had a chance to talk to a lieutenant Louis and the shape of the United States Marine corps a he was one of the rare ones in fact he actually had some experience with this beforehand having taken a cold weather course with Norwegians but he had this bit of advice for his fellow Marines\nI spent a month here ah the beginning of the year learning from them and uh I think that someone who isn't as prepared for the cold can learn a few things from the new ... or typical countries that work in a seven environment Charles for you how cold does it\n[laughter] well actually today was a little bit warm but very wet it's hovering around zero depending on the wind chill and things like that and give it a little bit more brutal but you know these guys you talk to you today and we were out with Marines walking around a bit um they all said that the weather's just kind of shifted back and forth are unpredictable weather in Norway as usual for this time of year\nSo let's talk about what this whole NATO exercise try to juncture actually means who's taking part in this well\nThis is a members of old twenty nine NATO allies all twenty nine NATO countries plus partners in Finland and Sweden I'm as you noted in your intro it's it's a massive exercise with fifty thousand personnel are about sixty five ships taking part a hundred and fifty aircraft uh ten thousand vehicles so it's a massive exercise\nBut in terms of who they are actually directed at well NATO seems to stress that this is all a fictitious enemy and of course so does the U.S had a chance to talk with Admiral James ... he's commander of yellow joint forces command in Naples, Italy was leading the U.S team up here in Norway\nWe don't pick any particular individual names using the exercise you're fishes or we're not interested and I'm picking anybody else territory wires bad effects of operation protecting the sovereignty and the borders of ... member nations to twenty nine\nCharles I mean given Donald Trump's criticism of NATO um it is perhaps this exercise a reminder to the president of the United states about article five and his responsibilities [noise]\nYeah I think that's one of the stories you're behind the scenes as a concern over just the U. S. is commitment and this in some ways with a reassurance you heard again and again for people from the NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg\nTo the U.S ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison saying that you know the NATO alliance as strong as ever um it was interesting to hear also Mr Goldberg talked about how\nWe get these exercises were not targeted against anyone uh but at the same breath you say you know we're facing the most challenging security environment in a generation and and this brings us back to you know the reality today no one doubts that this is a message to Russia\nFrom states that border Russia such as Norway and the Baltic states you know really increasingly worried about what they see as aggressive behavior particularly after the annexation of Crimea Russia's proxy war in Ukraine and this was really a sense that said that you know article five matters and I think that it matters to the Trump Administration\nReporter Charles Maynes ... Norway thank you thank you Mark I'm retired General Stanley McChrystal knows a thing or two about war he spent most of his career in special operations and he was off the commander of U.S forces in Afghanistan\nI'm a chrysalis reconsidering the notion of leadership in a new book it profiles Thirteen leaders from wildly different backgrounds\nBut they had in common was this white hot burning conviction in their cause\nOne of the leaders McChrystal profiles as someone he calls a valid Musab al Zarqawi the former head of al ... in Iraq\nOne point he had a razor blade smuggled into the prison and it cuts off attached to that he put it on in his youth because it is a violation of Islam and the other inmates are able to see that and here's a guy who proves\nThat he's willing to walk the walk all the time and then later as he leads al Qaeda in Iraq it's the same thing it's not the brilliance of his ideas are strategy it's his absolute conviction that makes us attracted us his followers people attracted to someone who's so jealous\nSo charisma and passion key for leadership are zealots though good leaders and where does charisma impassioned start to turn into zealotry\nWell it's interesting charisma impassioned are usually good and we as followers are attracted to them but just like salads they can take us to the wrong place and what we found with our zealots has like a flame that burned so hot than it burns the oxygen in a room\nIn the case of Zarqawi we killed him but he was necessarily going to die because he was burning too hot for the environment which he was in even the Iraqis who followed him didn't share the same level of commitment he did so\nBy the time we killed him I'd like to believe I was at the point where I understood that he believed in his cause just as much as I believed in mind maybe more and who's to say he's not right\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as leader because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to most of all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when the war began\nIs that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success some policy if we're talking Afghanistan and particularly well\nYou had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where do the leadership\nThere fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an new story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about\nOur current leadership the decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "31"}
