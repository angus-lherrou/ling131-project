{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Survivors feel compelled to contribute their story to that Congress' decision to highlight impact and prevalence and there are so many different reasons why survivors take advantage\nOr feel compelled to reach out for help trainees national conversations but it's been happening and now the election and two thousand and sixteen and it doesn't really seem to stop\nAnd is it also are you hearing from callers who are saying potentially they didn't know that what they experience with sexual assault and now with the sort of focus on this conversation today they're recognizing that it might have been or their folks who didn't understand the severity of what they've been through\nYes absolutely oftentimes one survivor a story um once it gets picked up by the media or we start to have a national conversation about it\nOther survivors start to identify elements that worry that relate very much what they experience particularly I think we're going through a major culture shift in this country that's really highlighting all the different ways in which\nWe're impacted by forms of violence all along that spectrum from workplace sexual harassment too sexual assault itself I think survivors are recognizing parts of their story and that of others there is a department of justice ... some years ago that said roughly Eighteen percent of survivors\nDon't tell anyone of what happened to them because it didn't feel\nBig enough or Portland enough on but survivors are feeling compelled to tell their story now as part of a national conversation that is incredibly important [noise] um and especially if they're looking at the potential of their perpetrator to move into a position of power that could end when the lives of of many other community members\nWhat happens on a call like this\nFor the most part whoever of answering the hotline responds to expressed needs and desires of the color so some survivors are calling simply because they want someone to affirm for that and that what the experience was in fact sexual assault\nSometimes they're calling because they'd like to be loop than to counseling services lotta people call hotlines because they're looking for information about the criminal or civil statute of limitations in their state and there's a large number of callers I think\nDon't get a lot of attention and those are loved ones of people who have disclosed their survivorship\nA loved one who is perhaps now for the first time learning that their son or daughter even their mother was victimized some years ago and wanting to reach out to experts to help them navigate is water so that they can help that person along our journey of healing\nYou know what's interesting is also you mentioned the statute of limitations and each state has its own\nStatute for sexual assault a but I'm Wondering what happens you know we've been\nListening to calls also from people who have experienced sexual assault many many many years ago very early in their lives and are now coming to terms with it when the statute of limitations has expired if you didn't know to do a rape kit for example what can someone do\nWho is now reckoning with having been the victim of sexual assault who who is outside of the statute of limitations who didn't take\nThe steps that they thought might have you know help them to\nA navigate the situation would have happened\nYou know I think the answer to that question is really one that has very little to do with the survivors are victims and more with our policy makers\nAs I think we are noticing that high profile cases like Bill Cosby for example so many survivors had come forward and were denied opportunities to pursue justice simply because the statute of limitations had expired in their state\nAnd so I think that there should be a time of reckoning for those that are in position to shift policy\nTo uh from what we now know about the impact of this trauma and the FBI recognize it\nActual assault as the second most violent crime the first one is violent crime as murder\nAnd when we have survivors who are now coming to terms with what happened to them many years ago\nTo deny that opportunity to pursue justice because we have laws on the books that are not trauma informed or survivor centered at this point in time given what we've been talking about pretty much consistently for at least the last two years is not acceptable\nAnd we talked about what people can do at the policy level and within the legal system but what should they do I mean I feel like what's happening for\nA lot of women across the country I'm an men who have been victims of sexual assault and sexual misconduct\nUm is there seems to be the real psychological toll that's being taken on Americans across the country it's very exhausting to have to listen to this for some people it's opening up new wounds for others they're read a visiting places that they may not have wanted to revisit\nWhat's the best course of action for dealing with this sort of re trauma position if you will uh the psychological heaviness that comes with having to have this conversation day in and day out oh that is\nThat is a question that hits home\nFor survivors I think it's really just listening to their own body as we just started this conversation so many new survivor's or survivor's or adjust now reconciling their victimization are reaching out or help through professional hotlines and that's critically important\nBut for some survivors that might not be that I Wish to pursue they still may not be ready to acknowledge that anyone\nThat they've experienced this crime\nAnd so self care is critically important right now if you have the privilege of being able to take some paid time off to care for yourself\nThat's a great thing to pursue do you have an opportunity it takes some extended breaks and the one with nature and smell the roses and and go for a walk\nAnd physical activity is a good stress reliever for you and to realize that as a nation we have embarked upon a marathon of culture change this is certainly not a sprint\nCulture change work takes generations to have an impact and so it's okay for survivors to sort of pass the baton for a while and I hope that survivors realized that they are\nBeing held close to our hearts as the do this work and have these conversations that it is not their individual responsibility to change the culture their responsibility is to be as as well and it's healthy as they can be\nPatricia toughened heart is the executive director of the New Jersey coalition against sexual assault and a reminder to our listeners if you are a survivor of sexual violence and need to talk to someone the national hotline is one eight hundred\nSix five six for six seven three Patricia thanks for being on the take away\nAnd that's our show today Thanks so much for listening and remember you can tweet me anytime

Jacksonville your community your world rain continues overnight look for a low Seventy five partly cloudy Tuesday with scattered showers and thunderstorms hides in the mid to upper eighties\nThe mystery behind a chilling video today on the world's\nIn a video you see soldiers leading to women and their children down a dirt path\nAs a point where one of the soldiers sort of tell this child that solar you have to do this kind of thing I'm basically saying if if your parents are you getting killed as well but no one knew where this atrocity took place until a team of reporters figured it out using Google Earth\nWas the government rule dreams that could force immigrant parents to make a difficult choice\nEither keep yourself and your children healthy bug risk being separated for using Medicaid or snap\nOr forego those vital services so your family can remain together in this country those stores today you're on the world\nMy understanding from the early research in prototypes phase of the system was supposed to be able to provide on the order of maybe twenty twenty five to thirty minutes of warning based on the idea that the sensors mounted in the center of the base and in those areas\nSo can you tell us how your system is different from the system but failed to work\nThe main difference between our system and those systems is the lack of a bully that's on the surface things that can get vandalized things that can be damaged in heavy seas and additionally our system communicates remotely to the shore the acoustic signals\nYou mentioned vandalism I mean that was a problem with the system failed to work weren't a lot of the ... just stolen\nI don't know the specifics but in the early days of discussing making these new prototype systems that was\nOne of the concerns is that the systems had been vandalized\nYeah so you're prototype is on the sea floor but it's more than a thousand miles from where the silhouettes they should not be struck a and uh the the epicenter of the quake how helpful wouldn't have been on friday\nWell that particular system may not have been helpful but in the larger picture of the program\nRather than they are just being one censoring on the ocean bottom there would be multiple sensors on the ocean bottom a and they could be in very strategic locations around the area and then each one of those if they made a measurement or multiples if they made a measurement could send the information back to shore acoustic like\nSo there'd been at least ten nominees to hit Indonesia the century so far I mean the death toll is up in the thousands what would it take to get your system up and running to be able to alert people throughout the region\n[noise] it's just a matter of time and having the local governments installed the appropriate infrastructure at the moment we're waiting for the next phase of testing to take place over in Indonesia I think in the spring to which the Indonesian government is installing this cable infrastructure\nCannonball with the woods Hole Oceanographic institution thanks very much for your time today yeah no problem\nNow to a different subject of scientific research the health of the Amazon rain forest in South America the fate of the forest is intertwined with out of the indigenous people who live there and the animal species in the forest is no exaggeration to say that the Amazon is also tied to the future of the world's climate\nThis week on the world we're going to explain why the Amazon is even more consequential than ever reporter Sam eaten traveled there recently for us and our partners at the nation magazine and PBS NewsHour sound joins us now here in our Boston studios so Sam what does the future of the Amazon have to do with the future of the climate\nYeah Michael often we hear of the Amazon for it's incredible biodiversity less often and more so actually you're hearing about the role of the Amazon and the climate\nA lot of times we'll call it the lungs of the planet but actually the metaphor is kind of funny because it's in reverse its absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nAs the trees grow as they as photosynthesis happens it absorbs C. O. two sets of this immense carbon store for the planet providing this incredible service for us the idea for this series of stories that we're going to be running this week on the world\nCame up about a year ago when science magazine published probably the most important and least noticed climate paper in years scientists from Woods Hole Research Center in Boston University found that tropical forests in the Amazon\nAnd around the world have been so degraded by logging and burning of the forest and agriculture that they're actually releasing more carbon into the atmosphere\nThan they're storing a this flipping of these carbon sinks to carbon sources has huge implications for the planet Carlos ... is one of the researchers studying this carbon cycle down in the Amazon this is what he had to say\nIf there was that which is the biggest ... the stops doing these environmental service off sequester each in\nKabul was to the idea is that ... college in ... I was ...\nAnd ... show a great city increments than it has ...\n... what the ... I mean when he said greater increment basically he's he says that we're going to see higher C. O. two concentrations in the atmosphere or the Amazon used to be taking something like all of the emissions from all the cars on the planet and absorbing it into the forest that's not happening anymore so Sam tell us a where\nYou went in this very large forest in South American who did you talk to\nYou know we're talking about a a forest that's the size of the lower forty a United States so a massive area and the idea was\nTo go to the what's called the arc of deforestation this is where the agricultural frontier is basically chewing away at the edges of the Amazon and we wanted to talk to as many of the players so you have basically a logging on the front and then you have cattle ranching and then you have these agriculture kind of coming out on the tail end these massive soy farms\nAnd the idea was to talk to as many of these players as possible and piece together all these complex elements that are behind the rising deforestation rates in the Amazon right\nNow so if the metaphor is as you said earlier the lungs of the world are no longer inhaling like they use are there now coughing what is your take from this whole set of stories that we're going to hear\nI mean I think the biggest takeaway from this is is that there is no clear villain or it's not just\nYou know the illegal loggers going and we need to stop the bulldozers it's all of us essentially so if you're eating beef if your eating other meat that is fed soy that comes from the Brazilian Amazon if you're building a deck that has ... which is one of the highest value hardwood coming from the rain forest\nYou know this is affecting the future of the Amazon Forest and this is something that affects all of us because if we are going to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement\nIt's not going to happen without these forests we actually need to be growing more trees not cutting them down\nYeah and that list you just went down from burgers too hard with like ... from the Amazon will give a lot of Americans pause so I'm not very encouraging picture and was serious consequences or what hope is there any glimmers\nYeah and this was a big focus of our reporting a there's a lot of energy happening down there I'm Around indigenous entrepreneur is small farmers people that are trying to create a standing forests economy how do you value the forest economically more so than cutting it down as a way to kind of get away this duality of\nConservation on one side and extraction on the other which is very much you know a losing game assets as it's been\nAnother glimmer of hope or the indigenous groups that are protecting their forests and this is one of the best productions they've found scientists have documented this hum that indigenous groups who have clear land rights entitled to their land this is one of the best protections against the force station\nSo I spent a lot of time with these indigenous groups that have basically taken of protecting their forced into their own hands they've organized these vigilante militias that patrol their lands to keep the constant pressure of illegal logging out of their lands\nThey've also taking the fight to Brasilia to protest what's happening politically which is rolling back a lot of these indigenous rights so that you could open up their lands to mining and agriculture and I'm One of the organizers of an event that I was there where it was like three thousand indigenous people from a hundred different groups showed up in Brasilia\nAnd protested they marched I'm Sonja ... is one of the main organizers that she's also a vice presidential candidate and the upcoming election and this is what she had to say\nThe vacation is hey these days\nIs so she's saying indigenous people have basically been fighting these forces for millennia and she's saying that the fight is for force that benefit not just the indigenous people but all of humanity so this is not just their cause it's everyone's\nThe lungs of the planet the

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston the United states Canada and Mexico have come to a last minute agreement to update the north American free trade agreement just don't call it NAFTA two point oh\nCalls us embassy a sort of just work and [noise] President Trump at the White House today us MCA is short\nFor the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nKind of flows off the tongue joining me now in the studios the world's Jason Margolis a could've been a riff on ... you know your abbreviated that to happen it could have been taught you could possibly a missed opportunity Jason you've been writing about NAFTA for a long time now how how are people reacting to this new NAFTA this us MCA\nRight well there's the politics and then there's the economic side of it and the quick political reaction is from President Trump we had the worst deal in the history of the world and now it's the greatest deal in the history of the world\nThis landmark agreement will send cash in jobs pouring into the United states and into North America\nGood for Canada good from Mexico and set of jobs leaving for overseas they will be returning back home and we've already at it\nAnd the truth is what was agreed to yesterday it's not a radically different trade agreement from NAFTA it's an updated deal so it's like saying I have a a a baseball team I got rid of a couple of players who was the worst team ever knows the best team ever so when you look at the economics it's not it's not a radical overhaul it updates things\nJason when you come right down to what's really different about us MCA from NAFTA\nSo there are some changes to some key industries for example autos\nAre now requires that Seventy five percent of a car must be made in North America Canada the U.S or Mexico in order to qualify for no tariffs under the new deal the what is it the sorry the U.S MCI\nDoesn't quite flew off my town yet I'm One of the thing that's gotten a lot of attention is us dairy farmers will have more access to the Canadian markets Canadian dairy farmers are not happy about that or they feel they've been used as a political pawn\nThis is David ... she's the vice president of the dairy farmers of Canada and what he had to say\nToday the message sent to are passionate crowd and quality cautious people it's clear\nThey're nothing more than a bargaining chip to satisfy President Trump\nYes oh Canadian dairy farmers not happy I'm can President Trump counts as accurately as a big\nPolitical when I think so it does bring NAFTA into the twenty first century it addresses intellectual property that age of ... I mean this was passed in the early nineties so it does update things\nBut also keep in mind that I spoke with Jason for men who served as President Obama's chief of the council of economic advisors\nHe said yeah this is great that we have some certainty and things are moving forward but all these things were negotiated under an updated Trans Pacific partnership and all these things most of these things were updated the sweat from and told me this morning a\nLot of this is getting things back that Canada had already agreed to in another agreement two years ago\nWhat happens now when does this deal become real\nSo the easy part is done getting the three leaders of these countries to reach an agreement in their trade representative now comes the hard part and here's President Trump speaking today the White House\nPlans assigned the agreement by the end of November by then we'll submitted\nFor approval to Congress where in theory there should be no trouble but anything you submit to Congress has trouble\nOr no matter what\nThe single greatest agreement ever say they'll say well you know Trump likes it therefore we're not going to approve it because that would be good for the Republicans so therefore we can't support of it\nDoes strike me though that the Republicans will still be in control of Congress at the end of November\nThey will but this will probably lead into next year\nAnd remember a lot of Democrats were with President Trump on this issue they wanted NAFTA to be updated they felt it was very unfair to labor or they want an environmental provisions and I have not read through this entire revision nor have my sources this is thirty six chapters in these chapters\nTen to twenty pages so it's going to take many weeks to digest this and little parts are going to be coming out like how did the Florida tomato growers fair\nHow did the avocado growers fair how did this industry fair how did that industry we don't really know the nitty gritty and remember with all trade deals there are winners and losers and there's going to be people in Canada\nThe U.S and Mexico who say yes I really came out well in this I came out ahead and other people say you did what you did what to my industry so that is going to be coming out in the next few weeks\nYou know obviously the details of the world's best Margolis telling about the new NAFTA known as the United states Mexico Canada agreement thanks very much ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe Trump administration's treatment of undocumented migrant children as in the news again\nOver the weekend the New York times published a report about a tent city in West Texas where many of these children are now being held the sense that in the town of tornado Texas has been massively expanded and hundreds of immigrant minors have reportedly been ferried there from shelters elsewhere in the country in the middle of the night\nOne important no these are not the same kids who were separated from their parents at the border early in the summer some of them are still being held in process by the government\nThis is a different population these miners in the west Texas camp are mainly teenagers who were detained after trying to enter the country by themselves Leah ... is an attorney with the women's refugee commission\nThe tent camp is you know pretty remote\nIt's very far from El Paso which I think is the closest city there's not a lot of vegetation is just you know kind of think the picture's really speak for themselves you'll there's rows and rows of those tents that are that children's living quarters or they have a couple other facilities on site in dining facilities and the like but\nBut it you know it is remote ended on\nIt you feel like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on how how does the do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from a facility where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty children so much more of a homey environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects all in some English the also have regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist [noise] a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving\nAnd or possibly in route and so\nAnd so it's very important that these children have you know the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like turning out this emergency facility we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work books but\nThat's not a education yet not far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really hot\nIt's really the onus is on the child to\nTo ask for it but you know they've just been transition there from a different facility and they don't know anyone there disoriented possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um and it's quite stable I think\nYou're a member of mine kinda boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "01"}
