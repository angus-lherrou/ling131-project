I'm a librarian at you and what is known for a long time and I'm about ten years ago she said I have some material no one's ever seen\nAnd that is what prompted the in the book because there were personal letters notes note cards and particularly a group of short stories and I recognized immediately that they were a witness accounts consumers Thirteen when he came here\nWhile writing the book George Merrick son of the south when our but more parks had access to ... personal papers and documents as well as people who knew him\nWell I did a Richard share stories so that they want things I think I learn from Richard is what George was really like as a human being ah and and everybody also told me that of all the ... children he and Richard where the most like\nOh there was this intellectual stricken artistic straight and uh so I was able to well I Do feel like I Know George Mary from all of research on particular reading a so much of what he wrote\nAn Eighteen Ninety nine George ... family moved from ... Massachusetts to Miami, Florida to participate in the citrus industry the pioneering spirit of his family helped to inspire the Thirteen year old George Merrick\nI think the fact that when it got here everybody had to learn his father and mother were both college graduates and they moved into the back country into an old homestead because his father wanted to leave the ministry and race grapefruit\nAnd George was only Thirteen and so he he did not go back to school but he worked in the field to help his father he worked with a bunch of the young teenage ... from coconut grove who became is very dear friend whose only friends\nSo they became pioneers but they had a very different background they were intellectual college graduates in an era when they're well all of those around\nAs a young man towards marriage dreamed of transforming his family's land into a beautiful planned community he was not a typical developer Florida land as parks explains he wanted to create an affordable place to live with public infrastructure to benefit residence\nHe was very visual and he read all the time and and he would take the vegetables into the city of Miami a everyday when he was a teenager again and and he would read books and he would go from what is now called gamble sit down down my that was took four hours\nAnd uh and he read both ways and he'd love Washington Irving Jon Hamm ... that's where he got a lot of ideas and he would look and see the timeline\nAnd uh then we went to New York\nAll his father wanted him to go to law school he lived with his uncle them and think\nTo what's his mother's brother who was an illustrator an artist so you're getting all this visual and they began to talk about making a planned community was architectural control that's what's really unique about coral Gables even to this day so he went around and looked at all\nOther plant communities in the north and then he and Democrats bank really and a landscape architect that he meant by accident named Frank bug new came down to work for the ... and his first cousin George ... they did the original plan for ...\nGeorge Merrick worked with a team of architects city planners and landscapers to make his dream of coral Gables or reality are but more parks describes what makes the look of the community unique\nWell I think there are two things first of all they have an architectural board on and I I'm middle unhappy with them as we speak their lead to a lot of white boxers sandwich bother me but they've always had pets so you can't build anything and coral Gables unless you go to the architecture board\nAnd when George for post sat originally people said nobody will buy but of course they did\nThen the other thing that really makes ... cable should make us a landscaping George planted thirty thousand trade\nWhen they started building the glass boxes we got the Mediterranean ordinance passed in ... and what is it allows you if you build with a Mediterranean style new building\nOr you get to go a little taller so we're getting towers back and he loved his powers you know the bill Moore and also if you save a historic building you can transfer your development right to get a little taller over what you're building new\nSo I think in a mess in the eighties and nineties I think it was\nAbout to go away with a glass boxes and that got stopped too so it's it's been very successful the values have gone up and I think people realize that it is the architectural controls probably more than anything else that have kept the feeling in coral Gables today\nThe Florida land boom of the Nineteen twenties was followed by a bust and then the great depression George Merrick lost his fortune\nHe was literally thrown out in Nineteen twenty eight because they're ... they had created a shitty he was on the commission or but he was having some health problems and they threw him off the commission 'cause she missed too many meetings\nAnd he tried to start George American corporate and but you know I'm the depression had hit then and he didn't have any money really to invest anymore he was losing you know property and things are being foreclosed [noise]\nSo he um\nHe never got better and I can never figure out while some it's the ... the man the man is a man of great character and he ended up in Nineteen forty taking the stand for postmaster and he had the highest score and he actually became postmaster of Miami\nAnd uh and they loved the postman loved it because he treated them as they call the first thing he did was give equal pay the women who were working in the post office department I mean he did things that really brief time\nOh and then the big mural that's in the central courtroom which was also the federal courthouse at the time was done by demonstrating and if you could look at it carefully you'll see a lot of the coral Gables Shuster painted into the wall\nMerrick never recovered financially at his
