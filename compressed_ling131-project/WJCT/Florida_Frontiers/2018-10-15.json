advertisement was the number one medium and talk about the age of fear in Florida with historian and author Garry Moore amino all that ahead on Florida frontiers [laughter]\nThat's music from a dance scene in the Nineteen sixty six films Johnny Tiger where chat ... as the title character does\nPelvic through us hip shakes and jumps with abandon in uh Florida bar Johnny Tiger is a seminal caught between tradition and modern society the movie was shot in central Florida including a shamrock studios in winter park\nFlorida played a major role in the film industry from the very beginning particularly in Jacksonville Rodney cabin work throughout Florida in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as a film director and production manager\nYes artifice secondhand for the pope who founded cypress gardens I was walking encyclopedia of motion picture business and then a lot to do with promoting the state of Florida\nAnd a according to him and Nineteen eleventh two Thirteen that era Jacksonville was the world wintertime headquarters of motion picture industry goes guess what I was in Fort Lee New Jersey which is where the movies were made it snowed in the wintertime so they came as far south as flavors railroad would go\nAnd at one time or eighty five companies working in Jacksonville and understand and Nineteen twelve of serving over a hundred million dollars gross business most companies in Nineteen twelve money\nAnd a hell wrote suppose there by a draft though that a lot of the little people\nBut uh it went because of two reasons first of all of a lot of small companies there that didn't bother to their budgets to try and they needed a fire truck going by they simply set up a camera on a Jacksonville St Paul fire alarm box and they do their car chases amongst the street cars without advising the street car company\nAnd that sort of upset the city fathers so they were not too friendly the boy but at that stage that the industry was beginning to move with\nAnd that kind of the end of the big held in Jacksonville at that time\nPhil Simpson writes about film and is president of the popular culture association and American culture association\nThe film industry did not begin in uh California as many people might assume it actually began in New York City and Chicago\nBut uh the early film industry did do quite a bit down south including in Florida and in fact one of the first early film studios was Kayla him and that was set up in Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd they did a lot with a early silent film including giving Oliver Hardy starred in silent film\nSo I thought that was a really impressive accomplishment um Florida film industry back then\nAnd uh Jacksonville uh was initially it was quite welcoming toward the early film industry\nAnd in fact the mirror there provided a lot of economic incentives for the film industry to set up and Jacksonville\nNow in about Nineteen Seventeen uh the mayor had a reform candidate running against him and the reform candidate had pledged to do something about the disruption of the film industry was causing in the streets of Jacksonville uh because as I'm sure you know there's a lot of disruption little film company causes and the normal\nDay to day uh in any town also the sensibilities of some citizens were offended because the film companies would sometimes stage scenes in public on Sundays and I didn't go over well\nWith a reform candidate did win and uh so therefore Jacksonville suddenly was not so friendly to the early film industry [noise]\nUh there were other companies are in the early silent era in Florida including the norm in film manufacturing company\nAnd they were significant because the used all African American actors as their cash to and this was for segregated audiences in Florida\nBut it did provide an opportunity for early black actors to\nPerform in a really leading roles and it was a non stereotypical kind of role\nOn so I thought that was also very significant to know about early Florida film history so the\nMajor film studios began to set up in Hollywood, California because that was a much more economically friendly environment for them and being moving away from Florida and other cities in the south\nBut still there is a pretty significant early presidents in Florida the film industry\nAfter the major film studios moved to California following World War one Florida remained a popular place for location shooting\nBy the mid twentieth century smaller films studios appeared around the state and some were involved in major productions bruso Donahue is the owner of control specialists a traffic engineering and management company his business is in a building that used to be shamrock film studios in winter park\nWe moved into this building a Nineteen Ninety five and at the time\nWe get our bucket trucks uh service our businesses and then a traffic signal systems and operations and maintenance and show\nA gentleman Gordon ... who came and certified vehicles said you're not going to believe this but I used to work for Davey tree two doors down and\nHe made it sound like Nineteen sixty one or sixty today said that they were shooting a project and they needed a sixty foot bucket truck and they got Davey tree they rented a truck and I took the camera man up and he says that yard you've got back there\nAnd he says they dumped a truckload of a white sand and planted some palm trees and from sixty feet up with a camera and made it look like you were looking at a pollination island and he said it was pretty spectacular so that place was called shamrock studios\nAnd he says and I think they ended up making a movie and a ... moved\nOut Hollywood so that was kind of fun and he showed us all around the building so this is what this was for us was that was for because he was part of that film at the time\nAfter shamrock studios left the building and the Nineteen seventies it was occupied by a pest control company and Palmer electric current owner bruso Donahue says the building design is clearly best suited for a movie production company\nThe officers in front of the building and seemed to be sort of executive management style offices um this is a building that I'm not sure an architect would be proud of it looks like it just sort of keeps going like the Energizer Bunny I mean this at sixteen thousand square feet under roof or which is hard to believe and when you said the warehouse\nAnd and again the bathrooms are not small bathrooms there are large because they were showers and dressing rooms so it is it's a big place\nFilmmaker Rodney cabin\nWe were here with the picture go Johnny Tiger woods universal reason sixty six ... sixty four we did on terriers and here\nWe had an extra location and all the old hotel and these are the hotel room interiors that if we're the seeds of took place there and then we had a bedroom seen for the house it was out on our location or garbage springs which is just a false front\nSo we're here about three days it was a nice studio work very well Robert Taylor ... Scott ... three stories of all the shots here\nBuilding owner Bruce Donahue\nWhat word using as our our business warehouse was originally a use for South stage and uh and production for whatever they were filming whether it was my understanding it could've been commercials could have been second yeah production for movies or TV shows\nA ... and so when you look at the ceiling you notice that there is electrical outlets and other pieces of equipment that was probably used for a while they had to do for by the ... or other equipment\nAre clearly not a normal warehouse it was definitely use for ah for film production\nFilmmaker Rodney cabin\nRight now of course the warehouse but as a studio and this was wide open space until the production company moved and we've had this set up a which was free walls entered stores and all the things like that and the all the furniture and props and make it look like a real interior seen\nOn the floor was a quarter of light stands with the lights and grip equipment and the various things like that it's cable snake go over the floor of the light distribution to the lights and then of course the camera and the camera Dali and they had to keep doing things clear so he could move around as as needed for the shot\nSo it was a quarter in a way but it entirely different clutter than it is today typical movies that\nCabin has fond memories of working on the film Johnny Tiger\nWas Robert Taylor's last feature he did a to made for TV movies room GM before he passed away and and this see look for as a crowning changing his career is that I'm fifty years old why am I making love to twenty two year old these pictures into this is my change from her romantic lead\nTo a character lead and they really look forward to it in fact\nHe was willing to do anything to promote the movie he was so thrilled about the change very nice gentleman enjoyed working with Robert very much\nIn addition to owning the building that formerly housed shamrock studios bruso Donahue has another tied to the film industry in Florida appearing in the Nineteen eighty nine Ron Howard film Parenthood\nSo I was president of the college part little league or they needed extras uh for the little league scenes and a coach mellor for the city of Orlando called me and and then said heads up you're going to get a phone call from these folks and so we ended up getting thirty six a voice from the college part little league\nAnd uh actually they I was not going to be in the film but I was going to be there to make sure everybody was safe and a Robert Stewart city commissioner today was supposed to be the base on fire for us and he was on fire for the league", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Florida Frontiers", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "15"}
