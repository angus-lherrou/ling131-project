trying to chronicle a way of life that was quickly changing by the end of the nineteenth century into the twentieth century\nAnd we'll talk about the Melrose ladies literary and debating society all that ahead on Florida frontiers [noise]\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nCase Stephen princes associate professor of history at the University of South Florida and author of the book stories of the south race in the reconstruction of southern identity\nEighteen sixty five to Nineteen fifty we spoke with Dr prince just before the sixth annual ... shop and our lecture on Florida history and culture at the University of central Florida\nWhere he was presenting on the topic reconsidering reconstruction regional national and global perspective reconstruction is traditionally identified as having lasted from Eighteen sixty five to Eighteen Seventy seven but prince advocates for extending that date\nI Do yeah uh I mean there's Eighteen Seventy seven is absolutely an important moment I think we need to to take it seriously both as a sort of political watershed as well as a symbolic moment you have if you look at a press in Eighteen Seventy seven you have people commenting on this was the end of an Arab this is the end of reconstruction\nBut one of the points that I've made in my work and then I'm going to make it my my remarks this evening is that there are a lot of continuity use that stretched through Eighteen Seventy seven and if we allow ourselves to be\nTo sort of taken with that moment as an end point of reconstruction we risk missing those longer continuity um so there are a variety of issues that simply aren't solved and an Eighteen Seventy set and the the the\nFate of the civil rights political rights if it fried people the relationship between the sections of the role of the federal government and I think to to at least is a thought experiment to to think in terms of along reconstruction a sort of changes our our perspective on on the post civil war period and enriches I think both you know the\nBy taking a longer view those twelve years between eight and sixty five an Eighteen Seventy seven suddenly become more than just the sort of passing fancy or an aberration they become sort of indicative of a lot of the conversations that will be happening over over the longer stretch of time\nSo this is not something I expected to necessarily you know filter into textbooks necessarily but I think I think it's worth at least considering what happens\nIf we if we don't you know stop our story of reconstruction in Nineteen Seventy seven and carry it a decade or two further on\nIn his book stories of the south race in reconstruction of southern identity Eighteen sixty five to Nineteen Fifteen prints focuses on popular culture as well as politics to increase our understanding of the reconstruction era and beyond\nWhat stories of the south really does is it tries to combine what are generally two separate historical conversations one having to do with race politics and and reconstruction\nThe other having to do with the re fashioning of of the identity of the south I'm after after the civil war a soy argue that what you see in in the fifth year period is really a national conversation between northerners and southerners between African Americans and white people about\nThe nature of the south what this place is what it has been what it will be what his role in every United Nation will be [noise]\nUm and argue that you can't really understand the story of reconstruction particularly the long retreat for reconstruction with out simultaneously paying attention to that larger conversation about the nature of the south\n... very definition that as a conversation that's happening in a much broader venue array of uh Venus than than simply you know the halls of Congress and presidential addresses and the places that we usually look for our stories of reconstruction [noise]\nSo uh tonight for example I'm now I'm going to talk about an event that happens in Brooklyn New York and Eighteen Ninety five where a a theatrical promoter builds a southern plantation hires about five hundred African American actors to play laborers on this plantation their status as free orange slave does not entirely clear\nThis is again isn't that that happens in Eighteen Ninety five in New York and to me how can we not include that sort of event yes it's yes it's theater uh yes it is it is\nA sort of peripheral bizarre spectacular one off kind of event but on the other hand to me that have been told us everything about the the sort of long retreat from reconstruction the idea that\nA northerners would it be interested in that event in in Eighteen Ninety five the idea that you could sort of a race the story of emancipation by creating this this timeless a southern space in Brooklyn\nSo I think you know turning to popular culture turning two sources that traditionally don't make it into our stories of reconstruction really as an opportunity to to enrich what we what we have to say about the period\nThat's not to say of course that I don't look at congressional debates and presidential speeches I think these things need to be considered in\nIn in tandem is is really what it is and to to do one without the other is to to miss the significance of of both I think\nDespite the promise of reconstruction the Jim Crow system was firmly in place by Eighteen Seventy seven subjugate ing African Americans in a variety of ways prince thinks that's why we should extend the date of reconstruction\nIf you're looking for an end to the reconstruction story I think it is the rise of Jim Crow which\nUh is in its infancy in the Eighteen eighties it's by the Eighteen nineties but it's really a you have the the\nSystematic franchise amount of African Americans across the south you have to widespread a establishment of segregation statutes and the Eighteen nineties and the first decade of twenty century is also going to be the peak of ... racial lynching I'm so to me that that's a more logical\nMoment to sort of consider as an end point uh for for the the store to belong to Rita rita reconstruction as opposed to about Eighteen Seventy seven moment\nIn addition to the production of black America in New York prince looks at many cultural expressions of history and his book\nAbsolutely I mean the black America is only the the Eighteen Ninety five sort of plantation a theatrical event is is really only won of of any number of sources um [noise] so in other places I I spend time looking at travel narratives um both offered authored right after the civil war and a whole bunch written in the Eighteen eighties northerners who trust\nThrough the south and write up their experiences and and sort of explain what this place is a popular conversation to have a whole chapter that looks at a sort of popular depictions of the Ku Klux Klan and the carpet backers as sort of\nTwin poles of a conversation about the shortcomings of reconstruction of what's really going wrong in the south is at the violence of white southerners in the guise of the Ku Klux Klan or is it the corruption of of you know so called adventurers who come into the south from elsewhere\nOr I look at a plantation fiction written by Tom cells and page joke Chandler Harris Charles just not an African American author who writes some important sort of counter works to those famous white southern authors of a plantation fiction\nMore widely or look a dead menstrual see 'em so they they black America story is part of a larger sort of change in in the tradition of blackface minstrel see\nEr which gets its its start before the civil war but it remains extraordinarily popular through this period and to the Eighteen eighties Nineteen nineties in fact I think you see some of the most interesting developments in that theatrical form during and after reconstruction though we tend to think of it predominantly as a antebellum sort of form it definitely it definitely last\nSo yeah I mean it's been putting to book together as sort of tried to cast a broad net and to bring in a variety of sources events and perspectives that that\nAre generally invited to the party when we're talking about sort of the literature of reconstruction and and its aftermath and catching that brought a net I again I Hope you know not at the expense of politics now to the exclusion of politics but in order to to shed new light on on political occurrences I think I think looking at a popular culture is is really useful in that sense\nCase Stephen Prince proposes that rather than ending an Eighteen Seventy seven the era of reconstruction could more appropriately conclude and Nineteen Fifteen with the release of the film birth of the nation\nExactly it's uh that's I mean that's where the book ends it's partially for convenience sake um you know I mean there there are certainly longer legacy of reconstruction than that you know we can we talk about are we still live in the reconstruction I don't know\nNineteen fifty and the birth of a nation seemed a reasonable moment or the film is extraordinarily popular it is a sort of watershed in the history of film and also a convenient sort of bookmark or where the sort of you know ... magnum opus of southern lost cause apple ... becomes you know the the\nMost significant um you know cultural form in the country\nUh for for a period of time effort to release a Nineteen Fifteen I'm so it provides a convenient and certainly Nineteen Fifteen but I'm I'm not arguing that that is in any way you know the only place that we could we could take our store to reconstruction I think it you know one among many\nPrince points out that reconstruction Arab policies are still affecting Floridians today\nOr one of one of the things that I've been working on recently one of the things that I I Do care pretty deeply about both as a as a scholar and also just as a\nCitizen of the Florida uh is is amendment for the attempt to to restore voting rights to to one point four million Floridians who are are systematically denied the right to vote due to a prior felony conviction\nFlorida is one of only a handful of states where it is as hard for former felons to have their voting rights restored it it's really out of the mainstream in terms of the most other states
