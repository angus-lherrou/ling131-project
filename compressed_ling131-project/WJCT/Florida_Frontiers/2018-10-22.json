evolution of land use and how that's changed\nAnd we'll talk about Florida's first professional football team the Miami Seahawks all that ahead on Florida frontiers\nRather than speak on the Senate or house representative yesterday some bus sat in Nineteen forty one\nAnd they live in and from a United States of America was suddenly I ever made a lot of the ... by a ban\nWithin an hour of the speech delivered by president Franklin Delano Roosevelt on December eighth Nineteen forty one\nCongress voted to bring the United states into World War two the war had a major impact on the growth of Florida which is reflected in a permanent exhibit at the museum of Florida history in Tallahassee Bruce ... is senior museum curator\nThis was an exhibit that to the floor to department of Veterans Affairs work with the museum on it was two thousand four we installed this exhibit and it's part of a larger project they had that included a a\nFour to World War two heritage trail the three dimensional off war to World War two a monument\nOut in front of the building and then this is the museums component and um as you say a Florida those\nRole in World War two ah really transformative a Florida was relatively\nRural area before World War two large influx of servicemen for training during the war or industry like ship building occurred and by the time the war was over\nWe're looking into getting into what's considered modern Florida\nDuring World War two Florida's population exploded Key West at Thirteen thousand residence in Nineteen forty and forty five thousand by wars in five years later\nThe population of Miami almost double to more than three hundred and twenty five thousand Florida became a training ground for American troops\nWill we begin or exhibits looking and emphasizing a military training in Florida because that was one of the key aspects of uh what was going on here in the state for instance naval aviation and a U.S army ah\nAir force or aviation work key here there was a huge number of bases and outlying feels Florida's mild climate flat terrain that allowed for a year round training for aviation so that's something that was a real concentration here in the state\nAlso in addition I'm here at like say a camp landing which is now a National Guard camp or during World War two it said population wise to have been the fourth largest city in the state\nAnd so it was an area that was training or both or infantry divisions and then individual a replacement soldiers between camp blending and also camp Gordon Johnston down on the coast it ... they had done a amphibious training there between those two bases\nThe or three a significant to us or infantry divisions that when a short Normandy has some of their training\nHere in Florida so it wasn't just aviation a ground forces were also a very active in training in the state uh down in Daytona Beach\nUh the wax the women's auxiliary corps was developed a training base and that was partly as a result of a\nNoted African American educator Mary McLeod buffoon has lobbied a President Roosevelt to set up a whack training base and so from Nineteen forty two to early Nineteen forty for a large number of\nWomen trained here in Florida\nThe world war two exhibit on permanent display at the museum of Florida history in Tallahassee includes informational panels and displays of uniforms photographs and artifacts curator Bruce Gratz\nSome of them are representative examples of we have a a infantry soldiers fatigues a Web belt uh then we also have some photos of the\nClasses century military classes that trained at camp blending and are they even have something like a souvenir pillow cover that soldiers would buy and then send home to sweethearts as a token of where they were a training here in Florida\nFlorida's participation in World War two went beyond serving as a training ground for soldiers immediately after the United states joined the war German submarines began attacking supply ships off the coast of Florida\nIndeed uh in the early months of the war pretty much about the first seven months of Nineteen forty two was a time where German U boats are submarines\nOr attacking a uh allied freighters or that we're going around like this through the straits of Florida between Florida and Cuba and then\nThey were taking the Gulf Stream and coming right up along the eastern coast so uh quite a few uh tankers and freighters were attacked and sunk in Florida\nAnd this was before they were able to get to effect to a naval escort and a convoy operations and eventually and a leader a Nineteen forty two the Germans pretty much pulled back their offensive in order to uh\nTo concentrate on defending Europe but for the early part of the war there were instances like off Jacksonville where civilians would see a burning tanker and even see the submarine surface so\nIt really brought the war home to Florida\nIt was not uncommon during World War two to see men working in Florida citrus groves wearing clothing marked with peas and double use indicating that they were German prisoners of war Bruce Gratz\nWere brought back a first from the north African campaigns also for some caption or does submariners and then eventually from Europe and Italy and uh they were put to work many times like picking citrus ah they had them station\nIn POW camps are particularly around like camp blending\nAnd uh as I've mentioned before that Germans were captured and brought to Florida we're considered fortunate as opposed to Germans who were captured by the Russians and take in Siberia\nSo um they were held and bases around the Florida and even held in Florida for a while after the war ended or just because there was so much a displaced persons in Europe and so they took a classes in English and uh American values\nIn addition to the German POW clothing the world war two exhibit at the museum of Florida history includes a variety of American uniforms worn by both men and women\nWe tried to be a particularly careful to include all of a major military services\nUm there's examples of a officers a uniform from a U.S submarine commander who received the navy cross\nAnd a next to it is a unlisted man's a sonar operators a uniform and to the right of that there's a a U.S marine dress code\nAnd um we also have a illustrations such as a photograph of one of the members of the seminal tribal Florida who joined the U.S Marines fought in the Pacific and later became a head of the ... tribe in Florida\nIn terms of army materials we have an eye jacket from a highly decorated officer and a sink lewd says metals such as the distinguished service cross the silver star the bronze star and the Purple Heart\nAnd he had fought to the Bible the ball and uh other I'm a military campaigns in Europe\nAnd in addition to that there is also a artifacts from individuals who served in the army air forces\nAnd one of the interesting items is an escape map from the China Burma India theater where it has in a seven different language is the pilot who was shot down could show it to a native and then be able to go back to his own lines asking for help\nAfrican Americans played a crucial role in World War two some of the famous Tuskegee Airmen were from Florida\nThis is a portion of the ah African Americans in the military exhibit we have um during the war I'm more than a fifty thousand black Floridians entered the military and different uh ... predominantly in the army\nAnd are often or as a support personnel such as a truck drivers and other types of a\nMilitary service support although I'm we highlight some of the most dramatic service which was with the Tuskegee Airman and uh we're very fortunate to have had donated for this exhibit um some of the memorabilia\nOf James poking horn um\nWho's um as in Pensacola and including his posture most Purple Heart a he was um a Tuskegee Airman fighter pilot who was flying a straight thing mission in
