University of West Florida Florida Atlantic north Florida central Florida ... had the oldest one University of Florida\nOr other places are so there are hundreds\nOf graduate students working in archaeology riding feces and dissertation they are so much more sophisticated than I ever was as a graduate student\nThere are new techniques that we never had and we are area remote sensing a kinds of remote sensing where you're pro poll magic machines across the ground and they help you to see what's underneath that new ways of recording data new kinds of analysis looking at the bones of the animals that the people eight\nSo I Love to go to the annual meeting of the Florida anthropological society where the students and others are presenting their papers it's just\nAmazing to me how much more we know than we knew forty years ago well now it's getting close to fifty I guess when I was just getting started I I'm thrilled about what's going on and the future is bright indeed archeology and and Florida\nLike history is flourishing and one of the things that we have in Florida is a long tradition going back into the forties and Nineteen fifties of archaeologist and historians

early Nineteen hundreds as ... explains archaeologists have a love hate relationship with more\nClarence Bloomfield more was a um a rich guy his father had a help found a paper company that was actually based in Delaware but see more went to Harvard grew up in Philadelphia\nAnd became interested in both archeology and photography I think while he was at Harvard\nAnd beginning in a about the Eighteen nineties about Eighteen Ninety can be can traveling to Florida to look at archaeological sites I think that he had vacation with his family early on near green coat springs in a hotel which I found\nInformation on um had a darkroom maybe that's why you liked it\nBut he became interested in the shell mountains that were on the St Johns river and\nDecided that he would use his resources to mount expeditions and so every winter beginning about Eighteen Ninety two or three or he wouldn't\nTravel from Philadelphia usually by train or come down to say in Jacksonville and there he had a rented a steamboat\nOh I think the first one was called the alligator\nAnd later he builds his own but every\nWinter he would travel to the south go to where the steamboat was or get on it or you had some people that came with them and then they would hire an African American crew\nAnd they would travel uh originally the St Johns river the ... they go around the Gulf Coast they come up to crystal river Florida and excavate they do the Florida Panhandle they'd go up the Mississippi\nHe traveled all post every ... river in the southeast\nA from a Eighteen nineties way up to about Nineteen twenty and excavated literally hundreds perhaps thousands of archaeological sites mainly mountains\nCB Moore's documentation was meticulous his excavation techniques were destructive by modern standards\nGood thing that he did was every season he wrote up what he found and he took wonderful photographs or he often\nThe materials unless they were like ... or something he didn't want a but we have those materials today the artifacts we have his original notes we have is reports\nSo we have a lot of information on the other hand if those sites still exist in today and we dug them with the modern methods that we have we would have learned a heck of a lot more sad thing is that people have abused they have\nRated and uh the and destroyed an archaeological sites not only in Florida but other states beginning well before Eighteen nineties and it's doubtful up any of the sites that he excavated a would exist\nToday you know and touched they would have been rated of many of the sites still do exist like at crystal river we can visit those many around Tampa Bay mound villain Alabama so we'd love\nA CB more for recording all his data uh we hate him because he dug those mountains and obviously destroyed a lot of information to use it very very interesting guy and I learned that he died\nGrew about a Nineteen thirty over in St Petersburg where he wouldn't spending winters in a house and he died in the hospital there that was right next to a mountain that he had excavated about Nineteen ten or something like that\nMore do right into Indian mound to see what he could find it his defense archeology as a discipline was in its infancy when more was excavating and Florida\nClarence more did the best he could he was a smart guy and archeology was just getting cranked up ah he was never really trained as an archaeologist never received no training but he understood enough by corresponding with archaeologist about taking\nMeasurements and trying to map aside in three dimensions and so if you can try to reconstruct it\nA century after CB more in Nineteen Ninety eight a discovery was made in downtown Miami that became known as the Miami Circle archaeologists believed that the circle is evidence of a structure from a prehistoric settlement from two thousand years ago\n... has reservations about the Miami circles age and authenticity\nThey don't like me a lot in Miami uh when I first was asked by the state to go down there and I'll never forget I was on the airplane going down\nI was handed a photograph of the Miami Circle and I said God what is that big rectangular thing looks like a four by a piece of plywood right on the perpendicular by sector of the interior of the circle which is about twenty eight feet in diameter\nThree state officials looked at one another and they said it's a septic tank I sat and watched a so I think that\nThe research question should have been\nHow did that septic tank get there they go with the apartments built in the Nineteen forties did it go with one of the earlier Brickell houses that was there was there perhaps a circular structure some kinds built over that septic tank\nIt turns out that in South Florida in the past when they had septic tanks and they were put into limestone you couldn't have a drain field because affluent wouldn't drain through the limestone so you simply let the septic
