S. daily oil use that day was nothing more than a pair of bolt cutters or in some research and\nWhen you do something like that you make it clear to people that those companies need our implicit consent in order to operate they have millions of miles a pipeline they have oil trains coming through all of our communities\nWe know that if we let them continue on with business as usual they are destroying the world as we know it quite literally and we can step up and stuff that you know whether it's training ourselves in governors offices you know whether it is you know swimming to sites where they're trying to build new infrastructure like we had the Standing Rock\nYou know whether it's shutting off pipelines are black hating oil trains there are numerous ways that people can stand up and make a real difference and make it clear that we're not going to go down without a fight\nEmily Internet would one clinic civil disobedience in this country one Henry David Thoreau Martin Luther king junior or to what extent do you feel connected to those efforts of the past\nVery much so I mean you know when you have unjust laws or unjust policies you sometimes have to\nBreak laws you know in order to call the attention you need to get things changed there's often this idea that you know it's a bad thing to break the law but I can say is a former lawyer that just because something is\nLegal does not mean is this moral there have been many many laws in the past that have been totally immoral slavery being a good example\nThis is Emily I was going to say also you know I may I read on civil disobedience for as a kid and certainly read about Martin Luther king and Gandhi and not enough pictures like that\nAnd I do feel that that's an incredibly important example and tradition the other thing I think about with regard to climate change more recently I've been thinking a little bit about people like Raul while I'm broke the Swedish diplomat who saved many thousands of Jews during a\nWorld War two and in a way that climate change fight has a lot in common with that because you know so many people get overwhelmed and think\nWell there's catastrophe coming I Can't do anything about it\nBut you just get up every day and you do the best you can and you have what you can save and there's still quite a lot that we can save and so\nLike can we save life as we know it probably not can we save everybody old definitely not we already have failed to do that but we can get up every day and we can save a tremendous amount and we have a lot of power that way and it's out or we need to utilize\nI was gonna ask you and that are obviously concerned enough about climate to reduce spending time in prison what keeps you from total despair\nThere are days when it is total despair but I feel\nI have no option but to continue to fight for what there is still to fight for and you know as Emily says it's you know it's not absolute anything we can save is worth saving\nAnd I often say you know what are my alternatives I might just gonna sit home and watch TV and wait for the world and I absolutely am not so\nAt worst I can go down fighting with the best people I Know and that is worth doing I remember that Alice Walker said resistance is the secret of joy and I have found that to be absolutely true\nWhen you exercise your power and do everything that you can to stop a great evil it is a joyful thing\nAnd we saw some as opposed to the courts team is a retired attorney and they are two of the five bell Turner's thank you so much for taking the time

thousand is our goal but four thousand once you get above a thousand you're getting something that you're going to definitely getting something out of it\nA couple of things first of all you don't

R. G. and don't forget we are on Facebook\nOr numbers on ruined for six to seven for one free that's is on ruined for six to\nSeven for one free ... let's see if we can hope ... Green Bay Wisconsin\nHi hello hello or by the doctors\nOr but I have I should say two questions but ah my first one is most important much second is the kind of go skating loving and Corey [noise] if we have\nTime but number one goal and exercise um I've been arguing that walking on the golf course is a form of exercise and I wanted to get your perspective about\nGolfing and exercise and that that could be almost substituted or going to the gym or the recommended amount for a day that I'm often is suggested for folks in reference to getting exercise in our life\nYou're absolutely correct golf is great exercise first while you're walking the course I mean golf cart is not the same as walking walking the course and it's funny my dad\nHe always walk the course and when he died and I wrote in the whole bit you know I said he was a lifelong golfer and he always walk the course I'd a lot of people who sat golfers your right your dad walk the course when he got to be to got to be older he got an electric car so that he didn't have to push the card all the time\nBut you walking you're pushing the car you're taking it on you there's no doubt it's exercise you're swinging\nYou're moving your body is sort of it's not yoga but it's stretching your body [noise]\nDefinitely definitely definitely and you know it's usually you know you're doing four to five miles and that's really good and you know you're you know Mark Twain Mark Twain said a golf is a good walk spoiled\nEditor in [laughter] new [laughter] that\nHe had a different you but when I I Love golfing I think when I golf I don't go that often maybe five times a year with my friend Dan and uh and we make up our score before we started so we don't really have to keep\nTrack of [laughter] can't go up by the number six that's one of our rules owns or NATO who wins of course being or after we're on after\nOn the course of the answer's yes golfing is good exercise and I know you can argue it doesn't have cardio vascular exercise that is true but the reality is a good exercise just means you're moving your body and doing something and so yeah yeah definitely no doubt about it no doubt about it you like to golf huh\nI Do I Do and I I I've been mixed reactions from\nFriends and colleagues because I've average I argued as you mentioned on average orders six miles every time depending on the side of the golf course\nHere you're doing you're doing ten thousand twelve thousand steps what you do is put on us you know you take your smartphone put on moves or the apple lab and then figure out how many how many steps you actually work and when they shun you and go what are you doing your dream and look I Walk ten or twelve thousand steps how many steps did you get today you know\nThis is where the counts manners not size but the ... so\nMuch in the Congo scathing loving and great ah\nIs is I was I got to the show I was driving and I just listening to your boat [noise] uh but as an African American male I thought is this the the knowledge Dr disease delivering\nApplicable in my neighborhood so I didn't know if y'all\nGet any special diversity shows or how would you respond when I felt like this was good information but I don't know what I Know people in my neighborhood are getting it why candidates outlook directly applicable 'cause we can have a very different experience that the doctors are with health and health care\nFirst of all the number one it is a pickle ball and when we talk about things for instance like hypertension if you're an African American you use different blood pressure pills and if you're a Caucasian so for instance ACE inhibitors I mean they're just they're they're different pills that we use if you're an African American\nBecause you respond to medication differently but for other things for most other things like stands and everything else it's the same the Mediterranean diet is the same following the same food groups at the same but reaching people is not necessarily the same now I also\nAh in in Madison, Wisconsin I also do TV and I do TV it used to do TV twice a week and I do it now ah I Do now once a week or once every other week\nAnd it turns out that I reach more African Americans in Madison and my TV and in my column than I Do anywhere else because they'll stop me on the street and they'll say I saw you on TV or I read your column\nBut that's why you got to use different ways to reach people because we get information in from different sources but the ... there's no there's no doubt about it and I and I appreciate your mentioning those differences\nWatch reshaping y'all have a great weekend I'm\nWell thank you hear things you don't have ... thank you so much for listening\nBefore we take a break Zorba let's check in
