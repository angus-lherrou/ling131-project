when I was in college was fifty percent of this world today it's less than ten percent for the first time in history we brought four hundred and fifty million people out of poverty in China four hundred million in India Fifteen Years ago South Korea was a ... aid recipient country today it's a donor country\nSo I see this transformation taking place we're curing diseases we never thought we'd cure smallpox tuberculosis a polio mean we're doing an amazing job with cancer now with the genome we have an ability to give specialized cancer treatment people are living longer living better than that so the challenge remains\nBut the ability to meet the challenge is absolutely clear to all of us\nSo that's what leaps out at me as that\nTechnology will continue to improve life people can live longer hope better\nAbout what we got to organize ourselves better we're not making our democracy and our governance choice work effectively\nAnd we've learned through history that the alternatives are pretty we don't want to have a market we don't want to have a dictatorship we don't want socialism communism or whatever I don't believe I think democracy our democracy has unleash the greatest creativity the greatest freedom but people have to respect it\nBy going out and voting fifty four point two percent is not acceptable and I've been in parts of the world\nAs a lecture in Missouri in Sudan and in the west bank in Kenya in the Philippines where I've seen people come out and wait Fifteen hours of one day and the hot sun with tanks and some places and guns in the hands of people to

to help you\nVery much you want you to\nThink we're pretty sure that call that eight hundred for six to seven for one through\nYou know that particular question comes up quite often and the reason why among other things some people actually drink eight ounces twelve ounces of grapefruit juice three to four times a day and for those people it can really make a difference in the metabolism of their drug\nFor for people who would take a juice cast once or twice a day and they're doing it eight or twelve hours away from their taking a pill no problem and there are so many grapefruit juice lovers in this country\nThat we could make happier with a simple thing now do you like grapes which I Do ... what do you drink it very much ... much but I like it all and I cannot yeah I'm going to like grapefruit juice it's it's\n\n\nZone for our ... call we have a food\nCosts food or um kids eating fast foods\nNow I Know will shock you but let's talk about fast food you know fast food we know in the whole fast food is good for you so you go to McDonalds you go to Burger King you go to Wendy's you go to subway you bring your kids there\nAnd you say oh they're going to have a a a good healthy meal be Mossad healthy meals at these places yes what percentage of the kids\nEnd up not eating healthy meals in other words eating junkie meals they've got they've got parents they go in there how many what percentage of the kids eat do not eat healthy meals\nProbably ... spent a lot of talk about making making ... ... yeah well the studies have shown this recent study they sounded parents that was published recently showed that Ninety One percent of them by junk food when they go to McDonalds and burger\nKing and Wendy's shot him shock shocks you know and it's only ten percent are actually nine or ten percent of reading the news now the reason among other things is because the parents I mean junk food I mean the ... be as\nIf the parents are getting a whopper and fries or the kids really going to get something that's healthier than a whopper and fries again or junior rapper and they'll get a junior ... very\nKind of exactly tell the kid is healthier food if a parent is shoving unhealthy\nFor the parents actually do I mean they do say that they do say well you're going to get a healthy meal and the kids go out the meal I Want to have the UN and it's really an issue because fast food is a major source of calories sugar fat\nSodium in obesity you know I mean we have to talk about obesity because if you look at obesity basically in kids especially kids who are kindergarten up until the age of twelve it's on the ... and a lot of it is due to the unhealthy food\nThat or is in fast food so it's a big big issue and I think it's an issue parents have to think about before they go to a restaurant and I think this is the time there's nothing wrong with going I Am not\nGoing to say you shouldn't go to fast food restaurants because the reality is people are going to do it\nBut you can do it in a thoughtful way and if you do it in a thoughtful way you can look at things and say okay we're going to get a burger we're not going to get the special sauce which usually has mayonnaise and has more calories\nWill get a burger but we won't get fries or we'll get fries and we'll split the fries in other words why not teach fast food responsibly you know ... and I find is rather interesting because I was looking at a at a Budweiser commercials and they said drink responsibly well I'm not a tea told her\nI mean I'll have a beer or New Year's I Do drink responsibly I think it's the same with fast food you can do it and the reality is children follow what parents you know as parents smoke children are more likely to smoke if parents choose junk food they're more likely to choose junk food and just one interesting cab yet\nI still remember when I was doing hospital work at a young girl and\nFor diabetes she was twelve years old she had new onset diabetes she was morbidly obese she was put on a diet in the hospital for three days longer regulated her and her parents snuck in Burger King\nFries and coax to her when she was in the hospital into the hospital put a stop to it in other words they they just didn't accept the picture\nSo good food for ... probably more good food for two\nYeah parents kids follow what the parents to that's the that's the that's the long answer and that's the short\nOne ... one eight hundred for ... for one through is our number eight hundred for six to seven for one free and those overload super ... Madison, Wisconsin\nHi hello how can we help\nOn my question about hernia surgery in this case I'm doing All right yeah and my husband is planning surgery was taught to the doctor and it's a you know are getting that seems very experienced and how does\nNot just general but she also does get ... no ... around there and the heart of the biggest role in the area and that we trust but my questions about mash and that\nI developed a bad impression of because of all this stuff about the patch on that and I understand ... place [noise] not a you know pelvic area but I'm Still kind of I heard about that huh\nLet's talk about your husband for his role so uh he has an ... that is a hernia around the belly bum a more than an hour he uh is he symptomatic how how big is it\nWell it sticks out maybe an interest so okay and so he could get ... and so he says it's\nUncomfortable and not feel 'em tight at time okay trying cannot bumped it uh-huh and he kind of feels like it's getting worse okay\nSo you you had some major things about ... first of all is symptomatic than a lot of people with him though the corneas that are not symptomatic and they do not need surgery [noise]\nThey're usually symptomatic went intestine cousin testing goes out through that hernia get stuck in the hernia and people often it and that points to pushing it that's really a signal with the fact that it's something that that should be treated um is your husband overweight or underweight the right weight why would you how many\nNot he's not overweight although the only way carry on is that what it is is that there\nAre men do tend to carry weight on their bellies and women tend to carry it on their backs and an interesting thing that I find when I have men who are overweight and my office\nI'll say how you doing and they pack their belly as if they're pregnant and say I can't get rid of it and I was thinking this I was thinking today I've never seen a woman pat her butt and say I had to go for a very funny I have no idea why men pad their bellies and say they have to get rid of\nOkay so he's a little bit over what he's going to do that you're concerned about a mash the transnational mesh tell me why you're concerned about that\nWell because I I think I may I understand if you certain side you have to do that or else ration rye ends up getting repeat it right but the problem is the mash it it binds with your mouth\nOh I don't find it finds it finds with material but want to get back for a second you mentioned trans fat you know so you've done research on that or well\nBecause they've been all these things about law that okay so what that is very different though\nThe doctors told me that was more likely it just marked problem in the ... area\nThere are there it's a different you're dealing with something that's very different when you look at the giant and the rectum which is something\nWhich you doing you're putting in a mass should really first of all I don't know if the ... the same dimension self may be different I don't know it highly ... well that may be manufactured in a different way I'm not talking just about the material the size of the texture of the mash what mesh they use\nWe're that we're that comes from and why a woman needs a trans fashionable mash becomes a totally different issues sometimes it's because of radiation because of surgery sometimes it's because of issues that have occurred during uh during childbirth and other things so it's a very very different operation and it's for a totally different reason\nSo for instance uh the plastic\nThat is used in a contact lens is similar to often plastic that is used in some joint replacement surgery it's the same plastic better contact lens is different than some of the joint replacement surgery that may have some of this plastic in there and so I just want to mention it it's not just the material is a lot more than that\nHow did you choose this particular search and you're happy with a surgeon and the institution\nWe called and this is what we were scheduled and we talk to this person and he's Shane neither young or old and she has she seemed like she knew what she is doing and he liked her and he's he's not worried\nOkay so neither young or old\n[laughter]\nThat's the golden period within life where you are neither you know so he was happy did you meet with a surgeon personally\nA lemon if you ever been into a lemon rind it taste bitter\n... a lot of the smell of a of the lemon comes from the ride and when you ... you immediately increase the smell of the lemon without adding any bitterness or makes sense that makes it so\nLet's make a deal it's\nMoving in large part of salted water do boy I'll cook the pasta according to the directions until it al dente notice how I pronounce it I pronounced it\nCorrectly for Gino out there all the time from Milwaukee and corrects me ice correct me on the dime it's al dente and not al Dante I finally got it after all these years\nGo by the cup a pass to what are you going to set it aside and use it later drain the pasta and if you're moving a little slowly in the kitchen toss the pot with a teaspoon of oil so it doesn't stick\nOr your fast cook or a slow cook um\nThey have the answer is no ...\nI Love it and don't go get his someone ... over medium heat and olive oil when warming and the ... chalet

now back to the phones ... ... Edmond, Oklahoma\nHi are you doing fine how can we help well\nQuestion um my son is about three years old and it keeps getting\nFevers or every other week wow remark favor are here for days twice\nA month so tell me a little bit more about it you bring him to the doctor so it was a three year old how was the labor and delivery normal or\nEverything you know does he go to daycare now does he have play dates with other kids are now and\nCheck them out or fever or for viruses and stuff that always come back negative\nAlways come back negative or how high fevers that he ... that he gets\nA gun owner or in a company in ...\nOh yeah when you have a fever that high and a hundred and four vomiting certainly would not would not be unusual um point sort of how does he eat tell me a little bit about his eating patterns\nLane read me nuts for king\nI'm almost ... how many kids do you have two two how old is your other child or for does your other child gets sick before you know not\nSo you're either see your other child does not get sick this child gets sick and gets fevers all the time um what do you do when he has a fever tell me a little bit about how you treated\nA Tylenol and you know like kind of staggering\nMhm sure and that's by the way that is a that is a good way to do it a Advil last for every eight hours and in between you can give Tylenol and that's that is really good for a really good for a fever cough and if you're going to see your doctor for this how many times\nOh man we've been pretty much every China yeah the early or to a traditional\nUh-huh and the air is pretty much I mean that's not the best place to be ever in the emergency room obviously but the child so they every time you go to the air they do blood work so they often do\nYou know we've only got as a pediatrician where one time and it didn't like really run any tests besides white blood cell count\nAnd that was not a not on the ... whenever they whenever they figured out they didn't think much about it or they have any comments about it\nNothing about it besides aren't\nOK so first of all ... they're they're ... and a little bit about the four year old does the four year old go to daycare or go to school\nIn preschool\nHe started preschool had this fevers been going on as long as he's been in preschool\nNow they're like you just start breaking he\nJust started pre K. this year there's a lot of good pre K. and Oklahoma Oklahoma has the highest percentage from what I've read in ... in the country you know so congratulations Oklahomans for really stepping in and doing pre K which is which is really very good for kids\nSo here's what it is some kids get more viruses and other kids in other words we don't actually we can only measures certain viruses we can't measure other viruses and some kids catch more what do you uh I I Want to figure out whether or not is catching it doesn't sound like he's catching it from a sibling\nUm ... do you guys get colds what sort of work do you do you do when your family\nAnd a stay at home dad I'm disabled veteran uh-huh and your wife she works at a a kind of like a daycare\nMhm does she get sick and bringing home does she gets\nShe's never share them and say\nOkay so she doesn't get sick okay I've got some advice for you first of all don't take your kid to the ER or the doctor very often that's advice number one\nBecause your child now is getting viruses somewhere is developing fevers you've had enough ... to the ER and so on so you can feel comfortable my child just hasn't virus and you can treat it at home\nWith uh the issue with fevers are you treated exactly that way with Advil every eight hours Tylenol in between hydration by the way it's extremely important and that's the hardest thing\nPd light if your child won't take you know it seems like they're dehydrated is the best thing if your child goes to the washroom urinate you look at the urine and see whether or not your child is hydrated because that that is probably the biggest issue and eventually kids who are multiple fevers grow out of it\nAnd they are from viral infections and your wife may be bringing may not actually be sick but may have some you know viral infections that come when she comes home washing your hands you know if she has any sniffles you know making sure that she you know you you know washing their hands after she\nUh you know I have two sheep closer notice instilling this what it is and you should\nSo comfortable your child has multiple fevers it will go away\nShe washer and religiously and it like as you know Google a chaotic fevers and germ or you think it could be anything that could be genetic or\nNo I don't think so and and first of all you know Google and then that is wonderful gives you lots of information but some of the information as you know is good in some of the information is biased and bad I mean that's that's the nature that's the nature of it\nUm some children get fevers periodically from viruses that are around and they just catch it automatically they get fevers\nAnd basically when they're adults they don't do that they build up an immunity if your child is eating properly meets developmental milestones is active and does normal things that a kid does it doesn't mean there's anything serious going on and let me assure you of that\nAnd that's because you've been to the ear you've seen the pediatrician you've gone to the emergency room\nAnd the reality is when your child has a fever you just treated in Europe\nWhen kids have a fever even if they ever ready or germ that ... they don't treat them and not treat them with antibiotics like we do maybe they treat Fifteen twenty percent of the year infections we treat Ninety five percent of the ear infections retreat throat infections even when they're not strep we give too many antibiotics\nThey don't do antibiotics in Europe and their children grow up to be just as healthy as our children the fever that you're treating really makes your child more comfortable\nI Would just sit with that I wouldn't look any further and worrying about an auto immune disease as long as your child's developing properly I think once you got a couple of tests I don't think I think I Would just treat the fever and say some kids have more fears than others and I would take I Would take Google for him and I would shut it off\nNot uncommon it does happen you should feel comfortable reassured he's seen enough doctor visits and that itself is a crime or for the family and the child\nSo thank you very much and uh and thank you for your service thank you I appreciate it you know we ... call\nOne eight hundred for six to seven for one three ... before the break Zorba we love it when our losers take to our
