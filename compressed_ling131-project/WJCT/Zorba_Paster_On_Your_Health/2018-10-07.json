{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "To make an agreement that's what we have to get back to instead of you know bashing China every day with new sanctions now there are problems with China's management of the market of course I'm not ignoring that I think there's a better way to deal with it than the current administration is\nSo let's drill down on that I Believe over the years I've seen you just about every other major climate conferences what inspired you\nTo think that you could find a way to cut a deal with the Chinese goes between us and the Chinese but it's forty almost fifty percent of the world's them is a short of just shy of with it is about forty five now yeah so what inspired you to think that there would be a way that you could get them to join us\nTo do so I Believe in logic I Believe in common sense and I believe and the power of persuasion\nAnd I believed that it was in China's interest I mean country it's hard to get countries to do things that they never perceive or in their interest\nBut I thought it was in their interest 'cause I'd spend enough time working with lower level Chinese are\nThere are crowds on the subject of climate that I knew what they were thinking and I knew they were hearing from their own constituencies I mean China is a one party system it's authoritarian yes but it's not immune\nTo citizen opinion and it's quite amazing really the way in fact it filters up through the mayors and governors and into the\nEther of their politics so I have I was hearing from people that Chinese we're increasingly upset with the quality of their water they're upset with the quality of their air we were posting the daily or quality on the embassy in Beijing\nAnd people were tuning in like crazy to our embassy to find out what the air quality was and the judge you they love it but we did it it had an impact\nSo they wanted to take care of their people it's that simple they really knew but they did it because politically it's survival they knew it was important to their ability to be able to meet the people's interests which is basically politics we haven't been doing that America by the way\nPeople's interest and not being met in our own country and that's why our democracy is in trouble that's a whole different diversion I won't go there and the sense that do but to go there well it has to do with whether we get things done and the environment whether we hold people accountable to what's happening now the fact is that\nI Believe people individuals kids hear it you know at UMass or at any college in this country are the key to being able to hold politicians accountable and you can't do it sitting on your button pretending somebody else was going to do it or does not involve you everybody has to be involved in this we have to go out\nAnd organize and making a difference of why do I say this with such conviction I'll tell you why because we did it in Nineteen Seventy in Nineteen Seventy\nRachel Carson it inspired many of us would the Silent Spring we had the ... way stumped with toxic waste sites where the river the Cuyahoga River in Ohio with light on fire literally\nAnd and people say I don't want to live next to this I don't want to get cancer from the water I drink I don't want to get you know emphysema and heart disease from the air quality so we brought twenty million Americans out of their homes on one single day birthday April twenty second Nineteen Seventy\nAnd we translated that into a political movement we targeted twelve worst votes in the United States Congress house of representatives seven of the twelve lost their seats in the Seventy two election guess what\nBoom we had to clean Air Act passed the safe drinking water the marine mammal protection the coastal zone management the EPA was created and Richard Nixon signed it into law why\nBecause it was a voting issue is that what we have to do today folks there is no mystery to how we reclaim the direction and future of our country\nIt's by going out and working in our democracy make it work last time and twenty sixteen when Trump was elected fifty four point two percent of eligible voters came out to about fifty four point to one Morocco bomber was elected in two thousand and eight it was sixty two point three percent that's the difference\nThe story of of what we have today is not the people who did those people who didn't vote\nAnd so I'm just saying you we can change this but we have to do it now 'cause clock is ticking\nJohn Kerry as a former secretary of state

young male returns north for its first breeding season it will settle in near an older male soon it drops all but one of the precursor songs the one most like the older male song and then a few days

Johnson and Johnson trademarked because it sounded like a good word to them for years ago and is\nNow the tablets are six hundred and fifty milligram tablets their eight hour tablets versus regular Tylenol big big difference\nWho can take a pill every four hours only the people with obsessive compulsive disorder and can do that and then I gave them the reality is every eight hours you can do it once in the morning when you get a once in a when you go to sleep and then you take it in the middle of the day some time if you're bothered so I recommend one did you tablets in the morning when you get a\nOne to do tablets when you go to sleep at night in the middle of the day if you could take another two tablets that's what you try\nTo take that twenty four seven for two weeks every single day to day have is the money to tap it's Ron lunchtime to tablets bedtime do it for two weeks see how you feel then you'll know if the drugs doing something\nThat your assignment man I give your\nDoctor be sure to color so when you reach a really advanced you got it for you when you\nSee on the tennis court\nAladdin under and force\nThrough some of them for one three before on ... it's ... it's hard for doctors to on learn thing\nWell this is a this is a rather interesting issue came out of the uh\nA pediatrics literature Jim of pediatrics and I think it's really important\nAnd it was looking at um learning behaviors in other words telling people you know not doing things so for instance in pediatrics antidepressants are given to us from the children they're appropriate but sometimes it given too often\nWe induced deliveries early when we really shouldn't be waiting for nature to kick in we get X rays of man 'cause we know we really don't have to get ... and things\nAnd they looked specifically and an issue that had to do with blood sugar so\nThe theory was around two thousand one that having tight control a blood sugar especially in the intensive care unit will produce better outcomes kind of makes sense gets your blood sugar under\nGood control so your body will do a good job it'll work properly and and this was because of a study kind of a medium study and not a really small study not a little big study\nBut later said he showed it wasn't very good so for instance when you get tight control of blood sugar you're more likely to get hypoglycemia right where your blood sugar is too low and lo and behold there was to zero hypoglycemia severely low blood sugar in the tight group\nIt was six point eight percent versus this is the next study in the in the group that was usual care and that type which was like a half a percent different seven percent of the people\nWere getting hypoglycemia versus negligence or getting ... it took eight ten nine years before to change the behavior of physicians study after study after study showed\nTo type blood sugar wasn't good for you you should get sort of moderate blood sugar but doctors and nurse practitioners NPs are less likely to change now there's something interesting medical guidelines came in they had to do with sugar\nAnd medical guidelines said after the age of sixty five sixty pounds kind of a random line is not as if\nWhen you're sixty five automatically you're older and when you're sixty four and ten months you're younger but over the age of sixty five Medicare said we should not true for a human globe and a one see that's never going to trigger seven we should shoot for age\nBut yet a lot of endocrinologist a lot of nurse practitioners a lotta PTAs and a lot of doctors said now wait a minute\nWe think that type blood sugar is better\nBecause we think think think thing no evidence\nThat is really better metabolic Lee meanwhile we never think about hypoglycemia or low blood sugar that is still going on in many practices in America today where people are getting blood sugar that is too tied when they're over the age of sixty five because doctors have been taught that hot that type blood sugar\nIs really the way to go it's hard to change physician behavior even in the light\nOf this you know Harlem hundred doctors handle is when things change when ... you're good at this because you're on the radio and you are kind of forced to keep up with ... but most doctors well it's a\nVery difficult thing because what happens is a study of come out and then there'll be a guideline them insurance got I mean I'm going to take a little bit more about this Medicare thing then physicians and groups are then given they're given like star ratings and they're given star ratings based on their hemoglobin anyone see\nThe lower the hemoglobin agency the better the star rating means you're keeping your diabetics and good control went in and and so the insurance companies in the star ratings for this or then behind the science that shows that were keeping people too tight\nSo on one hand you get a better start writing if you keep your blood sugar too low and the other and it's bad for your patients\nIt's a complicated system and you know what I don't have the answer give us a story that the insurance companies give out star ratings are what they do is they say you're doing a better job because you're taking your diabetics and you're working in their blood sugar to keep it down but they're not they're behind insane well here's the over the sixty five group\nAnd the under the sixty five groups and then this is this is related\nTo when people actually sign up for the insurance than go maybe I'll do this plan\nThey're doing a better job with diabetics so you've got a whole bunch of things working against changing behavior in physician's also they look at a bunch of studies and they go there's too many studies going out when do I change my behavior so there's no clear answer on what we should\nDo well I say kudos to the doctors because most of them are pretty good right than with\nCab similarly but they are but the fact is this particular study showed doctors don't change behaviors as quickly as they shoot\nA number of force looks to some of them for one three is our number back to the phones ... one of those in ... New York\nHi how can we help well\nI'm interested in whether the doctor has an opinion on the drug habit\nIt's advertised heavily um I don't know if any real statistics are out on it but I'm curious to know whether it maybe like a chicken soup that won't hurt in\nMy adult so wait so ... ... ... ... there was a drug ...\nAn hour Hank you ... okay ... ... is for your stomach so ... and I you see these African ... [noise] no idea of some kind of a you know something to improve your memory your memory short\nTerm they give a little grass on the TV you know how you prove than eight days as opposed to twenty days and now I'm just curious about it whether it's worth taking not worth taking\nA first of all there's nothing that improves your memory that you can take so first off you know this stuff that's on late night TV when do you see the ads\nOh it's all day long you know I I'm just curious about it\nBut I I Want to talk a little bit about memory and first of all save your money let me be very specific about it there is no drug to improve your memory know drunk at all there is no drug that scientifically shown your memory gets better from ...\nTo this baloney drug called ... it's ... ... that's what it is save your money you know they'll do something that can I add one patient who got something like this for their ... and they said it's free\nAnd then they got a bill for shipping and handling which was Seventy dollars so it was so the drug was free and shipping and handling was set in ... I mean you know it's an example of how they how they want to take your money but but I Want to talk a little bit of a memory that's interesting so I go\nI go to a trainer I'm In a university environment the trainers are always in their twenties or like twenty Twenty one twenty two [noise]\nAnd I find it very interesting because I signed my trainer and all the trainers have had in the last decade they periodically forget things they have to do this and I was with my trainer actually a couple of weeks ago and I can't you said I Can't remember which key opens the story is much keys and he had to go through like five keys to open the door he\nNever think about his memory is deficient based on age he just goes I Can't remember the key\nAnd then we as adults older adults go oh you've got too much on your mind I don't know what [laughter] what is it on your mind you're thinking about other things memory is erratic\nMemory is erratic but the way to improve your memory is by using your memory there is no doubt about that\nWell then a lot of people say do crossword puzzles well I'm a little dyslexia I don't know how to spell things up Microsoft Word years ago with correct my spelling the last thing in the world I Will do is a crossword puzzle I haven't done one since high school it will never happen\nBut I Do improve my memory for other things and that's where you should put your money and so there's something called a memory castle\nAnd the memory castle is where you picture a room that's very familiar to you and then you try to remember things in that room like in the store like you're going to the store and you want to pick up pickles you want to pick up ice cream and you put that in your memory room and when you go to the store you don't take your list you use your memories or try to find things\nWhen the oil is warm at the season chicken cooked five to seven minutes on each side transfer cutting board let it rest you gotta let it rest for five minutes\nFor the juices to go back and not a lot of juice and there's you have to do that\nNow in a large bowl and once again we're making a mango salad but you could do this with any sound and the olive oil lime juice very important in a few punches of saw whisk it until it's combined\nIf you want to meet you at the El Nino you've got an avocado and the avocado if you've got the mango it is called make a salad but you could do without it and the ...\nAnd then and the ... and if you don't have ... using other green toss it together until is cooked divided among the bowls slice up the chicken and the chicken to the top of the salad and ...\nYou've got a delicious interesting salad it'll search for people and tasty and you like it\nYeah and if I wanted to get a copy of this for us\nWell you could go to the Internet that it meant to say to or at at the store buy at WNPR that W survey at ... or ... or you can find this to F.
