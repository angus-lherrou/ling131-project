I wear compression nice we've on the airplane I'd probably work compression socks to if I wanted another I I Would just move forward and say that that's that's a possibility there is something that I'd run out and that\nIf I'm going to go hiking for two to four weeks before you go hiking hit the elliptical lip tickles are great for moving up you're moving your legs it's a very similar thing you'll get your circulation going you build up those blood vessels I Would do the elliptical for twenty to thirty minutes maybe three days a week and I do it for a month\nBefore uh uh that's really helpful thank you when you represent a phrase while hiking\nI Would if you weren't hiking so if you were having trouble hiking I wouldn't bother with him I mean you could wear\nCompression CB you weren't bothered hiking so uh you know that certainly is a possibility but I Would if it were me if I bring it with me and obviously if every day of hiking my leg were swollen I put on the ... the next day\nBecause otherwise they can get hot and sweaty you you've got to look at ...\nHow did you like how did you like the mountains there I think that the most some of them a little mountains in the world I've ever seen\nThey were astonishing yeah I'm here to New England\nWhich feel friendly and Iraqis were almost overwhelming\nStanding yeah yeah we love to do it again it was great you have trouble\nBreathing at that thing where the people so that was\nReally getting to stop at a time\nWhen you get if they are I think it's one of the most beautiful places in the world I've done quite a bit of travelling even even very comparable to the Himalayas in northern India in Tibet very comparable so we'll keep tracking thank you you know I'm getting back on their own families to\nResign for the call God can wake up no I was sort of nodding off you know I vacation certain\nRights that he says or your beach guy I met the ocean is so beautiful and walking to the ocean and put your feet in the morning and then you come back and read your book put on the ... mountains to yoga that threatens the opposite of the time and Mona can vacation\nBrute force looks through some of them for one three is our number eight hundred for six to ... for one three miles or ... the idea of standing at work is really growing in popularity but here's a research suggesting that may not be the best\nWell I Want to interpret this research is quite interesting first of all we know you know there's a a monster and now the city is the new smoking because we know that sitting in of itself too long is not good for you I mean it leads to obesity it leads to a lack of of muscle mass it leads to cardiovascular problems\nAnd the other end standup jobs had their own problems too because stand up jobs are different and this was\nA very interesting study but I Do want to put this in perspective it was seven thousand people\nIn Canada part of the Canadian community health survey and they looked at people who steward for their jobs okay so they're standing for the jobs so their sales clerks to cook their bank tellers their waders\nThe gate agents you know uh you know that are at the airport in their cashiers and they looked at ... that they were appear to be twice as likely to develop certain things such as heart disease because they were standing up for the job of the time\nAnd so the conclusion was maybe this is a cardiovascular risk factor if you stand up too much it's not good for you and that that's interesting I agree that there may be a factor here and they said\nYou know they should allow the place to sit down for a job but I but I Want you to look with the jobs were\nSo they were people were standing there were cashiers they were bank tellers they were waiters there were sales clerks you have to look at how much money these people make also in other words there is a monetary issue we know the people who make more money have less heart disease and the whole unless they're obese and they have other factors\nThat making money gets you better food\nYou've other things you go to the gym you exercise you know you have control over your job they looked at standing scene where the people with the standup jobs are having trouble was not only trouble they also make less money they have ... they may have more stress in their lives there other things that go along with it\nKind of interesting it'd be really interesting to do some research where people in the same work environment somewhere standing somewhere well there would\nBe very good and we know for instance that people would stand up desk suing back problems do better so you don't have as many back problems we know that oh yeah a lot of people have standup desks within our office at the clinic we have a couple of nurses who have stand up desk and they found their back doesn't bother them\nI think there was a moderation key here I think if you stand up all day or two job you get tired I mean my mother used to work at a uh\nA department store in Chicago called rebuild she worked in the cosmetics counter to set up all day you know and the only time she sat down is when is when she ordered new new cosmetics so standing all the time may not be good for you sitting on the town is may not be good for you maybe there's kind of a combination here that we should that we should think about\nSo you're a member of a long time yes you Sam on the job all male or female people standing up using keyboards right here I Can't imagine that\nWell I used to stand up to us with the keyboard and I find it I find it very difficult I'd rather a stand up and move around ... ... and the other hand I don't have a job where I'm just sort of sitting in my computer all day so\nSo I think that's I think there's a moderation Q. very interesting research so showing that that there is no uh tails man that just standing up is not going to do it if they're standing up and moving those legs and stuff and may be good for you but standing up too much in a job may have its own set\nEight hundred for six to seven for one three on number that's eight hundred for six to seven for one three ... we will come a list or in
