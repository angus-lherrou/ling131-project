I'm going to be a huge he wouldn't be doing a lot of stuff but this morning I had to get up early because I was on the blaze radio the blaze of course is Glenn Beck's empire\nAnd people know that he had an empire he has an empire and he is now actually officially\nAn emperor oh yeah he carries a sector yeah and in for the new ... or ... ah yeah he's the emperor ... dot com and fortunately wears clothes so yeah that's the most important thing and so anyway ah\nI was on the radio this morning with doc Thompson he's got to ... to ... what is also on TV you know you so if you watch funny guy ... yeah exactly and so if you watch that uh you've already seen me talking about\nDonald drain the swamp but I'm excited you know every time as an author that book comes out I I just get excited to see how people are going to receive it Michael in del of my pillow is creating pillows based on this book\nI'm not I'm not kidding around the fills you sleep on but these are like what do they call them to take everywhere pillar to take it anywhere like airplanes you take them on the point I don't know he's got for free 'cause it's like you could read it as a bedtime story and you got the pillow right there to go [noise]\nYou know yeah exactly uh but anyway it'll probably more like a couch accent pillow or something like that well you know creating a Donald drained the swamp\nPillow that's Michael ... Michael of by the way good time for me to mention that one of the sponsors on this program is my pillow and if you'd like to get my pillow where the big discount you put in the code Eric more attacks that if you don't put an Eric Irma taxes\nI don't think you're going to get the discount so if I were you I'd put in the code Eric or ma taxes either one I think uh but you if you want the big discount you got to put that in but I'm I'm excited that that my window you know he he has supported this president and all of his pillows are made in the U.S today ... and um\nHe's of course based in Minnesota but he he is the\nUltimate American success story is so incredible what what Todd has done in this man's life is life was a mess in absolute mess and he is just it's amazing so I I just think it's wonderful that he's creating a pillow\nOr with the Donald a character the caveman character on the pillow uh that's that that's you know it's going to take some time before we can get this manufacture but it won't take too much time but the book down bring the swamp is based on a true story\nAnd people who read it will recognize like oh yeah\nYeah this sounds very familiar and in the end the Donald caveman figure he doesn't George Washington type thing where he issues being the new king\nAnd he says no you don't want to king you're free people now what a free people don't have a king a free people you are the government you tell your leaders what to do and they say\nOh you mean like a president and he goes yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your cake and what's really amazing this is five thousand years before George Washington yeah and ... and the cave drawings or by Tim radical in yeah it's amazing because ah he's he's a alive now\nSo anyway down brings us this one is is coming out I Want to mention I'm also a ...\nThat we're doing a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom some of you know you've heard me talk about this but\nThat it's like our friends Sebastian Gorka says you know his the title of his book will talk about that the minute it's go why we fight we've got to fight\nAnd I think the other side the enemies of religious liberty are fighting really hard because they think they're fighting against bigotry now I'm here to tell you that that they're not fighting against bigotry but they think they are and so they fight really really hard and and they're damaging uh our our government basically and so you you've got to fight back\nAnd so when I think uh for example we talk to our friend who was the the fire chief of Atlanta he lost his job people attacked him and he lost his job why because he dared\nHe dared to publish a small book\nThat mentions this was for his men's Bible study that mentions biblical view of sexuality people said oh that's bigoted\nAnd he got fired from his job as the fire chief of the city of Atlanta and the alliance defending freedom defends men like that actually we have a clip from Calvin talk when he hearing here is that the the Atlanta fire chief lost his job talking about it here it is\nI Would gladly lay down my life in service to save another life because that's what firefighters do the one thing we should not have to sacrifice is our God given freedoms the\nFreedom of speech and the freedom of religion these freedoms but which so many in our nation has sacrifice suffered and that we shouldn't be forced to surrender\nIsn't an incredible I mean I met him a number of times he's such a noble figure he ... you know he's on the fact that he got fired and low I I Want to I Want to tell you folks\nJust lunacy yeah I mean this is a man of tremendous dignity integrity and by the way he he was doing a great job for a long time you went all kinds of awards he got some presidential award I mean that's who he ... who he is he and he was fired for daring to write something that offended a\nAn a gay activists in the city of Atlanta who decided to come after him and people typically buckle because they say oh I don't want to be I don't wanna be considered a big it I guess I'd better fire this man you know to protect my rear end so he gets fired and the light defending freedom stepped up\nTo defend him now you like to bring freedom does it for free and they have argued in front of the Supreme Court they're very big deal but they need our help and some saying you folks if you care about religious liberty you care about the ... you have to fight you got to go to the to voting those you got to vote and you got to help\nUh by giving to these organizations so we're asking you to give to life defending freedom at our website as much taxes talk that kind of see go there you'll see the banter my taxes talk dot com please give everything you've given double by the way it is doubled because we have a matching grant now's the time to give thank you know\nThe high this is ...

through which clearly were wrinkles ... as a set Tibet what's but\nThen he looked at me and he said totally nonchalant too said\nThat's where they hang me backwards with my wrist tied together with why from a pipe in the ceiling of the secret police headquarters in Budapest that informs or worldview because when when you see that when you internalize a from your father then you know you will

these things because I Know a deep in my bones Howe true they are\nWhat a Donald Trump do he said three things\nHe said guys I promised the American people that I'm going to recognize Jerusalem as the

right thing to do\nThat song from stomach so don't come to me with oh I don't like his tweets okay if I hear that again I had a pocket I'm not interested\nIt's uh it's actually hilarious because it's so refreshing that it's shocking I mean when somebody does when he's I mean the fact that he he makes all these promises and then he keeps the premises you think literally in my lifetime I've never seen this go around you\nThink about this American presidents including since Clinton\nBush included have promised the Israelis\nFoot twenty three years and ... it's like a multi ... every six months for the last two or three years the incumbent president has to sign a waiver oh we promised you Israel sorry we're not doing it this year\nThat's forty six waivers it's like an SNL skit with us and that was funny yeah this is the absurdity of other officers so there's a story now we're doing it for a second one\nAnd please if your listeners I'm not familiar off to the show you know go on line download the transcript or better yet watch the video of the president's ... speech\nHe will be in office for another six years but this is perhaps his most important speech because there is a moment and the ... not a paragraph Houston the we told the polish government would do when the president downtime we don't want him at some fancy government office we want him standing next to the statue of the Warsaw Uprising\nAnd they finally agreed this is one of the polls came out of the sewers to kill the Nazi occupiers and he gave a speech that within the last summit padded rough paraphrasing the the the the Texas in the book why we fight he says\nThe only question of the age is if the west has the will to defend the values upon which Judeo Christian civilization has built who can\nTell you who talks like that Winston Churchill ... like that a Reagan had moment I was making like that Maggie Thatcher for sure that talk like that it's it's absolutely a mind blowing as we both acknowledge that this president somehow rises\nOut of Queens New York [laughter] out of the rough and tumble a ... in many ways corrupt mass of of doing business as a real estate developer in New York\nUm that that he he he manages somehow to rise to this moment in history it's really unprecedented I mean there is nothing in his past I think that would have indicated that he would rise to this moment um so it is absolutely fascinating on so many levels\nBut the idea of transcendence what you were talking about when you take a simple stand for dignity honor right wrong as you said the left has today this wouldn't have been true forty fifty years ago but the left has gotten in bed with these ideas of\nButter relativism we cannot call something evil that is itself evil as those who politically disagree with well right and that could be ... to ... it's it's it's incredible Hillary Clinton yesterday said uh that we cannot be symbol because the other side is trying to destroy\nAmerica right when I talked to myself\nThis is hilarious this is the irony is evil\nFrom the side of the political side of the Iowa\nWhere a volunteer for Bernie Saunders goes to a baseball field not far from my house and
