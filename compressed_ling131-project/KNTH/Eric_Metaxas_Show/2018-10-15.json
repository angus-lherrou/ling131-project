share with you\n\nOr better maybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to pose\nAnd by my earlier statement that said realization you'll have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\nSo you know my you know my answer even if you have never heard me before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of them have to take care of themselves now obviously up to the extreme that you you can find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\n\nBut that is how that is how people think I Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the New York times are you ready I'm telling you this is

clean it up but I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but you know kids listen to this semi where that\nThat but also put it in a very general way and somewhat opaque adults will understand\nIt was an article about women who have lived under communism and then lived under freedom so it's East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism the article was a serious article you must understand the ... NATO lampooned is not from the onion it was a serious article claiming\nThat women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in a West Germany\n\nYou read that correct now the argument was they were show taken care of that in the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of a communist state\nThis by the way series of articles in the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nSo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's ... give up for free money\nI moved to Sweden for love not money\n\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also entitled me be paid parental leave benefits who couldn't object to free money handed out by the government to all Swedish parents then I became a father\n\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave out employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of internal laced welfare programs is the government's attempt to realize the political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among Swedes it as noticed three kit\nT.
