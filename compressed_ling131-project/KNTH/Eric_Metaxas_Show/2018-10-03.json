I Know we're usually energetic I Know we are\nBut I just don't feel that energy I don't I Am at the point where I'm feeling like we really\nWe really need to just shell in this country in these several states in this nation we just need to chill we need to slow down\nWe don't need to embrace everything that our party says we need to embrace we need to look at our neighbors not as either\nAn enemy or an ally we'd look\nAt our neighbor as a human with a different perspective a human that has a different perspective from ours\nCan we meet can we\nCome to some common ground and sometimes it won't happen guys sometimes it will happen\nYou will have a neighbor who's just overbearing demanding all about them them them than them sometimes you'll run into\nSomeone who's not your party affiliation it's all about them they don't care who gets in the way all they want is what's good for them but a lot of times\nThe party affiliation is because of a single issue or because of a parent\nYou've seen some awful things\nPermanent at the party\nMan we had some Republicans in local areas that were ... they were garbage they were sorry there were scoundrels\nAnd that could turn someone stomach heck I went back over the wrong the elections yes the Romney elections ship should you be calling up the Romney elections yes I went back over the primary\nI talked about that a little bit earlier but are you aware that the Republicans cheated in Orlando the Republicans cheated they violated the rules in order to change their rules\nSo that Ron Paul would not have a chance to win the primaries Ron Paul was ... playing a delegate game based on the rules that the Republicans had set up\nThe Republicans were afraid that if you were allowed to speak allowed to go through he would win the delegates\nNecessary to be their party nominee so the Republicans cheated that's why you had a second term of Obama and the Republicans not cheated\nHad Romney ... won fair and square a lot of the Ron Paul guys would have shut up to support Romney I wouldn't\nHave I wouldn't have because I'm tired of voting for the lesser of two evils I'm not doing it any more\nYou present me a good candidate\nOr I don't vote for that candidate\nI Am not voting against someone I Will vote for someone but there were still a lot of people who would have done it had the Republicans not cheated so all that to say there are some scoundrels in both parties\nAnd a lot of times our ideology in our politics are based on our experiences with some scoundrels somewhere\nBut if you can reach out I'm not saying compromise your principles by any means I Am a new compromising guy and I don't believe you should compromise your principles however\nWhere you find common ground do you support the Fourth Amendment\nDo you support the constitution of the United states do you support the freedom of speech do you support the freedom to exercise religion if you support these\nIf you support these and you'll find a lot of the groups especially the black Democrat groups are big advocates of the Fourth Amendment step out and meet him there meet them their\n\nGuys do you oppose black militant groups marching\nWith firearms and I'm bringing that up I'm not trying to make this whole race thing but I'm bringing that up\nBecause we have seen non violent black militant groups like the Huey P Newton gun club marching\nWe've seen that\nThe reason I'm bringing up by his because what we have not seen\nIs white\nGroups marching that we're liberal or a Democrat that were non violent we see and to fall we see them marching but they're violent they typically white and they're violent\nThat's why I'm bringing up the\nBlack non violent groups because we've seen more of the black Panthers marching but not in violence just to show of force a show of protest\nWe've seen that\nCan you not support them you don't have to support their message support their rights reach across inside brother\nI Love you I don't believe your message but I support your right and I want to be there to make sure your liberty is protected can we do that\nCan we not follow everything Republican can we just say hey I'm an independent thinker I Love my neighbor is Christ demanded now there are some that are unbelievable I grant you that but\nCan we not just take a different perspective if you support the Fourth Amendment\nIf you support the right to keep and bear arms you should support that for everybody if you don't think guys you don't belong in my audience you really don't know I may have a few stations they freak out over that but if you don't support the constitution\nI've got nothing for you I don't\nI've got no use for you I don't need you listening to my program\nBecause your last used to port something that opposes individual rights individual liberties\nAnd while the constitution may not be representative of God it does to an extent hold values of Christ guys you got support\nYou've got to support the rights of everybody everybody\nI've got to take a break you're listening to the final chapter we'll be back\nIn a minute [noise]\n\nCan't continue my excitement any longer I Am a when

box membership every month you're getting pounds ... pounds of beef chicken pork\nA kind of like being in a battle do it in and out of fires and and and change some some terrible things obviously a was having trouble sleeping tormented by a lot of that and a key date\nApril two thousand eleven he was a channel surfing three o'clock in the morning and here's this guy talking to a couple of international business guys up and to be Donald Trump and uh he got this premonition that he was a hearing the voice of the next president\nOkay now I read it at that time pretty amazing to town and an eleven\nHe Donald Trump on TV and he believes that God's speaks to him and says this is the next president of the United states now\nTo believe that Donald Trump can be president in two thousand eleven is plum loco so what did mark tailor the firemen think when God speak did God speak to him normally with this new thing for him\nIt's a very new thing for him and uh like I say it was three in the morning and he actually wrote it in his diary and many put a question mark\nBy like really [laughter] and what it didn't happen he kind of forgot all about it and wait wait wait in ... only twelve is what you're saying\nYeah exactly and then uh you know several years later fast forward he was a um having some treatment with a doctor Colbert\nAnd uh you know shared some of his diary and this came up and Dr Wilbur was very intrigued by it now it's like the end of fifty million is sixteen\nAnd a and it's a real thing and that basically became a lot of prayer across the country and many many of us know that you know the faith community had a I think a big part of\nA Trump becoming president and a big rallying point and um but this this prayer call that a Nancy Colbert the doctors life started\nA blew up servers all over America there were over a hundred thousand people calling in\nToward the got closer to the election but every day and I am you know to pray for our nation\nWell business something my wife my wife and I know about this and that is one of the reasons I wanted to have you wanted to tell my listeners about this because\nThis is not crazy this is very very\nUm [noise] shocking when you hear the details but I've looked into it closely enough that I take it seriously that ... some people here from God\nMark Taylor is one of those people you just a person just like any of us uh he's not some amazing scene but he does pray and he hears from God and what I have read about him\nA and I've heard some of his interviews I thought\nThis guys on the level this guy's not kooky\nOr he's very buttoned up ... he's just not a\nSome people when you hear them you think ... who who knows what we're getting we're getting you know right ten percent God and Ninety percent to ... but this guy that strikes me as very real and Mary ... exactly the same thing and people can look them up on line ... CEO Welby yard tea and mark Taylor but\nI Want to encourage my audience to look into this and it's why I wanted to have you won as I said so the film and eating out tonight how people look this up I mean people say like I've got nothing to do tonight where do I go see this\nYeah and I got to tell you were in every major market across the country uh fathom isn't it didn't oriented movie we wanted this movie to come out right before the midterms so they gave us the dates they did and it's and it's the type\nOf stuff here but the second in the ... Seventeen all over America and wherever you buy tickets you know whether it's go fathom events dot com\nYou can go to the Trump prophecy movie de ...\nUh uh I Would encourage people to pre by their tickets or his tickets are selling out\nA lot of theaters are adding an additional screens because this has got some momentum now and you're the as they do sell out theaters they bump another movie out and and give us another screen because it's it's an event oriented type release but er I encourage you to go up more than anything it's a message about prayer and it's a message about\nGod and country and and and you can go on in our lives I think you'll see that this this movie is a very patriotic very uplifting inspiring message and uh so we hope that you'll you'll be a part of it and go see it\nWell I think that I Want to tell my listeners that the Trump prophecy movie dot com the from the Trump prophecy movie dot com if you want to find out it's October second and October fourth\nI'm Mark a Taylor is an extraordinary person as I said I've heard him interviewed and I want to interview him on this\nThis program so I Want to get a hold of him and marry a Kobe or I don't know how to reach them but I I think that it's important to my audience hear\nAbout this stuff and see what they make that some people will be very troubled they say well I I don't like the idea that people are hearing from God today I had the Bible is good enough for me and so just the idea that if somebody is hearing prophetic Lee in this way is controversial in the Christian Community but I from what I have seen\nA there are some people for whom this is the real thing this is not something they're making up and mark Taylor strikes me as one of those people how did you come to know his story and to want to tell his story comes on a film\nOr a friend who is the bears in mind give them a mutual friend introduced us a writing the book was coming out\nAnd uh when I met them you know what you're saying about lurk is so true I mean I I didn't know what to think either you know I'm thinking this guy's your profit I mean I'm thinking a guy with a cane and the you know long beard and you know something uh but I met a very low very normal guy\nWho ah you literally had a very humble message that got and given them and uh some of the press by that and I'm Mary ... did a very credible thing she said we need to call our nation to prayer\nAnd ah so I said wow this is a story that could inspire people especially as we get towards the midterms and uh and you know that's happening again this chain is continuing through them in terms of marriage Dylan bombed and that so I'm sure she loves to talk about it\nI Would I Would love that and when we come off the air or you can give us send information because I Do think it's important we pray for the country it doesn't matter where people stand politically you don't have to like this president a right but I Do think\nEverybody is obliged to pray for this country this country was a has been used by God to do great things in the past and there's no reason to believe\nOr he doesn't want to have his hand on the company but he relies on the prayers of his people so the idea that mark Taylor\nBy sharing this with his doctor started a gigantic prayer chain\nFor the twenty sixteen election that alone is phenomenal what what what an idea and as you said it was it's huge I mean it was a lot of people praying for the for the election because people wonder how is it possible and Trump could have possibly gotten elected I Would say a lot of it probably had to do with this prayer Jane\nAgree yes absolutely\nI think the the other thing for people to notice in Italy at the end of the movie we have for your family gives us an opportunity to kind of a real selective conversation and I've got fourteen world faith leaders\nAre people like the former communications director for Netanyahu people like general boy and people like the former CEO of ash alert and\nTalking about what does it mean for America to be great economically politically and militarily what does it mean to the middle east and specifically to Israel so there's a lot of additional content that's kind of a bonus after the dramatic feature that that's also part of this so uh it's a media experience that something that people will come and enjoy\nWell a Rick stay on the line because I Want to make sure we get your information but folks are this movie is tonight Tuesday tonight\nUh and also Thursday night you have to go to the Trump prophecy movie dot com or there's more there you can you can look up the Trump prophecy movie dot com check it out and we'll be right back with the great Ken Starr [noise]\n\n\n\nThis isn't about my friend says about

in fairness with a presumption of innocence and all those things that we hold dear we just\nCast those all aside and simply say well it was about the Supreme Court so I Will rush to judgment I Will presumed guilt [laughter] and I think that's just profoundly wrong so a breath and I'm sure I just called judge Kavanaugh so clear to me and I said that it that to the world a bread\nHas been I think treated very unfairly he called it a national disgrace\nFor his perspective I think it is not just family tragedy for him and his beautiful ballad\nBut frankly I think it's a national tragedy will recover from it as we always do with a strong people but I think we now need to have a base conversation about fair that's just because someone a of alleges something\nThat that is the old song goes it ain't necessarily so at least with respect to\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh and I just don't think it was I Believe Brett\nWell but again it is it really so much about believing him as it is looking at the facts in other words let's say he said what he said and she said what he said and then we can say well based on what I Know I Believe him because we know is character but the fact uh don't lead us\nTo believe in based on what he said they they lead us to believe\nHim based on the evidence that's been offered and that's that's what I find chilling is that people it it's one thing to only have these two testimonies but we have other evidence or to corroborate or not corroborate and\nThat has to be to use legal term dispositive right I mean if we have nothing else to go on we've got to go on what we got\nAnd she hasn't produced any cooperative evidence but it ... it doesn't seem to stop people from acting as though she has it's a it's just a strange day for us as Americans and I'm I'm

before we get too much into your book 'cause we've got that time today and tomorrow I still have to ask you about um\nThe Mueller investigation of about a year ago when they had you on the program you had confidence uh in in Robert Mueller Bob you called him somebody that you've known all over the years but at the year has unfolded I have become increasingly upset\nOr with the with the scope of the investigation and win what seems to me a like a partisan bias which of course is horrific since that's not supposed to be happening what what is your take or at least what can you say about that at this point\n[noise] well I still have confidence above lower as a person of great integrity or he is a great patriot I think he served as\nA ... very well and including in uniform lives of as a very

magnificent work so I'm kind of a minority among my friends are as\nWell I mean listen I Hope you're right go ahead no no I I was just gonna say I so hope you're you're right you're you're one of the few people who might be able to convince me a on that war because he really um I I think the scope of the investigation is worrisome a there's a young woman\nA in a maximum security a location right now Maria Butina she was labeled as a foreign here and uh\nI I happen to know her and I know people who are around her and they are adamant that this is this is absolute madness that there's absolutely nothing to this and here you have a very young woman in her twenties\nHorrific a situation twenty two hours a day in solitary with a a ... bone and just just a\nHorror and and uh I I feel like there's a kind of madness that has descended over the country with regard to so called Russian collusion and I'm a I'm grieving for my country right now\nThat there was not a clear sense of outrage in fact there was a little book where's the outrage just in terms of the interpersonal relations the abuse of power terms of so called carbon Jones situation the Kathleen Willie situation\nYou mentioned ... to broader Rick ... who is willing to this debt to tell her story of a forcible rape\nAnd this was not a high school or College of it but by the attorney general of art sauce she came to become governor he was running for governor to such concerns serious stuff but so many in the media\nDid not take it seriously now let's so paint with too broad a brush were very quickly Lisa Myers of NBC now retired is the one who broke through Juanita Broderick story\nGod Bless her however NBC is a network tried to sit on the story I Can't say such good things about and that worked\nWell there's there's little question that whatever NBC once was it has now become a bipartisan organization it's no longer a news organization which is a\nWhich is a pity because it uh it it ... it has had a great days and it's passed but this is another problem uh our media are at this point um [noise] it seems to me mostly in the bag a for\nThose who are against Trump and it's a it's infected everything of course it's infected this uh the Kavanaugh investigation he would have\nFlown through with flying colors than any previous point in our history but because he is a the so called swing vote 'em that the Democrats I I'm Sorry to say have you know they have in fact a a excavated a new low there's nothing\nIn our past to compare with this and I and I do feel um I feel troubled for the country uh but I guess a lot of us felt that way during the Clinton investigation as well were you worried about your country at that time what did you think would eventually come of this because you were so vilified\n[noise] I was at work for the country uh I was just prayer fully hoping that we could come to the end of the fact finding a process and you know the truth comes out of their mechanisms in our country in contrast to show Betty\nFor the truth I'm Out at the U.S even in the media the media\nOr try to remain trawlers strong and true and say we we just want is jak with who's to say in the olden days on dragnet just just the facts lead us assess the facts if you only have some commentators come on\nOf his or her opinion that's great but would you please report the facts and don't report the facts selectively try to be honest we want on his government I think we will an honest person so I think we are at a very difficult time\nEric in terms of a journalistic ethics and so forth what's chosen at it and I'm Talking about the left and the right\nYou don't usually do the truth the truth show set you free and so the the thing that did not a cause we worry about the country or even I was told is that it was like this in the book that to\nSomeone walked in one day and I tell the story or at the office a jury of this issue as a kid I guess what added open door policy maybe I shouldn't have and said hey your numbers your poll numbers of apple logo Saddam Hussein\n[noise] my reaction was well hey that's not good but there's no place to go but up to ... is that we\nHave checks and balances in the country and one of them of course is our court system yeah that's what makes the cabinet nominations so very important because I said look we can't fight effectively the investigation and I go into some detail the so the book we can't\nDo battle on Madison Avenue was all PR people the Clinton to spend the machine and so for what we can do is maintain are on us the professionalism in the courts of law before the grand jurors are citizens and the\nTrial jurors competitors who are citizens yes our audience not the American people as a whole\nAnd uh so eventually you know the truth came out about a Bill Clinton's\nAbuse of power people will say oh it's just all about that\nRelationship and leave aside the power structure with his being the ultimate person that power she being an intern and so forth there was nothing forcible about it but it was it was a employment kind of relationship with his sons\nWere believes that the morality of say ... Twain him and his gun at his family what ... was all about it as you well know there was about the rule of law perjury obstruction of justice\nAbusive his presidential powers to prevent the troops are coming out\nAnd that's that's exactly right we're we're out of time to de judge star but if you hang on a I'd love to continue the conversation and we will arid tomorrow on this program folk to the

favorite thing on TV Turner classic movies oh yeah right if\nYou can see stuff on there I mean it's almost like there's everything else on TV and then there's teasing him I just watch it because there's so much great stuff on there um but yet Sunset Boulevard is on there pretty often and did you ever do you remember when Carol Burnett\nYou don't think you have pride that's interesting\nUh I think that itself is its own sent but yeah I'm not here to judge you that's where my audience to do now listen you know you don't think you have pride now why what makes you say that doesn't everybody have pride our army ... by definition we were full of pride and we need to lose our pride\nI think we all have an email we don't think we do um and I think we have to fight it 'cause that's\nNatural man ... human nature now\nBut if you don't think you'd have pride houses solve your problem like the only way this could solve your problem is if you recognize you do have pride and it's and some entitlement and that you can you have to let that go\nTo pray and ask God to let me be humble like Canada\n\nAnd what is it what is the attitude say about nagging\n[noise] now shall not bag is that in there it's the talk online\nIt's a part of the PIN number\nThat's what they say but the Constitution's part of a number of there you just can't really see it on\nWhat he is an example my lack of pride about go go not having a drunk they turn the air book [noise]\nAnd other people having things in their yearbook oh by the way had been mentioned what Dr Ford deer book about her no\nOkay [noise] I think ... what was in my yearbook so I went to my mom today after Bible study and I found in my ear bud from when I was a senior right are you carry it what it said about me\nHow could I not be

though that\nLike when people think oh Eric you've achieved this and this one is I think well\nIt's only by God's Grace I mean that I had wonderful parents who sacrificed for me and I live in a free country I didn't do that that was done to me and for me as a gift and so how can they not be full of gratitude and therefore full of humility because I Know for a fact\nThat it was not high but it was the lord and it was all of the lord agents in my life those who have gone before those who sacrificed for me I mean those are simple facts\nCorrect [noise] do you see how great the Bible is I mean I'm

excuse me when he asked Sarah Sanders white Trump always side with demand\nEh let's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations that term in ... and ...\nHave you seen though that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly as a kid when Roger ales as a kid is when Rob Porter is accused and that one Brett Kavanaugh has accused the president consistently every single time takes the side of the math\nYeah have to talk about it is but we're talking about that later on the program but first I have a question\nYou were when Madeleine Albright said this gets written adverse effects something like that and how far away and healthy\nNow recall the woman hired by the Republicans to interview a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nShe prepared a five page memorandum and said no senator ordered the memorandum requested them a random suggested it\n\nWasn't reviewed or approved before its release\n\nAnd she says this app salute Lee nothing\n\nTo the charges made by Dr Christine for at least as far as the last concern\n\nAnd my point is why it is being dismissed\nWhy is this woman being ridiculed being called a shell\nWhat does she stupid\n'cause she's such a hard core part isn't she just decided to come in and trash this woman just because you want to Kevin ought to be on the case here's what she wrote\nAbout her memorandum and I'm quoting\nThis memorandum contains my own independent assessment abducted forwards allegations based upon my independent review of the evidence and my nearly twenty five years of experience as a career prosecutor of sex related and other crimes in Arizona\nThis memorandum does not necessarily reflect the views of the chairman any committee member or any other senator no senator reviewed or approve this memorandum before its release\nAnd that was not pressured in any way to write this memorandum or to write any word in this memorandum with which I Do not fully agree the word written in this memorandum or mine and I fully stand by them well I Am a registered Republican I Am not a political or partisan person\nInto quote and then she goes through it and it's very detailed\nSays Dr Ford is not offered a consistent account of what the ... of when the alleged assault happened\nAnd her July sixth and Washington Post she says one thing you know July letter or to a drive thirty letter to send a defined sanctioned another thing August seven statement to the political ... she said another thing August sixteen post article\nSays another thing and she has three or four other examples where the date shifted\nShe said quote Dr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as he founded by name called she mentioned NO NAME was given in twenty twelve marriage therapy notes no damn given in twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\n\nIs an excellent when speaking with her husband doctor for a change or a description of the incident to become less specific Dr Ford has no memory of key details or the right of the night in question details that could heal corroborate her account\nShe does not remember in what House the alleged assault took place more importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house Dr\nForwards account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nDr Ford is not offered it consistent accountability assault\nHer town of who ... who is that the party has been inconsistent Dr Ford is not recalled important recent events relating to her allegations and her testimony regarding recent events raisins further questions about her memory\nStuck to fourth struggle to remember her interaction with the post cannot remember she showed a fool or partial set of therapy notes at the Washington Post reporter\nDoes not remember whether she actually had a copy of a nose when she texted the Washington Post what ap account on July six ... refused to provide any of her therapy nose to the committee and he is televised meeting it's very unusual\nDr forced explanation of why she disclosure allegations the way she did raises questions\nShe claimed originally that you wish for her story to remain confidential but the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist or husband to whom she disclose the identity\nShe testified she had a sense of urgency she's not contact descending however because she claims you not know how to do that she does not explain why she knew how to contact her congresswoman but not a senator doctor for cannot remember if she was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraph\nShe could not remember whether the polygraph record the same day as a grandmother's funeral the day after grandmother's funeral\n\nYou would also have been inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving\nDr Ford scripture not the psychological impact of the events race questions she claims she's struggling academically in college but it's never made any similar claim about her last two years of high school\nAnd on and on and on and this is simply being completely ignored even though\nWritten by a woman somebody with twenty five years experience and impeccable reputation is thorough and it's completely ignored ...\nYes ... that's something I couldn't help but when I go and healthy\nAnd then [noise]\nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley says there is going to be
