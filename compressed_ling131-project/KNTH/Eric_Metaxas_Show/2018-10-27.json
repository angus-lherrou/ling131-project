it\nHow do we know that we don't\nThis is just Miller's answer to this when he saw the warnings on the label and people expressed concern for the warnings on the label his answer was well maybe we should just take those warnings off the label\nNot say hey why would we have to take such precautions precautions with this stuff and I think about this to hunters there are a multitude of people who hunt feral hogs\nThey love to have pro hogs now I didn't see sit pushing for legislation to a\nBypass the the federal law which has been constitutional law or aunts oppressors restrictions on oppressors which would allow hunters to shoot multiple hogs without them hearing it\nThere's always one of the complaints that I've got from hundreds I don't know how many of your are hunters out

just before Russia's shutting not that far from the time of year\nOf one of the they were playing poker and one of the one of his fellow said we got a Russian service is this your how can we go to high holiday services issue where was God and when we needed help and everybody stopped talking and it does in the air when people didn't talk about their experiences and the Holocaust I seldom heard\nOne person says there is no God get over it we're out around the next person at the table says a ... that\nThis was a failure of of people look at all of our Christian neighbors they watched as we were deported in in my father's case watch this my father's father was murdered my grandfather was murdered and did nothing\nAnother person said you know what we can't understand the world Israel wouldn't have happened without the Holocaust so a greater good even though that's hard to stomach a greater good came from all from six million people being murdered\nAnd since then I've always wondered about that court question that people asked which is how can a nominee benevolent God allow evil on earth and so I've been in a way thinking about these questions since before it was bar mitzvahed\nAt and they'd been bubbling with me and I've I've I've grown older I've heard so many people say that it's not rational to believe in God right with all we know about science and the history of the of the Bible and and modern morality and frankly I think that's totally wrong I've read\nThe books I read all the books that Richard ... not all of them but I read most of what Richard Dawkins wrote Christopher Hitchens Daniel tenet even you've all Harare and I'm Steven Pinker and people would say well I read sapiens and I'm an atheist or read I read ... Hawkins and I'm an atheist and I'd say\nYou haven't really sat down and thought about these things and I\nYou know I figured if nobody's doing it a in a way that I'd like I'm going to do it in a way of life\nNow you where did you grow up I grew up in Chicago did grow up in Chicago um and you you were raised what as as a nominal do was was was was your Jewish faith a central to your life in any way was just something that you had privately going on\nMostly it was private so when my father arrived ... into the right one more I'm about ... but just one more to more words about my father my father was liberated was sixty pounds um he had been slave labor he had been in the concentration camps and luckily was liberated by the Americans who nursing I'm ...\nPounds ... set is practically impossible to think of\nIf he had been liberated uh with his if he had been liberated a week later he would've been dead I wouldn't be here today I mean he was on the verge of death\nAnd so he had watched his father be murdered his uh his brother was murdered his uncles were murdered my closest relative as a second cousin once removed basically um everybody was murdered\nAnd so he was one of those folks who was certain that there was a God and he was certain that there was a God because so many things happened during the course of him getting to Chicago that they couldn't have happened unless there was a God and his in his mind but\nHe was angry at Scott and you know what\nHe had a right to be yeah and I think that was the end he so he didn't speak to ... went to services made sure we were there on on Russia's shutting 'em ... enrolled meaning Hebrew\nSchool but he wasn't going to sell God and I think they were both\nGod and my father were giving each other the silent treatment and you know I think both sides understood what was going on [laughter] wow wow wow well\nOkay so so you go or you go into finance you've obviously been successful family banks and a ... at what point did did you settle in your mind that you believed in God was that something that that that happened early on or is this something much more recently as you're struggling with these uh atheist books\nWell that journey started actually I was at the Chicago public schools in that journey actually started when I was a freshman in high school\nI went to I was we were doing the ... and they still do the fetal pig yeah and\nI'd had enough Hebrew school to know about the six day sort of thing and evolution versus creationism and I went up to my teacher I knew from us why a little bit he was which is a conservative Jewish youth group price and I said Mr do but\nI said ... learning about um ... you know how the fetal big uh you know goes through all the steps of its of its evolution right how does this square with the Bible and are already looked at me and he started a mother a few things and then he gave a shrug\nAnd I started thinking well look I'm not getting these answers here so is my ... by the time I was a junior I transferred myself into either crunch Jewish academy in Chicago and I said I'm going to at least know whether I Believe or I don't believe and that's really what started me I'm an attorney that's amazing\nAnd the funny thing is that on ... ... ... is not even true I mean in this day and age you know that that's the kind of hard and that that was based on those ah what is it that the heckle drawings that they're they're just\nYou know these things get picked up and they put them in in textbooks and they go on and on and on and you know fifty years later they realize oh that that's wrong right and meanwhile you have an several generations of people who walk around it was on the test it's got to be right you know to do as a planet where do you want for me\nUh and then you really no no no that's not true actually so it is interesting\nUm but so yeah early on you actually decided that you wanted to know there are not everyone's like that everybody got crates us old differently but you really want to know what an early age so what happened when you go to college were you in any kind of a a a God worshiper in college where were you\nSo I um the the the important formative thing for me which was I'm grateful for every day is when I transferred the Hebrew high school\nI learned to read the ... and then opened up a whole new world for me or not that there's anything against reading the texts than any other language yeah but for me it just made my understanding much deeper\nAnd I became a sort of a lifelong speaker I consider myself a hopefully a lifelong learner I there was no magic moment where I suddenly became observance right um it was something that happened over time and I really really needed to reason my way to every step you know why should\nI keep ... why should I keep kosher I'm not as one of those folks who just does stuff because other people are doing it so it it it took me literally decades and in this book is is to some degree some of the research I did started decades ago I was I'm\nI'm I'm trying to reason out well\nHow do you square evolution and God how do you square the creation of the universe how do you square modern morality with what we read in the Bible you know people have tremendous criticism biblical morale and so I had it thinks are each and every those questions for myself well\nIt's terrific go we're going to go to we're going to go to a break here but uh we are a\nTalking to Scott Shay or in the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism Disney which actually so stick around [noise] did you hear her own [noise]\n[noise]\nHello [noise]\nI just don't see how my life can get any better\n[noise]\nEverything just feel like everything around me is falling apart if something doesn't change soon I just don't know what else I can do\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] for counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselor I Want to help me get through

help\nAnd not to mention the shedding back in the car three times a week credit scratching my thing on the side of keeping me awake calling from scratch she kind of makes you never\nDoes your dog it's scratch stinkers shed like crazy\nTown and they come to a dynamite for help\nAnd it kind of like a duck and how are you gotta pay the ... diner Tricia fatty I think\nOur vitamins and enzymes replace the nutrients cooked out most of the virtual dark moods\nHe gobbled up on like scratching his shutting animal and it is such a pleasure Mike ... non shedding and I have to think of I\nUm ... it becomes I dollar tree doesn't it\nYeah well every person is corrupt double\nAnd um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we choose counted the third commandment most Christians kind of the second commandment\nWhich is not to take God's name and then being than to take out take shop in Hebrew and it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there is no redemption of repentance it says that writing the commandment\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up ... sold spokespeople forgot\nAnd we've seen that in history we see it currently whenever anybody says look believe you don't ... don't believe in me because of me believe me because I'm the soul I I can give you the sole answer to what God wants you can get in the same sort of trouble which is how\nMuch of the stick religions get in trouble right people say look just listen to me you don't have to go behind the or don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning for it right all\nRight that's that's fast and then of course that was the ... the loser issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because\nYou realize that at the heart that he wasn't really a\n... a all he was doing really was challenging the authority of the church and the pope and saying look you have to bow\nTo a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that you have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong or we'd say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question it and at that moment you realized their\nGoose is cooked when you when you have that when you aggregate yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God which is really creepy yes and deadly\nYou've got and that's what Luther tried to do when you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion and is it\nThat I mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or you don't want to say that everything is subjective that whatever your point of view is is valid no no no when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time\nWe do need to take the responsibility to dig in for ourselves and to be careful not to just to listen to somebody because they seem like they're right but to but to understand that they are falling human beings as well and we can't\nA ... at the end of the day it's between us in God and it's our responsibility when we come back folks will continue the conversation we're talking with Scott Shay S.

H. A. Y. the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism and it's got it's just great uh to get to know you a little bit and to to see the work you put into this\nBook I I Love the idea because it's it's so close to my heart of trying to get ...\nWell the thing for themselves about what is right in true and I mean I think the reason you and I want people to do that is because we actually believe that if you do that it will lead you to the God of the Bible you'll say holy cow this is true\nAnd I think so many people don't do that they kind of take whatever they kind of you know ... from the guy says it blows by and they're not really going to go deeper if you go deeper you'll find that truth challenges does I guys that that ... where we are today or in the culture\nThat there's so much in this culture that is against God and against truth but we actually have to know that to stand against it\nRight I tie a hundred percent agree there's so much bad faith part of the reason I titled the book in good faith is there's so much bad faith with people play their faith in all sorts of things that don't make sense the good news about the Bible and about ... about worshipping the God of the Bible is that\nWhile you can never proved got\nThe God of the Bible is a Bible that is a God that you can just in with reason so we have a reason to put our faith in that got people put their faith there was a recent Pew study of significant number of people in the United states think that their spirits and rocks that they're all sorts of strange things going on in the world\nAnd what I've tried to do is to show that you can only provide evidence I mean there was no way to say you can prove there is a God and indeed I think and I go into the book why I think that would almost be a bad idea would remove moral choice from us but if you but what I think is\nI think that if you spend the time and do the digging that the evidence for God the evidence that we can fight is totally consistent with God and I said that from science I say that from the history of city the Bible\nI say that from understanding our modern morality and when we don't have God as part of the equation when we place or when we place bad faith like facing I dollar tree or faith and things are faith and money ...\nUm we can go and a lot of bad directions and that's really when the horse start and unfortunately we've seen too many of them throughout history yeah\nWell it it it's fascinating to me that uh you're coming from the perspective of a of a believing Jew usually the argument\nOr is with a somebody like me a Christian versus atheists but you're you're coming at it from a slightly different point of view and you're not arguing for the a divinity of Jesus or you're you're talking about God and the Bible in the most basic sense and you have\nDetermined through years of study that\nIt's true it's really his wrist the the Bible that to me is one of those fascinating thing the idea that\nCenturies past\nAnd the more we discover is more true the Bible is known to be I mean we keep discovering what was it Fifteen Years ago the steel at the\nI mean unfortunately the ten commandments if not actual video footage of the ... you know we take it upon\nItself yeah it can be but I'm sure everybody pressed up against the water rising away to walk maybe it was a little ... she was a little slippery mud but I'm sure they viewed it as a miracle narrowed down that way right\nWell see that's what's so interesting is that you know when you talk about what is a miracle a if God's hand was involved in it I mean if you're standing there and there are six million of you and you're about to be killed or whatever by the Egyptian army and suddenly\nHey there's a place to walk where there wasn't a place to walk twenty minutes ago something happened and let's go this way and he was scape and then pharaoh is army has drowned in the very place where you to\nMost people would say that as a miracle are now the details of the details and you're you're giving us some more naturalistic explanation I Know a lot of people would disagree with you on all kinds of ah things some would say that the whole thing never happen but it's fascinating I Love this is why I wanted to have you on because\nTalking about this rationally and saying look we first of all we don't have a dog in the fight whatever happened happened we just want to know what is right and a\n... some of the stuff we can know some of the stuff we can speculate on and if we're wrong well it is what it is you know it's not like it has to be this otherwise my faith crumble but what you're talking about it's fascinating I I mean I've heard of this before but you you're a you write about an in depth and this book\nAnd I think by taking the tech theory sleep too and really looking at the words yeah I think there are some things that we take for granted that\nMany believers think that we have to question I think the numbers six hundred thousand is ... males so I analyze what the word is it's it's ... it's six hundred thousand in in is how it's in ... is how it's written but when I went back\nAnd spent some time and read a number of uh ... review aloof\nAs you may know the Bible it the ... the tower was waiting or without vowels which is makes it hard joined\nBrowser very rare in those days declaring expensive hard to come by and they're handed they had to do with what they had\nRice correct you know there were words like aloof which could have been which A L F aloof which could have been pronounced the number of different ways and could have meant something very different rides and could have meant\nBattalions or groups are clusters so the likely scenario is that they weren't two million ... Israel lights crossing but more like fifty thousand and then if you read closely all of the other\nCounts in the Bible right the number first born which is two hundred and Seventy three groups that are\nPut aside and you look at the lines to make sacrifices that are much more comports with fifty thousand I like the old into it and you're not always going to come out where you want to fight said I Want to come out and say oh it's six hundred thousand\nWell right you know you have to follow the road and let you take let it take you where it ...\nMe that that we have this up to a gym and we have the ... gate at it but you're going right back to the Hebrew and you're saying that no we don't know it's not playing it's not clear it could be this or it could be this\nAnd uh it bears looking into and maybe the answer is we don't know but here's some Spaniards impossibility I Love that because again you're taking it seriously you're not saying saying no this is what they've always said and it's got to be this and you know and and I really think that\nThe Bible can hold up to that kind of scrutiny that are a lot of people that are told like no don't look too closely on the country look as closely as you like if this is the word of God you can look as closely Z like you'll learn something that you didn't see before\nYou must I mean I'd rather talk with someone who is questioning and its will and it's right ... right I mean some people are closed I've I've encountered atheists can and when I talk to them and if I start to give them one of the bluebird steady I gave people doubts about their doubts if I start to do that\nThey shut down yeah and that's a dangerous thing what can they have their own religion and they're not interested in you know having that the bumped right and I mean I think we also have to question our own religion each and every one of us I mean there's plenty of stuff to cleanse in in ... I don't know but that's\nWhy when people say like a I Am I'm an atheist and I go by science and I think what what do you mean you go by saying you'd think\nChristians don't do you think Jews don't the point is we can talk about the details and we can quibble and argue whatever but everybody a supposedly is being rational everybody believes in science so that's that's just soft history to say I'm for science I'm for rationality and you're for religion\nThat's nonsense we're going to be right back folks for final segment with Scott Shane the book is in good faith\nQuestioning religion in atheism stick around\nThat have\nAnd and the day of battle amen to on a true story of an army chaplain and his wife and I only stand before you today because Jesus is wrong because I have a family who loves and believes with one marriage one family under God he made me appreciate family\nPowerful back home and find help I think we all have been miserable rated PG Thirteen maybe inappropriate for children under Thirteen now playing for tickets on Showtime screw the indivisible movie dot com [noise]\nWith the U.S embassy now open in Jerusalem\nThe world is witnessing the fulfillment of God's covenant with his chosen to equal what does this mean for Christians around the world watching these events unfold in his new book earth laughed empire\nBest selling author and privacy expert pastor John ... unpacked thousands of years of history in their local prophecy to answer your most pressing questions about the anti\nGet earth last empire now on line and wherever you buy books\nAm defensive and be the answer\nThese days people then their children to college to learn a trade that no one in the family has done before they move away they worked for someone who doesn't love them and then they trade there in front of the valuable time for a little bit of someone else's money\nWe'll plan was to get a job but lay aside each month and a later start a family business as the owner you leverage the time of others and hurt off hundreds of man hours per day it's called financial leverage at trade way we teach you to start a family business by trading stock and\nYeah the benefit is that each generation teaches the next and bill's on the skill sets and your children have the competitive advantage of experience that's a great plan for potentially creating generational will\nJoin us at the garden ...

Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as the girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad\nPolicy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about what the dangers of adopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms are the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluids I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah the the school district\nPolicy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determinations of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect\nThe desires of the child in the ... in this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom ... a young boy that identifies as ginger fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade a it's posh his daughter and to give a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but what the the bigger problem as the school and a blend assemble\nWho buddies religion who identified him as gender fluid that is just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies in indicator as unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today the schools essentially say okay\nWe're not going to question that we're not going to determine whether that there's better accommodations we can ...\nThat we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to regardless of the impact it has on other students\nWell it it's just a stunning thing that it's possible uh for a little girl I'm\nTo be exposed to anything of any kind of a sexual nature when she just wants to go to the bathroom I mean the fact that because we all know that there are very troubled kids out there we don't know or anything it seems about this boy but the very idea that it's described as something of a sexual nature\nAt this age it it's just horrifying but you're telling me that the school\nHad this policy so they could not stop this boy from going into the girl's bathroom\n[noise] not only that but after all of this you would think the school might reconsider\nIts policy it hasn't done so you would think the school might\nEven to say look maybe we ought to make sure posh his daughter and this boy you're no longer in the same classroom that didn't happen as well it left Pasha with the only option of taking her daughter out of that school something any parent would do when the school was so unresponsive to what happened here\nAnd that just shows that this is this is not about you know trying to keep the students\nInterest first what it's about the school\nStanding by a very dangerous unsafe policy even in light of evidence of the harm it resulted in to pass his daughter\nWell I I think what you see happening over and over ... is that people have no courage when it comes to these kinds of cultural issues in other words\nEverybody knows right now the easy thing to do is to go along with this sort of you know transgender trend and if you bucket people are going to say what are you are you a big it and so typically people in authority school authorities people in corporations\nThey have very little courage in other words they just want to do whatever they need to do to not get in trouble and in this case who's going to suffer the kids so so they're not doing their job and they're forcing this mother to take her little girl\nOut of the school because they refused to do their job I mean that strikes me as a what is happening\nYeah yeah that's exactly right you know the\nSchool has a lot of options that it could have offered to this young boy or a\nDove given him a single user restroom that he has access to\nBut what it should never do adopt a broad sweeping policy that says use whatever restroom you want go in there with a little girls are in there and that is the danger of these policies as for other than taking a stand and say no we're not going to compromise the privacy and safety of our other students were going to find solutions but we're not going to do it at the expense of everyone else\nThey took the roof to say no let's just adopt is brought sleeping policy let's not have the courage to take a stand and say is is really best for all of our students\nAnd we're not going to do anything to compromise the safety of ... shows daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I when I grew up there we would be in a world that is in some ways a\nCrazy that this is craziness when you when you cannot\nUh have a common sense to say that a five year old should not be given the option to identify as an anything other than what he is which is a little boy the idea that this kid is gender food I mean the question is did a doctor say\nThat he needs to be a treated this way did his parents say it we don't really have those facts but the idea that\nThe schools are so afraid\nOf doing something wrong that they are allowing this to go on it really is a kind of madness I think we have to call it what it is it's a kind of madness\nA but it has to do with religious liberty in this case because ah as the length defending freedom has said over and over and over uh the people who believe that to men or men and women are women were were were being treated like where this crazy minority when most Americans understand these ideas\nBut these transgender trends have just been pushed on us and here you have a case where a this woman passionate Thomas ah is is not being treated right now what what what are you in what is the ATF looking for in this case because you said that this woman\nI'm a I mean who who is doing whom and what are the details of that suit\nAs things stand right now we we had worked with posture to file a complaint with the federal government with the department of education office of civil rights\nAnd we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is not only is you know this is a dangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law by adopting\nThis policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in and creating a hostile environment for policy has a daughter and and other young girls at this school so that's a bright light and all of this is that we now have a federal government is taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work throughout that investigatory process\nUh but at the end of the day what we're wanting is a good policy in place one that ensures something like this doesn't happen when that ensures that girl showers locker rooms and restrooms are reserved for girls ... and the young men and boys don't have access to them\nHang on one second folks are going to be right back oh

make a everybody be aware of the work of violence Tiffany freedom to say they need your help right now you can go to my taxes talk dot com and you can give right there\nWhere there's a phone number I'm now ... you know I I just want to say that a few years ago I Would hear people bring up cases like this like the case of of jak Philips and are kind of roll my eyes and say you know the people always they're always complaining about these these are these kind of fringe these crazy stories and\nAnd the time has passed and I think to myself\nYou know I'm I've met jak Philips I've met a who is it the the other the the the bakers of photographers who ... practically lost their business because all they did was say\nWe're Christians we cannot participate in a same sex a wedding ceremony it goes against our values against our religion and those people are told hey shut up do is you're told or we will sue your rear end you know all the way back to zero you will lose everything\nNow when I when I really understand this I think this is the definition of an American in America you're supposed to have choices and right now people like that are being told you better do this or you lose everything now I Want to go back to Jack Philips\nTell us the story about jak Philips and then I Want to talk about the new case the jak Philips has so\nJak Philips has a cake artist and does incredible designs on a variety of things but he's always operated consistent with certain view there are certain cakes he won't designed he won't use utilize its artistic talent towards things like I'm celebrating Halloween that he doesn't like the\nYou know devil imagery and all of that stuff or a cakes that are a denigrating the American flag or or mocking any group of people well he was approached by a couple that asked him to do a cake celebrating their same sex\nUnion and jak politely declined and said you know I I Can't use my artistic designed to to create a cake that celebrate something that I think\nViolates God's plans for marriage and as a result he was sued by this couple and the state of Colorado\nAnd fought all the way to the Supreme Court losing at every step of the way and we were able to represent him free of charge and gets to the U.S Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says no Colorado you cannot have hostility towards ... believe he's entitled to those and you're\nA efforts to to denigrate those and punish him for those is unacceptable and so that's where it ended up that's we thought was the end of the story was that Jack was going to be indicated in his right to work and create art consistent with his beliefs\nRight so that that's step one right so um I've met Jack\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court used jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body but\nGive him the freedom to decline certain cakes that saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks\nAh one we're fighting the civil war when we were finding the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight a and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid uh the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up to the least we can do I as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't\nDo that so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again a and I want to say uh if you can give to the online defending freedom I don't know anybody\nThat is doing this a kind of work right now so I Want to say go to my taxes talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny you give will be doubled up please give what you can\nVisit folks this is why God gives us money\nAn energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it is tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way\nUh eventually they're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values are you going to say uh where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn the lights defending freedom so the number in case you don't have a a website you can go to my taxes talk dot com if that's difficult\nOr you can call one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven\nWhat else are we looking at what other cases are out there right now because this seems to be never ending\nThat's right I think one of the other big issues we've been working on dealing with a adoption and foster care providers\nSo we have a a crisis in our country with a four hundred thousand kids in the adoption foster care system about a hundred thousand kids\nAre eligible for adoption and we need organizations out there recruiting families trained them helping to connect kids with forever homes but the same ah\nEffort to punish faith based organizations just is the same hostility we saw towards the jak we're now seeing towards these agencies in Philadelphia in Massachusetts in Illinois and other places faith based agencies have been shutdown run out of business\nSimply because they want to operate consistent with their view about the best environment to raise a kid that every child deserves a mother and father and so at the same time for example in Philadelphia that the city was saying we desperately need more foster care parents\nAre just a few days later they were shutting down by Catholic social services because they didn't like Catholic social services views about marriage and this again shows this ongoing hostility and the impact it's having on kids that they're being denied of\nOrganizations out there working to find them homes they're being denied of these families that would have been recruited all because this effort to push an ideology and for the government to punish those that don't like that they don't like their beliefs\nI have to say if this doesn't make you mad folks if this doesn't make you mad I I just assume you're not listening because this is\nHorrendous and the only good news and that's why I'm here folks I'm not here to complain is to say you can do something about it one of the things you can do and I hope you will do\nIs give to the alliance defending freedom it doesn't matter what you give give something we've got to help them do what they do or you can go to the website ... attacks us talk dot com

Cherokee Nation has denounced Warren's attempt to use her in for the tests will indeed indeed and aid for political advantage\nWould warrant is claiming vindication and demanding the President Trump

America I never want to be um an alarmist I never want to be a stoking people's fears but there's a time when we need to look at something that we want to avoid right now religious liberties under attack in America and if you don't understand that\nWe will keep trying to explain it so you understand what it means it means that if there's any time that you have a value or let's call it a religious value that that you say I\nI feel uncomfortable with this or I feel uncomfortable with that the government is increasingly saying oh we don't really care how you feel about your little religion shut up and do X Y or Z now I got a same United States of America are traditionally we've had religious liberty the government cannot tell you\nAnd smart guys for back with you again on

done over the years you've emailed me and I appreciate that very much\nAnd if you check my website and those other sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Larry Tanner fact I'll be filling in for Dennis Prager on Monday in this hour I'd be remiss if I didn't start out talking about the recent\nSpate of bombs or at least the would be bombs I guess and the arrest of a suspect\nI I don't even want to say his name because often these people like the fame or infamy for that matter that they acquire by these dastardly acts\nThe suspect but we did have previous arrests and was known to the authorities but we can't prevent every crime or a threat in this country I'm Amazed that we prevent as many as we do and and you know figure out who's up to what\nBut one has to be impressed with the quick action of the authorities to find the suspect\nIt never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are they are truly amazing\nAnd and in fact ah one of the things I set for all the years that you know the top press is not that effective bought the day in and day out people who do the job are terrific\nAnd it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team and others who helped out\nActually I don't let you but I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list ... never hear from him into his like he doesn't exist\nI've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those hundreds department who abuse their authority and they clearly did\nAnd speaking of unhappy with leadership I see where attorney general sessions if you're watching today he made a statement showing some leadership and one of his last\nRight likely high profile lax\nBefore his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president is goes all the issues and people you know with the Mueller investigation and everything else that's going on and\nHis next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now with you know what do you want another uh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time but he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him\nAnd I think many others did too I mean I remember he was the first one that came out for President Trump's certainly a mentor for senator who did so and he took some of what a risk so you think he's got courage he's a risk taking nah\nIt's like he's asleep at the wheel sometimes to\nActually now that I think of it he an FBI Director re never seemed to have the passion and energy that I think is necessary in their job and speaking of being surprised I was impressed with the postal employees who helped in this effort you know catch capture the suspect\nI never thought they were being so mean Sean I never thought they could move that fascinate me ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I Know I was just thinking about that well you ever you know there there was an older though Steve Allen of people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book call I think those domestic\nAnd he said he pulled up to the post office and one heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and the clerk and Steve Allen is the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the car says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have enough he says well you'll have to go back and kept to not much we can freeze the box always it back\nPlus I Want you know those numbers like you might get it a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with a heavy box walks up to the counter he's the only one there and the postal clerk says Thirteen ... says number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you've got to give them credit seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job [noise]\nUm but seriously it never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well\nI you know President Trump says we have the best and the ... I think in in this case you know around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like ... and you know last plane lost ships whatever it was called the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people which by the way some side was\nWild so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department engaging the soft coup I think a lot of people's knowledge that now against the ... legitimately elected president of the United states Donald Trump\nBut our unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular Asians those who do the work day in and day out and the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so it was disgraceful to see those in power tarnish the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI no we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know its image being so tarnished and so rude because someone you engaged in an old like a banana republic activity that's why we're unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them\nSo whether the suspect winds up being someone with deep mental issues\nOr someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what did the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disaster someone should be pointed that out\nWell he tried to do the political system is what you guys already with the political system and trying to get a legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn it this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is on and it looks like we don't know it sure looks like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy is that you want to be around no matter what side but it certainly\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor did they probably care that we were as unhappy with his election and the reelection a President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat we'd never dawned on them never never never dawned on them after all\nMany of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the announcer was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally change the United states of America\nWe are far\nThe United states [noise]\nI'd always got that wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave notice you quickly for job you do give two weeks notice now says that five days before what previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that\nAnd which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected history has made one a leader steps up stays\nThere's value sharks are fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get in power I Wonder if you agree that we should ... different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have\nWas right yeah [noise] and apologize for what you may know my sign up is always a pleasure privileged to have like front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House in
