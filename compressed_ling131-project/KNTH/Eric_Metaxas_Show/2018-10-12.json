the answer [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh right yes I'll let the music run a little bit law is great song from hot chocolate love that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done thus far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in the land and fine I'm okay with that but then we attributed powers it does not have a forty does not have granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the\nPerson up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans are going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like him and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him think about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left with the right can we agree on something I Am at let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes should a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we can go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to get those honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as a bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been\nBased or negotiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sick sad thing is\nOf the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the left is supposed to be deemed black right I began this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way I support\nA person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is sad or we've seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not the Texas Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen them come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative doesn't\nPut out a an amendment to open carrying the he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile black people\nAnd Republicans do other Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile by people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yeah blacks\n\nSupport Democrats\nAnd Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney who basically supported Obamacare lite\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be worst accepting things we don't want or don't believe\nDo I have any liberal pardon me do I have any liberal Democrat black men out there who think that the government should have a

swamp you have people uh from both sides of the aisle and people from both sides of the aisle\nOr on the cover because you recognize that the people on our side on our side very recently because of the cabinet debacle and some of them rose to the occasion but prior to that\nThey really had not been helping very much and I think that is why we have a populist movement now because the ... if they are also out of touch\nPeople they they have turned you know\nUh they're lonely eyes to Donald Trump it's an extraordinary irony in our history that this man from queens of who's been a developer who has no a political experience has more political skill and more common sense ah\n... than any of these people were going to we are going to go to break forgive me when we come back from talking to

I I Would add to that that the reason a young people are saying that therefore socialism it's pure ignorance in other words you have\nA in the last forty years we have not been teaching the basic foundational values of what is American self government what is capitalism how these things work if you don't teach these things as good\nA then then people can assume things because they really are blissfully ignorant they don't understand if you've never run a business or you don't understand how bad regulation can be and how bad tax can be if you don't get that stuff and you've not been taught that you are to love\nThese ideas these wonderful American ideas or if you're not taught that are then basically ... you're open to any ridiculous idea and I just think the previous generations shouldn't\nForesee on any level and I'm really concerned for the country or Facebook or an Amazon and Google and all of these companies\nObviously they belong to the in the ship a fool's category they lean very strongly left and they have extraordinary power what do you suppose we can do is there anything we can do about that or what do you think we might do\nI mean these are not American companies schools under Barack company it's a multinational huge parts of it are owned by the ... countries that hate us\nSo there's no there's nothing inherently American about Google you can do it could never have never have thrived any other country they're loyal to America they have a stranglehold on all information in English\nAnd they could determine the outcome of our elections so why is it will not a massive threat it was our company history of the world today don't worry about than the Social Security administration does in our Congress just kind of ignore it and that and the Republican and they really are dumb are still repeating like talking points from the ... Institute circa Nineteen\nNinety nine like oh you know the free market or something\nYou know what was it an amazing isn't it a ... well the funny thing too is that one thing that always in rages may about people who think the free market is God ... if if if we have a truly free market a ... around the globe and their slave labor in\nAnother country you why not a moral reason to say the free market can go to hell I Want to buy goods from people that are not and slaves that uh\nHave religious liberty this to me seems more fundamental\nTo me as an American then this idea that a borders uh for trade or anything he somehow not conservative I mean it's a it's madness to me so thanks or you know ... it's stupid\nPropaganda that the conservatives including me unfortunately swallowed it never thought about what you care about the outcome not the ... I don't care what you call your economic system I wanted it with\nMy family has autonomy to worship as we want\nWhere my children can be safe at where the family is more important than anything else\nWe live in a system now where you know girls my three daughters are cold relentlessly your child to get their first obligation is to global capitalism and you have it all but they weren't virtually to work at some dumb investment banker to raise your children I mean maybe that's why okay fine\nBut we're telling our kids get their first obligation is to shareholders and not their own\nFamilies who signed up for that Republicans defend it yeah I don't know why\nWell they're not thinking I have to say I mean I've talked about this in the past but their their fundamental things that some of our leaders don't understand I remember you know George Bush when we had now of course I was a fan of Bush I voted for him but but the idea that we can wave a magic wand kill a dictator and\nYou know Seventeen Seventy six style self government and democracy is going to pop up in Afghanistan and in Iraq and you think wait a second this is a fundamental misunderstanding of how things are supposed to work you need a people of virtue to govern themselves you need a whole history\nThe these kinds of things understanding what the free market is and what it is and why it's good and why it's not I really think our leaders\nWe were so um [laughter] no it's true I Know he bought it like when the non Arabic\nSpeaker like Bill Kristol tells you he knows exactly what's going to happen in the country he's never been to and doesn't understand yeah\nAnd we buy resort not like oh that's right it's like ... it's like you know what's going to happen like life is so complex right at three\nOr has we're still dealing with the outcome of the first four are you joking I mean like this is ... or whatever we were very unwise yeah in believing a lot of dumb people who pretended to know what they were talking about but had no idea\nI I mean I I I hate to agree I hate to agree and you're ... you're exactly right but listen we're coming to see these things now at least you are and I am and we can assume there's a couple of people out there who see these things\nAnd I really think that a lot of this has coalesced around the personal person in the presidency of Donald\nTrump and we're really are having a a realignment or a market correction of ideas as it were we're out of time I know you have to go maybe you can stay on the line I Want to get your address to send you might Donald

[laughter] ... had fallen and Salem ... here and you sound like a an Arabic but tactile\nYou sound like a couple of Irish sons are guns are really I Love the two of you because you you do you live your passion to use one of the cliches of our day but you you use your skills as journalists to tell these important story so for somebody who doesn't know anything\nAbout the story of ... you know obviously the movie or is just coming out now it's an important movie I Hope people will go see it desperately I Hope that and it's why I wanted to have you want for this hour but but tell us and in Salem um\n... what are the basic give us a thumbnail sketch in case somebody just tuning in they say I've never heard of this\nCriminal I mean who is going to hit film I tore down onto this will be that go ahead and go ahead there are\n... apparently or Australia or Mary where night said if the driver I was looking at a much such isn't a picture of a marriage it's like no you go darling no you go you go ahead\nAnd ... is an oyster doctor who um is serving three light sentences and the principal in Pennsylvania for delivering babies alive and then and including our next whatsoever so he did that for Thirteen Years within ...\nBecause of the establishment who who who you know who want to protect abortion that nothing about all the warning find even though and in fact two women died and it felt like and they still did not bring 'em so this is the ... the movie is actually about the trial\nThe investigation on the trial we showed up and gory it's not at all like that it's a lot like a law and order episode but but they're just like a credit card bill ... I'm\nOn a jury you know of pro pro abortion people actually over you know not pro life people convicted of murder for doing that and\nThat its own brings up a lot of questions about how did he get away with it for so long\nA fly would a governor governor Tom Ridge a Republican governor Catholic have allowed this to happen during his sharing his time as governor and in fact why was it that that same governor said hands off the abortion clinics which was part of the reasons like author waffles\nWatson discovered earlier um well you know there's also the question that the story brings up and not release it which is how the media or the ... one story brick walls and the court in Philadelphia how it is that most people in the country have never heard of ...\nWell we're having in very divided times and this is this is a horror and I was if you want to know how divided they are\nA ... even when someone does a things as horrific as gruesome as this man did if somehow falls under the rubric of of abortion nobody wants to know the facts and in this case\nUh because we do have laws in this country we were forced to deal with the fact and this man as you said it's not behind bars\nServing three life sentences I mean this is an amazing thing so what precisely was this butcher convicted of that he is now behind bars for three lifetimes if that were possible\nBlow and he's you know these convicted of murder and\nMurder in bed but he's also killing his patient and you know he he won an abortion that was a grand jury in Philadelphia and I'm sure a grand jury Philadelphia I've seen a lot they called it a ... of course\nI'm about to hear a lot to do this the bodies were being the ... to ... say the bodies were piling up but they actually were literally piling up in a in his in his basement or ... ... we were coming out of a clinic\nOr the authority didn't want to do anything and I we're ... we made a movie about it I Want to tell people look it's not it's not a gory it's gone a horror movie it's a courtroom drama and it's about the trial it's about\nHow how you go from being this mom being protected species or two detectives good detectives and good lawyers\nRealizing this sooner on Rikers something wrong here on fighting against the political backlash to the media backlash to bring\nJustice to let the machine or a boy so\nIf people want to know about the movie or just so a cause people to an Internet radio programs they can do to\nGod's nail movie dot com ... G O s N E L L God's Nell movie dot com um ... what\nMade you think the two of you that the movie needed to be made about this he wrote a tremendous book about it I Know the book that\nVery well and people are interested in the book uh I Would recommend highly or that they get a copy of the book for all the details movies can never give those kinds of details but uh what what persuaded you need to make a movie\n[noise] you know things have seen like a like a movie in in in reaching a very wide audience\nUm you know not everyone read books that don't have time to do that if there was like reading um even documentaries are something that a lot of people you know don't really like\nTo watch and we actually thought you know what you know what's really popular in the car in John ... is a very very popular in the United states but a lot of TV show with our climate here for years with incredible crime story but really how to um to ... you know it's true crime and you know at the central it is a very impressive investigation that's going on but\nYou know it's amazing ... Jim lord of the central story and then you know followed up very closely by the president is turning to women really going back to get the story and put this guy behind bars um you know it is that you know that's that's very much that I very much the attraction\nAnd and failing did you direct this movie\nNo real what we were used as a mix seriously the veteran actor next year seat a directed at you know you probably know Nick from\nAh from justified the TV series but also Nick Nick was an actor and the shape of water he was also three billboards outside ebbing Missouri just just a names and you know a basement basically every movie you know every big movie the last\nFriday the post office and he said that's what he wants to do that how he ... he felt like this was something that he was he could do a really it's designed for him so he's\nStill a good job um you know thank God I didn't direct it uh you know as a journalist I Would have been too concerned with you know making sure that the other thing is you know its toll exact ... you know but Nick Nick has about ... story truth\nBuddies probably all off the street and we'll direction to it um I'm told a story that's very important we want this to be accessible a bombing of a book was a best seller but you know that it's still a limited audience that Ericka was a true crime drama in America\nFor a you know everyone watches out you know if you watch if you watch you know law and order you'll love this\nWell I was gonna say that uh you know to tell a story like this\nIt is a gruesome story but you don't need to show the horror you can apply it and there have been many films are that have dealt with abortion in moral bleak way this is of course before roe v Wade to thing became hot button and movies don't touch it anymore\nBut there was a time when you could do that the movie healthy with ah Michael Cain\nAnd Shelly winters brilliant movie from Nineteen sixty six\nUh it deals with an abortion and it was just

American let them know that it's up to you to do something about this that this cannot continue and the fact that he continued as long as it did how many years was was he operating this house of horrors this guy's now\nWhat Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he's he he you know whether he's operating within ... well you know Seventeen of those years several\nChain of those years no one expected the clinic no one from the department of health decided to to to see you know to do that\nAnd that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know but people need to know what's going on in the country we one of the parts of the film that we you know where most proud of what we think is really important that we and we certainly were very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of credit card bill you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain\nTo the jury what a good portion good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between deaths and murder 'em and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors who who come into that particular effects that the movie\nOf educational to them as alert they learned something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine at least it's a very highly qualified to work all over the United states of America did not know\nSo this is why exactly what you're saying you know people get to go because they're going to get an education and the other side it's just like a law and order episode you have this you know a portion doctor on the stand as can you describe\nA legal abortion to the to the jury and I remember feeling the night at the very beginning of the profits that whatever how that testimony will be in the movie in the movie script was very important to us because we believe no one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first\nAnd of course ... and and no one can criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcript of the trial you know it wasn't you know original writing their you know on and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have it where where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and all you know on varnish way and I think it's it's ... it's quite shocking for people who hear the even people who think they know that subject there'll be quite shocked to hear that's\nThing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so well and certainly both of you do but but what God's nails did that makes them a serial killer\nOr it's not just of course that he's doing very late term abortions which are gruesome but\nUnfortunately quite legal in America but he was also because he made a lot of money off of ah killing children ... that were viable obviously and you describe a described that early on but but but\nThese children would often be born alive and he would he would murder them uh and and that is really why he is behind bars is it not\nYeah yeah I mean is he he he he murdered babies born alive he he murdered his own patients by the way a by allowing on registered unqualified stopped to give them a space here\nAnd he also operated up go low um you know he ...\nHe also did eating in the the the legal limit for abortion and in Pennsylvania is an incredible twenty four weeks an incredible twenty four weeks like six months she was six months pregnant and having abortion\nHowever I wasn't good enough for him he did even earlier than that er during the week and then on the week on the Sunday\nIt abortion sold it to be didn't trust any of the other members of stuff to a system to him and his wife did what he called the special cases like if he was doing twenty four plus during the week while the people during the weekend you know nine months and months nine months that's that's what he was on\nAny nobody would prosecute him he was quite confident that he could get away with this obviously with the with the with the liberal abortion climate in America and especially in Pennsylvania\nAnd he was right that's right because we knew and we know where you're right because we know despite multiple complaints I Love to lots of complaints and and in fact they all you know get complaints came to light during the grand jury investigation you know like\nOh no matter how bad things got and obviously I mean it doesn't get much worse than to women dying noticing what inspired the department of health and Pennsylvania to inspect ... and you know that's a new reason why people need to go and see a movie if this is happening Pennsylvania ... century not in some

that's what they're doing the getting away with bigotry left wing bigotry\nAnd Kanye West says he grow up without a father and told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him\nAnd it is far and away the number one problem in this country the number one problem in the black community the large number of kids growing up without fathers foreign away nothing else it even close all the other stuff people talk about all this other nonsense\nFar and away and you have somebody calling us you can call them uneducated you can call him a not terribly literate calling what

about the black\nFamily after slavery\nA black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof with his biological mother in biological father then today\nIn after slavery because for years it was illegal for slaves to marry it was a huge uptick in Mary and if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten\nA black child was slightly more likely\nTo be
