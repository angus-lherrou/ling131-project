for houses\nMary Ellen happy hunting I'm Glad we're able to give you some insights\nWe'll just we'll get some military history the other day well discussing possible future trip to Germany with my son I remember back when I was a battalion executive officer in Germany\nI knew that are brigades mission was part of the strategic reserve the U.S army in Europe this was during the Cold War and we as a part of NATO were there to keep the communist from attacking into Western Europe\nWhile no one really knew how any battle will go once a for shots fired we do have plans on how we think things will go I asked military intelligence folks what would be the first enemy you know we would face your door start\nIt took a while but they got back to me with the guest that the first year that would be would be something like a hundred and twenty third motorized rifle regiment of the German army that was cool then I asked for the names and biographies of the senior commanders that regiment\nThat took longer they came back with the names of regiment of commanders battalion commanders interestingly enough all of the officers had the same first name for new\nOh I thought that was strange actually I was surprised to see who's eligible guys hadn't thought of strange so I pressed him to look into it long story short for new yes and you stands for first name on the [laughter]\nColonel I didn't see that one coming I I really didn't uh but that does make sense well I've often said that military intelligence is a contradiction the term yeah yeah I was thinking that too but I didn't want to say you're a good start [laughter] okay it's a military history time we'd have skipped\nOn Eighteen October Seventeen sixty seven Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon completed their survey of the boundary between the colonies of Pennsylvania in Maryland as well as areas that would eventually become the state of Delaware and West Virginia\nOpinion Calvert families had hired Mason Dixon English survey heirs to settle their dispute over the boundary between their two proprietary colonies Pennsylvania and Maryland the Mason Dixon Line also became the reference point between the north and the south in our civil war\nIndeed and October Seventeen Seventeen eighty one hopelessly trapped at Yorktown, Virginia\nBritish general lord Cornwall surrendered is eight thousand British soldiers and sailors to a larger Franco American force effectively bringing it in the American revolution\nDo you think he ever lived that one down colonel uh probably not I wouldn't think so I'm sixteen October Eighteen fifty nine abolitionist John Brown let a small group out of re it against an arsenal in Harpers Ferry Virginia and an attempt to incite an insurrection and destroy the institution of slavery\nWell he certainly had a noble cause and he was a couple of years early but uh he certainly kept the ball movie yet will timing is everything isn't it it is indeed\nOne Fifteen October Eighteen sixty three during the civil war the CSS Confederate States ship ... the first successful submarine was sunk during a test run killing this inventor and seven crewmembers\nI'd say that's an unsuccessful test well planned\nOn Eighteen October Nineteen forty two vice admiral William halls eat replaced vice admiral Robert Gordon Lee as commander South Pacific the man nicknamed bull by the press began his military career as a destroyer commander during World War one\nPolicy it was made a captain at the age of fifty three urges naval aviators wings and was promoted the vice admiral in Nineteen forty but it was the bombing of Pearl Harbor that marked out his future for him halls he had his carrier task force I Am maneuvers when Pearl Harbor was attacked\nSo his was one of the few functioning battled groups left after the destruction of so much of the American fleet placing him in the position of making the unpredictable and aggressive strategic decisions for which he would become right now and\nTalk about a good time to pull maneuvers I Wonder how he knew to be gone that day\n[laughter] like I said timing is everything I mean\nThere's everything around Nineteen October Nineteen sixty five North Vietnamese troops launched a major assault on us and South Vietnamese special forces camp apply may in the central highlands two hundred and fifty miles north of Saigon\nDuring the week of Savage fighting defenders of the besieged outpost man by twelve us we embrace four hundred money are tribesmen and a handful of South Vietnamese gorilla specialist repelled repeated Viet Cong attacks the tide of the battle turned finally with the arrival of several hundred South Vietnamese reinforcements and numerous allied airstrikes\nWith a camp secured General William Westmoreland senior U.S commander in Saigon\nDecided to seize the advantage and send in the first Cavalry Division or mobile defined fix to defeat the enemy forces that has threatened climate the decision would result in November and the battle of the grand valley the war's bloodiest battle to date the Vietnamese communist never won a major battle in the entire war they lost every time\nWith the eventually won the war because the U.S media started\nSaying they were winning and the protesters in the United states hit the streets and that military history for today skip armed America time take us there ...\nAll of us here in front lines of freedom want our listeners to get training get armed in that order we fully support the right to keep and bear arms for all law abiding families and we encourage you to find out

cooking behind the counter when a man walked up to her and slumped or in the face giving her a concussion after the undercooked stumbled away a colleague emerge from another area of the restaurant point a gun as the assailant and directed him to leave\nSurveillance cameras recorded the incident in police disseminated the clip to help find the suspect thanks colonel\nThis type of unprovoked violence is happening more and more these days and I suspect it will get worse before it gets better it all started in Europe about ten years ago and it was called the happy slapping game\nBut now here in America it has morphed into something called the knockout game it became popular a few years ago when young teenagers would pick out an adult to attack I didn't catch like walk up to them and sucker punch them in the face the goal was to render them unconscious with one punch\nIn some cases they would even kick the unconscious victim as they lay on the sidewalk and even take selfies of them while standing over the victim\nQuite a few people have been seriously injured put into comas and several have actually died as a result of these types of attacks but how can you defend against crazy acts of violence like this or a few handy self defense tips you can follow to minimize the danger of becoming a knockout victim one\nWhen you are around people you don't know especially when in transitional spaces like parking lots and sidewalks always operate at a heightened state of awareness check people out from a distance and if you see anything that makes you feel threatened or uneasy leave the area\nToo when you walk past people keep them in your peripheral vision many times attackers will glance over at you and then look around the area to ensure no one is watching before the launch the attack\nWatch for these non verbal cues and respond appropriately when you see people with various intent\nAnd three when walking past people on the sidewalk or a hallway or in a parking lot give them a little space don't let them get close enough to play the knockout game and for\nDon't be afraid to make brief I contact just so people know you are aware of their presence you are sending the message I see you and I hold you accountable many times this is all it takes to ward off an attack\nI understand that we shouldn't have to worry about people like this but the sad reality is that this type of craziness happens and we need to be aware of it and take precautions fortunately for the victim in this story there was a co worker with a staunch warrior mindset any successfully

enough sheriff deputies just ... it's just reality and even to Panama City and even in places no other big cities where they have\nPolice department and fire departments and federal entities they're

have this problem over and over\nAnd you wind up with the Cajun Navy guys coming in on boats rescue people and he wanted the U.S has an escorting earth a set of guilty but all the checks and you wind up with a Seventy guard neighborhoods in towns because it's just this this rally last year at Texas we wound up being the security force\nThe town of nursery bill Texas and in fact we ended up guarding the national guard who were not allowed to be are there are there are still out there with no weapons or the senseless and they turned to us because we came into our firearms\nAnd they'd just to stay there so pleased only because our guys with ... at night you have no firearms because of the goofy rules that are there are clear operating under it's just ridiculous\nI don't understand is that this harkens back to the days are over the map when you have there you could be under a mortar attack and you had to call in before he could even returning fire I mean this is crazy what's the point in having a National Guards they don't have that they don't have anything to to help 'em guard stuff with\nRight well look like today we got a report today that down and Panama City National Guard there\nOr do you enforce allowed to be just yet but I'm just pointing out that you know the bureaucracy in red tape we dealt with it last year at Texas which is that what's that again and for the last year and then the Puerto Rico um and just like kitchen maybe we're very much the same mindset\nLeaders for around red tape you don't listen to it we don't worry about as good\nThings to the town with the wind up we wind up with people you know thanking us because we don't want that stuff's topless\nUnderstood no one about\nI mean historically been but you know and I'm forgetting about it after I don't know\nTen Fifteen Years after I quit being a teenager I mean like ... years was um the church played a major role in the in supporting people who were put in a bad spot because of some sort of a natural disaster some kind of an emergency so where is the where's the church\nHas do help them there's there's the ... ministries have their own disaster relief that go out a lot of that is not really\nA applicable until after\nThe initial stages breaks his older when they're doing a result um I Do think churches trivia refuge metallic storm I think every church should have the same type of Curtis mindset has the LDS Church does\nAh fortunately most churches country just do we do use church a church or civil trick is actually in Florida\nThe disaster relief there but they didn't have it back we had to bring food at\nSo I think ah the churches across the country just as we've let our militia atrophy or churches have also atrophied their responsibilities they should be a place of refuge and should be a no nonsense or they should have backup generators ultra sheet\nWhether it's woodstove was or cocaine they should have the ability of two\nThousand shelter clothes and providing clean water for people entitled storm literally and should be ... right that's what the church should be out of it should be related to weather the storm and and the fear fear focal point of a relief afterwards and very few churches today are like that so far but both of them are not\nGoing to do these things are unknown quantities but I Do have a couple of questions that maybe are almost super close but I'm going to try him out on the other way from the time that the disaster strikes and you realize that we're we're getting good right now\nDoes diluting typically begins the moment that the weather subsides a little bit or did they go waiting out to the looters go waiting out into the raging storm and try and pull it off that\nTo sort of star passes we saw that North Carolina they were coming in on boats into flooded neighborhoods um that will direct up two rivers and streams that are coming in on boats into political homes and looting got\n'em they're also Skilling generators off people's porches you're trying to recover from that for the flood so it's just as soon as the storm passes through out\nAnd you know it is that your local meth addict structure at your local you know drug addicts that are going to do it yeah they can go in and score you know easy you know he's a TV set or a generator it gives them drug money if it's going to happen I'm\nA lawyer does on it but they had a team of foreign leaders from Pennsylvania who drove down to North Carolina\nWe're using chainsaws to go on the front doors phones are after abandoned empty and salute them but there there there were arrested this goes to show you that because you know situation dealing after she got teams like that will travel from a state in the whole area and in Texas they had cut Jackie's encourage acting same kind of thing\nStill thinking of going to have a quick score a truck full supplies so you know you want to put more organized looting after that's been a few days three or four days a letter from the local drug addicts usual\nOh boy and a dog to get there probably are and yeah\nUm yeah she should assume that absolutely I mean unfortunately in North Carolina there was a situation where you're at a local fire fire told us so they are rescue helicopter was fired off\nA couple of Yahoo has a boat to didn't want that rescue helicopter shining it's whites on them so they are they're looting so they took a few shots at it forced to abandon its mission\nSo that's kind of situation they are doing with their their habits\n[noise] I'll tell you you just can't rely on people coming together to are we going to always going to be the wild cards so how long how long have you guys prepare to stay down there as long as it takes or do we have an idea of the timeline\nWell usually you're looking at about two weeks span um I mean depends upon how long powers out to eat the security problems that'd be\nAs long as the power's out you're going to have an increased security problem\nAnd that's a can push is simply not enough law enforcement to cover so um to put people in North Carolina we stuck with everybody watched it could be that we're ... protecting the imitation of with almost association we eventually said at the local neighborhood watch of the people that live there\nAnd that's a long term answer all of these small towns that are that blacked out all over Florida like I said I never have watches\nUm you know but we've been to be with the politically correct leftist viewpoint that you know the people themselves should never provide for their own
