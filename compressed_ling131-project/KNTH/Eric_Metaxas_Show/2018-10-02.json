could talk to you buy something more fun but you know what if we're talking about something as important that's something even more important than just having fun so let's get into it there is so much going on in our country we need wisdom what are we to make of the current situation what do you what you have to say\n[noise] Sunday and the side I'm particularly if you get\n[noise] if you like to do\nWith the constitution in the country free market economics and labor actually beginning of the republic but certainly over the last century years\nFundamentally transform the nation let it slip it means\nPrincipals great individual liberal economic freedom showing national security law country there's a cool\nShow from Washington and so on\nOn change for [noise]\nSo they have they have met with resistance by the American people were centrally center right people throughout this entire war that they've been waging so because they haven't been able to achieve a lot of those goals by the ballot box\nBecause the American people see it for what it is and rejected they have used the courts\nParticularly the Supreme Court but the court said all level to impose their ideas and their agenda because they couldn't do it legislatively so when you take a step back and you look at the confirmation fights over Clarence Thomas for example Robert Bork were they were successful and torpedo wing\nCandidate for the nomination right and now with Kavanaugh who\nWill replace a swing vote Anthony Kennedy it makes complete sense that the left would take this approach to destroy the man his career his reputation his good name his family\nBecause for them and it's not personal for them it's all about power and control and if you dare to step in their way of achieving that power and control if he threatened to block their forward march in any way Eric you must be destroyed\nSo none of this should come as a surprise I mean I think all decent people of goodwill are outraged at what about what is happening to this good man but when you take a step back and look at it and the broader sweep of history it makes perfect sense well\nUh I I agree and I guess what I'm Wondering is right now in America\nWhen people you know I think the thing that that that um [noise]\nIt's not just the left is is the enemies of all of it as good untrue and beautiful\nThey exploit a the innocence where the kindness or the graciousness of the other side Hitler did it uh in spades I mean people were to buttoned up to understand they're dealing with a madman until it was too late\nOr you see sometimes um you know the Bush or forty one and to some extent Bush forty three there there's somehow gentlemanly and they allow themselves to be ruled and played by the other side often\nAnd it seems to me right now you have something like that going on in other words the viciousness on the other side people aren't really\nThey're not prepared to accept the absolute willingness on the other side to do anything to win including put someone forward who has so far nothing plausible to say another was ... this woman I'm Ford\nIssue you know anybody can say anything but they're willing to put somebody forward like that even without corroborating evidence just because\nThey think it's going to work they think that if they do this they rattle the cage long enough eventually somebody will given isn't that what what what the Senator Flake just did in other words if you screaming loud enough in the elevator he\nDoesn't have the guts to say excuse me I'm trying to take an elevator if you don't mind you know he wouldn't say that so he left this woman rented him in the next thing you know we have another week of of lunacy it's because the other side has has taken off the gloves\nBut I guess my point is I think your average American eventually does see this and I think that\nYour average American at this point is seeing the craziness that that this has gone so far and it really does become a kind of madness that's taking a silver\nYeah and I look I I think you have to take\nInto consideration to the the the allegations that person making the allegations whether they're cooperation substantiate should we haven't gotten any of that\nFrom the acute Tara frankly any other accuser of judge Kavanaugh and also to your point about the American people and what they see and somebody came forward and said I Know that judge Kavanaugh I drove a car off of a bridge\nI often say a Massachusetts island and round a girl and here's\nThe body and here's what we know and here's how he left the scene and passed down for ten hours before he chose to report the accident and hear the police reports and so on people would say holy cow\nHoly cow he is being accused of murdering someone there are police records medical records proof witnesses eyewitness accounts and so on and this is a heinous crime it's murder\nBut what they're saying is they're they're trying to ... because this woman story is not holding up but it's full of holes and inconsistencies of going back to his high school yearbook\nAn entry than that and whether or not he had an extra beer or two in high school or college most Americans take a look at that and say you know what if an extra beer or two in high school and college it's his biggest crime or I could never make it to the Supreme Court\nI mean people are people know that\nLife is full of shades of gray and ... none of us are perfect the last perfect person to walk the earth with Jesus Christ none of us are perfect and people are thing really you're going to try to block this guy for something he may or may not have done in high school when he was Seventeen or sixteen\nYears old it is madness oh and I think that when you're looking at\nA lot of the polling and and it's very fluid now Eric but what I see is yeah both sides are are now jazzed\nGoing into the terms because of this onslaught against Kavanaugh but what's more interesting to me is that it seems that the Republicans now the Republican base conservatives even independents\nWho are watching this spectacle and it's grotesque hit job on this very good and accomplish mad they are now completely jazz to come out and vote\nThat's my that's my hang on a Monica forgive me we're going to go to a break we're going to come back from talking to Monica Crowley this is their contracts are

me\nUh is not just that you are you're right thinking politically or that you love Jesus but um you worked for Richard Nixon and knew Richard Nixon toward the end of his life I just strikes me as an extraordinary privilege that you had to get to do that and so therefore I guess I Want to\nYou what do you think a President Nixon would make of where we are now but if things were very divided in this country when he was the president but it seems to me that now it's simply worse\nYes and I'm Glad you asked me that question Eric because the leader in the week I'm going to have another call enforce spectator usa the British I excuse me the American edition of the British spectator on since thoughts on that Clarence Thomas Anita Hill\nA spectacle because I was working with him at that time and I think it's important to revisit Nixon's insights into what went down during that period of time because it is so what is an end to the Kavanaugh experience and what we're going through today\nBut I Will take to answer your broader point\nOn yet at the moment that we are currently in I'm not so sure that we've seen since the Vietnam Era and before that the civil war period in the country history\nI think it's really unhealthy I think it's very dangerous and I think that the difference this time around which makes it even more so than those previous two periods I mean obviously the civil war to the very existence of the country but it's at stake\nYou at the huge moral issues of of slavery and abolition and so on\nThe period of the Vietnam Era also was carrying a country apart over the war and and the counter culture and so on so these are all shades of gray of upheaval but I think what makes\nThis particular moment perhaps the most dangerous is that the other side again at war with the constitution\nAt war with free market economics individual liberty oh the great American pillars of exceptionalism that they are so willing to buck the constitution and it's very\nUh foundations of what makes this country what it is\nIncluding basic rule of law principles like due process I mean the left has always been sill outspoken and so adamant about transparency accountability due process you've got the ACLU\nWill now over the last like two days or so the ACLU has come out\nSaying well Kavanaugh should not get to the Supreme Court\nWell what about evidence ... evidence jury rules and requirements what about due process what about the presumption of innocence until proven guilty all of the things that the left the ACLU and said that they stood for forever the idea that they would be so willing to dispense\nOh we forged this bipartisan compromise to allow the FBI to look at this for a week do you think the last few think Coons do you think Feinstein and and the far left that they look at this as oh this was so great a bipartisan compromise this is just yet another delay tactic\nThey want to push this past November and vote\nCan see if they'll have more leverage to stop this seat from ever being filled until the twenty twenty election right\nI mean that that's obvious and that's the question is do people on the geo piece is there anybody there who gets it I Wonder ah what the president's role has been if he's had a role behind the scenes or if he feels that he has to be very very careful but I I the president\nHas always gotten this stuff he somebody who is you know kind of a warrior at hard sometimes to a fault\nBut I really do think that Americans\nWho are inclined toward traditional values toward a um toward voting a more conservative leader I think a lot of them the reason they voted for Trump and the reason they're probably upset with the Senate now is because of this I think\nWhat is wrong with these people are playing Patty cake with the devil Dianne Feinstein is so cynical her legacy will be how she cynically played this this is at the end of her career and it's so ugly so negatively political it's depressing\nYou know over the weekend irregardless watching MSNBC and little bit CNN a little bit the bill Maher show on HBO a little bit and I literally had to turn it off because I felt literal nauseous\nBecause these people are so cruel and there are so vicious and they're so ruthless and the pathological liar is\nThat there's anything wrong with that because we know they know that we're not supposed to judge\nThat ... the ease with which they will mock and disregard tear apart a good and decent man like Brett Kavanaugh over politics over their war for the future of the country that vicious in cruelty that I saw I literally had to turn it off and get away from it yeah\nBecause I felt that non spiritual level and you live talked about this we've talked about our our beliefs and and our faith then Jesus and everything I look at these battles\nNot just on that the sort of a natural level and the political level and so on obviously it is but I also see a spiritual level to this is a spiritual warfare this is good versus evil and it's so clear to I think you and me and and maybe not to some others\nBut the weapons that are used to are so outrageous and inhumane that I think most of the American people even if they don't see it sort of a spiritual dimension to this I think they feel it and see it on some level\nYou listen you you could not be more right at\nHeart this is a spiritual battle and at heart all real battles are spiritual battles but this is\nClear that the the lines are becoming clearer uh the the evil\nOr when people can mock a good man like this and treat him as though he is guilty and you start realizing something's wrong with those people because even if you thought he might be guilty you still believe in fairness you still believe we gotta go according to procedure\nIt's clear the people they don't care they just want to win and it's it's very very ugly and I I think that um I I didn't think I Would uh you know go go there but I wanted to mention the Kanye West thing I don't know if you saw clips of him on Saturday Night live but I thought I never thought\nI Would consider him a hero in a brave man for him being willing to uh to speak out against this bullying as he put it\nThat is exactly I mean if if the if the Senate or a Judiciary Committee and had had half the ... the he had they wouldn't be putting up with this nonsense I just have to say I maybe when we come back we can talk about that because I just I don't know did you see it\nWho who would've thought Kanye West would emerge as a hero of the Republican\n[laughter] I mean can you imagine I mean is it like Larry all I've been\nHearing about this all day yesterday and saying you know let's let's back up Kanye West and let him know he's not Standing Alone that we've got it back he said he wanted split\nThe mega hat on on that I don't know and they were bowling backstage\nAnd color and not to do of course they were but they are they are scared to death if somebody like Kanye West comes out for Trump they're just going to melt like the wicked witch they cannot handle that it's so scary when we come back we're going to talk more with Monica Crowley is the ...

that it's Monday is getting me down it's this Kavanaugh hearing sorry Karen Carpenter hey folks from talking to Monica ... just a few minutes left Monica were just talking about Kanye West and the absurdity I did follow your Twitter feed it reminds me now\nThat you did comment on this but I I cannot believe that he was willing to go out there you got to see this is a brave man to be willing to go out on the stage of SNL to defend Trump to defend his wearing this hat\nThat is just it's just stunning to me that he's willing to do that and all the people who have plotted Jeanette O'Connor like twenty five years ago for ripping up a picture of the pope I mean a ... I Hope those people are applauding him for doing what he did\nWell chances are they're not um you know this whole community of art is entertainers acts churches mutations they like to think they're big rebels ride Erich like\nOh look at me I'm going against the man going against he stabbed us read 'em punk rock well you know what's really punk rock honey in West and you know why he's punk rock because he is standing up\nOh you mean press that I knew about those say well you know what you know about everything so I'm never impressed I'm just like a Greek neighborhood oh I Know you're you're ... impressed I'm impressed\nIn a global way with you on such a level that nothing you can really improve that so there you go okay now listen we are unfortunately um have to talk about what's going on uh with the Kavanaugh hearings it's a grievous crime in the United states of America\nAnd you've written a couple of pieces at the stream\nI like to go to stream dot org stream dot org and check out what you have written one of them is called the forest of the Kavanaugh hearings and then the other one is this is how one would frame Brett Kavanaugh framing the negative sense so I'm\nOkay John what do you have to say\nWell what we're seeing is a shows what we saw was the equivalent of a show trial\nWhere\nUm the people in charge of the show trial trying to destroy someone's good name destroy him politically and destroy us politically\nOr they just kept rewriting the rules and moving the goalposts and to mix metaphors throwing going in one piece of spaghetti at the wall after another\nTo see if it sticks and then if it doesn't stick it doesn't matter because there's more spaghetti and the thought oh Michael out an Audi found some\nYou know a disturbed woman who's been you know who's been subject to penalties for harassment and defamation of character\nAll right well that's true I got something else or yeah\nWhat do you think about this it's like a traveling salesman comes to your door and he's pulling these weird gadgets out of a bill that bag you know oh you don't you don't want a watermelon sharpen your okay that's absolutely fine I got something here that you could make toothpaste outta him you don't want\nThat okay let me try something out [laughter] it's like Mr ... from green acres [laughter] yes and Mr Douglas I have a genuine raccoon coat I've always wanted to do my mystery an impression on the air he sounds a little bit like Brent Scowcroft but we can't we\nCan't get into that and he don't you know that was doing that on purpose he looks and sounds like Brent Scowcroft I never get to do my Brent Scowcroft impression Ankara fertile [laughter] You're welcome\nWill so anyway this the thing is ... let me just say this um we are unfortunately at war we yeah we were playing Patty cake we're playing nice and I really think that if Kavanaugh had been\nAble to be voted on before the flake flake out\nUh I think\nWe could have proceeded and the the the bitter left would have continued to snap and grouse but we could have moved on with some semblance of border with this having happen now with this call for this FBI investigation I think the gloves are now off on both sides I think\nYou know they tell you what it's about it's not it's not just about Kavanaugh it's not just about the Supreme Court it's not even just about roe versus Wade which we don't even know how low the ditches about destroying Trump's presidents I was on the phone this morning with some very serious people who who used to work in the ministry and\nAnd it says about stopping Kavanaugh preventing Trump from from getting a nominee on the court\nGetting the base of the Republican base so dispirited so defeated so humiliated that we don't just lose the house of representatives\nTrump gets impeach which is like an indictment the Democrats now think they can win the Senate and remove him from office that is how lived up\nThis pack of sharks are because they taste blood in the water\nSo we leave that's what this is about this is all about taking down President Trump it's I mean each Brett Kavanaugh is a nice guy who was friends with the Bush family he's the kind of establishment Republican I Would probably normally avoid like the plague\nBut I'm sure you have a very good jurors none of that matters nothing about his character matters now people are saying he's guilty of perjury we can't prove that he molested\nDr Ford will can't prove we ever met her it doesn't matter doesn't matter the inconsistencies and our story which she told under oath none of that matters what matters is maybe we can catch him in in an exaggeration or a slight\nInadvertent misstatement of facts concerning as college drinking habits\nNow I just want to be clear people are saying he committed perjury because he didn't night that he drank too much he didn't he spent he said quite specifically\nI never drank so much that I ...\nI doubt or had time or I didn't remember what I had done that is always had under oath anything else you hear people talking about I wouldn't call it spin I Would call it a lot I I Would call it leibel\nAnd character assassination and anyone who says otherwise you all he lied about drinking no he didn't want your lying now a perjury what is your character problem\nIt's the you know it's an amazing thing because even imagine I mean even just step back and imagine what we're talking about we're talking about a kid in high school and the first year of college I remember\nYou when you were Eighteen ...\nWe were kids in those days where I was a pretty sight your kid but I mean it's hilarious because I remember you at age Eighteen I remember myself at that first of all it's forty billion years ago let's let's be clear okay this is not something that happened in Nineteen Ninety nine\nA this is ages in ages ago\nAnd the drinking age was Eighteen at the\nTime was was Eighteen and I drink to excess every single weekend because that's what you did on those campuses\nAnd yeah and I have\nI Would have five gin and tonics before dinner\nAnd didn't ask them for it [laughter] and then I went to a bar I'd be fine well\nBut the ... listen I can just say this for a fact right in my life I look back on that\nNow what I Want my daughter or my nieces and nephews to drink that much rain like that absolutely not I had a born again experience in my mid twenties and I'm a I'm a different man I can say that and I and I never drink to excess but in those days\nDrinking to excess never got to the point\nWhere you're blacking out or you can't remember never and I think to myself if somebody drink to that level you would say you got a problem like you can't drink that much that\nThey would not graduate near the top of their class at Yale and and get into Yale Law school people like that I knew people like that yeah they tended to drop out then dry off and comes dry out and come back ... solar silver in in in every sense\nOf well I mean that's the that's the point is if you've got that kind of a drinking problem where you're actually literally blacking out you're not going to be able to function at ...

education is supposed to be ... and how about the\nTeaching young people to understand the principle that all men are created equal or why America is the world's freest nation\nThese are all true things it's important that we understand them and there is only one place I can think of where students study these things at the level they do in Hillsdale College and that is Hillsdale College\nOr by putting in the work to understand these essential cruise students from Hillsdale graduate ready to lead in any field of they're choosing and he'll still students learn and what it means to be a

website created just remind listeners which would be you it's my taxes for Hillsdale dot com that's my taxes for Hillsdale dot com and joins mere act let's continue our conversation about the Kavanaugh hearings All right\nThanks documentary was ... when you see a show trial right road is the fundamental difference between\nShowed her show try ... in a show trial legal norms of guilt and innocence and the presumption of innocence do not apply\nBecause you are not being judged as to whether or not we can prove you did something criminal you are being cornfield for your political acceptability and and for how well you'll have to have followed the party line the shifting party line\nThat dominates society so for instance in the Soviet Union when he when Stalin had show trials of his former colleagues who had helped\nDo a ... bring about the Russian Revolution some of them did a lot more fourth and eighth ad on\nHe one of the things that was the first of all they manufactured all sorts of crazy allegations like they they asserted that some of these longtime Bolshevik swore simultaneously spies for England Nazi Germany and the Vatican\nAll the same time that they were sabotaging factories that they were poisoning the water\nAnd then but what was really about was that the reviews about how communism should be implemented war not what style and wants to do at the moment so because\nThey disagreed with him on say how to collective eyes the farms they were criminals trying to destroy society and they needed to be destroyed and they were going to be\n... maybe he has a motivation she wants to eat but fortunately maybe she worked for an abortion company let's\nGet a caller to pick her views on Kavanaugh and we can use the details from the memoir to build a plausible story that will check out in certain particulars because we took them\nDirectly from our judges ... memoir and let's make ... judges stuff fall guy because he admits in the memoir that he he got drunk and blackout that she has memory lapses so he can't say it didn't happen\nBecause he's already admitted he has no credibility as a witness that's why he didn't wanna testify before the Senate because he would just go there and get\nBadgered by liars like Senator Blumenthal who pretended to fought in Vietnam\nAnd now that's not a joke I mean the idea that you know the details on on Blumenthal in the Vietnam claims\nYeah he got as many traps deferments as he could finally cutting devoted anymore and the poll whatever strangely he could to get a U.S assignment he never left us soil during the Vietnam War but he talked\nHe won he lord of the ones gave a speech where he talked about when we were fighting in Vietnam so he's a stone cold or a year and if he were to say\n... under oath that he fought in Vietnam she could go to prison for perjury says the man who are willing Brett Kavanaugh about the meaning of both in his year book\nWell actually the warning\nHim if you're willing to lie in small things you're willing to lie in greater things I Wish to God Kavanaugh had said oh you mean like line about serving in Vietnam the way you did senator that would've been great\nNow I guess I'm not clear did the Blumenthal ... did he said in a collective way when we Americans we're fighting in Vietnam another with no\nNo he said no no he was talking I think he's talking about soldiers he said you know when we were serving in Vietnam and it was a it was in the context of fighting himself in Vietnam\nWell that's how I thought I just want to be clear but yeah yeah so we have a situation where\nUm the people uh in in the Senate on the left side of things we have obviously Feinstein and and and White House and and all of these folks they seem to be\nI mean it's kind of obvious but I just want to say that they really\nJust want to win what Feinstein did the plausible deniability and we didn't leak this thing or whatever it it seems clear I think the most Americans who are paying attention to this that\nIf she really cared about this they would have brought it out over two months ago but they knew that politically it would be far more damaging to do right during the hearings and so they sprung it on America\nAnd then this woman of course is forced to come out of hiding and and uh you know become a national figure out and you know she seems like a very fragile person I ... I Can't help but think that she's damaged in some way that something horrible happened in her past\nI couldn't help but feeling sorry for her because she seems like a very uh as I put in a very fragile person ... I still can't I I Wonder if the truth will ever come out uh why she's doing this in what she really believes I don't know that we'll ever get that\nYeah I I don't think it would be very convenient for them if it did come out well um I think she was\nIn the music and I think there is not just no reason to believe it was Kevin all their strong reason to believe it was not Kavanaugh\nUm the fact that all of this was handled by hurt George Soros attorney and I'm not using that lightly hurt or turning this cat has worked for Fifteen Years for George Soros directly\nThis is ugly business so ugly I Hope\nMost people in America are are paying attention this is this is not GOP versus Democrats this is really for the soul of this country there there are many good people are in America who who would have voted\nI'm against the GOP in previous elections but I Am I Am hoping\nThat there is some real liberals out there who understand that the things that have held us together as a nation or being threatened by people who are so desperate for power they simply don't care anymore they simply don't there's not that they care in a long time but\nBut they're revealing themselves to be willing to go to extremes that we have not seen in our public life this is very very destructive to the foundations of this country uh I I just want to\nOr we're going to have to go to another break here folks I'm

and credible whether he was candid with us whether is Demian or by the way and and now accusing Democrats or some kind of a conspiracy\nAnd do him and noticed she didn't ask that all about the
