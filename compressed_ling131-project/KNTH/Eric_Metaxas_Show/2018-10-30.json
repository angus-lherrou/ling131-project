I don't know how many of your or hundreds out there and how many of you have friends who who are hunters but when the shooting I actually uh well I better not go into the store to much don't wanna get in trouble but I'll say this\nOne of the hunters wanted to try to suppress or just to see if it ... enough to keep the hogs running because once he shoots one ... feet or\nThe other side of the sound and run but with a suppressor you can take out several of them [noise] so do did send Miller offer any other solutions trapping him anything\nRestricting the regulations on hunting on hall Kathy know his solution was a poison that could enter the food chain that could\nTaint hogs and you're supposed to recover the carcasses of the hogs bury him Eighteen Inches underground a here's another issue this is a slow killer\nThis is why the peta people were were doing it because it's slowly kills ... what's that mean it means it stays in the system for a wild hogs will eat the bait and travel we don't know how many days it takes to kill a home with this poison\nWe don't know a a hunter shoots his hog and feeds it or one of the lawsuits that was a put out was by a gentleman who actually sells the feral hog meat so don't food manufacturer\n\nHe could potentially potentially contaminate dog food none of this matter just said no matter what mattered to sit down her\nWas getting that could put out their read labeling it ripping off FDA labels are federal labels\nFederal warning labels precautionary labels what's not see why these labels let's just rip them off this is Ted Miller a Republican\nAnd so he's definitely not a friend of hunters there's other things bell sit and do that you should be concerned about farmers were seriously seriously say about ... number because once he got into office he did something\nShe\nRaised fees for a range of services that the agency offers farmers he said that the agricultural department needed more\nIt needed more funds will the fees generated were over six and a half million more thirty one percent more than what they needed so they're overcharging farmers overcharging Texas farmers\nNot afraid of the hundred not offended farm and not a friend of the rancher may be may be some ranchers might be a sprint because of the turtle hug population the the ... put those who don't realize how dangerous it is\nNevertheless there's one more thing you need to do this man who raised the fees\nOn farmers\nAnd gained more than thirty one percent needed\nOver six million dollars more than the than the services actually cost the farmers he also added without publicly posting jobs to his office gave his friends jobs created positions\nThat weren't there to employees friends so this guy he's not worth having guys vote a\nJury Patterson

the Jews I Want to be really clear that at the heart of this\nIs nothing less than the person uh the percentage of evil Satan is behind this and so I just want to tell people if you want to know um what's that the root of something like this you can trace it through history\nOr is it is profound evil and it just happened the other day absolutely horrific that in Pennsylvania and the United

they're allegedly being persecuted by 'cause that's when you are right the earlier effigy if you're governments persecuting you or you didn't see the Jews fleeing Germany waving Nazi flags in singing the songs and demanding that the the us admit that\nNo the wouldn't tragically we turned away thousands of Jewish genuine refugees being persecuted by the Nazis Franklin Roosevelt did that these people are not refugees they're marching with the flags of their country\nMost of them are young and military age men this is a lot more like the ... the landing in Mexico and trying to take the place over ... ...\nOr a caravan it's an invasion by people who are not refugees they even offer refuge in Mexico they've said no under no legal theory to these people have a right to enter the United states but if they set foot on American soil\nThen George Soros and the Roman Catholic Church lay on Catholic Church their lawyers will flock on them and it'll cost fifty thousand dollars each to prove that these people\nAre not refugees what we know perfectly well they're not refugees we need to keep them off us soil and Enron and President Trump needs to push Congress to fix our asylum and refugee laws are absurd they were joke they're designed to help immigration lawyers make tens of thousands of dollars off\nThe taxpayers while the fake refugees disappear into the country and work illegally and then have anchor babies who are citizens who conflict welfare\n... should we not changed the anchor babies law how did that ever happened\nWhen I was a misinterpretation of the fourteenth amendment they wish intend it was intended to get citizenship to the to the former slaves and their children lawyers and judges misinterpreted that to be that\nIf someone flying from Korea to Iceland and she's pregnant and she stops off in Chicago she gives birth in the airport that kids are citizens\nThat have you know I Will tell that ... wouldn't that be\nA simple fix it's fairly clear and fairly ridiculous to most Americans that that that that that's should be changed don't you think\nPresident would would they wouldn't they wouldn't need to pass a law and and see it hit me to get it through Congress and then the last word challenge it in ... and it would go to the Supreme Court it I suspect that we we now have a court which would uphold scene interpretation of that that just because an illegal immigrant while you're holding or ...\n... gives birth all of a sudden she can stay and and our kitchen get welfare and you know the family can't be separated the sanctity of the family I mean I think if Donald Trump's\nHe needs to stand for the one way to lose the midterms is to give in to this it's a look utterly we get to tell the Republicans look we can't do anything even Donald Trump as president can't stop a massive invasion from Latin America that sends a green light to the next four and five and six and seven invasion\nOr I Can't we punish Mexico they're the ones that are allowing this\n[noise] I think we frankly should put our troops into it I mean it'd be worth occupying the border on the Mexican side to these people can enter the country\nI mean wouldn't that hey that'd be awesome maybe we can ... we we take Mexico\nWell I don't want I don't want to know I Want to inches on their side of the border that's how much in Mexico\nI let it but it but but but you know I mean I joke but it is interesting to me that why why aren't the Mexicans taking care of this like why are they allowing this to have\nTried to stop these people in the attack their police they're bloody federal ... Mexican police who were attacked by these guys I mean this is an it's an army\nSo they have an army so the Mexicans cannot stop this they're they're selling group and they would end the\nViolence force and then they would look bad to their people this is all it's all this instant replay of its famous novel the camp for the saints it's a French novel from the seventies about\nCountries being overwhelmed by mass immigration invasions and because they put the women and children up front people can't\nDo anything they didn't feel paralyzed to stop them and so the countries that are obliterated I recommend everyone read the camp at the same it's all about people using weapon icing the week and the poor and putting them in front of an army of invasion to destroy public order\nAnd tear down countries like America and like Europe look what's happening with Muslims in your Muslim So called refugees in Europe\nWhile I was going to say but this is what the the the most wicked uh people do I mean the the radical I'm Muslims do the same thing with women and children are they set up shop inside schools and hospitals and then when you bomb them or you know you're you're killing civilians it's it's just kind of the most cynical mass\nKilling she'll stay using ... ...\nIt's the same world view I mean the the biblical worldview says that we ... we wouldn't do that that's the level of cynical deception or to trade\nOn A People's respect for women and children ... you don't do that this is very dark stuff I'm John we're out of time when we come back I'm going to be talking

many Greeks on this and they do really believe\nThat they had been sold out are sold down the river as it were economically uh and in other ways and I guess my question to you would be what you think it's possible to do right now in to the United states take a role in this it seems that Brexit\nA was a very healthy sign something along the lines of the election of Trump that that that the people so to speak\nOr have caught on to the idea that the people I'm In uh who are supposed to represent them are in fact not representing them well and something needs to be done do do you think that uh there's hope that some of these European nations might rebel against their overlords in Brussels\nCoil it as I was saying before your break um the result of shoring up in Italy we're we're pretty new parties uh took control of the government and they are very disturbed that what happened to ... is in line for Italy\nAnd so they are making all kinds of noises about limiting the power and role of you\nAnd may also be thinking of somehow ticket country out or we have a job on the president I'm hungry\nOr who is the firing on its immigration policies saying that we're not taking all these people there's only two million Hungarians are not going to\nBecome a different kind of country and [noise] so you're is faced with these crimes a rebellion [noise] um [noise] uh the British one uh this is not over yet I mean I've never expect to the British would actually be able to get out\nAnd they have a I don't know how many years was has been dragging on couple at least I think um it's not clear that they'll get out in any real way\nUh they may get out on paper but still be subject to bought your rules and payments and everything else\nSo [noise] how it comes out I think it remains to be seeing but we've had a base to principles established a while but\nOkay and so when it gets when Germany do to get out of it\nFor court actually might happen\nBecause of all the American pressure on Russia [noise]\nCity you break up because some of the European countries especially some of the central your moods\nAre realizing that they're being forced into conflict with Russia from which they would have no chance whatsoever of surviving\nAnd I have no stake whatsoever in the conflict\nAnd and the cost of a ... that are dumped on Europe from Washington [noise]\nAh it's starting to erode the a hedge enemy washed and has exercised over in Europe since the end of World War two\nSo some of the European governments are beginning again to fake like there are a sovereign country if they want to be sovereign from the Americans saying OK so troubling to grow\nTheir policies all of this time so you may see a breakup or a beginning of a breakup of the ... which then makes it easier\nFor country to leave for other reasons such as economic ... so I don't think anything is static in the world and I think the guidance of a threat [noise] Washington issue is costly\nTo the Russians and the Iranians are the Chinese and now to Germany you know washing the toll Germany if you go ahead with this new or two pipelines for Russia we're going to sanction you\nWell that's not a very smart thing but go Germany gives us the fighting Kurdish and not much we can do about it\nAnd it break if we lose our influence the German and ... years up for grabs so you can't say it's too late for Greece because you don't know what kind of a mess wash those garlic\nSo you disagree with Trump's ah we all share solid\nEuropean countries to go to say we are not going to be forced into a conflict with Russia suicidal and not go do it\nAnd so then you get turmoil and Frank churned up and\nAs I said earlier it's already happening in ... in Italy you know just like in Greece Greece but came up with a new part I forget his name I forget the name of the later [noise] but now they're saying things happening in like third parties that together and they have more votes\nBut still not the kind of [noise]\nSupport that they need to be a form\nOf about\nTwo years but it's happening already and show which is French French probably rowboat so I think the whole of things\nAre going to change the ... what happened to Greece a ... a limerick considering what the pressures on Europe to\nGet Russia is causing a lot of thinking has been absent for decades\nTrump's actions may or may\nLead to good even though I guess you're saying that you you don't agree with the way he's approached ah the ah the Europeans\n... might be a good thing for breaks up [noise] because without that if you're on stage really didn't have generally over Europe it wouldn't be able to like these stretch to Russia when Henry Ford says it wouldn't have anybody to get ... diplomatic cover\nYou you don't think the Europeans will be dumb enough to kick us out and tell us to get our bases out of there that doesn't seem possible to me\nWas [noise] was nothing about that would be the smartest thing they could possibly do\nYou they don't have the money to defend themselves do they\nWouldn't have shown whom\nFrom us exercises here generally over Europe is your life stage yeah\nBut you can't have your own policies that we'd all of them show or you know but they're so used to that they don't talk much about it but they're starting to say\nWell that to me that's a positive development I have to say I

A. G. E.

whole show that takes place over there but the one that involves um us in close proximity\nIs right here and do our phone lines are open for you and I've got some questions for you ah obviously plenty of things to say but I always couch them in questions for you\nBefore I Begin asking you what you think about some things I'm In a time when so little unifies us I think when we were lashed together on Thursday here on the Larry Elder show I think I went through my usual speech about how unity as for the birds common ground is a\nIs a mess and in fact we are a better people we are a better government we are a better society when everybody just\nIt is true to their beliefs let the conservatives be conservative and fight for conservative things let the liberals being liberal and fight for liberal things were going to have winters who when losers who loses what the election is about the do week from tomorrow the winters are going to win the losers are going to lose and I've been preaching a conservatives for years\nI don't think you're going to win by trying to reach out to the left 'cause all they're going to do is bite your hand off because they ain't reaching out to us\nAnd nor should day the left should be left if their ideas prevail good for them not so good for the country in my view but they're they're all this common ground unity come by on nonsense\nI is in terms of policy\nIt is ridiculous but I offer that\nAn on ramp to the following there is a short list of things that unify all of us under the umbrella of our humanity or at least should I Wish it were all of us are but there is a a a little tiny sliver of a subsection of of humanity in its steamy underbelly [noise]\nThat ah that does things like what we have seen in Pittsburgh and so before we dive in and talk about Pittsburgh before we dive in talk about the media reaction and political reactions to Pittsburgh let us just pause and do the most important thing we can do as Americans as people\nAnd that is lift up those last people in prayer let us lift up the soles of those who are shot by this this this monster\nTheir their families their friends\nTheir faith community there at the tree of life synagogue it is it it is probably if it is sad\nThat it takes thing the only things like this truly unify us but this is not a a policy battle this is not a left versus right thing this is a good versus evil thing\nNow in a minute now you will hear people say that that in their take on good versus evil\nThey consider the president of the United states to be evil man that I'll have a word or two to say about those people but before we before we had down those various rabbit trails of talk show land\nUm let us just no matter what we are doing\nRight now where I Am here in central time it's a little after five in the sun is shining it's beautiful warm Texas day\nMaybe you're a little bit into your commute on the east coast maybe in a beautiful vistas of mountain time it's late afternoon and you're enjoying whatever you're doing it out on the west coast and not in a\nAn elder country of Los Angeles and various other affiliates in California where it's a little bit after three it's the middle of the afternoon to Monday and maybe you've come through a weekend filled his blessings filled with faith and failed his family at least that certainly my hope for you [noise]\nThis is exactly what these folks thought as they walked into the synagogue on Saturday morning\nI've heard a lot of people say that the one victim they can't get out of their heads as the Ninety seven year old woman and I I Confess to that myself type at any one life is is worth more than any other like who that was really bad I mean they're all bad it's all terribly there's all heart rending but if you're Ninety seven\nYou saw the Holocaust first hand a lot of people who are Ninety seven are Holocaust survivors and they were dwindling generation we should cherish them while they're here\nAnd the notion of somebody surviving that time when we had a global force in the Nazis who's goals including the eradication of the Jews\nTo defeat the third Reich to win World War two\n[noise] two seed decades of further one would hope enlightenment a surround the world\nTend to have that horror be an increasingly distant memory but a memory we keep alive there's a reason those words never forget are so important never never\nForget it's not like this was thousands of years ago with all kinds of brutality were common\nIt's not like it was the refuse in time and you know just a few centuries ago the kind of world gave birth thank God to the United states of America this was when this was this was the thirties and forties for crying out loud we have people walking around a live who who were ... teenagers and young adults from that time\nAnd this this this wonderful woman who was one of them for her to survive all of this only to take a bullet in the safety of her synagogue in in in Pittsburgh in October of twenty Eighteen are you kidding me\nWell no we're ah we're in we're not kidding there are people who are in this twisted there is hatred there is anti Semitism there is racism and massage any and all of these these\nBehaviors that are uh that that are the devil at work\nIn our lives [noise] uh how many such people are there I don't know if it's not many at all but it doesn't doesn't take many this only took one\nI I Am not comforted by the fact that it's a tiny sliver of humanity that that dives to this death but the fact that they want us to many the fact that the any human being can spew this kind of nonsense of about about the Jews\nI mean not to any type of hatred makes more or less than than than the other there are some people who hate other people you know because of skin color others who have other people because of religion and others who have other people for a wide variety of reasons\nAnd ... and ... and it's pathetic and\nAll good people unite in a segment where we've talked a lot about division in unity all good people unite to to mourn to lift up these people these victims\nThese beautiful souls and that's in a God we lift them up we celebrate the they're welcoming into the arms of a loving God\nAnd we keep their families and that community there and scroll hill and all of Pittsburgh we keep them in our thoughts and prayers and in our our best thoughts as we move forward\nAs we do move forward it is time to take a look at the ... sorry tawdry bottom feeding that happened is people politicized this\nOh and you're going to hear some of that\nAnd then you're going to hear about some of that from me and I'd like to hear about some of that from you we may not agree on everything that's fine that's why we have phone lines eight eight eight nine seven one said Mark Davis info aerial they're very very glad you're here on this Monday is can be important show very blessed to be here with you right back\nThe Pittsburgh synagogue shooter was somehow spurred to action by the president warnings\nAbout the care of in\nThousands of people who are headed our way in order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is vigilance about that somehow set the stage for\nThis kind of a reaction I mean how low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is in why is the author\nYou say you might be why is he out there are very very first thing that the president didn't condemn\nThe attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous\nActs you can't start putting the responsibility of the individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime is delivered on the promises he made and if anything I think is sad I and divisive the way that every single thing that comes out of the media and Ninety percent of what comes out of the media is now is negative about this president\nAmen amen and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged down\nAs you hear word afterward and page after page in speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet about our level of discourse in civility is all kinds of dashed against the rocks and observation that you certainly can make\nIs it because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp elbows de salty thing that he might have said it's summer rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nNo reason our discourse has been dragged into the muck\nIs the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that he won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd this this is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way the level of vitriol the level of bend them\nWhen you have an entire dominant media culture walking around
