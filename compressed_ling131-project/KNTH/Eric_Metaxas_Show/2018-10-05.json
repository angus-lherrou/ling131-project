if you missed the first few segments well I'm Sorry we've been discussing the electoral college we've been discussing the\nFallacies regarding our government and the political process we have now that I Want to give you an interesting though did you know that there was not in the beginning a two party system\n\nDid you know that the electoral college from each state was required to cast a vote for a person running for the office and they were cast\nA vote for two separate people in other words they were cast a vote for this group or this person and then another vote for this person and at least one of the people they cast a vote for at least one of the people that they cast a vote for\nWas not supposed to be from their state [noise]\nSo when we see this what would happen is you have a multitude of people you would have each state send it to like doors to cast a vote for a candidate\nAnd at least one of the candidate they would catch to boats and at least one of the candidates they voted for could not be from their state and the interesting thing about this is we had a multitude of candidates coming in so there were various political ideas represented\nAnd the elect tours were allowed to choose a number one and a number two\nThey were to cast to vote then the votes of the electors would be tallied up and whoever got the most votes was the president and whoever got the second most votes\nWas the vice president\nYou didn't choose a running mate you didn't get a one party here or a two party here typically it could happen but it wasn't designed to happen\nIn other words you can have an extreme socialist and an extreme conservative on the same platform one president and one vice president and I didn't mean the same platform but on the same I'm both an office\n\nIt was it was actually quite fair the way it used to work but we have gradually destroyed the representation of each individual nation in these several states and that's quite dangerous\nThe\nBest solution is education it is going to be difficult to turn back the process but without education is this going to be impossible to turn back the\nProcess the guys this is the best course of action is to fight for the state sovereignty\nTo fight for the state's sovereignty means we put more authority back\nInto the state back where it belongs\nWho really who really better represents you\nSomeone in Washington DC or some congressman you said the Washington DC Washington DC or your local state representative\nYou know the representatives used to a point senators\nWe wouldn't have this vote over be toe O'Rourke and\nA Ted Cruz\nWe would have your state representatives appointing them and if you didn't like the senator did you talk to you representative and if he wanted to stay in office he recalled that senator and get someone else out there that represents your ideology\nBut the best course of action is return the authority\nTo the sovereign states and does\nGive the people more local control\n\nThat is the best course of action we have unfortunately it's going to take a lot of educating\nGuy not giving you a very very brief rundown a brief um education if you will some of you is just a re education or just a re familiarize yourself with things you've already know\nI don't know where everybody stands in a political perspective there are some people who are brilliant geniuses out signed me and there are people who haven't studied that far because they've concentrated their studies elsewhere\nIt doesn't hurt to be ignorant on the political process and it doesn't mean anything if you've never heard this before and you've never understood this it doesn't matter it's it's not degrading to you because we're all ignorant of something but the idea is now that you've heard it\nThis is your first time hearing anything like this how the electoral or white electoral college works how the constitution was set up the limited\nResponsibilities and the limited authorities of the Congress if this is your first time I checked me see if I'm right pick up a constitution read it it's not that long\nChicken and see if I'm right guys there's nothing wrong with being ignorant absolutely it's when you're stupid that you got a problem\nAnd this can be cured stupidity as when you see the facts and you ignore the facts stupidity is when your mind\nPuts your personal preferences or your emotions over facts\nStupidity is when you ignore having knee jerk reaction or rebellion is is this case to have a knee jerk reaction to something that doesn't follow your core\nThought process or your core beliefs challenging core beliefs either the wrong with the right if the right those challenges make you stronger\nIf they're wrong then you become a little more educated\nA little more informed it's a great thing all around anyway we're up against another break we'll be back\nIn just a minute you're listening to the final chapter thank you guys for joining me like I said well you back and just miss a hold on time [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nOr the reason you're here is not because you're related to Rush Limbaugh although congratulations on that very few people achieve that in their lifetime you might like that it's not an easy because I tried for a while and then I'd rather just not going to happen [laughter] but um\nBut you've written a book you've written so many wonderful books in here I'm holding in my hand another one the title of it 'cause Jesus is ribs\nAnd Paul and the early church you did not used to be a Christian and you certainly did not used to be a Christian author you live you you dove into this thing almost like you believe that\nYeah yeah uh interesting I've always so enjoyed our interviews because you bring up things that no one else does that wasn't one of\nThem when I asked my point now where you know what I Want to know seriously you are you you said is on the program before before my listeners people just tuning in how to you you're a lawyer how did you come to fake what happened\nI it was a skeptic as you mentioned and but I was a seeker I I always believe in God that I didn't embrace the God of the Bible didn't embrace these as Christ didn't really believe that an all loving God would allow people to suffer a much less a turtle damnation and all that and um\nI finally started studying it reading apologetic books\nPaul Little um you know Josh ... del Norman guys are and I finally uh overcame my so called intellectual doubts\nAnd then I later placed my faith in Christ but I\nI just I I I don't understand how anyone can think that there isn't a cod I mean Romans one I don't understand you know that you look at the creation you look at the ah you look at everything I Know the Senate can point poke holes and all of that but if they have an open mind they will understand\nBut but embracing got a Bible was a little difficult in what I didn't realize is that people had placed seeds in my path all along and I didn't realize it until after I became a believer little thing that if they hadn't happened if God and it's probably\n[noise] I Love it you know I mean everybody's path is different and it's so fascinating to me but I I Want to encourage everybody who's listening this is not for other people is this for you it's either true for it's not and if it's true\nBy the way it can only bless you there are people I think they have this fear is gonna bears me it's going to make me living that an absolute garbage I Want to date that clearly that is garbage\nIf you think that believing in Jesus will make you into a weird person it'll only make you into weird person if you want to be we should person but honestly\nIf you want to be who you're supposed to be if you know if you want to get to your grave\nUh always wondering who am I really supposed to be well then you can avoid God but God is kind of like the gas in the tank the cars and go anywhere without gas on the tank and I I just want to say to people you know who find themselves in a position like you to say honestly the idea that this is scary in some way is a total why\n... and picking up on that I I think there's a there's a lot of paradoxes in Christianity in my view and I talked about some of them in one of the book but I think some some of this pre Christian\nHad this fear that Christians don't have fun they don't enjoy life there like I said they're ... they're they're regiment of the robotic they don't they don't live robots life\nAnd if they do is just to be goody goody isn't the kind of people you wouldn't want to hang around with not because you ... enjoy just 'cause they're they're not happy people for some of them kind of I'm not so there are a bunch\nOf well I I Know I can give you named after the show okay [laughter] but [laughter]\nBut what I didn't understand until later I began to study it I said how can you reconcile this idea that Christianity gives you a liberty Paul talks about immigration it it'll set you free ... believe in Christ in such for what okay here's here's the answer that paradox before you become a Christian\nYou are a slave to send it is your master now I don't mean that kind of sin your terrible person all we're all the prey but I'm not in just vernacular labor macular I'm not saying if you're a terrible person may be a very nice for it\nBut you're a slave to that kind of lifestyle in his it has dominion over over you when you accept Christ as your personal savior\nYou are a liberated from sin and you become a slave to Christ now what does that mean that that that doesn't mean you're free ... and Paul addresses these cars that me and I'm Free to say\nNo in fat ugly now it means you're now a slave to Christ slave I don't want to be a slight know what you understand that you then out of love and the ... you want to even raised yourself to a higher standard of morality or out of a beatings and love for Christ and and what it all means but you're not bound to you're not living under\nArbitrary not armed for not living under the the set of rules they transcend that crisis goodness and love\nA transcends all that and you want to be a beat him and you're no longer sleep descent\nAnd I want to follow up with this when we come back folks were talking to David Limbaugh brother of Russell and uh this is the our taxes show I'm not a sibling of Russell's but I'm aware of his work we'll be right back to the book is Jesus has risen\n[noise]\nWhen that sarin News I'm

Seventy I'll repeat that at the end of the show I Want to go back to\nA day but you were talking about going through the scripture what you've done in your book now this is the new one Jesus has risen Paul in the early church\nYou are effectively entertaining the scripture another's you're doing a Bible commentary even though you you you're presenting it as a popular book because it is a popular book but the point is that you're also doing a Bible\nCommentary you're helping people because by the way that is biblical people always say well that's the word of God there's something about the word I got well by the way in the word of God says uh unless somebody explains it to you how you can understand that you need somebody who gets it to help you understand what it says that if you just open up the Bible and start reading a lot of people are going to get stuck I\nGot stuck you need somebody to help you and that's what your books are doing\nExactly thanks for saying I I saw a guy and Twitter somebody promoted my book on Twitter and some Senate comes on there no thanks I I got the Bible that's all you\nKnow that's not all you need but we have Sunday school teachers by the way\nBut can you can you imagine we just got to say like the level of of foolishness that is on social media there are people that advertise their idiocy there the whole world to see and it's this religious\nSpirit when they say I got the Bible like wait a second are you telling me that you shouldn't read anything but the Bible exactly but there are people will say that thing and guess what in the Bible in\nX. okay Paul is in in in Athens okay preaching to the Athenians what does he do he quotes pagan poets in the scripture absolutely okay so there's this idea you can't even escape\nPagan poets when you read the word of God so folks that that's going to challenge some people the logically but I'm not challenging you the Bible is challenging you and\nBy the way he he he cited pagan poets not only did show that he was learned but to relate because he he said I become all thinks all people don't sweat the small things I'm going to uh relate to people whoever I advantage allies because I can get into their\nAh into their framework and they'll listen to me if I Know something about their world you don't compromise you don't delete the gospel that's not what he did at least I'm not going to sweat the small stuff I'll allow us to these certain things he said you you guys believe in God\nBut what about the let me tell you about the living God and so he explains too so get talked to people in their own terms it as a evangelists an apologist so\nUh but I what I think and and you hit on something else\nI have a lay platform I I Am not a theologian I'm not a pastor but I've studied a lot in my life the Bible in in theology when my adult life\nAnd I feel like I was calling to share what I've learned with people who are similarly situated ... people are not quite there as Christians and Jews and Christians\nWho uh who who want to learn more about the Bible who who are hungry to learn because I think I can relate to these people in a way that pastors and theologians can't they talk to people on their level and and other levels but they don't most of them don't know what it's like to be a skeptic bless their hearts\nI always wanted but that's exactly right and that's why I write a lot of what I write 'cause I remember vividly what it's like to think Christians are not somebody I Want to be the I remember vividly what it's like\nTo think they think they've got all the answers they're idiots I remember that two viscerally yes and so I feel a passion to reach people who think that way right now but as I say I know what's going through your head I was one of you and I think that it's important for folks like us\nTo write books like that so I I Want to say thank you for writing Jesus has risen people need it\nBut I also want to thank you and I want to shake people out of their complacency even Christians who don't sometimes I I just wonder why people aren't more passionate like you and I are that a lot of things ... bumps analog\nLook this is the word of God it's the living God that God that sent his son to come down to become a human being and suffer all those indignities for us because it was the only way we can be safe\nAnd you don't want to learn more about the Bible I it's it's not I'm not saying I'm good every day I'm I'm very sporadic but it is so profound that it's really the word of God you got to get into\nSays okay we're going to be right back folks talking to David Limbaugh trust me it's not the coffee is the Holy Spirit you'll see we'll be right back [noise]\nThis isn't about my freedom is is that everybody's for

with their music you know that's the re kind of seniors did you know that are the ... that some well somebody else does it to like the original but but\nI listened to the right kind of singers version I thought oh that's the version that the movie version I Want to play my program talking to David Limbaugh and I'm David I'm your book is called Jesus is resident and we were just talking about how excited you got into that I find this very interesting when you said that you just when you really discovered that the Bible\nIs the word of God now a lotta times America's we say the word of God and I think we lose a lot of people because the heck does that mean\nWord capital W word the Greek word is logos so when we say the word of God I often think the Protestants evangelicals kind of get it wrong because we're so focused on word as word that we're missing that there's a bigger piece to it the logos to say use the word of God\nIs more than the words of God it's a one wonderful thing to say these are this is this is God's word and these are the words of God but to understand that it's a fused with the divinity of God himself it's used with\nWith the presence of God and apart from that it's not the word of God right just a bunch of black marks on a page and a minor bird or a parrot could speak the word have gotten it ceases to be the word of God right\nI'm well first of all this is the greatest country in the history of the world not because I say so not because I'm a great now because your great but because\nThe ideas behind this country or a gift from God to the whole world we are stewards of these ideas of self government and freedom and basically uh\nWe have to take that seriously it's like somebody gives you an extremely valuable object worth a ... so much money is so fragile you you can't say that not mine I don't care that they've given it to you even trusted with it you need to take it seriously and I think that\nWe have to take what we have seriously and and part of that means we have to understand how it works and so what's been going on with the cabinet nomination\nA has been depressing because people I'm On the Democratic side of the aisle traditionally have played by certain rules and I think somehow they feel now they no longer can play by those rules because there's so much at stake\nI'm that's bad for everybody it's bad for them it's bad for the whole country so I'm asking you if you're listening to this right now\nI pray for this country and we always say that pray for the ...\nI mean genuinely pray when there's a commercial or when you have a second say a prayer whether you're in a car wherever you are say a silent prayer or spoken allowed prayer for this nation for this confirmation process because this is dark stuff right now we are we're talking about\nWhat a man did or didn't do when he was Seventeen years old whether he got drunk or whatever and I think wow this is this is madness has descended on America and then when the G O P relent to pressure and says okay we'll drag this out again will have the uh uh an FBI probe\nOf course Feinstein and others say oh it's not the right kind of FBI probing not deep enough it's not broad enough which really means that they won the latest forever and they're using every political advantage you have to see it for what it is folks you've got to see it for what it is\nBut it's it's as nasty and unpleasant as anything I have ever seen a year and so I Want to ask people pray a pray for Kavanaugh but more than that pray for the country please pray for this country that we can heal and that people who are negatively part is in\nA would would understand that we have certain standards that we have to abide by no matter what next month that I wouldn't want to say that\nMy fear is if Kavanaugh does not get a a put on the Supreme Court and the Democrats take over in November that that is the one two punch that will knock out while there is\nIs why thank you for reminding me to say to everybody you need to vote and actually I Want to say particularly to pastors out there\nYou need to understand you have free speech and the idea that you can't speak politically from the pope it is a joke and it's being used to keep you silent now you may out of respect for your congregation and I would advise that don't advocate for any candidate for any party but speak about how we have an obligation to vote biblical\nPrinciples unborn\nAre are expecting us to vote because nobody's protecting them a we have all kinds of sexuality issues madness has descended across America and if you don't stand up not just by praying\nBut also by voting I have to say you're going to be held accountable okay you're going to be guilty when bad stuff happens you can send me I should have voted twenty Eighteen it was it was kind of tough for me that day folks leads you get an absentee ballot now do what you need to do to vote I Want to say I'm speaking of which of people know this week we're doing a\nA fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom when we talk about the madness\nThat has descended on America right now and most Americans get this you don't have to be a conservative or a Christian to get this anybody with common sense\nA gets that uh madness has decided on America okay for example yesterday literally yesterday was today Thursday okay Wednesday yesterday\nThe U.S department of education announced that acting on a complaints filed by our friends at the alliance defending freedom or against the Decatur, Georgia city schools that day the department of education\nIs opening an investigation into a horrible assault of a kindergarten or a girl\nIn her school bathroom as a result of a boy being allowed into the girls restroom people said this would happen here it is due to the school districts transgender bathroom policy okay folk so so here it is it happened immediately almost right\nA passion of Thomas I'm her daughter was assaulted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich are completely biased to set up in the first by in fact what's interesting about these commissions one of the requirements is and and\nDo just think if this would ever be allowed for a jury right\nThat the majority of the commissioners have to be someone who's either in would be discriminated against or is part of\nA group of people that that would have been discriminate wait a minute wait a minute you're kidding me that's that's built into who can be a commissioner so right there it's it's so that I said they set that up that's right and and so that's how it set up so of course they're coming after people like Jack or minding their own business\nPeople like the cheap or minding their own business\nAnd it's it's not activists who are out there and people's faces these are people living their lives according to their faith and they're actually finding them seeking them out and going after them in jurisdictions\nOkay so this is why I say if it real Americans do not stand up against this violence is if this is my listeners folks this is you right now right if you don't stand up now and do something\nOr if you don't if you don't understand that this is happening you're you're going to be part of the problem you cannot stay silent because the people have soda so to speak come at a closet on the other side they're no longer pretending to be nice nice they're not playing Patty cake no pun intended they are out\nFor scallops they want to take down anybody who dares defy what they say and we're talking about nice people like the chief who's sitting right here nice people like Jack Phelps in other words the real big it's\nThey don't want anything to do with the real big if they want to come after nice people who are definitely not big us and they want to say we're going to make an example of you you're going down we have the courts on our side we have the media on our side and it's why I said in my small platform on this radio program I Want people to know\nIf you allow this to go on you cannot complain when they're going to they will come after you are somebody because this is how nasty it as if you say the wrong thing they're coming after you and so alliance defending freedom you guys are are practically the only game in town I mean you have been doing this for years fighting this battle\nAnd it amazes me that you have pro bono lawyers how many lawyers do you have across the country that are working for you guys\nSo we have about sixty five lawyers internally for ATF but then we have a over three thousand lawyers were allied attorneys are also committed pro bono our okay for the\nWorking for free that's ripe for free so I I say to my listeners or if you can give something to alliance defending freedom there's a banner on my website but this is just insane we need to know what's going on I hate to talk about it except we must talk about it we'll be right back in the air attacks that show [noise]\n\n[noise] with the sarin News I'm Rhonda roster of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's acknowledging he might have\nBeen too emotionally

who is senior counsel there and uh one of their stark clients chief Calvin\nCochran I'm One of things I Want to say and I was just reminded by Anne Marie Paris so who's sitting here silently she has no my phone by her choice\nBut she just made the point that the reason a ATF exists it it's not that there aren't lawyers that could be hired to defend people like uh the the chief here or a jak Philips but the costs are huge you guys do this for free\nFor free because you believe this is the right thing and you know that if you don't do it for free most of the people being persecuted cannot afford they're gonna lose their homes trying to fight these insane battles and these activists on the other side who are really they are genuine hate groups\nThey know that and they know that they can take advantage of the legal system and they can make people pay you lose your job you can lose your house you can lose your reputation just because we don't like the way you think sure\nAnd and how does a person like the chief go up against the the city of Atlanta that has a budget like are the size of a third world country or the state of Washington for barren no stuff's better Colorado I mean it's simply cannot be done and you talk about these cases the chief case has been going on for four or five years who knows what it all and\nUm these cases have gone to the Supreme Court you're looking at an easy million dollars plus per case that\nDepending on how when they take and no one could afford something like that which is why we have the pleasure of coming alongside the cheap and all these good people who are just living out their faith and and and just getting bullied by by the\nThat you use the word I mean they're they're being bullied and sense of people saying like you know we have the power to shut you up\nAnd we're going to shut you up you you want to lose your job you want to lose your house you want to lose it you better shut up and if you don't shut up we're going to come after you and so they're making a point of going after people specifically to threaten everybody else so that everybody has a little better shut up now I Want to say to my listeners too if you shut up you're a coward okay you cannot shut up because\nWhen you shut up you were helping them to bully innocent people so we we all have to speak up and I think that people of faith particularly in this country we have this false view that ... being a person the fake means\nUh that I have to agree with everybody and get along with everybody you can love people and disagree with them\nAnd this idea that we shouldn't fight I mean barn Hoffert dealt with that there were lots of Germans at the time said oh I don't want to get political I'm just going to keep my head down well if you keep your head down unfortunately now you were helping Satan because this is this is a situation where we called the fight so ATF you guys are fighting\nYou're doing this for free and so you need people to support you it's one of the reasons I Want to have you won is because I Want to tell people if you go to the audience defending freedom Web it there's a a on my website ma taxes talk dot com you'll see a banner for the alliance defending freedom all give the phone number in a couple of minutes to but\nYou guys need help because there are not twenty alliance defending freedom is out there there's you guys I I Know this landscape\nAnd so what happens if someone says well I don't want to speak up because then I'm a hater or I'm I'm a big at all those names are meant to silence you rather than having a debate on the issues we get into this ... that has nothing to do with what's going on and simply the silence folks I think you're right by telling people to to Pakistan\nAnd there there are people there are are so called Christians are who are confused on this where I I haven't been called like on Twitter accused of making like a racial remarks ...\nThese people are insane they don't know what real racism is they don't have a real bigotry is I mean go around the world where you will see real bigotry real racism but people are are so sensitive now that you're afraid to talk and I I Want to say I want to be a leader in this and say folks\nThis is not right this is like\nThis is there's something viable when in a free country groups are trying to tell you shut your mouth do not share ... even if what I Want to share is wrong I have a right as an American to speak my mind even if I'm a fool\nI have the right to speak in America so I'm not telling you you have to agree with me but I have the ... of the right to speak but\nWe're self censoring people are afraid and as you said\nThat there's there are people out there that they know they they can't win the argument so all they can do is say shut up and if you don't you lose your job you'll be ... you know\nThat is it's so vile that I think most people when they really get into like they get angry they say this is this is despicable I'm not going to stand for this I Hope people listen to this program understand\nThis is not right and you need to be part of the battle I don't know what that means uh some some people can write a big check the ATF I Hope they will other people can just educate themselves and speak up when you get an opportunity because if you don't speak up some day folks you won't have the ability to speak up we're getting we're getting there\nYet and what's what's interesting is ... and you mentioned this happens in schools that happens in colleges and universities I mean if if people follow the news there are\nThese biased response teams which means if a student says something that happens to offend someone they report them\nThe administration them comes after them but it's it's like sensitivity training\nAnd so they're actually going into these situations where you can't speak your faith because obviously that's going to offend someone I'm trying to shut the students down even before they get into their careers and into into the public square so they're getting about a young age teaching them that\nIt's better not to share your faith which obviously we know it's important to do so and they're getting it when they're young there are\nPeople around the world being killed for sharing their faith and there are people around the world being killed for being Christians and in this country we're afraid than somebody looks\nThat's the wrong way or whatever or you may know the story of my friend Greg glories of pasture in orange County California he does an annual crusade incredible crusade thousands of people come to faith then Jesus\nAnd he put up this kind of hip looking banner a at fashion island it's a big mall in orange county and the banner\nHad him holding up a book would you would assume is a Bible but there's no cross or anything like that but it just Greg Greg is hip look in and the banner and the graphics are hip and he's holding up the Bible somebody complained to the to the people at the mall um offended I'm offending 'cause he's holding up a book that might be a Bible\nAnd they force them to take it down\nAnd I'm just saying ladies and gentleman if you allow this madness to go on your part of the problem if you do not speak up and and do something about this you are welcoming in America that's no different than any of the countries that and then we have fought to not be like for\nTwo hundred and forty years ... and it's not only a matter of of you know how important is your faith to you you know you hear all the time will leave your faith at home I don't know how you do that either your faith is a party or it's not you don't ... I I Know how you do it you'd be a coward and a hypocrite but it but it's also just in the interests of a free speech\nAnd so it ... it don't it it's not only applying to to to Jack and Calvin and and all these other folks that applies to all of us we have the right as you mentioned even if someone disagrees you still have a right so far in this country most of the time to to speak about whatever that happens to be especially when it's something to do with a you know your core beliefs\nWell I think that there's some truth that the that you really have to be bold the only way it's because it's a spiritual battle right and the enemy wants us to be cowed and to just be shut up I'm just going to shut up\nGod says no be bold be strong for the lord your God is with you um if if we are not mold and strong for our faith we really are becoming part of the problem we have to be bought so I Would say the only way to counter this needs to be bolder in our faith to talk about Jesus more in the public\nSpaces because it is our right it is not only is that our right God commands us to do it we're going to be right back folks talking to the lines of fending freedom you can go to the website my

but first\nThe FBI report has come back to some Fifteen hundred pages long and according to Mitch McConnell does not support Dr forwards accusation\nIt's all the facts do not support the allegations levied a judge Kavanaugh's character\nAnd said many of the facts actually support judge Kavanaugh's strong unequivocal denial\nWhich he repeatedly stated the committee investigators other penalty of

Navarre someone's career or destroy their reputation that what the sun is going to be known for\nNot to surprisingly Chuck Schumer disagrees\nI just have three points to make one we had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts\nIf they continue to interview people until the cows came home they would say it was a limited inquiry\nHaving received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized what a shock sick and I disagree having received this a briefing on\nYou know isn't that just wild you got people that have already said they're going to vote against\nThe moment the nomination was made Chuck Schumer says he's going to fight it with every ounce and his body so it didn't matter what the FBI reports that did it\nOn all of the documents I disagree with Senator Grassley statements\nThat there was no hint of misconduct and third\nWe are reiterating our call given how limited this these documents were and how limited the scope of this investigation was we are reiterating or call that the documents with proper rejection be made public\nOf course you do Lindsey Graham said hey you guys want it to ... you got it\nIs a complete report is a background check\nOn my I'm confident the FBI did a good job they were not or hindered in any way or the focus of the background check was credible allegations before the committee [noise]\nUh I was looking for certain things to be answered by witnesses\nI'm more confident than ever that what the committee found is held up and then some of the main thing for me is that you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them did they feel like they were able to do their job with that and parents and I think the answer is yes they interviewed over a hundred and fifty peace within interview throughout the course of Brett Kavanaugh of life [noise] to those yes from her interviews no evidence of that cell manufacturers\nSay senators who requested the supplemental FBI background check got what they refer [noise] and I am ready to the\nA lot of soda a bottom wing dumping them on and on the bottom line here is\nThat why don't we don't

did go at least not about the truth [noise]\n[noise] now talk about goalpost being moved\nFirst we were examining whether or not it was true that Brett Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault somebody that's what I thought this was\nThen it was about his judicial temperament because he lashed out after being accused of being a attempted rape is orange one pundit refer to him as a serial rapist he lashed out so therefore now he lacked the judicial temperament\nAnd then it switched to well he wasn't candid about his partying days he drank a lot more than he said he drank he partied a lot more than he said he did and he put\nTogether an image as a choir boy he already said he didn't he had too many beers from time to time\nDoes the same standard apply to this gentleman who gave an interview in two thousand and one and said I might have drunk a six pack of beer an hour before going to class\nWith a young girl fine you know where you live in but you know everyone has sort of
