property in Morgantown West Virginia the forty two year old mother of the girl told investigators she woke in the early hours of the morning after hearing that commotion in her daughter's room she grabbed a shotgun from her closet and rushed to her daughter's room\nWhere she was confirmed by the side of an Unidentified Man struggling with her daughter startled demand turned around and face the mother at which point she fired directly into his face blowing off most of his head\nThe rape is it's just a three year old sex offender known to police for a series of crimes on young victims died instantly I Believe that\nIt's hard to argue with a shotgun at close range well thanks colonel this story is very unusual and not typical of most pedophiles most pedophiles do not break into your home and try to force themselves on your children in fact\nAccording to the national Center for missing and Exploited Children most pedophiles are not strangers at all but are people you and your children already know many times they are authority figures in your child's life such as coaches teachers religious leaders are even police officers pedophilia is that epidemic levels here in the U.S\nAnd you should take precautions to protect their children against this crime you are for things you should know to help protect their children against pedophiles one\nBe very active in your child's life you should always know where they are and who they're with take time to meet the adults in their life hold adults accountable\nMany pedophiles look for children who are isolated in who appear to not have other adults as protectors in their life just by being active with your kids you can deter many pedophiles to sexual abuse on children isn't just a big city thing it happens in the country as well\nAccording to the U.S department of justice there is one child molester for every square mile of the country the days of letting your children run free are over three make sure your kids know the names of their anatomical parts\nMany times molesters will use ... names for these parts but if a child is knowledgeable then he projects power and we'll be avoided by predators and for\nFuture kids that it's okay to disobey adult in certain situations it's okay to say no you can't touch me or no I won't get into your cart\nTell your kids it's okay to run away whenever they get that intuitive or gut feeling that something is wrong and our story today the mom did a great job in stopping the pedophile in fact I give her an a plus and I don't often do that after all it's hard to hurt a child

all kinds of stuff so\nWhat about that I Do think the whole the whole thing the long game was to give us over to China and just because of the position where we couldn't really do very any anything other than acquiesce\n[noise] yes and I think that's not all of it though I think that I think that we're starting to wake up to something that's been going on for about a century [noise] and that would be taking us back to the Russian Revolution where shortly after\nThe Bolshevik to power we went to the Nineteen twenties we went through the ... started the ... the great depression Franklin Roosevelt came in and in Nineteen thirty three reversing\nThe policy of four presidents beforehand and six secretaries of state who all basically understood that you could not normalize\nRelations diplomatic relations with a revolutionary entity openly about your destruction in other words the communist government that has taken over\nIn Moscow at this point [noise] he he normalized relations he initiated a diplomatic relationship with the Soviet Union that was rats that rested on live\nAnd it has continued to rest on live and it would it this would include our relationship later with China and what he flies why specifically\nIt's not a very big exchange of papers that that initiated our relationship and Nineteen thirty three this is actually a list of promises that the Kremlin me\nNot to try to overthrow the government not to support groups and networks engaged in trying to overthrow a government not to try to ah support any kind of upset version of our institutions in other words\nThe Kremlin promise not to subvert overthrow or try to destroy it\nWithin\nAnd this was the basis of the relationship going forward along with a promises to pay some gets back things like that which also didn't happen\nWell at that point of recognition\nIn November Nineteen thirty three all of these activities were well under way in terms of Soviet support for communist networks inside our government insider institutions are churches are schools et cetera already underway and this just was a situation of institutionalized sing the subversion because\nAt that point we made this agreement we centrally started pretending that it it wasn't happening but what also happened as a result of the agreement was the communism was in many ways normalized and there was a great inflow of radicals\nOften very often covert agents included in the into the burgeoning government of Franklin Roosevelt in the Nineteen thirties so this is sort of a wind up toward trying to understand the wind from within that we have been subjected to\nComing up on a century because it it it preceded recognition but it really ramped up\nUnder under Roosevelt continued to World War two and after and so what we look at in in\nCertain flashpoints um the Cold War the discovery of the Rosenberg atomic espionage things like that these are just blips that pop up and attract attention but this this process that took version this Halloween out this complete I'm essentially\nCovert war against our institutions has been going on that long China came later\nChina's involvement in this came later it it's it's again we're starting to look at it now very very important it's very very advanced but I don't think we can discount the a tag team effect here that goes back all these many generations\nWell what a Mansour that's amazing\nWell it's it's [laughter] it's it's really what I've been living and breathing for seven years now when I started writing my my my book American betrayal that you mentioned at the beginning of the show because essentially American be trail is an attempt to uncover this history\nWhich is is just sitting there in documents in memoirs and newspaper accounts say she rational records an FBI records and all the rest of it but it's been essentially\nSuppress hidden from us by the left wing in the in academia in all of these sort of chattering classes that have taken up a narrative that has essentially left us defenseless\nAgainst in turn off the version and we look at the Cold War most people and I certainly was taught this way as something that happens somewhere else not in America but it was a fight on different battlefields it was a chessboard in Europe and there were hot wars in various places like Vietnam or or Africa or different different\nUh outbreaks of violence over the decades but it was happening here and this is where we have not\nPaid sufficient attention and a lot of it is speaks a right to uh what Donald Trump has has brought to our attention in terms of understanding the swamp and when I think back over the past decades um\nI look at the first real glimmers of the swamp becoming a parent in Washington\nReally after World War two um when the Republicans come back into power\nAnd we've just been looking at a ... you know sixteen years of Franklin Roosevelt and then Harry Truman finishing off a Roosevelt fought the term [noise] and then when the house changes finally comes into Republican power they start investigating the swamp\nThis is what had accrued over these years in terms of the same kind of bureaucratic takeover that Donald Trump has brought our eyes to today I I think that what we look back on miss\nMiss taught as quote the red scare as though it was something that\nWas imaginary and hysterical much the same way we're we're taught\nThis today to to look at anything like the swamp by the uh um elites were were were similarly hysterical today if we think there's something going on but I think that was sort of the first effort to really\nDrain the swamp and um it was ultimately not successful there were so great successes there were some tremendous uh revelations um [noise] and yet\nUltimately in the Nineteen fifties really following date the takedown of center adjusts McCarthy\nThe swamp triumphed and and kind of\nReconstituted and we had essentially last are really understanding of how to even do counter intelligence at home how to recognize some version people can became very very afraid of even talking about it because they'd be called a red date or or\nSomething like that are practicing McCarthyism which we still here today um and so again time goes on and we become more and more\nUm undermined and subverted and and with eating less historical memory than they had back in the day when they were doing these investigations and such and then Donald Trump comes along and I'd be the the quintessential outsider\nOr in Washington you need to none of this if not\nBeholden to any one here and we get another look at the top and we get another crack at training at\nAll of this really do so it's a it's not hard to understand what ... the look on his version of groups there will address about
