{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "And I just want to studies event that show that was part of the hardest right and then you have number three four five six seven when my it it just in a sense it still remains hard but you got that many more hands\nGot into that me more skills you've got that many really change your values your values aren't that you need every kid needs a brand new computer and every kid needs to topple line bike and every kid needs to talk of the line that\nYou can happy with hand me downs and you\nKnow neighbors give you think that their kids for most families I'm although lots of kids have gone has full of mice clothes and bags but people given them because they have only two kids and my spikes and all sorts of things so I think that um\nPeople have to see that I have a talk that it's called um the family as a path to holiness that\nGod wants every human being to be holding and he does of course just for priests and nuns and ministers him oh by the holy and since most people marry and have children\nIt seems logical to conclude that God would have actually made the former itself marriage and the feeling a pack the holiness and as you have more children you become more and more generous more and more open to diversity and variety and an MRI kid is so different and and you have to learn how to cope with all these different people and\nThen when you meet their friends and the the the children of their friends and families and and this huge community belts where you're rooting for everybody I just I Love to go to sporting events with where there's all these families and everybody knows every kid's name and everybody's rooting for every kid and that goes on for a long time we have a lot of kids\n[laughter] so good at it now and it's so beautiful and what people often don't talk about is that whenever you the bigger the family the more you have\nWhat I call a family culture it become become like a little tribe and you're all ... you you you see also just uh you know we've only been blessed with our one daughter but I thought to myself\nThe more kids you have the more you see what your genes and your spouse's genes can produce and it's it's fascinating to see brothers and sisters from the same parents in some ways similar in some ways totally different if this panoply of a you know gene expression and you've just\nAlmost laugh at how different they can help you and you you know you see that when you have a lot of kids and there's as I said there's a kind of a culture in families when the family is larger and there's something\nI Would argue inherently joyful about that or at least there there's a great possibility of joy in these large family and we don't see that so much whenever I have seen it\nI have to say I I just applauded and it's been wonderful\nYeah I Do want to stress that you don't have to have a large family to live large family values\nBut it it comes were actually in a large family almost you know in forced its you know everybody there was a child instantaneously becomes\nLess selfish and more self giving him more ... more generous you have to have someone who depends upon you twenty four hours a day well when you have eight or nine people that are four five six people that depend on you twenty four hours a day and you just can't\nStop growing in those respects but people were smaller families especially if they sit with orange or families those kids pick up those values sneak up the sense that old I'm I'm not the center of the universe there's lots of love and I'm sure is that my dad always said he ... we had six he had sex and so the ... you have six only children he said\nWell what we really centered universe that's just kind of life you know so well\nI honestly I've I've seen this and I think that it looked at the same as marriage where is God's way of forcing us to fly right in other words\nYou know if you're in a marriage and you don't believe in divorce no matter how it goes\nYou say well I'm sticking with it and I'm gonna I'm gonna love\nThis person no matter what even if today I don't feel like it and that does something to us and Shapes Our souls and ... on some level the forces us to learn how to love and I think that goes you know double for kids when you have these kids you love them so much that when there's trouble or difficulty\nAh it it just does something to you are in a way and again uh not everybody can be blessed with marriage or with kids but I really want to say that when you live in a culture\nWhere you're always hearing about hey you better better take care of yourself and you know don't don't be a doormat for other people it's like to hear that so much you think yourself a wait a second uh there's another side to that store you can given given given give and and you just get more and more blessed by God and I think we just don't hear that often enough so\nUh it's one of the reasons I wanted to have yeah we just got a few seconds left what do we know need to know about this book or Janet before we go\nYeah I I I'm so glad that you're um promoting and among evangelicals I it's not expensive

evangelicals and of course all of them pull the second theology the body was directed towards find a scriptural\nAmen I'm Sorry we're at a time and chanted this book is called why humanity Beatty is

Bernstein says I'll I'll share this he says that um he says we should negotiate with Mexico so that they will participate\nIn paying for this because they're insecure border is a major cause of the problem right so this would enable the president fulfill his promise that Mexico would pay for the wall so this is really it's a serious proposal um\nAnd he says that ah I don't know if you have it in front of you there but it's just you know a ... he says that this would be a ... charities and churches in the United states could step up to serve and minister to these\nA while you know they they are they are doing this and there's just a lot\nTo it um and he says each of them could apply for US citizenship [noise]\nUh you know it it's it's it's an opportunity to weed out you know the undesirable the criminals the MS their teens who've ... I mean it's kind of funny because we people uh you know when you watch cable news people can these big arguments and he think wait a minute why if you were at terrorists trying to enter the United states\nWhat would be the easiest thing in the world would be the joined the caravans you are a I mean it's kind of like ridiculous how can you be of course it's easy to get into Mexico it's easy to join you know you just flip in if you wanted to cause trouble\nIt's it's just obvious that that that's possible see all these good people by the way these good people you see them on TV\nThey're being used cynically because ... you know what it's like to walk Seventeen hundred miles right I mean these are people with kids are walking and flip flops like the whole thing\nIs it's sort of cruel to me because they're wandering and wandering and that there is no promise that that that this is going to end well for them I mean most of these people can't walk that far with kids it's just [noise]\nAnyway I I just I thought I Would I mentioned that some people look at my Facebook page\nA war on Twitter I'm really\nCurious or people think of this proposal my friendship Bernstein ... uh he he basically says that um\nYou know that he's he wants to he wants to know people think this is a good idea he says it it it's a it's obviously I'm you know it's just a massive issue to PR issue and stuff\nRight there's there are these folks obviously are being used by bigger you know higher power\nSome say this is the thing that there are\nYou know money he'd\nPowers George Soros is probably a behind all this and look if if you believe what he believes ... and you had billions of dollars\nYou would do what he's doing okay that doesn't make it any less destructive but this is only logical to me that he is doing anything he can and it's why I think of him as a as a villain but but it's it's logical and so I think that sometimes you see these images and people get emotional and\nUh

that a light in darkness with John Corbett er and so many others I mentioned Tatum O'Neal before I ask you about Tatum O'Neal or I Want to ask you you said that\nThe mother of Whitney Houston sings in this film\nYet doctors to see used and and she is wonderful she sings at a funeral about loss and uh you know it's just an interesting thing I always think that how life imitates art and a lot of ways and obviously what she went through with her daughter and a loss of that and and uh you know um it just for the ...\nAnd her granddaughter right now to grant an American image has an opinion\nThere and the sorrow there and you can see it through her as she's doing this and she's an incredible singer you\nKnow you don't really hear about this but she was you know she was famous before Whitney was obviously\nMhm well that that's big actually that's that that's kind of amazing I um I was going to say I don't think I mentioned is on the air and and but I mentioned earlier that\nTatum O'Neal uh was in Nineteen Seventy three did I mention it I Can't even remember now the Jews in the film ... moon\nAh which performance that she gave in that film this is Nineteen Seventy three she was like nine years old but that is one of my favorite all time favorite films that I Can't remember president you while we're on the air or because we were talking earlier but\nAre just absolutely great great great film a it is it's filmed in black and white to Peter Bach bondage made in Nineteen Seventy three so obviously the throw back the Nineteen thirties she ... ... ... plays a character\nWhose name is Abby pray and Addy pray and her dad\nAre basically Cohn ... he's a con man and a dry O'Neill her to her real like that and they they go door to door in the you know Depression era south\nPretending to be Bible salesman and you know we're going to do all this different stuff where of course the name is pray and but it is just one of the coolest films a ... ever Madeline Kahn\nAs usual practice she almost the old the show she's such a genius actress but ah honestly Tatum O'Neal performance it's an it's astounding I'm In any event so\nShe's great also in ...\nWell I Would assume that all these years late forty years later she's going to be forty five years later oh my gosh but\nUm she ... such a such a character so what role does she play in this film\nShe represents the school so she's she's the head of the board um for the school that does not want the church to be returned right so you know she's she's a very strong character in this um but you also she's also so likeable\nYeah I mean I think that's you know it's kind of ... in a way because it's scary our kids you know are watching YouTube\nOr their ... you know they're on their phones arrive paths are all you know there's so much content coming in that it's like how do you how do you direct them to something that's positive and something that kind of has windows on it that's not going to allow them\nYou know on YouTube anything can come up it's scary is actually really scary it's horror five year old our five year old ... you know and you're\nOn your parents are going to have to get somebody's going to have to I Hope somebody's gonna make a lot of money helping parents figure out\nA how to keep their kids from stumbling on stuff like that you know there's so many different ways

the faith\nAnd histories of story of face so the remake you guys are producing that yes you have produced that yeah it's already done and it's coming out and you have the grandson of Billy Graham playing Billy Graham in the film\nYes that's pretty cool and that comes up that yeah that his\nGrandson way him if he's ever in a movie don't answer that question ... so it's coming out in October ... and it does it tell the face I\nMean I Do yeah goes through that whole faith thing and it talks about forgiveness um I mean that's the that's the nice thing about what what pure flicks has ever since gods not data kind of opened up the time that we could you know we released between four to six movies in the theaters a year now\nSo in a this month actually in September we release Little Women in

host\nOr by the name is Stephanie rule you probably know about her you've probably heard clips played from her end of her I got a chance to talk to her to say that it was\nMm entertaining\nI think was an understatement enough so that I feel like replaying it for you it's only about five minutes long that's how much time they have on the morning drop clock but I Want you to hear from Stephanie rural just to get a feel\nFor what the liberal point of view is as it pertains to President Trump and his supporters headed into these midterm elections because the president can't say anything without the liberals adding words to his statements in order to make them sound offensive\nAnd you know exactly what I'm Talking about the left going crazy about the president two nights ago speaking in Houston, Texas on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz at a sold out Toyota sold out packed jam packed Toyotas center with thousands of more people outside the president declared he's a nationalist that is\nA dog whistle we are told that is an absolute statement it's a call it's code coded language to the base saying I'm with you white supremacist wow and what\nYeah I'm going to talk about that we're going to talk of the play back for you\nThe conversation that I had with Stephanie rural wells are going to talk about what nationalism really means with where he has some ah who is a very impressive person he was a a close senior advisor national barrage when uh the Brexit was decided\nAh we're in England or in Europe rather ah when Great Britain decided to essentially remove itself from\nUh BU and you know what that is that as an actor of\nNationalism we're gonna talk to ... ah and then also as it pertains to the ongoing and ever marching inexorably\nToward the southern border the United states the northern border of Mexico that Central American caravan now believed to be some fourteen thousand strong [noise]\nAh what does it mean for the United states and what can we do to stop\nWhat I think most of us would agree is an invasion it is not a migration it is an invasion RJ home and there's the director of governmental affairs for fair\nThe federation for American immigration reform so we got that coming up next our as well so a lot of really good people that are thought to including coach Lecter RJ ... replied Stephanie rural from\nA conversation that I had with her earlier today\nBut the lead story of course that we have to get into is who is sending explosive well potentially explosive devices to prominent Democrats in New York and in Washington DC\nThe homes of George Soros the Clintons Brock Obama and others apparently have been targeted for these suspicious packages let's get a little check your of the news on this from Fox\n... latest ... packages were confirmed for at three in New York at the home of billionaire George Soros on Monday and today it's CNN and one address to the home of bill and Hillary Clinton in ... for which Mrs Clinton at a campaign stop in Florida thanked Secret Service who\nIntercepted on\nPackage and dress she last long before it made its way to our home\nAnother was addressed to the Obamas in Washington and also to Florida and Marilyn for Democrats five packages were cleared three in California and one received by New York's governor\nSo this of course all happening less than two weeks before the midterm elections and uh right now as you can imagine the finger of blame is being pointed\nIt's being pointed by the American left by which I mean elected Democrats\nMembers of Democrat activist groups members of the DNC and members of the Democratic controlled media which is to say virtually all media that isn't conservative talk radio when maybe that Fox News report\nThe finger of blame is being poured it squarely at Donald Trump and Donald Trump's psychotic supporters\n[noise]\nIt is um an astounding thing uh hypocrisy when you see and hear these kinds of things\nWhen\nSteve skull lease was nearly murdered on a baseball field\nNot too terribly long to do\nWhat Eighteen months ago someone that neighbor when Steve ... was nearly murdered and when an entire softball field or a baseball field\nFull of Republican elected officials congressional members practicing for a baseball game were attacked by what we came to find out to be a radical extremist Bernie Sanders socialist who wanted to murder as many Republicans as possible\nDo you recall what the Democrats said\nDo not point the finger of blame\nThe Democrats for the psychotic actions of somebody who happened to support one of us\n\nYou can't put blood on our hands because one not we didn't tell him to do that we didn't tell him to to try to murder people that's not on us right this is what they said very loudly very clearly under repeatedly\nNow those very same Democrats you said you can't blame 'em his politics for his decision to try to commit mass murder on Republican members of Congress on a baseball field you can't blame his politics are now saying you must blame the politics of people we don't even know\n\nWe have no earthly idea at this point in time\nWho sent delivered made fabricated or whatever any of these could be would be might be potentially explosive devices and sent them to Soros CNN the Clintons and the Obamas\nWe have no idea but without knowing who it is they are ready to say it's Trump's fault\nAnd its Trump supporters fault because President Trump doesn't like the media President Trump demonize is the media especially CNN and therefore his followers are carrying out what he wants to have done to them\nThat is exactly what they're spending their time doing meanwhile there are others myself included\nAsking for at least a modicum of patients asking for just an idea just give us at least a hint of an idea of who this is before we start describing motive and blame\nBecause there are a lot of people whose to suspect that this close to the mid term elections that this is a false flag and these are things being done by liberals to try to embarrass and to try to hold were conservatives and Trump supporters accountable for this we have a lot to digest\nThat is essentially what this is all about\nAnd that's why they have taken this very clearly defined statement by the president in Houston, Texas where he rallied for Ted Cruz and tried to turn it into something it's not\nWants to talk about our country so we should\nThat word\nI'm a nationalist sub [noise] president of\nThe United states could not have been more clear in defining what he meant\nHe said between globalism which is being more concerned about the people of the globe then you are about the people in your own country versus nationalism which is putting our people first the people that elected me\nAnd then I'll deal with the rest of the globe second between those two I'm a nationalist\nThat is exactly what President Trump said and what did the left here well Jim Acosta tells you what the left her\nJust rather than just a follow up on your comments about being a national is there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you were white national\n[noise] it's like Jim Acosta the grandstanding glory hounding attention grabbing\nPhoto journalist for CNN and he really is she is a phony journalists the is just about as bad as it gets and this is a nation that produce Dan Rather Jim Acosta\nIs playing the role of Google auto fill right you ever go into\nGoogle and you start searching for something that the first few letters of what your what what you want and then it says do you mean blank\nRight\nYou type in you type in the word law and as you're typing L. A. W. or do you mean lawnmower no I actually wanted to talk about the law I Want to search for something about the law about asylum in the United states why are you giving me law here is to have a Costa he's Pugel auto fill\nPresident Trump I'm a nationalist Jim Acosta do you mean white nationalist\nHow'd you get white nationalism out of a very simple definition of globalism\nCompared to nationalism because they hear what they want to hear\nAnd they smear what they want to smear\nKeep that in mind that is their goal especially as we head to the ... the president as popular as he's ever been forty seven percent approval rating according to NBC and the wall Street Journal poll and they are scared to death of what that means at the midterms\nAnd that's why they're going to continue to play these racial games much more coming up by print sitting in for Larry Elder glad to have your board here on the radio and you're listening to the Larry Elder show [noise]\n[noise] with us\nOr a news I've had
