nationals on the Caribbean nation a grenade or by that nation's marches regime ordered Marines to invaded secure their safety there are nearly a thousand Americans in Grenada at that time many of them students at the our medical school and a little over one week\nRaised government was overthrown and that's military history for today ... is our armed America time take it on brother\nAll of us here in front lines of freedom want our listeners to get training get on in that order we fully support the right to keep and bear arms for all law abiding families and we encourage you to find out about the laws governing use of deadly force in your state and follow them to the letter and of course don't forget to follow the rules of safety and commonsense whenever\nYou're carrying a firearm to protect the ones you love what's your story this week\nColonel well a man who lives in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle was awake is it for a um one day in July and by the way this was before Seattle mayor ... signed a Law Order and firearms to be locked up would not a news\nWell a burger broke into the mud room at his home the resident grabbed his hand gun before investigating the source of the noise the shooter was trying to get into the main part of the house so the homeowner fired shooting him in the stomach he was later caught when the cohorts took him to a hospital for care\nThanks colonel in this particular scenario I like to focus on firearms storage especially in light of the Seattle law that requires firearms to be locked up when news\nOf course all is responsible gun owners are reading on practice that concept so there's really no need to legislate it however but those you out there who do not already lock up their guns would not in use let's go over some of the ways to secure your firearm\nFirst of all when they got us on your person either in a holster or some other carrying device it is considered secure and in use whether that's a whole store fanny pack doesn't really matter we're talking about an on body carry method where you are in complete control of the gun simply because there is attached to you and follows you wherever you go\nHere are some requirements I levy on all my gun saves\nNumber one it must be secure the whole idea of locking the gun up is to keep it out of unauthorized hands if the safest is dirty enough to keep a kid from breaking into it and get something different\nYou should buy the best quality gun safe you can afford I've seen people run out and buy a twelve hundred dollar Kimber pistol and then lock it in a tin cash box from Walmart they constantly nine Ninety five folks don't do this\nNumber two the gun safe must be in a location that makes it readily accessible to all authorized users I stage my gun safe and guns on all levels of my home simply because you never know when the bad guy will invade you or where he will break into your home it could be on the main floor second floor or even in the basement\nAnd last you must be able to open your gun safe quickly and easily well under extreme stress having to remember a long digital combination or use a dial to open it is simply unacceptable\nEven worse yet is needing a key to access to safe first you have to find the key then you have to insert it and it just takes way too much time\nStick with a live digital keypad or RFID technology or even biometric fingerprint opening methods and you'll not be disappointed the bottom line is you are responsible for the security of your gun so get the best you can afford and keep it simple and keep it safe\nGee that makes sense even from learning [laughter] troops listen up on veterans' day we're\nGoing to start a new program thanks for the input you all have senator I Need more input our goal was on the show to honor the cease military person not the superstars but the average soldier sailor marine or ... they don't have to serve in combat they do have to have served

about and\nAnd discussing outside of the beltway you know I live in this environment in in Washington where he was like an echo chamber so I'm interested in dropping in on the\n... in conversation and ah the show's seems a good way to do that and I wonder good don't how many people you think are hearing to the the theory about Q. I mean there's a thousands is if hundreds of thousands millions how many\nAmericans are actually engaging in this idea that there is a force or individual or group of people called Q\n[noise] um [noise] I might have perhaps a better way to ask\nThe question would be how many have access to it or know about it I Would say is limited I Would say it's quite limited I Would say that the uh it's it's because the questions that are being asked\nOr a relatively fundamental or if\nIt's for people who loves freedom and support the motion that people can uh can actually govern themselves\nUm the questions like he was asking I have ... minutes once people understand there so to answer your question not enough will be my age\nOr what you were actually\nI Would say the reach and that's really a worldwide it's not just in America this isn't even a balance just America it's really about freedom worldwide that's the message and transparency for those in power and privacy\nFor the average person this is a movement that's worldwide there are people all over the world that are aware of Q. I Would say it's\nProbably hundreds of thousands of people on our show we've got people in Australia people in Ireland people in England people in America people all over the world so it's you know not limited to America it's more in indicative of what's\nHappening geo politically I think and um but we're seeing happen with access to information record yeah\nEven launched for the mouth and say that you know this is one of those one of the threads that it's very clear and the Q A is what is the nature of uh the conflict here what is what is Q. providing that is not being provided\nElsewhere in the media sphere\nAnd one of the things that seems clear to to rational people when we watch the news particularly on the one watches European lose I have to say that there is there's such a goals and what you're consuming in the way\nThought it was interesting watching majority what his produce one ton Hoosier said no make it's too good to mess it up the mess it up some more give you a million dollars was you know [laughter] Nicholas ... I mean it was really quite good and he said no it's too good stuff and\nYou know what I'm Wondering is we know the amount on documented a darn Dr James Mitchell and he was um he was asked by he was invited to join CIA em to develop an interrogation program and personally waterboarded\nCollege ... Muhammad over a dozen times\nHis comments about nine eleven were very much what he would be\nThe comments were the kinds of comments you would make if you were compartmentalized and said this many times you work in a big ... area you don't know what's what's going on in the office down the hall you don't know what's going on on the floor above you or two floors below you or any of that stuff you don't know you were in that world so you have that mindset and I think that's what happens you know\nIn the in the in the the journalism sphere\nYou you were in that world so I mean we don't we adopt a little bit of a of a common mindset when we have to work within any given apparatus we're in the army you act like an army of your journalist Newark for big TV station you're privileged to have that job you are because it's it's a big organizations prestigious organization\nDon't you sort of uh adopt a of a group of things\nThat I think one thing on same offense to have to saw I mean when I came to America and I understood how America radio during the weekend wax completely different to what I was used to\nIt was a paradigm shift because what you know as much you know and you don't know what you don't know and I think there's a lot\nOf people are paying that ... that it's time to to\nFind to understand what they have known and what can I have understood to be there and reality might not necessarily be the case because they think glaring\nExample is awful late the stuff that came with the rise of president Donald Trump\nAnd I think also that is way way um cue comes and and I wanted to ask you a good dog I Know you've you've um say given some examples lesser God's to media and and and you are at about what is your take on or at that cute\nPeople um you people that followed Q A religious neat what if they take on the American mainstream media can you tell me\nWhat do you mind if I jump in on this one piece of the girls can always talk [laughter]\nFor love locks snow or in the Nineteen fifty\nTwo different media companies in America there are now six major multinational corporations that control Ninety percent of all the news we get America\nAnd the idea that these multinational billion dollar corporations don't have an agenda for themselves I think is a little bit silly but let's look at the coverage of the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nUm Ninety six percent of journalists any mainstream media organizations donated to the Hillary Clinton campaign [noise] we had Hillary getting debate questions in advance\nWe had a Google Search engine being modified said that when you did searching for Hillary Clinton and you type things and the thing that should\nPapa or would pop up a and that does go when not pop up things do go\nTo their aim to be a large scale I'm left leaning coverage and certainly um\nThat was given to Hillary Clinton I mean nobody talked about any of the Clinton scandals she was treated kind of like a a princess with the mainstream media here in America they were very hostile towards President Trump and the\nLevel of fear mongering that we saw\nWhat would happen if Trump liaison elected he is a fascist he's a racist well let's look at the facts of what has happened since he has been elected as me seeing what we were told they were going to think that they were going to go to war with North Korea and you know\nWe're seeing heat there he's negotiating peace with the green continent their denuclearizing\nWe're seeing a African American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in history and and what is it a fast shifts\nOf fascism the definition of fascism as a political philosophy and movement or a regime that exalted nation and often and race above the individual\nAnd that stance or a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader severe economic and social regimentation and often for civil suppression of opposition now the people that\nAre are involved in the magazine movements\n... here in America that pro Trump if people that have been involved in eighty two men\nAre about individual rights\nEqual rights under the law equal justice under the law I mean I don't see for civil suppression of the opposition here I don't see conservatives groups out in the streets went by\nLaw in baseball bat no new door I'm\nPaying the leftist ah you know the DNC headquarters and spray painting it um you don't see that and you also don't see\nThe president acting as a dictator he's actually negotiating peace in the Korean confidence not going to war um we don't see this one race being a exalted so I just I'm not seeing that label fascism working I mean African American or African\nAmerican unemployment is the lowest that that was then and then as far as economic and social regimentation rat seeing that either we're not seeing forcible suppression of the opposition\nUm the people that were posted Trump are allowed to say whatever they want about they're allowed to nearly everybody in the world is allowed to smear President Trump\nSo there you\nGo to go to extend was totally on the part about the boat to be electronic voting machines flipping votes were cast for Trump flipping through but there was no one report\nOver any votes passed through an electronic voting up arose flipped from jewelry to Trump was from Trump to Hillary which don't say anything about that they were sitting on those digital\nDomain and um and expensive and you know back to a a believer numbers more our TV was Robert Robert Robert\nMore did you think Robert More um\nKnows about it he said the diversity of opinion\nAnd on and talking about what's going on here in the United states the streets of brandy offered a\nAnd the draw of the voting machines and regularity would seem to be\nHuman dimensional that is to say oh you're in one a political persuasion or direction do they tend to mistake I was advanced screwed\nI Would say this diverse or the environment the ... the champion by not just Robert but others on the left or and I would actually say that would be on the left changed all of these are the these are the very same people ah that would\nSort of stand behind the notion that it's okay for Google\nOr YouTube or Facebook or Twitter to create a shadow banning engines the cut off diversity of opinion and the very diverse than being champion\nAnd so I Would I Would beg to differ and I would say that the the notion that it is being handled handled an even handed way\nIs a is poisonous to the truth\nUh and it would be actually part of the problems so you know just going down go way that we would look at the facts as they present themselves oh I'm In the queue or even out and a leader of economic environment we find ourselves in\nA I Would say that it's beginning to build up\nA a a an understanding of how a media you know comes to the equation they come and see if we cut off one side of the equation away free speech and we don't want her to speak that diversity of opinion\nThan for me that definition fail fails dress and know that when he's on the exam\nI'll tell you on hold on to that would be able to go to the other side of this broke or a good dog [noise]\nDo you all true [laughter] ... some\n\n\nVery fair I mean I look I I'm very aware that we missed part of the conversation when we operate in Washington and I want to hear\nIn many directions where the American conversation is going I mean not American conversation we need to hear it you know here in Dallas we need to hear it across the country because there's no question that Washington is an echo chamber\nAnd I want to hear what people are saying I Want to see that some of the outlandish theories whether people believe in them I Want to hear a whether America is a moving to the left up to the right what is the conversation in the American household\nOr get that and I got to tell you I think that's commendable because of a lot of people I mean that I'm not labeling us as being one on the left I'm not but a lot of people\nAre really if you'll excuse the expression of gun shy of a of a hit pieces so forward they'll give you an example of
