Chicago before voters\nFroze lines of freedom Saturday nights at ... am ten Seventy flea as\n\n\nYou know [noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh right yes I let the music run a little bit lie is great song from hot chocolate loved that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done this far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues in policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in the land and fine I'm okay with that but then we attributed powers it does not have a forty does not half\nWere granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the person up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans\nAre going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like them and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\nThink about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left or the right can we agree on something and let let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes should a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we could go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to get those honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as a bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the left is supposed to be teen black right I began this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative by people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the\nPublic and it's got to stop being this way I support\nA person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is set or we have seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not to take his Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen 'em come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open carrying the he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected\nJust put another layer of protection on an individual's right\nIn addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile by people\nAnd Republicans desert Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile black people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue now that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks\nYeah blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats and Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney who\nBasically\nSupported Obamacare lite you see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be worst accepting things we don't want or don't believe\nDo I have any liberal pardon me do I have any liberal Democrat black men out there who think that the government should have a right to profile black man how many Republicans do I have out there how many liberty minded delivered by the guy's going to say oh no man\nEveryone has a right\nTo be safe and secure in their persons in effect but that's where we're lacking dude dude they're just going to do it and yet I forget that my like a throwback kind of deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a focus on liberty because we have our vision has become myopic because of this left right fight\nGuys let's support let's get on one page and say we can support and respect liberty for each other\nLet's use that liberty one of God's greatest gifts to man and he's given us a lot but one of the greatest God's greatest gift\nLiberty\nThe right to make our own decision [noise] you're listening to file chapter that is a hand will be back\n[noise]\n\n\nOperation overlords Jay peak Richard here you know I Love history

and then as I got on Hugh Hewitt and whatever to it it went to like three hundred something which is decent right but it's still not in the top one hundred\nWell this morning or ... he jumped to one Seventy so we're we're breathing down the neck of the top one hundred right yeah so what's the number one book in the country Stephen Colbert and a bitter anti Trump\nFake children's book now it's a real big children's book in the sense that you would never give it to a kid it looks like a kids' book but it's not appropriate for children because it's just kind of mean and weird\nBut my book of course is uh even though it's a huge book for adults like coal bears book it's really also a children's book genuinely you can give it a kitten and people are giving a kitten kids like it and they specially liked to say George Soros\nBut what drives me crazy is that cold beer is on every night right being mean it's one thing not to like the president but he's pretty vicious if I had a TV show like his I Would never be that vicious about Hillary or it's one thing to correct jokes I mean Johnny Carson always cracked jokes about the president but\nThere is a meanness to it that bothers me and so of course now he's ... he and his writers and put out this vote number one\nIn the country and so\nI kind of like to send a message or to the to the country and this and to Mr cold they're having my book uh at some point over take his book yeah so that means his book will have to drop from number one\nAnd a or my book could just go to number one but you know there's so many people in this country who don't hate the president and I kinda think like hey I'm if you don't eat the president\nBecause for you and I actually think that this is a good book to give to people who don't like the president because it's it's warm hearted it's not I mean it's not like ha ha but whatever I just just had to say that I was so glad that huge trigger loved it I was supposed to be a machine and Bream last night and I think\nI said that on the radio but they had to cancel so I'm going to be an chicken and bring tomorrow night which is friday Gray Thursday that's tomorrow night [noise] um\nSo I just

freedom now a lot of you know a nonprofit organization they rely on the generosity of others right\nThey provide free legal services for clients being targeted by hostile governments or states targeted by the Colorado civil rights commission who knew one elected and they basically said we're going to put your business because\nYou wouldn't bake a cake to celebrate a same sex wedding and he thought well excuse me I I don't bake Halloween cakes I'm a Christian if you come here and he asked me to create something for you or if it violates Marlins principles I I Can't do it well tomorrow to to discuss this in detail on this program\nBut I I Want to say that alliance defending freedom stepped up to help them it would've cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for him to defend himself and his business he was basically going out of business I mean that they're going to put you in a business because wedding cakes are his\nA bread and butter to mix metaphors so so he really was suffering alliance defending freedom came in and took it all the way the Supreme Court in one seven to two so people think that this is some narrow conservative ruling no seven to two and so life defending freedom did that\nFor free and this is going on all around the country you heard about the deal with um\nWith uh the former fire chief of Atlanta uh Kelvin Cochran who's been on the program so that's what they do a there's another case right now that's going on in all of these things they do folks\nFor free which is why we have to help right so a more recently Washington state\nOr their attorney general decided to target a grandmother named ... she's the owner of a local flower shop because she declined to create a custom floral arrangements for same sex wedding\nShe felt that that violated her religious beliefs ATF stepped in to offer her legal support for free okay so this could be you or your neighbor your friend or your cousin or your brother\nOr the actual cost of doing the litigation like that were huge okay they did it for free if it could happen to ... could happen to you so a barren no standing strong and not wavering here's a clip from ...\nTo thousands to that my

president and see if we take the house it will be\nA subpoena or office ... shouldn't full too often look for any and it's good for Americans but just because they hate though Trump ... the question on the ballot will be a you're giving into hatred or do you love this country it's really about the more complicated than that\nWell the irony of course that the that the other side keeps talking about hate down with hate I've never seen so much hate in my life it really is dismaying it's genuinely dismaying that people\nAre who they have all kinds of issues with this president ... good for you if you do let's have the debate\nBut to effectively a say we don't we're not interested in having a debate we're interested in shutting you down with every kind of epithet it's it's a little

of wonder what happens to the bitter left at that point\nYeah I mean this is one of the reasons I wrote why we fight it for the shop and the the understanding that and and the political environment

Daniel I'm and there's a chapter called\nWhat do you need to know about war\nTell us a little bit about that because you know a lot about war and and and tell us your background in case people don't know you beyond a just seeing your face or on Fox News that your pundit but you have an amazing background a it with regard to a military fighting\nWhile I was blessed to come up with your ... uh through my life I call it on a warm day are found myself at a military base a on a selection cool boss I ended up\nA member of the British ... an emerging charging unit fell in love with that kind of life babbled in it in college when I started studying law systematically looking at the evolution of terrorism did appear to be in that\nAnd then it was all of it off the nine eleven to be invited by a U.S marine alleging gold colonel like crap you become a member of the faculty teaching a counterterrorism calls on a U.S base in Europe\nAnd been married an American undecided but we have to come to a lot of great the\nBrash hoping that this new show on was again blessed with a job teaching at the national defense University of ... a month teaching them lost his degree in a Catholic terrorism and\nAnd then one day in June of trying to Fifteen\nA phone call from Korea eleven both of you may be interested in it by getting candidate Trump on national security issue so that's that's it in a nutshell but\n... do\nWell enjoy it while you're qualified to write a book with the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies you you know a lot about this knowing this chapter ... uh what do you need to know about more tell us a little bit about that because most of us don't have anything approaching your background\nSo it was the first things first when you say the word war to America does it mean something quite different from\nIf you say it's a European law somebody from ... when you say also Americans I think I think the ... image as a private ... the\n... infantry tank battalions dog fights over the Pacific but if you look at the great if you look at the last two centuries elaborate shot in the book\nMore than eight percent of all conflict since the podium is what we technical term irregular warfare all unconventional meaning\nIt's look the army's all various countries fighting each other\nIt is the only one nation sprayed fight against non state actor whether it's Stephen Decatur youngest us naval captain ever fighting the Barbary pirates off the shores of Tripoli two hundred years ago it off the\nYou believe the end justifies the means of that's how you get fascism communism that's how you get even the caliphate\nWell it it's so beautiful to I remember the first time a I had you on this program we talked about something along these lines and I thought\nUh this is someone with whom I can discuss the deeper things because really that what you just said is indeed at the heart of it all if we understand who we are what does it mean to be human it means to be made in the image\nOf almighty God but fall and broken and without the ... of the scriptures we can never be redeemed so that the idea that we can be redeemed\nOr or resurrected without the cross of Jesus Christ most Christians would sort of claim to understand this but I think that we have to connect it as you've just done\nTo a global ideology there have been ideologies such as the one in which we live in the west here American style self government we have always recognized\nThat mankind has the capability to be evil to do bad things so if you raise human beings up\nAnd think that they can be perfected we can be perfected and if only will do this or had this technology we can ... perfect our whole society that has led\nTo the Soviet gulag you just set it and it's led it led to the to the Holocaust\nAnd in our own age would lead to a unchecked by people willing to fight or as you and I I'm a hope to do it will lead to a different kind of Holocaust and gulag there's just no way around it when you think human beings\nCan perfect ourselves without God it's really chilling I mean is this stuff of you know an entire novel\nIf you aggregate yourself the role of ...\n... ... ... there is no limit to ... you will justify it and you'll role as well ... ... you can become the next ... if you think that it is up to you\nTo create effects and then you become ...\nAnd you will load a third of your population and you will kill anybody for example I mean this is ... is that person was a perfect the goals is the last say ... the state\nAnd he will be killed that's what happens when you're like old at the end of the ... those are the risk that you are as a civilization\n... it's an amazing thing and that's why I say it's wonderful to speak with you because I Want to educate my audience those people who don't yet know this have to understand then when we talk about\nA conservative view politically or we're not just talking about some issues we are talking about the deeper principle of who we are\nWho do we think we are I mean listen there are strains within conservatism a within a libertarianism didn't miss everything you've just said they don't get it they think that technology\nIs the way forward and that that we don't even need to think about these kinds of things they think that the free market is a kind of God that can be worshiped into the free market will deliver everything and\nAnd we always have to understand that that the free market\nOr in a free democracy all of these things have to be checked by morality by virtue we the people have to make these things work unchecked or we you know we can have a the free market in China and it can ... can suppress Bible\nAnd these are deep ideas Sebastian and I'm so glad that ah that not only do you understand these but you're writing about them and speaking about them\n... this is a lot of the great lessons ... Michael bow back and then this is the mosque through Florida and by my libertarian friends capitalism free markets it's not just about the invisible ... about\nThe moral directs joined up market moods it's not you know ... and the bottom line is ... is a whole concept of bats why for example having Google\nSupport to try to use the tightest ship were censored websites up but\nThey may be making money for their cell yup about his thoughts capital\nWhile it that you sort of have to ask if making money is the bottom line what if I trade slaves you know in a foreign market not and you know that's you know that okay with you can trade slaves do you mind can I trade in baby parts\nWe have to understand that\nEverything has a moral component and at the end of the day the free market can give us exactly what we want which is better pornography or you know of a robot Brussels I mean the the the free market has no morality we are the one that's supposed to have\nMorality and if we don't exercise our morality the free market will give us whatever we want even if it's evil so folks were going to be right back talking Sebastian Gorka the new book is why we fight sick around

left they they're the radical better left that they're not the left of of Nineteen Ninety or or even the left of two thousand it's not the left of of ah Al Gore John Kerry I mean the whole thing has shifted what I'm Wondering is\nWhether if you can't win by violence and you can't win by arguments don't you have to move in other words don't people have to say that the the goalpost had been moved and so the argument\nNeeds to be within ideas that work right with with the within the realm of ideas that work and so\nIt it's almost like you want to have a choice between this kind of conservatism and this kind of conservatism in this kind of conservatism because people are voting and they're saying I'm the left is\nOut of ideas I mean I I I've never seen it so clearly you know doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute but they've been a quieted by ah by the loudest voices by the voices of inciting violence and that kind of thing and I think your average American sees this and that where we are\nReally seeing an historic shift right now\nAnd you ah suggested to me why don't we have a conversation or I could come and we can do this and I thought there it is and that's\nProbably Eighteen or Nineteen years ago which is stunning ... your milk your book for the call came out not long before that and you just told me that you're you have a twentieth anniversary

in fact he's in the city number of times before we were recording things I think um but and I\nAlways say also that you were the first seven speakers insect seats in the city because you really very very graciously let yourself your time and your talent or to help us build what we're now become Socrates in the city but\nThere's so much to talk with you about but I think I'm ... years speaking uh here in New York on something I talk to you have called the magna car to\nOf humanity and I thought that would be a perfect place really to go today can we can you ... ...\nJobs will be by the union tonight on that on\nThat phrase comes from rabbi sects who says that the genesis declaration that humans are made in the image of God is the magnet Contra of humanity you know there was the highest statement of the in violent bowl was\nAnd precious ... every single human being\nRegardless of any of the description you might give them of class race size speed intelligence and so on is magnificent and terribly important today because you know we've talked about as the post truce generation sadly we're becoming the post human rights generation and it's more important\nHuman rights are being undermined\nThe whole value of the individual is being undermined you'd think of a whole lot of mud and views like multi cultural do some more utilitarian as some of the greatest go to the greatest number they have no place for the individual\nBut my concern tonight as we're looking towards singularity\nAnd post humanism there was no high view of human does to stand against some of the things that are coming so if you go back to see us Lewis who's the abolition of man he talks about the final stage of a ... generations think they will make people in their own image\nBut we're we're very close to that was say gene editing\nAnd so we better have a strong high view of human dignity if we're just stand against some of the effects of dehumanization which are on the way\nIt's interesting because the use of the rabbi sacks a of England uh came up with this phrase the magna card of humanity to refer to to the\nVersus in genesis that say we're created in the image of God I guess my question to you because I I talk about these things of course a lot as you would guess but I Want to ask you where um\n... if somebody does not take the Bible or as you know the founding documents of their their thinking from we're would someone get the idea that there is such a thing as human rights you can't I mean how did you think\nFor the universal declaration of human rights Nineteen forty eight it was partly paused in real motion to announce he has some and the death count revelations and so on\nBut fortunately it was led by Charles Malik who was a strong Christian and it came out of a broad Christian consensus you wouldn't posit today because the simple fact is if you take the alternative views around today say\nA atheism cannot go round the precious most of individual human rights simply cons read books like John Gray strode dogs and he's quite open if God is did\nThe idea that we think we're different from the animals France not just what Peter Singer ... you know it's a great mistake humans have ever made we are only animals and so on so that no she goes to the Bible and you cannot find it anywhere else\nSo that was true freedom this way out you were cut flowers civilization in other words\nThe roots of human dignity of freedom or quality some of these things are distinctively the gifts and fruits of the Bible the Jewish and the Christian scriptures and if you cut those roots were cut flowers civilization and the flower will\nIf it's so funny to have you here because I've heard you speak about this so many times I've read your books on the subject and I have him by these ideas are such that I Am constantly speaking about these things but to sit here with you\nUh I ... you you ... your um your real scholar and you know\nA no break in a semi thing or another scholar not an academic oh well then you're saying you're better than your thinker All right and then I can say I'm a I'm a thinker\nA because I'm certainly not a scholar but what I mean by a leading with that is to to say that you're aware of some of the contemporary thinking on these issues I'm really not I'm not you know well read on what philosophers and others are writing about this these days but\nWe all well a lot of people know about Peter Singer and but but I guess my question is there's so many people who don't have a biblical view do any of them see that\nWithout the biblical view without this idea that the magnet credit of humanity that were made in God's image with ... ... does any buddy today who doesn't have a biblical view the where not having that view\nLeads to is there anybody expressing a some reservation about where this is leading who are not Christian\n... question would be quite a number of what to me is interesting you know major imminent tonight you know the name you've all Harare he wrote a huge bestseller a few years back ... but his new book international best sellers called homo deus and the title tells you everything and\nThere was he says we are now about to upgrade to being what he calls dumplings or ... planted a scenarios writing as a Jew but an atheist from Jerusalem and he actually says in the opening chapter scientists will do better than the Old Testament God\nNow he has this extraordinary review and ... as men becomes God but in the book itself he points out this could lead to the degradation of human insulin\nThe great divide in the future will not be between the rich and the poor that will be extreme it will between the ... and the onion Hans stunts they say in Homs or died genetic engineering and I've never heard that ... I call it between the ... and the and the I'm In ... and the ... so you think of\nHillary calling the rest of America deplorable Z\nYou can see that the enhanced will have an incredible disdain for the onion Hans and\nYou know that's going to lead to incredible human degradation oh one one person who's more concerned puts this this is in front of volunteering back in the forties when we create the first ultra intelligent machine it will be the last invention that humans need ever make\nBecause after that they will take a vote we better make sure we build into human values into that machine well or it will treat us the way we treat animals they're all sorts of things so that\nWe're going to go to a a break folks I Am here with us again is I Know I don't have to tell you to stick around because you will and yo\n\nHey there it's Eric my taxes for policy genius here's an on fun fact over half of bankruptcies in mortgage foreclosures are caused by medical issues that's because if you get sick or injured over the course of your career your employer sick leave off and only covers ... up to three months\nAnd law health insurance helped with medical bills it doesn't replace last blue come that is where disability insurance comes in is essentially income insurance to protect your paycheck if you're sidelined by an illness or injury\nPolicy genius that's all the shopping for you they compare quotes from the top disability insurance companies to find the best price than their license experts\nManage the application process to save you kind of a hassle policy genius has helped over four million people shop for insurance and placed over twenty billion dollars in coverage so if you rely on your income to get by compared disability insurance quotes with policy genius dot com will help you protect your paycheck\nAt a price that makes sense you can get started on line right now policy genius the easy way to compare and by disability insurance\nYou have my head and the day of battle amen based on a true story of an army chaplain and his wife and I only stand before you today because this is my wrong because I have a family who loves and believes in one marriage one family under God he made me appreciate family\nMore powerful that if I have I think we all\nIndivisible rated PG Thirteen maybe inappropriate for children under Thirteen in theaters October twenty six for tickets intro times go to indivisible movie dot com\nWith the U.S embassy now open in Jerusalem\nThe world is witnessing the fulfillment of God's covenant with his chosen people what does this mean for Christians around the world watching these events unfold in his new book last empire\nBest selling author prophecy expert pastor John Haiti unpacked thousands of years of history at their local prophecy to answer your most pressing questions about the anti get earth's last empire\nAnd that's again and emotionally call the motive is I'm technically but you're into an incredibly dangerous world where even sciences over written in the name of the power and the pleasure of those who have the power the elite that's incredibly dangerous right\nAnd and to get back to what we're saying originally that unless you believe were created an image of God it seems inevitable that things slide in this direction and so you say that some people are aware of this\nWell this is a catch twenty two I mean one man puts this\nDegree just obstacle to announcement is the view that humans are sacred\nYet the fact that humans are considered sacred is the only barrier to the dehumanization to make 'em there's a catch twenty two\nYeah well at the dehumanization you talked about a ... elite I mean the idea that some people would be able to\nUm have children that are enhanced I mean obviously the technology will probably enabled us to have ah children that are smarter that are tolerant or stronger you know that that's something that a ... that in and of itself is not so horrifying what's horrifying\nOr is that if you only believe that we get our value from what we're able to do\nA then if we don't have inherent value then obviously does create a pecking order which ... which is the enemy of freedom and democracy\nYou remember all the uh it was that view among liberals like H.

I mean you know what if you say there's no evil or good or anything like that then why shouldn't we do anything we can do whoever had through our can do it who's to say that I shouldn't if there is no God who who can they're telling me that I should not do something\nAnd if you take an ethical I could tell us attorney and it's and the greatest number they just go to the greatest number\nYou know what a ten to twelve people\nThat I don't know I was just going to say that a move we save a thousand that was the one that's right and that's exactly what uh what what Hitler's doing even he had to make the case of the German people that will kill you or your children are because they're taking up space in hospitals and we need that money for the boys were\nFighting on the front line and it just it only makes sense we're gonna be right back folks talking asking us about everything that's in the air attacks us show\n[noise]\n[noise] that sarin news ... for residents of hurricane ravaged Florida Panhandle\nTo struggle to get back to normal continues for cell phone service leaving most valuable with a well those most vulnerable ideas with little information to help get them by unseasonably warm temperatures in the eighties\nAdding to the misery because so few people can cool down with air conditioning because of electricity problems bottled water is plentiful at roadside age stations but ice that's another matter\nPresident Trump warning a very severe consequences if the Saudis are found who have murdered the journalist ... treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin pulled out of a major Saudi investment conference Thursday amid global pressure\nA federal prosecutor in Pennsylvania taking aim at the Roman Catholic Church by opening a grand jury investigation centered on child exploitation this is as sarin news\nAm dense Seventy the answer hey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy either dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer\nStage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollar Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family they group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without them at a sure\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason is is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nAte for for forty one Bible that's a for for for one B.

I mean and it's ... it's because of you that I Know any of this stuff but when I was writing in my book if you can keep it about Lincoln\nWhat is down did me and again I first joined us from you was\nHis view his his\nHigh view of the founders end of that generation and of what we have here in America\nIt's clearly what we might call American exceptionalism made clear that he sees that we are chosen by God that we've been given this tremendous a gift that we must treasure not just for ourselves but for the whole world I mean it's clear that he thinks that\nAnd I think today the left\nWould give lip service to Lincoln he's some great guy but they never go to that narrative to them you know full pro American no there is a dead against it I was going to say but if that against it ... it to me the\nLast great American who addressed it likes that was Martin Luther king so the declaration was a promissory note\nYou moved to circulate comical and then the rise of feminism into Vietnam War movements some around sixty eight there was a fateful lunch left to America went from being a liberal project with the Capitol Hill to being a less liberal project which was anti America\nAs understood though there and since then America as being racist genocidal homophobic you name it\nAnd that's what the left police today and it's and so the deadly well and of course ... sixty eight was when Rudy do you go cold forty called the long march through the institutions picking up ... I don't know who ... no ...\nWell put like this there every time mug schools were revolutions treats failed never worked\n... set in jail and the twenties jail by Mosul they figured out why didn't and he figured out what you needed was not a revolution the streets the ... you need to cultural had Gemini domination\nIn other words the elites yeah Rudy George ... the head of the red brigade he said what we need is a long much picking up now along much of the institutions above all\nThe universities the press and media and entertainment and that's precisely how his lawyers fifty years late to exactly and they won all three of question no question well ...\nWell but I but I see a dissent in the ranks I see you know a ...\nIt was going to handle them as crazy like I mentioned the transgender ism but those new voice articulated in the hole on calling America back a list included a vision re way\nWell there are ways to avoid costs lots of voices their voices but the problem level you're doing radio and lots of good people like that but I mean America is never called back you usually it's either the Senate\nOhio or a charismatic figure the small city like Martin Luther king and those new voice like that speaking on behalf of the better angels many voices lower down agree with you\nWell the thing is that there there are voices just that they don't have the platform that they're kept out of and that's why you need to hire well ... than a loud megaphone right yeah it's like when they were ... they were when the abolitionist we're looking for a figure in parliament to leave their cars and you and Wilbur force ah heeded the call\nUm it it is interesting though I I Believe just as in those days that the lord will raise up who me will there are there are folks out there and God has to do it you know it's not really\nUm ... we we don't know who will emerge but I I have confidence that you know even as I hear you talk\nTo these things aren't possible we really do have a it's an it's an uphill battle because of where we are because of the fifty years of this the long march in these institutions but I ... everywhere I look I see hope I have to be honest I see hope it doesn't mean that I think it's going to be easy but I'm hopeful\nAnd I'm I can even go on the record I I've gone on the record but that that I think that whatever one thinks that this president I feel like he's pulled us back from the precipice I really do believe that if Hillary Clinton had been elected it would be game over we wouldn't even have to read them and they have these conversations\nWould be sending concrete it would be so I argued public you know doing the book to he's like a wrecking ball stumped America in his track yeah but you only have four years to rethink well well I'm ...

more civil constructive conversation about race relations\nQuote we're politician to our divisive with their disingenuous cynical approach that is disgusting\n\nAnd he goes on and on and on about this time for politicians to have a civil conversation about race relations now coach I Know you listen to the show I'm carried in San Antonio appreciate the\nCoverage you can tell you something you're not helping you're making things worse remember the poll that came out a few months ago that said that six out of ten Americans feel that race relations are getting worse in America\nBut most of them never discuss the issue with their friends or family and I think about that\nRace relations are getting worse\nPeople agree that they're getting worse but they don't discuss it with friends or family\nThat would be something on the part of people like pop of agents that people aren't discussing it because it's such a sensitive topic because America steel seizing racism the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow you had a black cetera let me tell you why people don't talk about it first of all most people don't think they are racist\nThey don't most people think they're fair we'll see what they did they give people a and even shot most people consider themselves to be Christians and the whole basis of Christianity is the golden rule treating people that way you want to be treated most people think they do that so they don't like the races number two\nIf the greater diversity of right and I am that racism is not a major problem in America anymore despite the fact that you feel things are getting worse doesn't mean it's a major problem is it ruining your day is a staff and even going into a marketing ordering something if the person behind the counter happens to be a different race in yours of course not\nWe're getting along just fine here\nIn this country the third reason people don't say anything you say\nYou tell the truth about how you feel and you're going to be called a racist or an Uncle Tom witness what's going on with Kanye West witness their retreat that Steve Harvey head give you a quick story buddy of mine just told me the other day he's in a bar my buddy is white everybody in the bar is white and it's a sports bar is normally there are sports things on TV for some reason was local news\nAnd they were doing a story about how a bunch of ... every year uh for for several days or Lynn their services for free to poor people are and they interviewed some woman happened to be black holding her baby and she was saying\nI my baby needs braces my baby needs braces and some white guy said what about your baby 's husband what about your baby's father what about your husband what about your boyfriend where's eat\n\nAnd then some guy a table to over said hey that's racist and the guy that argument and the guy that said hey this race if eventually laugh because uh it was started to escalate to the point where who knows what might have happened so here you have all white guys one white guy saying out loud hey\nWhere's your where's the baby where's the father of your baby how can we can help us what he said how come the father of your baby can't help you\nSuddenly fit perfectly legitimate question he's called races by another white guy\nSo the point is people don't talk once the upside I Want to say how I feel it's going to be politically incorrect and next thing you know I'm a bigger around when I called her ideas of jets that racism is not a major problem in America and I'm Talking to somebody thinks it is what's the upside how am I going to prove it what what what am I going to say\nThat's why so coach you're not helping anything and Matthew is Chris Matthews expose the game listen to this\nIs for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist so of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get some off the hook you know what I'm saying\nNow Matthew is making two points although he doesn't realize that the first is\nMost people aren't raises sorry not\nSexually since most white people will vote for somebody if they think they're racist if necessary for us to characterize that person has racist your brand Reagan's races to brand George W Bush's races to brand Donald Trump is races because most white people will vote for him to get in the heat races therefore we're going to characterize it raises\nThat's the con he's just exposing it\nMost white people coach are not racist or your friends racist are you a racist or your friends' friends' races\nKnock it off\nNineteen Ninety seven time CNN poll poll black teenagers and why teenagers have talked about this before both were asked do you think racism is a major problem in America more whites team started wasn't black scene\nBut then they asked this do you think racism is a big problem a major problem or a big problem a I'm a ... ... minor problem or no problem in your own daily lives\nEighty nine percent of the black teens that racism was a miner or no problem in my daily life\nGrow up knock it off you gotta do three things get to the middle class coach you know this finish high school don't have the ... before you're twenty get married before you have that kid you will not be poor regarding this business about a introducing racism and and structural racism and\nAnd uh uh what's the other word institutional structure Roland a systemic racism yeah\nAbout the police coach tell these young black men comply you won't die\nVirtually all of these high profile cases would not have taken place had the individual slash suspect simply complied\nAnd his record is ruled even if the officer gives you an illegal order you must comply unless that illegal order your the company would force so you're not helping any anybody coach and the big problem coach is in your lead\nLook in the mirror for every player that does not have a kid outside of wedlock there's a player with to do something about\nThat that is the number one probably in the black community number one probably in the country forty percent of kids in this country are born outside of wedlock that is a massive problem Seventy three percent of black kids coach outside of wedlock that's the problem\nNot racism knock it off\nGoing to be talking with Dr ... just a second one of the things that we talk about is the abduction and apparently the murder of this Washington Post reporter here's what Jake Tapper set about it\nThis afternoon the president is denying he's giving cover in any way to the Saudis and the thing he simply wants to find out what happened but that's about as top that the president was willing to get he has had\nHarsh words in the last week or so for Stormy Daniels Senator Elizabeth Warren and Taylor Swift than he is bad for the Saudis responsible for the likely butchering quarter of a Washington Post columnist and\nYou see where they're going I mean well a CNN's defense guy mud to this\nOne with more that's only half the bombshell here I mean the the the really interesting part of this is an addition to the typical prosecutorial side of this as you report and the opening you were talking about a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will\nFrom all are going over Rosenstein let me play this out watching it Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation that Congress I bet it's going to turn around and say we want to see that in the Congress has been a leak there's going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that narrative of work at a\nFederal so we're going to talk to Dr ... about CNN reporting that we may see more indictments from Robert Mueller and has the parents as president been dismissive about what's happened to the Washington Post journalist I Am Larry Elder do not leave town\nLarry Elder Paul through all the\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time not a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago it wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and you know before the cross what is it been five even\nRemember this was a the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform number that\nYears ago a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the pits\nAre Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem a one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive ... executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker ... since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that it was a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from many of them\nThat's a shocking what is the saving you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if ah there is room for moderate Democrats and the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward [noise]\nThat's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWhen you're going to do\nWell I'd like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this very issue um and then in the short term um ironically my son is going in the air force than sixty days I'm going to spend some time with him and in the end I Will continue to fight this cause as long as I can continue to clear my name [noise]\nGod Bless and let let me just say again I'm not in support of the Democratic party but I Hope you stay in that party 'cause I think it needs to normal people and I think you you know hoping remain mark thanks very much for sharing that is a shocking story appreciate it thank\nYou for me to normal
