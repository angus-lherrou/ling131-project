CD but they're not included even though they're in Europe but that included other countries in Europe are\nAnd I'm a you know they won't include countries like Brazil or Russia or you know that obviously clearly meet the income criteria and other criteria that are there\nThe already why Russia was not a full member of the CD is because of the political issues that are involved not because of economic issues\nAnd um you know so I Would I go and give presentations discussions that kind of pointed out what the grabs look like if you include all the developed countries or if he gets include the select one what they want to go and pick\nBut it's really you know most people don't know the whole they say fourteen countries up there and they just assume laws you know that must be all the developed countries I don't think most people even in their mind quickly go through and say well you know you're missing other European countries in the ...\nSo you know it's not like the media really cares about trying to hold these people speak to the fire in the media is doing this as much as other\nYou know there are so many issues here it's not just\nThe murder rates are the homicide rate to issues about gun ownership so the United states it's supposedly way out there by itself in terms of gun ownership you'll see claims that\nForty four percent said they own guns are all in the United states that's just garbage and it and I think we'll put his numbers together the small arms survey which has gotten funding from ...\n[laughter] more people they just they just\nAre not a credible source they won't even tell people where they get their number it's far from most countries and the countries that you can figure out what they do they're just not credible so you may have let's have a survey here that country which has a um gotten registration\nCanada for example\nBefore they had long gun registration Ninety eight or you would find surveys that would show at least eight million long gun owners in Canada\nBut when they get the registration they only got about ... to register their guns and survey numbers quickly dropped to for me now is it that\nFive million or more people will bragging about having guns even though they didn't have them or did they instantly going sell them off there was no media\nStories that you find about people wanting to their local gun store and and trying to get rid of the longer that they had\nAnd there never will be in John ... it's not credible I've got I've got to stop you there I gosh I hate it I I was fascinated listening to you I looked at the clock and then boom here we are at the end of the end of the hour John ... thank you you are such a valuable resource\nListener crime research dot org all of this information is available to you remember ignorance when left unattended breed stupidity don't be ignorant this information is available to you\nSo it was worthy of extended analysis [noise]\nWhat it is they hate they hate the word nationalist as an example\nAnd I gave my supplied for you a quote\nFrom the European Union it's visitor center of the\nEuropean Parliament has a plaque up national sovereignty use the root cause of the most part time and the steady march of humanity back to tragic disaster and barbarism the only final remedy for the Supreme of catastrophic evil of our time is a federal union of the people's\nSeavey believe the bigger the better the American founders thought that since human nature stinks the less power concentrated in individuals hands the better\nSo both the left believes people were basically good especially themselves they know that they are basically good\nBecause they're in lightened and therefore all the power that they could have will only be used benign nearly that is what they believe these people are fools by definition left this may be sweet\nThey may be a whole host of things but to the extent that they have left wing views they're fools\nAnd foolish miss begins with the belief\nThat power concentrated in a few people's hands if they are lightened enough is just wonderful they really do believe essentially in benign dictatorships\nThat's what they believe the founders believed in diffusion of power separation of powers\nThat's why we have a Congress that's why we have an executive and that's why we have a court that is also why we have a U.S Senate to diffuse power among the states the left\nHates the Senate hates the Senate\nBecause it doesn't just reflect majority will because after all Wyoming with ... with fewer and fewer than a million people has as many senators is California worthwhile I don't know thirty million forty million people but it's completely non democratic which is exactly what they wanted it to be\nThey did not believe in democracy that is from their perspective and its lack of faith in humanity mob rule\nSo folks this is just unknown today because you don't learn that at school who's going to teach it to you you're left wing professor they don't even know what I just said it's not even a matter of suppressing if\nThey've never heard that they don't understand that if the diffusion of power amongst many is a guard is guards against dictatorship\nBut they walk the EU wants more and more power they're perfect example concentrated in Brussels that's why there was a ... they were shocked\nThat a majority of rich did not by the idea that Britain should seated sovereignty to a larger\nInstitution called the European Union\n\nIf you believe people are basically good then it's great to concentrate power in a few people's hands if you don't believe people were basically good you have to be idiots to concentrate all the power in a few people's hands\nBut as I said they believe in themselves if they ... they don't believe in God much but they sure do believe in themselves we know what's best for you\nEnvironmentally and sexually and artistically you name it yes indeed we know

and that's for you [noise]\nTo come into our country we have a three point seven percent unemployment soloist is spending more than fifty\nAll right so talking about the coming into the country here's an editorial in today's Wall Street journal the march from Honduras the caravan to know where\nThis is revel a Tory though the details are murky we do know is that former hung during congressmen ... of the left wing a Libra party\nHas admitted to organizing the caravan that's news to me or do you think about that I Believe it or leave the party of former president Manuel ... now folks I talked to

theory used to tie between the Andrew Johnson and Brock Obama I have often said ... was the worst\nAnd I could make a good case for it but it's okay if he's tied for worst\nBut the as when you have the entire media backing you up it's very hard for people to perceive how much\nDamage you do every time he said for ... and we knew that\nHe wasn't interested in furthering black white relations was

[noise]\nSee the fold while you were racist why are you at any of these things if you oppose thousands and thousands of people coming into your country illegally\nMaybe that's the difference between the nationalist and the non nationalist you are allowed to ask by the way ... expect people to say what is best for me\nWhat is best for my family what is best for my community what is best for my nation and what is best for the world\nYou you weren't allowed to do that but here's the beauty in general what is best for the United states has been best for the world not because I'm an American am I saying that I'm saying it because it's turned out to be true\nNot always fight by no means Americans have been ... have been myopic at times there's no question about it\nNevertheless you would have to ... anybody would have to acknowledge was it in world interest that the United states when the Cold War was it in the world's interest that the U.S when World War two was it in the world's interest that the U.S when\nThe uh World War one was it in the U.S interest for that matter that the U.S defeat communism everywhere\nWonder why you sit in the world insurers to have communism ever victorious unless you don't give a damn about the people who suffer under communism\nAll the global list you rooted for Ho Chi Minh that's the irony the American nationalist rooted for America in the Vietnam War\nThe world's the world global lists the world's global lists rooted for Ho Chi Minh so let me ask you a question which was better for the globe a communist victory or an American victory which produced more suffering an American victory or a communist victory\nSo they're full of bologna even in their concern for humanity\nThey're much more concern and hurting the United states and helping humanity\nHow else how else do you explain the fact that people rooted for Ho Chi Minh all over the world all these global lists wanted this Vietnamese Stalin to win\nIt's a moral fraud all of that stuff it's just the fraud but it sounds great oh I care about humanity\n\nThat's what turned me off to the left when I was in high school that they didn't pose communism liberals did\nBut the less

really um why couldn't look at it and complement to President Trump\nA presidency that found that people are my kids to America and I just think that oh\nWell it's certainly a complement to America the truth is that it happened or under a under President Obama and the economy was or was not good\nYou are right that there is it that they know how good things or the United states in how low the unemployment rate is so that they could most likely get a job\nBut uh it it's remember ... look what's beyond as compared to hunt Doris in Guatemala the American economy is always robust\nSo if these people aren't sitting down with the wall Street Journal and checking out the stock prices that they they know where it's better here is the point though that's the key point and that is just should be made every single day\nWhy would these people want to replicate the failed societies from which they come\nBy the way I Know again for the left who in their superficial little intellectual bubble think that to say something is a failed societies to engage in racism it has nothing to do with race that is one hundred percent values zero percent race\n\nCan't people ask why is America prosper is is\nIs that if you were in Guatemala\nYou every one of you listening if you weren't brought to Guatemala and and seeded orange hunter is a renowned Salvador\nAnd watching or in Brazil doesn't matter any Latin American country essentially and watching your society just be mired in poverty and corruption why wouldn't you ask the single most obvious question\nWhy is America affluent\nThere was no other question anyone in Latin America thinking about the economic situation there are other situations but thinking about economics there is no other question to be asked\nWhy does America work why don't American ask that question why does America work but they don't\nInstead the left asked asks why is America so racist Gina phobic and homophobic and Islamophobia could cetera\nWhat you what people who care about people as opposed to get just care about anger should be asking is why does it work\nThe question in this question intelligent people fought for people ask is not why even Americans have slaves it's white America abolish slavery\nIt's not why use their poverty in America it's why is there so much affluence in America every question asked is the wrong question\nThat's that's the point that needs to be made something just that just came to my mind I was just reading about the likelihood of Americans of different Americans when I was speaking about Americans complaining on the left\nThere was just a survey done about who was most likely to demonstrate\nAnd the the results were fascinating and it turns out of course left this were far more likely to engage

the Washington Post carried a front page story on Sunday about how the left will now campaign for Kavanaugh is impeachment they have to keep the anger momentum going at least through the election next month\nIt isn't just about him it's about cleaning the power so they can advance their liberal social agenda through the courts\nThat's what it has always been about conservatives are accused of

I mentioned it in passing regularly\nBut I don't know if I've ever devoted to an hour to what you do see one\nYou're checking for going back very far it's an indication\nAnd\nThat subject is a word

that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you what where is is that my whole life if it has been a ... a love I Want to understand what is wisdom understanding of life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's it's the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand and nothing that is why the highly educated are usually the least wise members of our society\nA because universities teach the opposite of wisdom they teach you to be a fool in my opinion some people escape on harmed but many the old and secondly because they teach you implicitly from a explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n\nWalk the walk aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender what does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department\nIt shows a lack of wisdom because he wrote the wisest plays written in the English language but it's not valued\nAll that matters is not wisdom but in this case race and gender so they they dismissed him because he was\nA white male and they put up a female I don't know what color\n\nWisdom without wisdom you can't do good\nThis and good is what most concerns me good versus evil you can't be a good person if if you're a fool and the food is the opposite of the ... person and those of you who are biblical you oriented build the word food is used pretty often\nWhile as a fool the food was the person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nYou with me if it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if only that sinks in in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important\nThan compassion compassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassionate doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion but compassion without wisdom is overly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies were going to continue the discussion of wisdom but I give you an example here\nI feel bad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits\nBut the ... person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is it compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with the wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is taught wisdom\nIsn't salt it isn't taught because it is in Salt\n\nI Believe ultimately that the radical secularization of western society is if the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nI get calls this I have I Know I mentioned before when I get calls\nYou're from let's say twelve or Fifteen year old and the kid talks about important things of life I Am certain that they are in a religious home and in every case that it's turned out to be true\nThe twelve or Fifteen year old if they would even listen to discussions of grave issues like I have my show even if they even with the with cold in about let's save the planet\nThey wouldn't call in about an issue of wisdom\nThey would be worried for people they would be again compassionate without wisdom\nThis is the great problem and they realized that in college so I had all these professors who are very very bright very very male legible and totally on the wall eyes they didn't understand life\nI fear for a society that the stock value wisdom and that is happening in all of western society\n\nWhen they Prager seven seven six is the number eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nWisdom will create a much better society than compassion by love compassion but you
