today or is it really is important to me so I'm very excited about it and I want to remind folks\nUh if you're thinking of getting a copy or copies for Christmas or whatever if you buy them\nThe week that it comes out which is to say today or tomorrow or it goes to the first week of the ... when they when they put together the best seller lists so I I always say to friends do me a favor\nYou're going to buy the book you know buy it now because it it goes the first week is is the most is the best option for a for us to get\nA on the bestseller list so I just want to say that ah it's important to me if you're thinking of buying it that you would buy it this week and of course you get the first edition and the first printing 'em I actually think this is going to be a thing I think people are gonna I think next Halloween\nKids are going to go out dressed as Donald became meant that could be oh no I'm telling you you're going to be done all the caveman within ... really pillows we know that my pillow which is our friend like window they're creating their sending us there you know whatever and at the end of the book Donald the caveman book the dumb brings us want book he\nBasically said they they said hey we want you to be a new king and he goes no it's kinda like George Washington he says no I don't want to be you can you free now you're free people\nAnd a free people you don't have a king king tells people what to do and they have to do it but a free people tell the leaders what to do and the leaders have to do it and they said to him oh you mean like a president he goes yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman yeah and so\nHe says I'm your caveman so we're making pillows that say he's my caveman and it's got Donald the caveman on there so Michael in del in my pillows going to be making these\nAvailable it's hilarious I mean just the fact that we've got we've got merchandise and we're and we're having dolls made up I still haven't found supposed to see it today I oh I was close to see it today everybody do Erica solid and get some books and keep this thing wrong well I I Do if it hits the bestseller list obviously that would be tremendous but I don't even know what category they're going to put it in\nLike I guess just humor books I don't know what it looks like a children's book so maybe I don't know any way I I don't want to forget to mention speaking of America ... um we're doing or something with the alliance defending freedom a lot of people know that religious liberty is under attack in America every time you turn around somebody is being challenged\nA for their faith and it's it's really an odd thing because the less people are aware of what the constitution actually says and aware of what our laws actually say with regard to rid live just liberty the more they're inclined to say oh I don't want to get in trouble and ... and by the way you then give\nIt's kinda like showing fear to add to it to a wild animal you know\nAnd that you in Bolden them you have to fight for what is right and religious liberty is key thing so life defending freedom they're the premier organization the United states that fights for religious liberty so if you have a ... year being attacked at your job we we had on Kelvin talk when he was the\nHe was a fire chief in Atlanta incredible human being African American hero I mean this guy was was intact terrific you know a early on and his career racism whatever so he rises to become\nYou know American success story whatever he\nWrites a small book for men's Bible study and mentions of biblical view of sexuality right now will somebody in the same sex community an activist didn't like it came after him he\nLost his job he was thirty five years in the department rises to become this big deal that he was gotten awards by Obama and the go all these things raises a hero lost his job because somebody said you know what you're a big it I don't like you know and so we're living in a time where if you don't fight that\nYou know the whole country is going to fall apart you have to understand when when we we all have to fight together otherwise we're all going to lose together so basically the alliance defending freedom is doing that they're winning they won a number of times they argued and one in Supreme Court level but they do this for free so if you come to them and say I got a problem there I can say ah\nLet's see let's see the money you know that they're not like some gum shoe that says that right give me a hundred dollars per diem and I'll uh I'll see what I can do no they say we will do this because it's right so they depend on\nOur donations so I'm asking you folks to go to our website attacks us talk dot com and you'll see it much taxes talk dot

like I just didn't have the I just it was hard for me to stay had the clubs and continue to wash couldn't get it like who told you you had to anyway\nWould actually move like if you're at a comedy club you go on stage you need to kind of rubbing elbows\nWith the other guys who were there going to make you funny or just getting more connection will it'll get you potentially more stage time because a lot of the comedians will have their own shows that they do the city I Gotcha okay so I was a professional reasons for networking ... yeah for for that and just for learning and I know I didn't understand why I didn't have a taste for it but then\nAfter after some years went by and I really got my own voice and clearly know who I Am income and I\nSuddenly I wanted to watch comedy again and I realize what's going on is I Would have been influenced correct by those others necessary but not even knowing it and even some of my friends some of that you would know when I watched her comedy I can see who they watched when they were ... when they were\nGoing on or you could have ended up being like the black Sam kennison and yeah and nobody wants to see that yeah you know what I mean or or my ... I could have been smashing like fruit and stuff [noise] I don't see that ... or some ... ... yeah oh no oh my gosh smash them for\nYeah I'm now let me ask you something uh\nI'm asking the question to ask you before because you didn't answer it when you were a kid growing up and you're watching people on TV or whatever who did you connect with and say I think he's funny I Want to be like that\nYeah when I was a kid I wasn't thinking more comedy is that right so you didn't watch I don't know J. J. Walker you didn't watch\nA while to heck I mean who all have on TV and find them funny\nAll my channels deserve lead shows on it is I Would just have written\nWell I just assumed that because you're black comedian you might have had some you know you ... only well oh usually you're going to tell me oh Bob Newhart was my biggest influence you know maybe I don't know\nHow ... into the dog is your very serene ... I'm trying to ask knew who were your like Steven Wright has that cerebral being ruined why no he is he really and you're a little bit like\nThat yeah your hair is different but you are a little bit like that Steven Wright it's more than we are so close really not interesting yeah but but ... you um so you don't have anybody like that that you say like that wanted out do you love to watch right now who's so stay or go to me uh\nBrian Regan disaster yes he is um in Killeen Jim gaffe against European gap again is also clean he's a Christian I Know Jim ... but I'm taco when you were a kid Ellen DeGeneres is yes and she's also clean\nShe yeah she was fun yeah already Mack was brilliant too but but come on when you were a kid you didn't you like you don't say like yeah I wanted to be you know Richard Pryor I wanted to be you know in any Murphy anybody nobody used to\nBecause of my comedy my county actually comes from a when I was a kid I used to struggle more reading\nLike I ... up in a quiz is really bad start to look at worst differently like I'm Talking about even in middle school\nHave I'd have to look at the ... and the color to positioning what's in front of what's behind it how people responded to it actually came up with seven different ways to look at a word to determine what the where it was you know Joe ... turned out really good at it to the point in high school people didn't wasn't really reading how's\nIt working out really really fast and I was going to do a re just fine but I still got disability look at words and people in situations seven different ways almost immediately and that's the primary play supplement company\nYou know where you are right on your genius you I'm not kidding you're genius you have a you have an ability to see I remember when I heard you do comedy at one point you went into this in depth he told a story and I realize that that's just a freaky gift like well yeah it is as it can be a curse but it's a gift in your case she using it for me right like\nSometimes people they don't ask to see things the way they see them or I just to kind of a gift but you're able to turn it into\nCounter first person to call me a genius a really kind of touch with them for real promise you I'll be the last so because people need to be geniuses themselves to recognize to go in the airport a filler application\nFor working directly [laughter] if I had ... but I mean I\nDon't I don't I Try not to use words like that lately I I think it's true I think that you have you have a a you have\nOutrageous gift and that's what enables you to be funny even the way you talk about humor and you're thinking about it was looking at it from the ... you know a lot of means is just an instinctive thing ... and they they have never thought about it they just know how to do it with her into\nThere's two things I've learned that really so whenever you\nSomeone laugh to retain more information rather just they just simply do retain like at least I think he's thirty eight percent more information that's why the super bowl commercials are so funny they always make them funny because they wanted to remember a product well\nThat's what I Do comedy if I'm if people if their hearts are open I like to make a deposit so even for example in the movie a mortar funny we were making a deposit were strategically making a deposit into people\nEven though it's Ninety seven percent funny but people will be moved there was a ... as a result of this like there's eight year olds who come to my shows who were laughing and then even crying as a result of some of the stuff that we share in between\nThe gym they step drinking a drug in and they yeah go into comedy do even the eight year olds behavior last year we're reaching a you know and say hey you need to get your\nLife together so you do not so ... I I'm just fascinated that I Want to ask you a simple question like that you would ask any comedian like are you in France has gone up you you're kind of telling me you didn't have any\nYou know I respect of budget comedians and really enjoy watching them now but now I think about the where there were influence meaning influenced my style like it was they had a they cause me to change my ... and they didn't really happen I just had my own I just stayed away from it but I didn't want to\nJust literally couldn't I just didn't have the desire was weird but now looking back at in retrospect I'm really happy because the way I'm doing comedy hasn't been done before not the comedy itself with the but the extra stuff that we're doing in between the jokes\nRight well you are you also realize that influences if they're if they're good they help you find your own voice as opposed to kind of overwhelming you know what I mean like say you eat you kind of\nThey they help you may be no what's possible in terms of calm yeah something like that and I have that in writing a little bit but it it's a it's a fine line because you do feel like some people just re treads of something else but who knows maybe that is their voice and uh we're just responded to somebody else so that\nThat line of people say all the time and I really liked blind we're to talk about ah you're only going to be successful is your five\nClosest friends were right so if that's the case with just with friends who's ... who's a five people like who else or who you're listening to because we have our gates irrigate everything's going to come in and then it's going to show up so I'm your wages\nRebuild you'll never succeed in comedy I'm just telling you right now [laughter] because I don't do that under the influence right so you're saying sometimes on ... and ... it is it is so no no no I Am really fascinated because I remember when I heard you do comedy a number of years ago I remember thinking\nYou're somebody who thinks very differently you're looking at things from different angles and that's really what makes you not only who you are but it makes it it gives you your comedy some ...\nSome time I'm sitting in a I'm a grocery stores who you are I'm at a grocery store them to do this for music is too low I'm at a grocery store and buy some food and the lady behind the counter

you don't have a federal movie coming out we go from here is that right there's a movie October Eighteen one night only a moving ... been funny when sound to more than funny that it does seem to me though uh that\nThis movie obviously it's funny but you are you're asking people to think about their lives and what their purpose in life\nBut not just say here's what are the image before at the end of the movie is a ridiculous unexpected call to action for people who make to make a decision to be a punch line or a punch on as a person who's looking for an opportunity to give but you can't give 'em money\nBecause money is not a punch line it's only the result of you using your set up in case of this is a difference or I saw surprise set this up again I how do you live in\n... they reorient the time so Christ was born what six B. C. to BCS zero BC whatever and Paul is pretty much the same age and uh after Christ was crucified and resurrected but in a sense that\nPaul was around ... as a an ardent Jew and a follower of the law and a student of of Judaism and he was a persecuted of the church and so he's in his mid thirties probably early thirties\nAnd um he's going around outraged that Jews are accepting Christ is the messiah when he knows he knows that can't be true\nBut I I remember when I learned this I I remember I learned that the summer I came to faith now I've been an altar boy in church every week and it just shows you going to church you may learn nothing because when it for whatever reason but I remember when I learned that the apostle Paul St Paul\nBefore he became the great leader of the Christian faith that we know he was persecuting Christians I ... when I learned that I thought\nYou want to talk about conversion ... holy cow this was one of the smartest people of his day he was a genius in terms of the scriptures he studies in the mail yet the big adventure of the time so he was\nPaul was an absolute genius one of the smartest most effective uh you know a a Bible people of his day Old Testament people of his day and he was using his faith in his knowledge to persecute\nChristians so one day he has this thing happened to him and will you you tell the story I mean this is like unbelievable except we know what actually happened\nHe ... and let me this as a background that let me tell you why he believes that Judaism is authentically from God that that that Jews are God's chosen people by the way you and I believe that as\nWell by the way Jesus believe that any\nWho's a Jew and and and all that was true everything you learned was true but then the Christians come along Christ comes along it can't be the messiah because he was dies on a\nTree he's hung on a tree which Old Testament scripture says you're cursed if you do he was also supposed to deliver them aside as it's supposed to deliver a military and political victory Christ went down an editor defeat and humiliation uh apparently and he couldn't possibly be what they were were looking for so no this couldn't have happened So Paul\nDoesn't just think the Christians are not a threat they're starting a a religion even the competing religion that would have been okay no they're twisting his religion and the word of God that's a serious affront in his defense I don't blame him for being outraged because that's what he was\nTaught to believe so he's on a mission to imprison kill 'em persecute them he's on his way to Damascus he ask for permission from the religious ... religious authorities in Jerusalem to arrest these heretic ths in Damascus and on his way there he's blinded with a ...\n...

out there listening\nWho doesn't know when Christians talked about the book of Romans ... cautions whatever what do we mean by that what we mean is that this man Paul uh is traveling around the ancient world creating churches creating Jesus a bull believer groups here\nAnd here and here and here but then he keeps traveling and the only way you can communicate with them is to write these letters so he hears things from them they write letters to him\nAnd the letters that he wrote to them we can just imagine what's going through his mind he's not just like oh let me just down if you know these thinking this is this may be the only thing I get to say to this group of people so he takes tremendous pains to school\nThem in doctrine what's right what's wrong so there's all kinds of the logical stuff in there and then as you just had this practical stuff through the years about arguments about communion or this or that and he puts it all down not knowing that this would become a part of the Bible it's a it's kind of an amazing\nThing it's an amazing thing in another parallel thing\nIt's grounded in actual history just like\nThe entirety of Christianity is grounded in the history of Jesus as badly resurrected so here's Paul not writing some abstract theological doctrine\nThat's untethered to real historical events he's living this experience and under the Holy Spirit a empowerment\nHe's writing these letters to the church that are that are steeped in practical advice and doctrine not knowing that they're all going to be available to us pray in a transcendent way\nHow cool is that I was an everyday that's what's so cool is that when you say in a transcendent away when he was writing them as you're saying he didn't understand that they would become scripture for everybody that he just said I'm just writing to the specific group of people either in Rome or in colossus or in a ... show or one of these places he's writing to them\nBut the way he wrote God used it\nTo reach Christians for ever and ever and ever it becomes the word of God\nAnd uh I I Do think that that's such a beautiful thing because it transcends time I mean it exist in time

away I did it um I think a year and a half ago all the time goes fast could be two and a half way yeah Frank's awesome by the way you said\nJesus has risen to the title noticed the verb present tense it seems a little weird not Jesus was resin Jesus is risen it's a present message because as you said it's timeless it in time minutes outside of time at the same time and that's why the present tense\n... yes I agree with you\nWhy did I said I don't know I just wanted to say\nNo no no no no I like I like that I mean I think it's important to talk about there are people who everybody's different but there's some people usually a Christians they get very fussy\nLike they they don't like anything for example I missed the call right up there like morale and mystical I just want the word of God we're gonna what are you what do you think the word of God is yeah God\nIt has created a door to heaven through these words on the page is is that mystical his conversion mystical our angels mystical\n... the point is we're living in a reality there's the physical reality and then there is according to the word of God according to the Bible there's this mystical reality all around us and I'm always amazed at how Christians can be the most guilty of getting nervous by that you know\nA ... you know as though the spiritual world can only be a counterfeit of God and you think well wait a second you can go wrong in both directions some people think that everything's spiritual must be good no there's a demonic ... realm and you should be really scared on the other hand\nThere is an angelic realm and God and the Holy Spirit want to speak to us Mr ... people don't like that word pick whatever word you want in a transcendental way a in a transcending way but I think that it is important for us to to understand that that Paul himself rights when he's in prison he's in prison and he says\nI Am seeded with you and heavily places so in other words\nPhysically where here but if we have been born again by the spirit of God we're always in two places at once yes I'm physically here but by faith because I had been born again spiritually I Am with the lord and it's an amazing thing to try to comprehend that\nWriting these books because you're doing something that's gonna it's gonna outlast you I mean you're putting\nIn the pages of these books stuff that people can read any time help them understand what the Bible says ... I mean you just got to be probably really accomplishing something for the ages you know I was proud of these things is your microphone on is this micro now okay gotcha\nYeah he probably are not supposed to be proud of these things but I I Am I I feel really good about that that I I've gotten the feedback from a lot of people that they these books do help people understand scripture better and make them want to get into scripture better and and as you say that they do they will survive\nA to some extent I don't have any idea and and again I don't take personal credit for whatever it is and this is a false humility we all know that Christians that\nThis is has to be from the Holy Spirit if it has any lasting value that's a positive value and yeah I'm humbled by it I I Love it it's just an exciting thing as exciting period in my personal or professional development that's more gratifying than anything I've ever done\nAnd what happens after this book did you say you're going to go into the other a pistol in in the scripture\nYes I Would have finished the all the New Testament after the gospels with this book\nBut space limitations which must be a demonic thing yeah [laughter] that's it I just I went to the content speak for itself it dictates the amount of space I'm going to cover I don't try to artificially reduce it trying to make it accessible but deep enough\nTo to impart what I Want and it just lend itself to the six books a pause missionary pistols once he wrote on his three missionary journeys and on his trip\nTo Rome now he's got ... I've got seven officials left to cover on excited to cover does and the rest of the episodes that the other apostles wrote I don't think I'm going to have the audacity to tackle the book of revelation well maybe we can do that together 'cause we're we're\nWe get we get knocked out on the weekend no seriously that's a that's a pretty big but well I mean look part of the reason that you didn't want to do it all in one book is because once it goes beyond three hundred pages people get weird yeah and I think that reg Murray probably smartly said hey\nAh please keep it to to the kind of a size of a book where people actually pick it up and buy it and read it and stuff and\nAnd again you're very accessible and so sometimes I think her book fools people into thinking it's going to be very us scope scholarly a times my bigger books have done that people kind of scared and stuff and the fact of the matter is no that's uh that's just an appearance but\nUm I I just think the idea that you're basically entertaining scripture I've thought of doing the same thing I haven't done it but the reason is that when you get into\nThe Bible and and stuff pops out at you you get so excited you want to tell your friends right yes you find things these ... this is great yeah I Want to tell the whole world and I want to so I'm I'm kinda glad that you're so excited yeah\nI used to do that in Sunday school but you only read about twenty people and uh and plus they know you and they know you're not profound so they don't listen anyway so you you taught Sunday school yes the ... at your church Missouri yeah sporadically like once every two years I'd do it\nThree or two months class or three months ... right yeah well that's interesting does Jimmy Carter still teach Sunday school um\nI don't know but my daughter doesn't talking about nuclear warfare hike his daughter did\nOh I'm Sorry we didn't need to get into that didn't need any Carter talking about nuclear warfare it's\nTraumatic to to hear it I Know\nIf you're if you're the kid of a president and I know a lot of them are listening right now I care for what you say because just because you're the ... the son or daughter of a of a president as states doesn't mean\nYou need to to tell everybody what you think but that could it's just it's a great temptation it is um well let me just to say that um\nThe idea that you're writing these books again this is what what numbers this but not in the series sort of um\nI think this is the fourth that is the fourth night the book overall and for Christian theme\nOkay so so you wrote a book that talks about your conversion we covered yesterday you wrote a book that talks about how the Old Testament points to the New Testament to Jesus then then the gospels and you know the last when he did was the gospels and then this one which is Paul\nIn the early church and I think so many people um are are so confused about the basics of what happened they need a primer\nOn on it I you know what I Love we were talking about this before the scripture is so fascinating that you find new stuff in it all the time\nAll the time I found the other day uh my pastors preaching a sermon on loop five where Jesus at the beginning was ministry says you know cast your net out in the boat there and they catch is Julian fish in there all freaked out they don't know how did this happen it's insane\nWell it dawned on me while I'm listening to the sermon\nThat at in John Twenty one at the end of the ministry after he died in ... and and and uh before he a sense he says to them hey cash units and the other side of the boat\nAnd the same thing happens and it's because of that that Peter realize this holy cow it's Jesus and he died in the water and I thought I'd never made that connection and I went on line nobody else seems have made that connection there so much stuff in scripture once you look into it we're going to be right back talking to David Limbaugh focus here in

benefits America have too often ... other nations especially on trade and tariffs\nPresident Trump and his team said they would do away with NAFTA because it was a bad deal negotiated under the Clinton Administration Mexico said it would not agree it has Canada promise no change in its policies that penalized especially American dairy farmers\nCanada has modified its position now in the face

you call\nAre you kidding me [noise] now\nSenator Elizabeth Warren who have repeatedly said that she is Native American part Cherokee part Delaware took a DNA test and according to the Boston Globe ... it shows that she is in fact part native\nAmerican\nThe Boston Globe article said quote the vast majority holding a professor from Stanford professor Carlos Bustamante from Stanford\n\nThis question when you look up and find out what Carlos Bustamante studies or what he specializes in I'm presuming I'm presuming he's a geneticist but let's make sure that you anything to sociologist I'm just kidding I have no idea what do you have to find out Carlos Bustamante Stanford says it was a possibility she had a Native American ancestor anywhere from six to ten generations ago\nAlthough the vast majority he says uh her ancestry is European but the result quote strongly support the existence of an on an ad mixed Native American ancestry close quote calculating that her pure American\nNative American ancestry appears in the family tree in the range of six depend generations ago which would make her approximately one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth Native American\nAlso get this study was based not on Native American DNA but on Mexican Peruvian at Columbia and DNA\n\nNevertheless CNN headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with quote strong evidence close quote their words of Native American ancestry daily beef also left wing publication Elizabeth Warren fights Trump's Pocahontas taught with DNA test proving Native American roots quote unquote really\nIs that when it proves one one thousand and twenty four that means the percentage of Native American ancestry and her is actually lower than the average in America\n\nIs he claims she never got any sort of benefit by claiming to Native American kid with CBS says\nMassachusetts Senator Kennedy Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday sought to explain the controversial decision to west herself as a Native American Ina directory of law professors for nearly a decade before getting a job at Harvard and said she is absolutely qualify for a job in the quote that was years ago\n\nProponents of time accused her of quote participating in Harvard diversity sham close quote by allowing the school to lift her as a minority\n\nLaw school directory\nTouted her Native American roots in the late Nineteen eighties early Nineteen nineties\n\nAnd according to a former chairman of American Bar association of law schools\nThey directory once served as a tip she for administrators looking to and identify minority professors so she must have been in this book knowing full well she's going to get an advantage it turns out the amount of Native American ancestry and her is actually\nProbably less than mine and yours [noise] [noise] in fact\nTruth be told I have a a mother whose father very light skinned head straight hair I understand his parents were also very light skinned and I believe my mother went even said that sometimes they could even pass for white\nWhich would probably indicates that I have probably more European Caucasian blood in me than it is it lives with Warren has a Native American ancestry and her now considering all my life I call myself a black person\nOr therefore for the last ten years\nAnd I'm just thinking this through so stay with me here for the last ten years I looked at myself as a black person which means I have therefore failed to benefit from the white privilege that I was in title to switch\nTo me there ought to be some sort of reparations for black people who have more white blood white ancestry in them that Elizabeth Warren has a Native American Cherokee and Delaware and her and therefore I'm old all of the lack of my having benefited from white privilege\nFor all these years since white people all benefit from white privilege so it seems to me the people that could have been designated as white who didn't do so given the standard is pretty low one one thousand\nIt seems to me I Know somebody over here and I'm thinking about Obama now here's where it gets complicated that's what I'm saying we're we're we're we're altogether big industry collectively given the new standards were learning from Elizabeth Warren who not once Donald Trump to pay our\nDonald Trump once said he'd give a million dollars to her favorite charity as you take a DNA test she now claims to protest wants to come to pay us so we have the new one thousand uh and twenty fourth standard\nNow Obama is a descendant from a Kenyan his father was a kitten a and a Kenyan was one of the states that whose treat ... tribal chieftains sold off kept his ways and it's like a very\nUm and Obama's a mother distance from people living in Kansas who I understand owned slaves so Obama\nDescend from slave owners on his mom's side and slave sell it on his dad's side so I'm thinking\nMan owes me some reparations over here given the standard we now have here so if
