I like to challenge the new law at the time and our executive director Chris Cox noted and I quote magazine bands do not deter criminals or improve public safety and steady irrationally burden the rights of law abiding gun owners\nJust as in line with the department of justice funded study of the Nineteen Ninety four federal semi automatic band quoting which also restricted magazines with a capacity greater the turnaround to study noted that shouldn't be renewed the bans effects on gun violence are likely to be smaller Beth and perhaps too small for reliable measurement\nOkay sharing conceded that\nMagazines with a capacity greater than ten rounds are in common usage and thoughts entitled to Second Amendment protection however he then proceeded as other courts have done to apply and infinitely malleable interest balancing test standard to determine whether New Jersey's infringement on the second Amendment rights is permissible\nHe concluded what that means is that the Garden State New Jersey's magazine ban should be subject to intermediate scrutiny\nThat means that the policy must further and important government interest by a method substantially related to the interest\nIs putting a heavier burden on it okay the court and I quote acting as policy analyst rejected testimony refuting the advocacy of magazine bad then adopted the state's purported concerns over the criminal used to these item\nNow association of New Jersey rifle and pistol clubs is going to of course appealed his decision\nBut I Want to get real with you for just a second let me stop talking about this or just a second I I talk about this where they W. R. hawk and others I discussed it on the daytime show that me reach down behind me right here\n\nYou hear this bag opening when I'm pulling out of the Syrian pulling us out of\nA factor but I have in my hand is a bump stock for and they are Fifteen narratives I'm set it back down here\nTrump\nAs we've discussed on this show and preview shows over the previous week\nHas said he is nearing a ban on bump stocks\nI bought this bump stock legally it is legal for me to shoot this bump stock I own this bump stock legally and I'm not giving it to anybody\nI'm not giving it away\nAbout destroying it I'm not going to throw it out in the creek I'm not going to beat it to death I'm not going to I'm not going to do Youtube videos on on keeping\nIn mind I own it I owned it lawfully nobody's going to tell me that all of the sudden I Can't have it it belongs to me and I'm keeping it\n\nIn New Jersey I'm going to ask you a question no California been facing us for a long time as well\nWhat are you going to do\nNow that gun hating freak show governor Phil Murphy has signed into law\nA ban on your Fifteen round magazine\nBecause you see you must forfeit possession that means gave it to someone or allow someone to take it away that's your property or you are to permanently destroy it\nIn such a way that the magazine no longer accept what it was built and accepted for which is Fifteen route and which you lawfully paid for and purchased lawfully and own lawfully today because of anti gun freak show Governor Bill Murphy\nThis is the bigger philosophical question here\n\nI'm going to quote David coterie again I've been doing a lot of that lately been talking about David's work a lot over the last week or so\nMark on me I Want to remind you he told me on a program not too long ago not too long ago so I Want to tell you something\nThey can't confiscate guns in America it's impossible we have a Second Amendment right to possess are guns they cannot confiscate them they can't be confiscated in the U. S. we can only willfully give them up\nThink about that\nVery profound words from David coterie and he's right let's go back to to take New Jersey here eight to Seventy six one New Jersey anti gun governor freak show Phil Murphy signed into law because he doesn't like Fifteen rounds it's okay with that because he said you could\nGive him up destroy him\nPermanently ruin them and keep them from doing what they were supposed to be done in the first was oh don't think that's not going to use any trouble yeah right somebody sees a Fifteen round holes in 'em ... she's Fifteen holes in the back of your magazine\nIn a state like New Jersey oh you're going to jail broil it won't matter if you modify it we've seen what they do we've seen what they do to ... Brian ... we've seen what they do this you know then there are others\nThey don't care about that you live in fear and New Jersey if you're a law abiding gun owner even if you follow the law and call them for advice on following the law like Brian ... did you\nStill get convicted felony you still have to seek a pardon from a governor you still have your life destroyed because of these freak show gun haters\nSo the bigger philosophical question is what do you do I just told you what I'm doing I own this bump stock I bought it legally it's in\nMy home lawfully and I'm not giving it to anybody because no one can tell me that what I purchased lawful you have to ... and own\nNow makes me a criminal it's just a piece of plastic\nI didn't become a criminal overnight because of something I don't think about what I'm saying to you because of something I lawfully own today does not make me a criminal tomorrow\nSo it remains to be seen what Trump was talking about we have a lot to go on in the coming days and weeks with that is going to be grandfathered in I don't care if it is or not I have it it's fine I own it lawfully come and get it\nHere it is I'm not giving it to\n[noise] I think of a man [noise] like take away reason and accountability [noise]\nDoes have\nA non ... he won the number one [noise] why women\n[noise] I've always been a big problem [noise] listening to you you go out and going [noise]\nAll my friends that are suffering from email our every Wednesday\n\nFeatures the male female our I think it's also I was talking about men and women in the media I may be wrong and by the way if I'm wrong I Will acknowledge\n\n\nAm intensive and the only answer there to radio station to the city to focus on good use one the good news about the economy jobs but it's super confidence in the defeat over ISIS\nOne is a good news about the victory over the cross the border is all about a year now the other is all about the trinity [noise] when you want to know more about the day's news for the day um to Seventeen the answer if you want to change your life\nTurned over one hundred points the the word to gather and we could change the world let's faces\nWe love my legs and we love to let her find your favorite radio station is of course much you can find us easier if we tell her simple trick to study simply say unless\nThe answer is just after she confirms you could then say Alexa answer that's all you have to do an election will learn how to find us you can listen to us through your Amazon Echo echo show that goes on and Amazon snap devices Alexis what's your favorite radio station in Boston you get your\nHands on Saturday the answer\nLoses the dentist for regular show on gay marriage and now that knew the answer my\nTheory is women if they receive a gift they see wow look at the thought that was put into this uh getting\nMe this gift that is really moving and beautiful beautiful and therefore moving men think hey\nWhat a great deal I now have a hundred dollars to spend at X Y or Z that I didn't have before I could buy exactly what I Want for me thank\nYou how am I speaking for you Mr producer\nBut now interesting because I Believe that every one if every one of the three emails affiliated with the direct presentation of this show tripled gee the living martyr and all I have feminine side I Do I Believe that\nThat sure enough tripled jeeze feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card after I laughed at him for about five minutes we'll resume the conversation\n[laughter] [laughter] that\nThey have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they have cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even trains may say\nThat that's amazing I Know I Know I Can't believe that question that they have gift cards were like it was that his hilarious their gift cards no no that was invented when you were born oh my God\nIt's this generation we keep him around it was like a sort of a a a you know just stay in touch with what the with what the new folk think anyway Prager seven seven six or seven seven to for three triple seven six\nAnd that is that that's the theory that I I'm working women love too by the way there's no better or worse here is is that at all\nThere is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nWell obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know what it what is your take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add that show what is your Dennis prayers feminine side and I said it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I think I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a ... [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him shoot them uh dramas where you know action to action dramas men law here yes Ben love high speed car chases the guy shot him and this and and as it does do not explode she such explosion [laughter]\n... explosions [laughter] that was great I I I I I I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me but a romantic comedy I Am\nTotally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation I mean I loved sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted\nYes\nI Know that ... guys yes I you don't even have to turn it off that tried triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you like both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and the explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit but that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the love women\nI have to weigh in the ... the early days and and that's right and gift card that's correct\nYou see Dr ... do you see that they know that there's a gift card slip through them that is exactly right\nYeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode [laughter] so everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what if it [laughter]\nSo I Am this this is a male female should is devoted to Dennis this theory on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife\nI ... I I I I you know as well as I Know her but I could see what do you think you know my wife very well why do you think or sue would would would answer it's a tough one what would your wife\nAnswer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do\nI Know there's a good argument in both I think\nShe likes the gift I think she'd be very touched but I wouldn't be touched too if I liked the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting me that\n... are are very small ... who knows better what I Want to know why that's why that's why rational bail brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right so it's a generous give a hundred dollar gift\nThat somebody spends they have thought to it and and I know they gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing people think that you're getting them a gift certificate shows you didn't think you took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all\nListen don't couples is set up one of the call when they set up an account at a at a department store a furniture store you you know what I mean you know ... people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't ...\nCouples marrying set up a thing what is it called\n[laughter]\nThis is a problem when you work with men\n\nUh anyway you they set up an account and you to use the past that way they could get the the the dishes they want they could get their register that thank you that's right they register with the store\nNow All right you're right I should've known knowing romantic comedies but the last time there was a registry even a romantic comedy was Eighteen sixty nine the first the picture of the ticket\nSo now that's an example Poe right that's like a gift card\nI don't like inflicting pain on people are like keeping standards I put me in the punishment room I put you in the punishment room that is a good reason the screener needs to know the fifty\nInitials or spell out the name [laughter]\nOkay\nWe have standards at the ... show All right Christine I'm Sorry that you were even tangentially related to this sad moment\nIssue there Oh yes I Am okay go ahead it is it is\nI I Hope she didn't get in trouble\nWell she may high but it's over [laughter] hey go ahead I\nHonestly I prefer cash because the card you know how much stores make off of gift card\nWhy cause pain to lose ... known them twenty five dollar gift card yeah something for twenty twenty million bucks to weapon that gift card and you're going to be\nLow that is a very good point I never thought of them that much money than that but you know what they're saying\nThat it's very interesting you're so right but there's something that seems to be about well if yeah it seems almost tacky and it's and it's ridiculous because it's no different from a gift card but I have no way you give a guy an envelope with a hundred dollar bill said again\nI don't you get to spend all the\nCat you know no you're right I I couldn't agree more\nThat you may be the castle wrap it up in the life what a gift\nA big one [laughter] oh I beg why [laughter] very funny\nThat's a very funny thought you'd give somebody gets a big box the bail opened it up there's a hundred dollar bill on the bottom [laughter] yeah [laughter] All right I agree with you know\nWhat I Want better than me and it and it at my age you know one company by\nRight so you're sixty three at forty three would have preferred a gift yeah All right so I don't think the I don't think it's age related uh I have to yeah I I don't I think I think it's more sex related and that's my theory but I you know obviously you you do you\nPrefer the the the money uh\nThere's a there's a there's a very er here All right good we have a male who prefers a gift will take a thank you Christine Marty in Indianapolis, Indiana Hi\nHey
