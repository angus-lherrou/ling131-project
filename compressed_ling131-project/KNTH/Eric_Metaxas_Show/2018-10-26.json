[noise]\nYou know [noise]\n\nOh right yes I'll let the music run a little bit law have great song from hot chocolate love that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done thus far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we have seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in a land then fine I'm okay with that but then we attribute it powers it does not have a forty does not have granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the\nPerson up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans are going to cheer for him and back him why\nBecause the left doesn't like them and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\nThink about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left or the right can we agree on something I Am at let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes shoot a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes should a white man should a Hispanic\nMan should uh and we can go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense unfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to even do some honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism is the bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the left is supposed to be team black right I began this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way\nI support a person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is fat or we've seen Republican and Democrat lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not the Texas Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen them come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile like people\nReally we did um I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open Gary and he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have\nDone was protected\nJust put another layer of protection on an individual's right\nIn addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile black people\nAnd Republicans do other Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile black people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yeah\nBlacks overwhelmingly support Democrats and Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney who\nBasically\nSupported Obamacare lite\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be worse accepting things we don't want\nOr don't believe do I have any liberal pardon me do I have any liberal Democrat by men out there who think that the government should have a right to profile black man how many Republicans do I have out there how many liberty liberty by the guy's going to say oh no man\nEveryone has a right\nTo be safe and secure in their persons in effect but that's where we're lacking dude dude they're just going to win dude you already forget that my like eighties throwback kind of deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a focus on liberty because we have our vision has become myopic because of this left right fight\nGuys let's support let's get on one page and say we can support and respect liberty for each other\nLet's use that liberty one of God's greatest gifts demand and he's given us a lot but one of the greatest God's greatest gifts\nLiberty\nThe right to make own decision you're listening to file chapter that is a hand

but before we go to before we go to Carrie Sheffield a\nI've got a I've got a couple of fun announcements or I Want to make but I don't forget to mention alliance defending freedom is is that this is very important okay a life depending freedom folks uh I got to tell you right now we're behind so if you're inclined to give a let's just say that\nYou know all over America I mean we notice that the federal and local authorities are pursuing leads into suspects who who might have sent these uh these bombs are these explosive devices by the way none of them went off so it makes me wonder if the whole thing's a PR stunned\nBecause you are right okay but um anyway the point is that these things present like a clear and present danger to the political system because everybody's talking about it's a big mess but I just want to tell you folks there is something that is\nConstantly a danger a month ago a year ago five years ago five years from now religious liberty is genuinely under threat is a serious secular forces are chipping away\nAt our Judeo Christian roots and religious freedom is being threatened so I Want to push\nThat said please give to life defending freedom or they they just send people for\nFree okay and this is the you know by the way Bob Trent who went through I couldn't agree with that that a seemingly small ways uh our that our religious freedom of infringed upon can become a huge legal challenges right and then you get charges of intolerance bad press horrible stuff\nWe got to take that there's got to fight it idiot that's fighting or the or the clip from Bob ...\nWhen you have these conflicts that become between the algae beaches community and people of faith and people say well can't we all get along well that's not what they're looking for what they're looking for\nIs active support active participation I Will come and find you and even though there's another fifty bakers or fifty forest that'll serve me for free I Want you to do it and the fact that you have a religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman is unacceptable\nSo it it tolerance even though it should be a two way street often in these instances ah it it's not and I think that's the danger of\nWell I I couldn't agree more uh if you're inclined to call you or the website which is just my taxes talked dot com but if you're going to call the number is eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven\nSeventy they really need your help folks um I don't want to harp on that's except we believe in ATF they can't do this without your help they been doing this for years but they can't continue to do it unless we\nWe step up alliance defending freedom out in um ... we have a number eight hundred\nAnd five five six twenty seven Seventy but I guess I Want to say you wanna go to the website everything is doubled as we've been saying so please a check it out um but I got to make a couple announcements I can do an hour or two but if we have a second here we do um\nI just want to say that I wrote an article\nUh it kinda was prompted by what Kanye West set in the White House like two weeks ago or whatever it was and it's called boys will be men instead of boys will be boys boys will be men and it's at the stream that or you know where I always send people for guns in Iraq stuff\nYes yeah well now there's a piece that I wrote there is also on my\nTwitter feed and on Facebook and will will tweet it out but uh it's I feel very strongly about it I'll probably be doing a lot of radio and other programs talking about it but next week or maybe I'll talk about it on this program because I feel strongly\nAbout it I've been doing a lot of radio and I just wanted to say ... yesterday I called up the Dr Bruce show right they wanted to have me on to talk about Donald the caveman ... and they started saying like well I don't know if it's a good time to joke around because a lot of the president's opponents are scared\nBecause he has been cited the violent rhetoric and he's inside of this talking about body slamming reporters and what so they they basically are forwarding this narrative that the president's rhetoric is bringing this stuff about it I Want to say I said on the on his program to the doctor said\nThat is absolutely unconscionable\nThat new in a prominent place would push forward that that narrative it it's really horrifying to me but I'll say on this program I think it's worse than that I think it's despicable that leaders like Dr Drew either to get ratings or whatever it is or saying stuff like that it is it's a stunning it's a stunning thing I just wanted to say that\nThat I was so sick on that radio program I was sorry that I did the interview yeah that is obviously I Want to talk about something fun and interesting and they they just wanted to kind of push\nThis this idea I fundamentally disagree day we want to say they were going to go to a break

the full spectrum of information about who the founder was a and I felt really upset I felt like I had been like to I felt like there were ... whitewashing um the origins of the church that they were presenting this this um\nPristine image of Joseph Smith you and I it took me having to go to the Internet to find out the truth\nAnd it I like to say it's it's sort of like Richard Nixon where the cover up is worse than the crime yeah and what's interesting now is that in the age of the Internet you're seeing the Mormon church actually start to open up more and and they're open up their archives about Joseph Smith\nUh they're they're studying to be more transparent I think because they've been forced to uh and it's sort of that at you and knock you'll eat them when they're younger so that they don't feel like\nThey're right completely I I thought when I\nWas the worst of it in other words you're you're saying that you were a you were blindsided by what I mean that he had many wives that they were young like what what would\nYou like that like one was fourteen which was really upsetting but also the were married to other men\nBecause they say that oh he only did it because they were widows or they they were never getting married it's like no he basically said if you don't marry me and leave your husband you will be smitten by God and you won't get to heaven all living mowers\nOffered me ... me and there's ... [noise] that's interesting\nYeah and you know I ... and again look I'm not a member anymore and the church has its own responses and and the church uh also will say well he he obviously was a flawed man and he's not or you hear that there's a kind of stuff whenever you have\nA you know particularly I'm\nA very very strong leader like you find that some in religious cult that they start changing the rules and everybody's freaked out and you know it's like you hear these weird things about these people who have this kind of power and so I don't know very much about Joe Smith but but go ahead says oh and also what\nBothered me was that the book of Mormon and and you can read in the introduction to the book of Mormon they claim that if they historically accurate factual document\nA and that the Smithsonian with using it as a guide for ancient history and the Smithsonian issued a letter that said please don't use our name that's not true\nUm because the book of Mormon purports to be the end to document of a record of Jews who left uh Israel and moved to America um before the coming of Christ and that when Christ died before he rose a or appeared after three days in that three day period he came to America\nAnd that this was an ancient book of the American continent despite the fact that there is there evidence of that and also um the bulk wiring claims that the Native Americans are actually descendants of\nJews hang on one second we're going to go to a break folks were talking about Mormonism with Cary Sheffield stick around [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWhat else are in

hosts with Clay Aiken son of a gun okay so you were talking about being I'm Upset learning all these kinds of things what happened after that\n[noise] well I at sadly the way the church is it's very black or white or either you have to accept it all uh and really uh be quiet about it a sport this was my experience anyway or a few vocal as your doubts and\nAt a wrestle with it publicly oftentimes there'll be excommunicated or ostracized and so they really make it a black or white decision um it's really not like Judaism where you could kind of pick your your flavor or at least you're you're a manifestation of how you want to practice a and so I you know I took the red color or whatever going till I forget you know\nI I took the pill and I I decided that I I was going to leave and uh it's sad I think it's sad that they make it such a stark\nChoice must have been very tough for your family\nIt was well my parents are are outliers in the sense of they're they're even more fundamentalist at then uh I mean what I like to say is when Mormonism works out that's Mitt Romney Mormon and when it doesn't work out that a Ralph ... Mormon and I'm\nActually later on when I was an adult my parents actually got excommunicated because there are so fundamental it's a and so I've been to sound by them for about five years a as a young woman and so that made me incredibly um strong in the end but also at the time incredibly heartbroken\nYeah this is this is tough stuff people don't realize you know when you make a decision for faith or whatever there are huge ramifications um you don't know what's going to happen you think you do you do what what is right and you don't know how your family will receive it well what happened after that you went to Harvard and you got involved in politics yeah\nSo uh so after I I I I basically skated my last year ... even though I I was in in the closet doubt or I\nGraduate I got my degree moved to Washington and became a political reporter for the hill politic how is the founding reporter at Politico covering Congress wrote editorials for Tony Brinkley at the Washington Times and then I went to Harvard got a full scholarship to study at the Kennedy School of government\nUh and that was right that he doesn't this policy and really got interested in economics and after that went to work in finance at Goldman Sachs and it Moody's a\nMention you're incredibly brilliant please go ahead\nWell I or that or I just have a hard time sitting still yeah yeah I think very thing probably vote for okay\nAnd then I I decided to come by my interest in passions in both finance and politics and a lunch bold\nAnd you've launched bold TV people want to look at both TV where they go\nSo they can check put your browser to W. W. W. dot bold B. O. L. D. dot global G. L. O. B. A. L. there's no dot com and they're stuck on the twentieth century\nBowl dot global okay All right so what happened that made you politically shift\nWell the thing is I I had always been a\nPretty conservative politically I'm ... and in fact I wrote editorials for Tony Brinkley who history or work for Newt Gingrich uh and then I you know as as people in their early twenties sometimes are I ah was a rebellious also I\nThat that and that's what makes it so tricky because I think that there are some Christians who would say I don't care or it's a different Jesus period case closed there are other people would say well\nGod looks on the heart and if you love Jesus\nUh if you really honestly love Jesus and ... you know your worshipping him in your heart then it's ... I guess I always look at the ... chronicles do you remember in there where there's this um there's this calorie means kind of like a Muslim and in his heart he's worshipping as one but he doesn't know the difference between cash\nAnd as one and when he sees as when he realizes this is who I have confuse it so it's interesting because some people get very theologically\nUm precise and ... so anyway I don't I don't want to go further into that just because we only have a a few minutes but you when you wrote this article\nYou're you're basically looking for an opening of Mormonism I have friends in the Islamic religion thing the same thing like we need to be open otherwise what you know we become hide bound and dead and we can't even uh we can't even decide what we believe because if you have to question people to shut up\nAnd of course that happened to the Catholic Church you know about five centuries ago and I wrote a book about it but the last plant\nIn my op ed says that we need a Martin Luther for the Mormon church do ah\nBut I wasn't gonna wait around for that so I left that I actually went to a\nDifferent Christian churches in the DC area for about a year but I left for lots of reasons in part because I didn't I didn't have a direct relationship with God I was confusing religion with the relationship didn't realize that religion is what people do in a relationship with God does\nAnd where did you find that relationship\nI I just last year so that's a mad because they realize what had happened was I\nHad replaced my meaning in life with the gifts rather than they get rid of the guests and I thought that I Would find a deeper purpose in a deeper\nMeaning through public service because that was the here and now that is sacrificing myself for something that I knew for a fact because it's tangible at to me and I actually think that a lot of young people go through that too and and I think that\nThe you know the belief in government as a source of higher power or higher meaning I went to the Harvard Kennedy School of government that Kennedy said JFK in many ways became my ... you know assassinated and sacrifices himself and um I I\nMy my ... was small limited governor of of the conservative type a and then twenty sixteen happened and Trump happened and I was like that it\nMight be [laughter] so so much for your average\nFrom it but when he became president did you did you become part of the resistance are part of the the uh you know what\nNo I wasn't there part of their existence I was I was I said never Hillary I just could not at a policy level agree and for eight more years four more years of Obama type policies and so I Would Switzerland and that's and [laughter]\nBut I was never Trump or yeah I wouldn't say to people as all the reasons that Mitt Romney opposed Trump or the same reasons that I oppose Trump's right or the moral problems not having a track record to to uh to look at the ... the fact that he donated to Hillary he wasn't conservative enough for me right ah all those\nThey are now do you think with with the with the two Supreme Court nominations and the tax cuts would you say that he's more conservative than you thought\nOh absolutely what any delivered a so I'm I'm definitely\nOn the Trump train I plan to vote for him and twenty twenty or you know barring you know unforeseen\nAnd see the actual big one that I had a lot\nOf conservative and Christian friends who said who cares what he says he's not going to do it like you know he says you can do the Supreme Court he's going to nominate his sister hegemony whatever the\nAnd he said he's going to have to cut taxes he says and for some reason I thought well you could be right but I don't think so I was just something about the way he communicates I think he means this and so the fact that he uh got Gorsuch in and it looks like\nKavanaugh will get in and he did the tax cuts and he put the embassy in Jerusalem and he did all these things I thought wow he didn't have to do that you could get elected in and figure out ways not to do that\nUm and you know getting rid of the Iran deal a lot of stuff that he said he would do\nOr that he actually did or has at least try to do I I have to say many many people didn't vote for him because they said he's talking he's a big talker he'll say anything he needs to say uh and in those cases I Would say thank God he didn't\nRight absolutely and uh you know I I I've tried to take that as a tack of Jon Huntsman who former governor of Utah or he's also\n... embarrassed to China\nA well he was he was Obama's ambassador to China and now he's ...

president because he ran and twenty twelve remember he put his headquarters in Florida not in Utah even though he'd been the governor of Utah but he gave an interview saying things like\nHigh drama inspiration for many faith with which for the bleeding Mormon they ... they thought that was weeks off which is why they left Romney of her husband\nOh whoa popping ness oh don't say that yeah it it\nA good way though in a good way um but I guess um I I've always wanted to know what it was like to be Judy Garland and now I Know\nNow you know yeah OK so listen I'm over in this\nIn this hour first of all we got we got to announce again what we said in the previous hour we're doing a contest\nThat special contest mhm but before I announced the special contests where you can win a signed\nCopy of a Donald drain the swamp book and who doesn't want one of those they're gonna be collector's items okay now I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you how you can win one of those with the contest in just a minute but out and do you mind if I mentioned are friends that he'll\nSail for oh no please do this or I wanted to mention\nThem because ... there's the website that we have a set up specifically for listeners to this program it's my taxes\nFor Hillsdale dot com Hillsdale they when they educate the students are held because they don't take a penny a federal funds right which is a wild concept but it's like almost no colleges are able to do that they got on endowments\nSo they are genuinely free to teach about American style self government and liberty they they teach about American exceptionalism they teach their kids with the constitution means all the stuff\nThat not only is not being taught in many colleges today in most colleges I'm afraid to say what is actively being taught against Hillsdale their champions in this there's very few\nVery few colleges um that uh they don't understand these issues and teach these issues to their students but the reason we have a website set up my taxes for Hillsdale dot com is that they want\nTo teach these things to the whole world right now they want a everybody who's able to go to that website to accept what they're giving other students so the same professors\nTeach college courses that are available online for free these are the actual Hillsdale professors wearing the actual clothes that they were in the classroom that's not a joke\nSo if you're going to taxes for Hillsdale dot com you can find that other such good stuff\nTheir their their their champions that I had to say that All right so now we've got to talk about the contest mhm\nYou might know no please do something you needed to share with ... no I think the caveman contest is terrific\nOkay wait here's the thing that in order to get a signed copy of Donald drain the swamp we're going to make five available so this is only available for the first five people who do this a more people can do it but they can enter the contest but only five will order for the first five people\nWho dress up whether for Halloween or for all saints eve or whatever you want to call it for just to dress up\nA because not everybody celebrates Halloween because it's the satanic holiday obviously but here's the issue if you dress up in a costume at this time of year and send us a photo of you dressed up as Donald the caveman the first five people who send\nThose photos will get a signed copy of Donald drain the swamp so you can go to info at Eric my taxes dot com or you can go to our Web sites whatever however you get it to us um this'll be up to election day but the first five automatically get a signed copy of Donald brings a swamp\nAutomatic yeah automatic that's great but the best one\nAnd by the way you should probably be holding a copy of Donald drain the swamp a you know in in the photo I Would I Would recommend that but let me say that I'm\nThe best photo will get three signed copies of the book\nAnd everybody when we send a book we also send you a he's my caveman ... sticker and he's my caveman campaign button and those are big and beautiful there like three and\nA quarter inches across the really nice beautiful buttons or that they eat my caveman and the sticker at the same thing so we are we're saying that the first five people who do this is who gets a picture of them dressed in a costume or you can do it today and in fact I I wouldn't I Would rush because the the first\nFive that's it doesn't have the only jump all I get an automatic signed book\nBut the the winner the best photo of all and we'll get three sign books\nThree stickers three buttons ... at the first five just get one clear\nYeah I that's clear so find the caveman bathroom and get in there and change into your caveman colorized doom yes right\nUm uh so I guess I just wanted announced that 'cause 'cause it's Halloween it's fun and coal mine could be you know it's time to have fun and dressing\nUp as Donald a caveman as long as you don't do that in the wrong neighborhood you know where you where you could get a ... owned or something\nOr seeing a during the storm a label heads\nIn the in the United states of America that would be a really fun thing to do a follow wiener for a party or whatever it is so\nI just wanted to throw that out there good um I also\nAnd I say you want to talk about a hair in food\nOr no yes please do you you mentioned this and I ... off the welfare and I was like last night yeah go ahead [laughter] I\nUh I had dinner with Greg Laurie\nYeah the pastor Gregoire we've had him on the program ...

make as we know how much I loved jump from Iraq right\nYes light on Monday he's coming back on the shy no\nMonday we're going to Iraq back\nWe can't get enough of jumped Americans the best because

times get hurts last empire\nNow on line and wherever you buy books\nHave you ever seen a pest control spraying chemicals in your home it makes you wonder if they come and go so safe then why did I sit up and where the respirators I only to leave you to walk back in unprotected\nGet I I'm Scott from plugging pest free and I'm here to tell you there's a better way in an age where we now have the choice to drive electric cars\nYou too can electronically read your home or business of unwanted rodents and pass the answer is plugging pest free one hundred percent chemical free plug in pest ratio safest bet for your family and pets\nI mean look people like you and me who are Christians you know we believe in the devil we think Halloween is not a great thing to be celebrated we think we have a lot of use it a lot of people just think we're crazy but you know what we're entitled to her crazy views in America everybody's entitled to their view is whether you think it's crazy or you agree\nBut now we have the state saying not only don't we liked the way you think we're going to enforce it so you can't think that way so the idea that alliance defending freedom has to step up with its great lawyers and say we're going to have to go to court and this goes all the way to the Supreme Court when was it heard at the Supreme Court\nSo it was argued yeah go ahead go ahead Jack\nGo ahead no you go ahead okay it was like nobody I Know in December the fifth December the ...\nSince I was Seventeen so almost a year ago we went to Washington DC so the court Ruth ginsburg Gorsuch Kennedy Roberts both of them\nAnd it was seven or to let's be clear with the seven\nTo two decision Seventy two\nOkay now this is a big thing I Want to say this again are we in America need to understand this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court is not you know\nDivided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wrong and\nYou still have to fight these legal battle it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado gets this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp illegal\nBuilt this alliance defending freedom doesn't exist and somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and I'd say I'm\nBest part of my job is that we're able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue in front of Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding our whole person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the land suffering freedom do they do it for free and that is why I have you on the program right now because I Want my listeners to understand\nThat this most basic thing that will be happening all across America if we don't fight it because if there's no price to pay more and more people are going to try this kind of stuff that shut you down because they think you're a big it as I Want to say folks\nWe need you to help we have a matching goal if you go to my website ... attacks us talk dot com right now click on the banner we need you to help this is important we all got to pitch in folks this is this is a\nMrs for all the marbles or

marbles folks religious liberty in America [noise] kids under attack and you know what a you don't ask to the fight but if somebody attacks you have to defend yourself it costs a lot of money in legal fees\nAnd that's why we want to raise money for the alliance defending freedom they defended jak at the Supreme Court level and one seven to two so even the Supreme Court recognizes that shouldn't be a fight we we should really\nAre not have to take these things to the Supreme Court it's ridiculous it's clear and yet or you have to do it in the costs a lot of\nMoney so uh let me ask you then a Jack in ... when this uh this was over you win okay now we go around to most people think the whole thing's over but it's not\n[noise] right but very day that the United States Supreme court um those to the media that they were going to take like a back in two thousand Seventeen that very day it attorney here in Colorado about Google and they called my shop\nBeing asked to tell us to create a custom cake for that person Paco news so blue on the outside to celebrate a gender transition\nThan we form this person\nIn a way way way way way hold hold on jak hold on hold your horses you're not telling the whole story about\nOK what am I missing\nYou're are you missing you said that they wanted to put something on the top of the cake which was a pornographic image\n[noise] um as far as I Know on this case they just wanted to get to celebrate a gender transition his finger inside them not sure if we got as far as what would be on the top\n... but a ... am I getting something wrong I I read quite a bit about this that there was something about a a demonic figure in some pornographic thing\nYeah that's another one\nOkay well I forgive me [laughter] that's why I cut you off because I was like I Want to make sure that uh that we talk about that because I I was stunned\nWhen I heard about that so if you don't mind my ah interrupting the narrative we'll get we'll get back to the transition cake here but that if you don't mind telling me when did that happen was that right on the heels of what you're talking about here\nJak has already been in the six years we've got a ruling from the Supreme Court that state has got to stop 'em and so this is part of our strategy and all of that says asking\nThe federal court to dismiss all of this to dismiss this a formal complaint over the transition gender transition cake and to just let go jak go back to operating a shop doing what he loves doing which is to create incredible works of art there is kicked design\nYou how much baking you getting done [laughter] if you're constantly having to go to court and it's kind of nut\nYeah not enough food to yes stoking busy\nRight um my goodness I just uh it it is that a cat\nThat's a torture oh somebody watching the door of ... you know on a show and I\nDo have time to read and I'm rereading if you can keep it\nAll night or everybody should read it gosh\nThat's pretty incredible I got to tell you I ah I get so honored when I hear stuff like that you have no idea I mean the principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them\nBut I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know\nUm what it means to be an American and how precious it is and so what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberties the rarest thing\nAre really never had an a nation they'll Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have a both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happened in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um the thank you for um wherever and seeing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you or you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick this as we just said you did not pick as and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom\nWho knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now the Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so that's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all of the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this um said that jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again\nAnd that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is that can you say\nSo we're in the federal\nDistrict quarter Colorado and so kind of the the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but if not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court um but we're hoping that uh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado\nAnd and is it your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the Seventy ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nGas or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't\nBring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that ruling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law we think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court\nFound to be problematic and so I think that's a strong precedent um there were going to rely on and and hopefully the federal courts will look at that and say yeah this is too much hostility this is unconstitutional um and and dismiss Colorado's charges against jak for the gender identity cake\nWell I mean I Want to be clear ah for folks listening that you know Jack you're a Christian ... you're not an anti gay person you are a Christian with all that goes along with that so if somebody comes to you and says I'd like to bake a cake that says I hate gays because you're a Christian you would not make that cake either\nThat's correct and people with similar requests like I'm just not going to do that work on a God Jesus Christ in every way that again and I can't do that I Can't honor him making cakes or hateful or go against is teaching [noise]\nWell I Want people to hear that because you you hear so much um you know obviously we're living in a time where are the news is very confusing and people say things and it's not corroborated but it gets out there and\nAh people try to paint folks like you or me for that matter as a bigot and you think well not only am I not a big yet but I fight bigotry in my life I care about these things just as you do or we may differ on our definition of bigotry but we don't take these things lightly\nAnd there are hateful people out there and you're not one of 'em and by God's Grace I'm not one of 'em and I think people even saying we're talking about religious liberty this is not\nThe liberty to hate this is liberty deliver our lives according to the principles that we hold closest our hearts when we come back folks a few more minutes with

atmosphere good we agree there is no right to come to the United states neither is it a right to become a US citizen the same is true in virtually every other country on earth and yet there are those especially liberal Democrats who are fine with this nation being overwhelmed by foreigners\nNow why do you think that is there are several answers some cynical some political the political answer is that Democrats want to import voters sign them up for government programs and they'll always vote for Democrats\nThe cynical answer is for the left wants to change the nature and character of America instead of out of many one they want us to become out of one many multiple languages with English taking a back seat\nSpanish now seems to be the preferred language we're growing numbers among us with

little bit\nLet me fire up these phone lines for you right now because we've got to talk about this stupid package story right and we got to hop to it right now eight eight eight nine seven ones age eight eight eight nine seven one stage Larry Elder dot com for all things Larry even with the filling guys are here\nAnd if there's something you want to shoot me via Twitter at Mark Davis M. A. R. K. Davis that's another whole show to take boys over there but this is the one that that I liked the best one that involves you calling us when we're here on me Larry Elder show eight eight eight nine seven one said\nWhy do they call it the stupid a package Bob strikes\nThe story at its core\nIs very serious anytime someone sends\nAn incendiary device you are a real bomb fake bombs on that looks like a bomb an attempt to scare to kill somebody or just scare somebody it it is a terrible terrible crime right so let's just stipulate that it's terrible and by the way who else said that well that would be President Trump all day yesterday\nAnd it wasn't quite enough\nIt wasn't quite enough for a punitive media culture that seeks to milk this an opportunistic media culture that seeks to take advantage of this and make it seem like it Trump's fault\nThe reasons CNN got targeted is because Trump called them fake news\nAre you know Hi this is ridiculous and this is going to backfire because there is obvious and proper empathy for anybody that they get a a a bomb or something that looks like a bomb in the mail or dropped off by a courier\nThe people on this target list you can either Clinton's the Obamas Eric Holder Joe Biden Robert Deniro these people make my church\nBut I don't want to get a bomb in the mail no these are birds that does and then this episode the president was saying exactly the right things and so what have we been treated to in the last twenty four hours well he didn't call him he didn't call the Clinton called the Obamas just to let them know hey we got this\nKind of stupid idea is that what Bill Clinton doesn't know how much I Wonder if I got older they called me I just wonder if they got out of doing that are going to give other bugs Trump even though we're doing\nJust stop it ... this is what makes the story stupid in the hands of today's media a pretty serious cut and dried story a ... scary devices center the mailed of evil becomes needlessly\nAmped up into you know welcome to twenty Eighteen where a media culture that has poisoned discourse a million times worse than President Trump ever has or ever could\nIs now winding its finger at him well wagging its finger at us and they're very daring to tell us how to speak and how to act part of a crazy\nNow is the president United States\nHave brash sharp elbows to plain spoken refusing to kind of guy in terms of a communication skill and so literally\nDoes that ruffled some feathers from time to time yes it does has he done a couple of things that even made me go oh sir you're killing me a little here yes All right so let's stipulate that\nBut for jihad handy in part to hedge your just to just the discourse in America is a is is tainted because of it\nAnd most specifically because he's come after them with the fake news accusation and I know the one they liked the trundle out more often than any other\nHe called us the enemy of the people is everybody's stupid I'm I'm just asking is everybody\nShooting\nBecause that's simply not true the enemy of the people comment was leveled at\nCorrupt dishonest journalism which is rampant at CNN and in more than a few other buildings I had to struggle\nI mean very serious story but but obviously but but this morning and all the coverage was well the packages had been received by several key Democrats\nYou know the Obamas the Clintons\nNoted noticed you know it was a your ears ... W mess up my own story the packages received by several key Democrats and CNN like they need to be separated out of the list of the Democrats sorry I digress I'm\nIn the midst of of all of his hand wringing\nIf the president has at times dropped the fake news moniker on people it's because they totally did\nTrump is a racist fake news he insulted all Mexicans is fake news\nThey may crap up because they hate his guts the fake news accusation is one hundred percent deserved to\nGet argue all day over whether that's a tone you want the president take whatever that is stylistic side show choir we are in a bit I'll tell you one ... ugly bubble there you go [laughter] but I'll tell you what ah [noise]\nI'll tell you what is absolutely true and that is that the media culture that hate his guts\nCall it a racist every day the other day the president was just down the highway for me in Houston at the at the rally for Ted Cruz that made people's heads exploded I Love it [noise] um and he said the ... and I am a nationalist I Am America First country first\nAs opposed to a global as a stride do\nLittle to making sure the world is okay and we're but one called the wheel of the world\nNow I'm a nationalist he said I put my country first my nation nation nationalist get hit nationalist rather than\nGlobal list you know some people didn't get it but I totally got up and they just may do well and there was Jim Acosta here's a here's a prince\n... donors president I'm just one was just wondering if if you knew that when you were talking about being a nationalist was that a dog whistle was that kind of a wink and a nudge to Nazis to white supremacist was it a reference to white nationalism\n\nCNN the people who are lecturing us today about how a president ought to talk\nAnd so dripping from all of this ridiculous asinine coverage today maybe Trump will take this occasion to dial back his rhetoric really maybe the media will take a minute to dial back virulent hatred of him how about that for an idea let's see how that works\nBecause I'll tell you something if the media start to cover him with a modicum of fairness he probably won't kick him quite so often\nThe concept of what a concept [noise] so let's talk about some um\nMystery package stories today [noise] we've got to figure out what to do with a caravan got to figure out here they come\nUp but I guess I guess who's coming to meet him but\nAnd you'll find out that it's people who just wanted to spark sympathy for the synagogue and make people to God Nazis are everywhere\nThis happens all watch now\nDo we know this is the case here do we know that this is the left doing this\nOrder and false flag whatever you want to call it a hoax wherever you want to call it to divert attention from the terrible things that liberals are pre ... doing the leftist provable doing on camera\nIs this just only games or a judge in Canada and an opportunity to springboard best into waving a finger at Trump and blaming him for the whole thing is this just a sinister hopes\nDo we know this no we don't know anything about ... so stop pretending are saying that you know than it is\nHowever is it okay for you to wonder about it of course it is is it okay for you to wait\nFor actual facts to come in before jumping to the conclusion that everyone wants you to jump do you bet you can with my blessing and I told the audience this morning\nI Will believe that this has a right wing terrorists when we have a right wing terrorists handcuffed and in custody until then\nGame on wide open anything's possible let the game come to me\nBecause I I have no idea what's going on here and either you authorities are going to work on it let's wait for them to do so right there in Fort Worth more high Mark Davis in Larry how you doing\nGood\nI'm going to talk about that the bathtub I ever had a comment about what will carry mhm\nOh no no I I watch a lot of people in the morning and stuff I don't you read like a Fox yeah she looks like a conservative can do what the hell garbage she said she lost her job\nRight here's here's here's my thought it was just dumb for her to think that it's okay for white people to walk around and black face my dog knows that's not okay\nAnd the reason it's not okay is there was a really bad there's there's ... there's really bad history of of because they just didn't want to employ black actors they took quite actors made them you know minstrel up with black faces and\nBig wide eyes and red lifted that terrible racist legacy that makes it not okay for anybody to go is Diana Ross Emmett Smith right but I Love black people I'm going to do this it's a bad idea now so maybe you didn't know that and that was a man I'm almost done Megan didn't know that that was a moment for but ... but is it a\nDeath penalty offense I think the shit out of that was maybe let rolling mind sharp in ... for an hour or whatever it takes and then everybody get on with their lives does anybody think making racist but of course she's not\nSo what about you take us out\nOr whatever they weren't that many ... I I grew up in their\nRight I think probably about thirty ... actually I don't go there but I grew up on my back without proper term that ... seconds a lot of the history go ahead\n[laughter] I'm Around you know up yeah they have they broke our law but I don't want to die and\nThat would have been stood there would've been stew why they would have been stupid it would have been stupid\nYou know it would have been too but it would have been too I mean I\nI mean for me was the Nineteen sixties it was like a friend who said hey I'm going as a you know Frederick Douglass no you're not you

are not going to lose the house to Eighteen is what the Democrats need or the Republicans means what anybody needs to have a majority in a house full of four thirty five so to aging in one more than half is what you've got to have\nI think when we're done we are going to have about two hundred and twenty three two hundred twenty four Republicans about four or five a margin and that that's enough to keep man see below sea or some other Democrat from becoming speaker and I believe this because there was a red meat shed\nA red beach added we've established post cabinet post caravan\nA red beach
