little bit law have great song from hot chocolate love that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done this far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... supports the government over the individual and he sitting on a Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority it's assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in the land and fine I'm okay with that but then we attribute it powers it does not have a forty does not have it for granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the\nPerson up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans are going to cheer for him and back him why\nBecause the left doesn't like them and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\nThink about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left with the right can we agree on something and let let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes shoot a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes should a white man should a\nHispanic man should uh and would go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense unfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to use those honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism is the bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the left is supposed to be deemed black right I began this whole program I made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way I support\nA person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where\nRepublicans don't and what is sad or we've seen Republican and Democrat lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not the Texas Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen them come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open Gary and he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile black people\nAnd Republicans do other Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile by people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target\nBlacks yeah blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats\nAnd Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney who basically supported Obama cure light\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be were accepting things we don't want or don't believe do I have any liberal pardon me do I have any liberal Democrat black men out there who think that the government should have a right to profile black man\nHow many Republicans do I have out there how many liberty minded the liberty by the guy's going to say oh no man\nEveryone has a right\nTo be safe and secure in their persons in effect but that's where we're lacking do do that just called one dude you already forget that my like eighties throwback kind of deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a focus on liberty because we have our vision has become myopic because of this left right fight\nGuys let's support let's get on one page and say we can support and respect liberty for each other\nLet's use that liberty one of God's greatest gifts to man and he's given us a lot

direction others at all became about social justice let me tell you something William Wilbur force was not about social justice the way we see it today\nAnd sometimes people who have good hearts and

screaming about it on this program because it's important to do with the Bible says but the Bible doesn't say that people since the beginning of time I miss understood scripture so it's really important that you take the responsibility to understand what it says and does and doesn't say and I really think that a lot of sweet young people have been swayed and pulled\nLeft towards you know hashtags social justice because they missed understand what it says of course we're supposed to be compassionate but the question is how\nAnd I I have to say with Kanye West or you know appearing to praise this president for his policies a lot of young people are thinking\nYou know what maybe we have been getting it wrong maybe Donald Trump's policies are compassionate maybe the policies of the people who talk about compassion are not compassionate and I really think we have to think\nFor ourselves you can't just when somebody says that we believe in compassion we believe in helping the poor doesn't mean they're doing it and this is the thing is that if you want to destroy your future and if you don't want to help the poor and then you float along with the socialists tied but the fact that evangelicals are being very cynically drawn into this\nUh it's just so good to have you wind up to wake people up to understand that a huge effort has been made it's been going on since the Obama administration and before two thousand and eight in two thousand twelve\nOr I mean you know that for a fact don't you\nI Do and I think it's time for all Americans to\nLook past words\nLike progress that actually read grass and compassion that's not come patch and we have to Jesus said you know the ... you know the tree by the fruit and so American evangelicals dot com we tried to make the case\nThat biblical truth is the highest love for human beings and for cultures it's on loving to pay the ... global at social engineers people suffer and you know open borders are less loving than

Dutch Michigan people and they will not tell you the truth and say for example hey that's not funny but he had come to New York for that you should play double Dutch too so ha ha\nHa ha or be twice as much when you said yeah exactly and the double decker bus so we can we can sing that later but let me ask you when you came to New York when did you have a plan or you're just going to come here and you know I had NO PLAN\nI actually didn't have any I Would I was just like I'm gonna do whatever it takes to try to get into at least break into somebody's comedy clubs sort of comic strip law which I think is due around are you there for some\nWould divert club I was able to finally break into it was so hard to get into his club they used to have an open Mike on Tuesday nights in a broken did you have accomplices or you just did that on your own oh cool I'm I've been I was going to do the jokes are just too and I tell you something let me tell you something pal\nI lean opening ongoing throughout the that are actually I'm a lawyer to anybody's where were you when you broke into the club ... what happened tell us the story sort of where to get into these clubs on Tuesday nights they have a ... an open Mike\nBy seven PM comedians who are new in town start lining up at like six o'clock in the morning wait a minute really know for like ... they have this whole honor system where you got Fifteen minutes to go to Russia to me afterwards like you would really hard\nTo find them I turned to perform and it's in in this community named George Wallace walks here who you probably know I Know George Wallace awesome to George Wallace won the legend elect for why\nWhy do they have like a legend there when it's supposed to be tryouts for young comedians\nWhere it's open Mike not in any legend like George ... whoever can show up whenever they want to take you to the curb exactly in um next and he walks in\nAnd I know I'm about to get bumped into managers already walking over to me but this is actually where God shows up for the first time in my life\nWell this is where I noticed a yeah sort of managers says to me hey uh George ... do you want to go before him or [noise] I think you want to go before I'm just guessing Lulu and you don't want a journey to crush it and then you've got to go back away\nSo I go on stage and I got New Yorkers laughing but not only is are they laughing he comes in and he laughing to\n... and everybody knows George Wallace never laps and well if it's funny okay yeah so he says to me after the show there's a bunch comedians are all around them and they're um they're asking questions and he leaves him and he walks over to me and he said you know what you're funny I was like wow bank to news like in your clean\nHe was like let me ask you questions like why don't you curse\nYou know I don't know if my grandmother walking or something like what the truth is is earlier in my life I made a deal with a buddy ray we will encourage anymore I don't know nothing about Jesus nothing about do you have this point in my life and we just made a deal if you heard me courage she gave me a ... as hard as you want it to and vice versa and this was at fourteen years old which is kind of stuff\nThat's kind of amazing is really amazing well 'cause you know and I know that in comedy the cheapest laugh you get is by you know dropping F bomb it on your there just does something\nAnd almost every comedian goes there ... there's no barrier like you just keep going just gets dirty or and dirtier nastier nastier interview for some reason yeah\nShe's ready to boost God just send me a really but the fact that even the fact that that uh he noticed that and said that\nHe says to him and he said the fact that your point and clean I Love

strip\nWe'll hook you up Jerry um well well it is interesting to me that Seinfeld as always were clean and it's a lot of times people would ask him are you a question when he kind of kept the look on a specific no but she just like you say a lot\nOf people remain you actually ... is that what you meant\nOr a yeah poker or something you know I never asked him that people I Know that he has got he's

then it will go a little deeper where you're not expecting me to go\nAnd I know for a fact you're not that deep so let's see what happens while I was sort of way\nComedy works his first there's a set up and then there's a post on your set up is when a comedian will use of talent and resources the season the opportunity to ensure that the audience is moving in the same direction would oppose ... changes that direction in a way they're not expecting\nWhen they catch on to that change they received the punch line results are revelation fulfillment of joy express through laughter\nNow the in life it's very similar versus the set up\nAnd then there's a punch line you're set up is your town your resources your opportunities that you're married you got car at his radio show your set up is about what you've received and everybody knows are set up with your punch lines about what you call to deliver\nAnd not everybody understands that the punch line is and we don't know your punch line and you know you're set up you make a mistake\nAnd you realize something's missing and you think what you need is more set up [noise] just get a car if I could just get married if I could just get more and more and more what you really need to know is what is your punch line and just like me as a child struggle more reading even your setbacks are part of your set up\nSo you can deliver the punch line you're called delivers kind of like a slingshot further you've been set back the further you can reach but the question is what are you going in for\nYou have obviously thought this through this is not just something this is not off the cuff just to see this should be a Ted Talk is what they should be\nYeah so this is kind of what is so ... so this is the thought process behind the more than a funny movie hidden things October Eighteen because at the end of it uh there's a really\n... yoga for we go there we go there too but when you're talking about God using humor was a hundred

really Rick Warren has gone through some tough times right now yeah you to buy his\nBut I'm working on the purpose driven laugh ... book um ... I Am looking at best so he gave you a book so he told me to read this book called the humor of the Christ\nAnd if you ever get a chance to win who wrote that I don't know if you ever get a chance to read this book don't because it's really hard to read how ever\nTo be a point now how both the likelihood the high likelihood to use actually used the rate up hilarious yeah yes no joke Camacho lately like I knew I Know but because we know the end of the story people assume yeah it wasn't funny\nBut as you read the Bible not read it I see the funny in there all day long\nI mean it's just right there even just throughout the Bible or when a Abraham decided the hero circumcised his whole house like what are the conversation at our website uh-huh\nThey're like OK I changed my name and you argue certainly they will you change the name I don't know you put them sort of known what you're talking about like ...
