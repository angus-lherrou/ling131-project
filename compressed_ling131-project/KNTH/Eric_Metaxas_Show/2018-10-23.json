{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "\nOh right yes I'll let the music run a little bit lie is great song from hot chocolate love that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done this far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority it's assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in a land and fine I'm okay with that but then we attribute it powers it does\nNot have a forty does not have and we granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the person up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans\nAre going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like them and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\nThink about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left with the right can we agree on something and let let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no I'm voting yes should a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself\nYes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we could go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to use it does have honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as the bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we half past\nHave been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the left is supposed to be team black right up again this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way\nI support a person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is sad or we've seen Republican and Democrat lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not to take this Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen 'em come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open Gary and he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile by people\nAnd Republicans Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profiled black people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue now that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yep blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats\n\nAnd Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\n\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney who\nBasically\nSupported Obamacare lite\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be worst accepting things we don't want or don't believe\nDo I have any liberal pardon me do I have any\nDemocrat by men out there who think that the government should have a right to profile black man how many Republicans do I have out there how many liberty minded limited by the guy's going to say oh no man\nEveryone has a right\nTo be safe and secure in their persons in effect but that's where we're lacking do do that just kind of one dude yeah I did alright forget that's my like a throwback kind of deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a focus on liberty because we have our vision has become myopic because of this left right fight\nGuys let's support let's get on one page and say we can support and respect liberty for each other\nLet's use that liberty one of God's greatest gifts demand and he's given us a lot but one of the greatest God's greatest gifts\nLiberty\nThe right to make own decision you're listening to file

I'm In an hour to we have a lead Habib but I I just said I'm dying as you're all weekend long I've been dying to share this with my radio audience\nThe Elton John concert I I don't have any words that you can describe what happened it was insane can I can try\nAt least at least two All right\nUm I uh\nI went to the ... and John concert I was invited by\nThe bass player for Elton John which itself is lunacy like the bass player felt when John is a wonderful Christian who read my books and he invited me so I just about painted I've shared that I'm a program like I couldn't believe it so I I go a with a friend of mine and we went to the concert\nAnd this this sweet bass player he kind of acts like he's a big nobody he's the bass player from John he's such a sweet humble guy Matt Bissonnette he takes us around he introduced us\nThe guys in the band they they'd been in the band since Nineteen Seventy and Seventy one the the um the bass player de Murray passed away years ago but we met that guitarist\nA David Johnstone to do it as a ledge and you see him you know who he was and then ... will also in the drummers since Nineteen Seventy these guys if you watch like old documentary Johnny see these guys they look like you're Eighteen years old now they're like you know older men\nBut it was such a mind blower but it it gets crazy are you ready for this are you ready\nGo go All right\nDon't sound that excited are you okay I don't know why haven't I don't want me I'm very excited I'm In New York yeah\nIt is and I'm In ... no no not I went\nI went to the ... so then uh the Baker says hey let's go to the people are maybe we'll see some like be easier right and I thought yeah that was like what a concept who who's going to be at the John VIP around like I don't know maybe a bumper to Hillary Clinton no joke she and bill had been there the night before because they were to concerts in Madison Square garden so I dodged the bullet\nAnd we get to the VIP loud and I look around I don't see anybody then\nA woman comes up to me and says your air attacks this and I said uh I'm In the\n... and John ... Madison Square garden I don't expect somebody to know who I Am in that world right right she comes up to me she goes she loves my books she met my wife in Texas He's from Texas she's here with her two daughters are like and what does it in seeing what what is going on [laughter] somebody came up to me and they and they said well we're from Dallas and we're here\nBecause our friend Heather top and I said what wow she says the our other top and yeah well some people listen to this no already what I'm about to say right Ernie top and\nIs the man who has written the lyrics to every single Elton John song since the sixties the guy is a legend on par with Elton John mhm so his wife evidently\nInvited these people and so they bring her over and I meet the white burning top I'm about to me because this is really like it to people who know who he is\nIt doesn't get bigger right like wow I'm about the and yeah and his what\nHis wife is a Christian and she\nKnows my books and she was all excited to meet me I said I'm dreaming it's just like a joke this is somebody spiked my punch\nShe then takes us to meet her husband Bernie talk and\nYou had told me that I wouldn't eat Bernie top and I would never believe you because this guy is just I mean it was it\nWas such an honor and obviously the the concert was was phenomenal but the ... the whole thing was was was just amazing and then I had to race from there like I'm some big shot suddenly ... race or Matt to Fox News where I got into kind of a rhubarb with Juan Williams\nYeah yeah I saw that a ... ... it was ugly up and you saw it I saw it you know I Do speak out when he got my backup he said some stuff\nThat I thought wait a second\nThat's ... you can't really believe that Juan Williams you know when he said he said he says well he says this president has nothing to run on and I thought he can make you despise this president which you're right as an American but you can't say he's got nothing to worry about that\nThat is crazy right so I kinda got my backup anyway it was it was just it it it it was nuts and it got even crazier from there because you know\nA ... after that my my book went to the top one hundred that Donald drain the swamp book and so anyway I just I I I'm all excited about this and I had had a shared I Am I'm getting at the school girl is that wrong\nSo am I Am I [laughter] what kind of Portland Seattle okay go ahead anyway\nSo I'm In Fresno ... to ... this afternoon or the night I'm flying back to Los Angeles um\nI spent time with Victoria Jackson that was I was mentioning it was just the most wonderful time at world outreach a church people are excited about the Donald drain the swamp looked like you never know when you write a book on until you know because it's a kids' book people don't know me as a writer of a kids' books are funny stuff but it's a kind of a fable\nFor all ages this is this is my take away as I talked to people it's like they they they're excited because it's a fable that explains\nIt in effect why we should vote for Donald Trump in the midterms like basically it's so simple even child could understand that\nYes [noise] yeah I Am and why we have to keep the Republicans in control because it's going to well I mean exactly\nAnd it was even even at Johns America that even if you hate your the Republican congressman the problem is you know the the the the pitch\nIs so surreal in the culture right now in in Washington DC that if we don't hold Congress which we probably won't unless everybody everybody\nRight well that was the other one is ... ... ... yes got\nOne one was saying like acting like oh no no it's a president who's a uncivil here and it's like you were saying why wouldn't you you're you're kidding me you know you witnessed it yourself to see how people were like oh I\n... it's like is what I'm saying it's like there's this you know they call it gas lighting like somebody like that that's something like that you look at them like wait a second\nI Know for a fact that not only not true that's crazy talk but it's almost like he had this talking points and he just has to kind of put it out there\nBut it it actually offended me because I thought that is so not true it's not it's it's beyond the point of view we're at a point now where you're playing games with America that's not right if you're going to disagree disagree on the merits anyway\nYeah thoughts will probably never helped me back oh and I I just\nHave to say that um you know it was a it was an honor to uh to get to do that and listen you know I don't want to forget this before we go to a ... even though I'm all the way in Fresno, California\nWe are still doing a and I'll I'll say that so you don't have to help and I we're still doing a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom and we are I'm embarrassed to say this we're way behind\nA you know we we kind of when you do something like this you say well we think we can raise this much 'cause our

a that a website as much taxes talk dot com this is actually so important maybe part time after pastor Jeffress interview I'll get into the details on this but this is such an important thing\nUm I I

thought God was finished with him he spent six months alone by the work carrots and then two years with a widow and yet\nDuring that waiting time God taught a larger some in valuable things\nYou know we want to move from one big thing that the next big thing from a big failure to a big success many times God's calls a time out and I say in this chapter waiting on God's timing waiting time\nDoesn't have to be wasted time if we're learning the lessons God wants us to learn because many times God's not only working in our life he's working someplace else we can even say they're preparing for our next big thing and so really learning to wait on God is another secret for an extraordinary life\nWhile I loved that we're going to go to a break folks\nAh I ah have the pleasure talking to Dr Robert

I\nDidn't think it was God's will for children to be burned on an open sacrifice to the gods of bail and the ... he didn't think it was right for the people of Israel to be worshipping bail instead of Jehovah so he decided to be an influence in as culture and that's what we talk about it and how you can do that in this chapter\nSlow I Love it because I think that feeling that there's something you can do\nEven if it's a small thing to take a to take seriously the idea that God didn't put you on this earth just do exist but to do something and that doesn't mean that the goal of our life should be to do something to the number one bowl or a life of course is to be connected\nThing we could ever think of like okay I'm going to surrender and go to Africa and living a hug now you know why people who are missionaries go to Africa or China or wherever and live as missionaries it because that's what they want to do\nRight they would be miserable doing anything else God uses desires and passion ting gifts to give you his direction\nPull that there's there's so much in just this now I'm just curious because it's so humorous to me so at age five you said you were on TV and and the TV production bug beat you at age five that's very funny most five year olds\nDon't even know what TV production is I I just discovered about three years ago myself what the heck production is how is it that first of all you do it on TV at age five\nOh I hate to tell you I was playing my accordion on the Mr ... show the big\nShow we're in the Dallas Fort Worth area can almost I was kind of a similar semi regular on the mystery that permit\nTo that is so cute guy could scream are you kidding me and\nMy first number ... downtown remember ... ... yeah yeah yeah\nWe we play that we played on this program all the time I'm not joking that's part of my bumper music or when you heard it\nMentioned up up in the way that was the very first concert I ever went to in high school here in Dallas at the memorial auditorium a fifth dimension\nKnock uranium race you are not kidding I Love it I Love and also the idea of you I mean 'cause most people obviously they've seen on Fox News whatever the idea of you as a cute as a bug five year old playing your accordion on the Mr temperament show is there is that available on YouTube that is the cutest thing I've ever tried to\nKill or trying to find and destroy all copies that may be and exist\nThat is so cute I cannot even believe that at age five you were doing that that's a restive and what what's the song you played\nA downtown I think\n[laughter]\nIt's so cute I cannot get over it that is incredible I I Want to see this but so you were your parents obviously pushed you to do this or or or it allowed you to do this and you you did it and you're telling me that uh did you do more TV after that it was at it\nYeah yeah I did I did more I did that kind of you know growing up in the actual ... and uh make my money go into high school and college doing weddings and bar mitzvah was and everything else you got played in some places I probably shouldn't have played a and\nYou know it's just yeah I can I can play ... broken make tears come down\nHere [laughter] well I Know the accordingly huge in the sixties and and a lot of kids play the accordion it's not the ... you don't\nSee too many kids do that today but you're telling me you were on the Mr peppermint show I we didn't have that where I grew up so I'm just I'm kind of ... it sounds so cute but so you something about that\nKind of got into you and what I find interesting too when you talk about the way God makes people you didn't think oh I Want to be on TV you thought I don't want to be a TV producer we have just an amazing thing for a little kid to be thinking about that\nDrowned and and you know again the idea of broadcasting that's very important part of our ministry and the way we reached people and the business aspect you know it's hard to be a pastor without having\nSome a business training and business ... and our particular situation here in Dallas First Baptist Dallas\nI mean you know we just did a hundred and thirty five million dollar new campus and it's very complex a financial operation and again I think God put that in person and those are made because he knew what he was preparing me for\nThe kids got his doing that in every Christians live he's given those unique interest and passions and gifted this to fulfill his eternal purpose\nBy living on TALK of before we go I just want to see real quick how do we how was it the God spoke to you when you were Fifteen about being a preacher I'm just fascinated with this you know I can\nPoint to that was the second friday June Nineteen Seventy one at eleven fifty five AM in the morning now people say what was it an audible voice I say no it was louder than that but it was an unmistakable call a God that I was going to be a pastor and entertain that moment when I say OK or yes that is what I'm\nGoing to do that comes for everybody wants to have that extraordinary life we have to say yes lord\nWell I just love it a folks the book is choosing the extraordinary life got seven secrets for suggest and significant and my final question we just got ... seconds left where were you when that happened because I'm always curious when people say God spoke to me were you in church where you at home\nI was actually a youth camp but not singing around the campfire ... body on holding hands and all of that it was actually the moon's surface the preacher had been up preaching I wasn't listening to a thing you would say\nReally God was speaking to me and they sounded the bell for the service to be over and everybody to run to get in line and the lunch line and everybody running past me as I was walking between that old Tabernacle where we met and they'll watch uh area\nI mean is I was walking God spoke to me\nVery clearly going to do that with every body

Stutzman 'em out but I Know I Know you remember her story\nWhat over on the phone with us she owns a flower shop in Washington state right and she met her flowers out with a long time customer right who happened to be\nGay and she declined I might might say politely to use her full artistry but this man's same sex wedding she felt uncomfortable right well the the customers initially were were fine with it but then the state attorney general\nYou know when I was growing up in Jersey my grandfather was just silly and just to show you the people are like shoppers they three things matter to a little bit of land so they can have a vegetable garden work\nAnd church family I mean for things and and that's it so why go Teaneck at the time of my grandfather was there a Leo New Jersey where he bought a little two acres back what it was far away and the New Jersey has the courage to grow up in a small town\nAnd surely changed what what I was from what I was ... young for when I was older changed in fundamental ways\nAnd I went to University of Virginia law school and I was the first time I was in the show\nAnd then a friend of mine took me to Oxford ... old mess and I said this may be one of the most beautiful towns in America I may one day have a family here and I do\nIt's a ... now by the way does your wife know about this\nActually she's in Mississippi and so she knew\nOh you mean you have a family there with your with your wife 'cause sometimes ... with\nMy wife she literally ... area I think um but she loved many of the virtues of small ...\nThan I was just concerned you're one of those people that you know you were living to live your living a lie basically and I thought he's got a family in Oxford, Mississippi and his wife doesn't know about it if she hears about it on this program ... cook so you're telling me that you only have one wife in one family thank God okay\nWell ... as much as I remember\nAs much as you right now [laughter] now at least he usually when you mentioned it's so funny when you think about Sicily and then you mentioned documents to be I Can't think of two worlds in my mind that are more different when I think of William Faulkner and when I think of Sicily it's just like you know and and yet\nUh I get what you're saying it's very interesting ... uh ... Mississippi is one of the few states in the union that I still have not visited her spoken in I think I've spoken almost all of them in the continental us I have never yet spoken to Mississippi now when I'm\nSure to Mississippi ... speaking you come down and spend a couple of days broadcast you'll you'll broadcast I shouldn't it is the finest space in America to broadcast in which is our studio I and I think you'll understand not only the premise of my answer but\nThe substance of the show which is fault they're always write about ... light right and it was what Detroit ... written about cities and more than ... than should have written about the prairie\nWell it's it's kind of funny because when you describe it sounds it really does sound so beautiful and I love the south anytime I go to the south I feel like all Americans on some level or are from the south you know there's just something about just so American it's a lot more American than appeals to live in Manhattan\nSo I Would love to take him in and visit you and I I Want to talk to you today about anything you've written a lot of articles you do first of all tell folks\nUm what American I'm a ... what our American stories as you talked about on this program before but tell us again because this is a big part of your life and I am just fascinated with it\nWell I you know Eric I I've always thought that if you don't know your own story that is your family story\nOr your country story why bother travel a lot of people in Europe I've been here and now I go but the you know yourself right beer or your own you know your own country I worked for anyone in my family from going overseas until they travel cost across across our great country\nWhy not showing a great place to stay in their own country it's a little bit the premise of our American story to ship all\nThe great stories to tell about this country great events great people often people cause even sometimes events just happened\nBut who or what was our character what's our national character about what is this the American exceptionalism well we don't use those words we just tell stories and their stories about sports the arch a history a cherry street is this history a ... and yeah I mean\nWhen you walk away from our show or ... hours a night to go wow what a beautiful a great country we live in what courage stories we have that law\nDoesn't want to choke great stories about America wants to do every band story about America so they tell it streets to created by the way they were bad things that happen in America and segregation was one of ... what the original sin of the country\nBut but those aren't the stories writer I'd like to tell the stories that NPR doesn't show that's really what we're doing this or this or American like different people making this American Life really love their country\nAnd how do people find a you your I mean I'm I'm Sorry how do people find our American story time and they find it\nAt this point you can just type it in a Google Search would come right up to the top of our American story there where you are and we have overlapping hundred hours\nAnd you can build a category so we had everything from ... we do what we now Eric it's amazing people send us in their final thoughts about their loved ones and every once in a while we do it you'll see about a famous person it all started ... armored died\nAnd a friend of my calling from Pittsburgh and sadly Jack Nicholas is your to your own little Palmer\nIs going to make you cry I called up the Palmer family estate I said can I use that if you have that happen to have the skills to it's written stills you'll see Arnold Palmer\nWould make you cry and laugh at the same time that show something that we know what you gee every week uh we do it at this day and history every day we do leadership segment once a week we do it in American Dream is Jacqueline once a week\nAnd we do a lot of stories of the audience is setting and to us and we shouldn't play produced so our audience is actually the store a partial star of our shows\nWhy I just love this um so if people go to to Google and type in our American stories this stuff will come up I just want to make sure people are going to find you at all and all that stuff we're talking about okay what if some of the stories we can talk about things that are going on right now you um\nYou you wrote a story called the great Chicago recovery uh can we talk about that because I don't know anything about that\nWell you know everybody knows the great Chicago fire and that happened in October ... Eighteen Seventy one and people will show to know that it was a cow and a lot of theories about what started the fire really started the fire which at Chicago had grown from a little town of about\nThree thousand Thirty years to count of three hundred thousand trains that started the the the manufacturing in America it started and it was suddenly moving to Chicago and they moved in so fast it's such a volume make do with all these buildings were building codes whatsoever\nAnd they were all built out of that on one particular arid October day\nWere when these homes were filled with would want to create fire in the winter for no which just destined to happen at a third one thirty one third of the city to the ground there were a hundred thousand homeless Chicagoans the banks all burned to the ground the retailers will er into the ground\nAnd yet the story of the Chicago recovery which\nIs what I had to write about because it only a few years the city was built and there was no Illinois emergency management and there was no federal emergency management I almost nobody had insurance so for me the story was how they act Chicago to it and the day when there was no one to turn to the fellow Chicago\nWell first of all you know when you talk about a fire the great fire in Chicago it's hard for us to believe in this day and age\nHow fires devastated major cities I mean this was a normal thing practically I mean New York was devastated a number of times I mean the great a Chicago fire of course is really the most famous but\nA ... ... it is interesting to think that that's not something we deal with very much we don't say oh you know Philadelphia is on fire and the whole city is going to burn down but in the nineteenth century this happened when we come back on TALK to you more about that folks I'm Talking to lead a beep\nYou can go to our American network dot org and find out our American stories our American networked outward this is the taxes show stick around\n[noise]\nIsn't about my friend just about everybody suffering from the government can come in and tell you what to do like to think what you have to choose between your life and when you're saying we don't live in a free America\nThat he's ...

I'm guilty of you know all the stuff that that week we think is bad right I mean big government a bloated bureaucracy New York's the center of the moral on that I mean we had a reprieve under Giuliani a little bit\nBut basically ... under the new mayor or the Blasio we're we're we're we're getting dragged back\nInto that there are street people everywhere beggars in the subways are on the subway platforms everywhere you go\nA that's going on and so you have Trump\nReally made his bones so to speak a ... in New York so what is fascinating to me that and then he understood why it's bad just because he was here which actually brings us to Chicago I mean here we are talking about the rebirth of Chicago after the Eighteen Seventy one fire and it's really a absolutely a\nA a testament to entrepreneur entrepreneurship or to the American spirit\nOr to to the American can do attitude\nAnd yet Chicago today is you know one of the worst cities in America for for many reasons I mean there are many wonderful things about Chicago but it is really struggling right now I mean there's a tremendous irony there and it's very sad\nIt is that it got captured by public employee pension unions right so that debt which no one can repay has nothing to do with the American ... character it has to do with rewriting\nAnd extortion right and so what what got lost over time and what monsters always do whether they work for the government for the mob is they're always looking\nTo particularly big cities where they can capture free rent right and they can capture through unions to public employee pension huge my goodness this is Chicago's problem and one day it will be able to pay the bills it's also New Jersey's problem it's also California's problem\nAnd the joy to salvage we don't have big strong public employee pension union so we don't have great state that\nStates can't print money so here's a British I'll make it will make your audience happy\nThe red states are going to

future\nAnd that's that is extraordinary a date to hear you saying that I think you're right ah but it it is amazing to me Rahm Emanuel is not even seeking reelection it's been so bad that even he

I don't know if you do but her father was\nOne of the great American pastors and had a big big congregation in Detroit and traveled around the country giving giving sermons some ... some of the shortage were so good that he was signed by chess records so before reef it was a recording orders her for her daddy watch\nAnd you know it's just it's controversial you'll just to show your interest for her father her brothers\nAnd sisters why was the only person that we're supposed to be there it gave us\nFrom our co host eulogy about the nature of the show for the queen of soul\nAny tall talked about her life and he talked about sold the soul and it was actually a beautiful and we found a ... or eulogy at at a certain point he looked at the American soul and he talked about father was this really talked about money\nIt was a critique of capitalism and I'm game with that you\nKnow what do we take the money defines who we are\nThat can be a problem with capitalism depending things and and he asks the black folks in the audience what about the black soul\nAnd he starts to talk about five or ... but it starts to ask a serious questions about what is the nature of the African American community when men will respect their women wouldn't mental and trick they they're winning and then leave them alone\nAnd all of these stories that are so important and it's so many Americans would care about they never hear if it weren't for them listening to this program or to your program it's a real problem\nHere but you know shame on us for just not only media platforms and tell the stories are show joke I mean I think I Want to get the benefit but I don't think it's because they're evil I don't think Angelina Jolie didn't like movie than for the what you did on broken but you know is that they told you you it who's also selling elves\nAnd one on your age groups at two things happened to be I crashed into an ocean and like crafts that Jesus Christ will she left out Jesus Christ part the Billy Graham port her movies should because what on what we were shooting at us and I said let me get back to original point I don't think they do is they're mean\nI don't think they understand it\nI don't think they Under Cover him how totally or face Philips our lives and information\nAnd then we can struggle with dark they sure we don't understand that either they think we're rich\nFocus will periodically tree or have bills wherever the fair we're not rich were sinners we're all sinners but you don't understand that that was what he said oh no the first thing about what we are who we are and how faith informs our lives\nAre so I just think because they don't know it\nThey have a hard time writing about it I Try to write about things you neither do I understand\nWell I I agree with you and as I said I think that some people are hostile to face but I I Want to give people benefit that the way you do and say that most people they don't get it it's just a language they don't speak it makes them uncomfortable so they just kind of take a pass on it but it's so funny because\nMost Americans do take faith seriously I think of so many sports figures Darrell strawberry is on fire preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ one of the greatest uh sports figures of recent decades Darrell strawberry a spends his whole life and his wife\nPreaching Jesus a George Foreman his whole story I mean you know if you watch when we were kings you know you get George Clinton and Norman Mailer talking about the great fight the thrill in manila the rumble in the jungle but nobody mentions that\nAfter this this period a George Foreman has an encounter with God totally changes his life and you can go on and on and on and on and again that's why I'm grateful to\nEntrepreneurs like you because you're you've created a platform I'd I'd never created a platform I'm On the Salem Radio network and I write and do what I can do but it's really important that we get these stories are because you know you're talking about people voting with their feet I think that when when people know that there's a place they can get the ...\nSide of the story where the real story they'll go there so I I Hope people won't just listen to this program but we'll go to our American network a and and check you out it's just uh it it just makes me happy leave that you're doing this and they have such a good attitude toward it\nSo it's a blessing in the end to talk to people who don't agree with us and I'm thrilled to be a Newsweek where they have a very large book for it and they're they're starting to how well the pieces were doing but I'm not writing about Trump I'm not writing about the issues of the day I'm writing about bigger thing you could speak to the human heart\nAnd and trying to really drill down with stories that which we could not do otherwise argument and debate\nCan only get a ... I mean if we know one thing about our stories it's their energy to power\nAnd they they are able to tell people and take them away from the shelves and walk in someone else's shoes or when you're done reading in the real life story of Jackie Robinson addicted and one of your books\nThey'll ... they'll simply say wow that's interesting how they helped him and by the way I think that is that we should have what church door step by step ditch your story Eric I think at least people closer it did for me I was not a Christian till I was forty three and a person's story let me to Christ\nAnd and so I Know for for first hand knowledge proselytize you didn't get there all the people in my life Catholics or Protestants and everything in between Muslims Jews tried to convert me but it was a story that got me a story that could not be explained by anything but Jesus Christ's love\nNow let me ask you Lee a we've only got thirty seconds left in this segment and about four minutes on the other side can you tell us briefly what that story is you really got me interested\nYeah it was a story in Florida I did have a father son relationship at University of Alabama which I thought was going to be a ... story but the father and the more remarkable story and he was saying there's John coral and on the other side or manage I can easily do justice\nTo the store I'm Talking to a radio man he understands that the strictures of the medium folks were going to be right back I'm Talking to Lee Habib ...
