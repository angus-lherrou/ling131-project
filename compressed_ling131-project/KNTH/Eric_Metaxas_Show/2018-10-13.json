[noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done thus far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in the land and fine I'm okay with that but then we attributed powers it does not have a forty does not have\nAnd we granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the person up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans\nAre going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like him and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\n\nThink about this guys think about this I don't care if you're on the left with the right can we agree on something I Am at lunch break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes shoot a black man\nBe allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we can go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're we're going to use those honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as the Boogie Man hiding around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws\nWe have past have been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sick sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the left is supposed to be seen black right up again this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative by people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way\nI support a person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is set or we have seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not to take this Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen 'em come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open carrying though he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile by people\nAnd Republicans desert Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile by people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks ... blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats\n\nAnd Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\n\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney\nWho basically\nSupported Obamacare lite\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be worst accepting things we don't want or don't believe\nDo I have any liberal pardon me do I have any

it's going to say\nUh he's you might have man because Donald is the caveman and it's the whole story Donald a caveman he's my ... but anyway um that that now since this Friday I thought were not doing a fun facts friday but maybe we could do a little fun fact so would that be okay and you know sure do you do you have any fun facts in one of us don't dig it given to me I\nI well we both have it here I Want to share this with your the baseball season well throughout winding up of course with the big playoffs the Yankees were in the mental were in the middle of the Yankees were crush yeah yeah\nAt least I got to see my player Andrew McCutcheon I Love him from the pirates answering but I got to seem a little bit who does he play for he plays for the Yankees now he had to shave the the the goatee and the the drugs and all that oil because the Yankees have that had a policy but he eleven we established\nIn the Supreme Court establish no that facial hair is free speech you know\nI don't know that when they were out of money to for the other way I'm going to beard right now in ... oh yeah right now but I'm going to shave it off tomorrow morning but but I'm growing it right now and you think the big state love I think I mean ... hey I don't think so no boundaries that I can grow my beard yeah\nBut I found three things about baseball but you're not going to find and other professional for sports like um the football and basketball hockey and all that in ... the coach in baseball where's the exact same uniform but the players where okay now hold on a second\nI never thought of that out album you're you're telling me that in football\nNo they don't hockey I don't wear a helmet and they'll never panned in basketball they don't wear their baggy shorts\nOK in football and hockey Baskin and basketball the coaches do not dress like the players but for some reason and this has never occurred to me I've never thought about this in my life\nFor some reason in baseball the coach dresses like the players that's right and I have never thought of that until just now just because you brought it up brought it up and here's the question yeah why\nI don't know isn't that fascinating I Know it is I think it's kind of kind of fun I actually wish this we're calling show because I I Would like to to tell people cause somebody out there is going to have ideas on this you know we need to we're going to do more call in shows are most often worry we well we will um\nNow the other thing is in in in baseball that you can only score on off and it's like in football you can intercept the ball and you know in basketball the same thing intercept hockey intercept the puck but you can't in baseball like if the the batter hits a home run in these rounding third the third baseman can't knock them over and then he runs home and scores for the the team\nBut saw not up to bat so you can only score on off and you can't intercept the baseball or [noise]\nOkay so this is another thing about baseball standalone there's an office and then you go on defense and then often some defense back and forth but so you're telling me so you're telling me that\nIf if I'm In the field ... ... in my pictures on the mound he might catcher is catching yeah there's no way I can score no no way\nI don't know it's a it's a are you are you sure uh I'm pretty sure isn't it funny because to me baseball or something so ingrained that I Can't remember a time when I didn't know how baseball worked you know there's some people they just don't follow sports obviously\nMost Americans know our baseball works but just hang on ... but these are these are to think that the the scoring thing I guess I don't think that it doesn't seem like a big deal to me but the uniform thing that is just wild I Want to know there's got to be an answer where the started\n... like if you go back I think I could tell you right now Connie Mack\nNow wait he wasn't the coach he was like the owner right out of the of the of the uh the New York a ... the New York islanders before they became the Yankees I have to look this up but but I picture Connie Mack wearing a strong voter ... suit\nI I guess I have to think about this for second was he the owner of the coach I thought it was the coach but you're right if I think if Casey Stengel yeah ... they are all ... they all dressed like that so this goes way back but don't you want to know how far back I\nLike to know by the way we didn't get to the third thing yet but we will after your interview\nNo we can get through it right now the third thing is in baseball there is spitting spinning the chance spit\nOn the floor of the basketball court you can't spend hockey would cause there'll be bumps on the ice right you can't spit in football to wind up on your gridiron right your good work on your higher and what is it called on the helmet assessing rabbi ...\nHawkins okay I think it's called face mask the gridiron the gridiron is the field itself is called the gridiron okay folks that I Know when we come back or by the way that's very valuable facts Alvin\nThank you you're wealthy said sarcastically when we come

you before you were doing what you're doing now were you doing how did you get the idea\nTo do this because it's one thing to use that to to take it public so everybody can enjoy it that to me seems like a tough thing now did you did it so beautiful\nI understand we didn't mean to do it right when we're trying to do it right it would get all the cuts every now and again that's right like they can all I had that I Want my birthday I did not know would add a camel when I found out that they had a camera that was all\nShe makes I mean I\nCame there with me and we just got to talk you know I did all of these people were going we had no idea they were saying things that people want to say that the political correct\nCorrect and it's men make or not we didn't have to understand what they were talking about when they hit the truth that's right we're not talking with Charles\nYeah we had ten people on to you too can at the time we was talking to the people that was there about what we thought about certain subjects or what have it at all and it just snowballs from there\nAnd they were basically the bully you know you can't have that believe any more I think that's what really outweigh people happy what they look bad people up in a corner\nAnd what they were created a silent majority riots when Donald Trump came along it's like oh I I Will give you that\nI'm going to protect religious freedom\nI don't care what anybody do and the compatibility of your home but you can't push stuff up all the people they have their beliefs or their religious convictions and I don't believe so but the Democrats did it\nFor the Republican Party can that he would Hollywood wanted it to the average Americans want it\nAnd people showed up at the polls we didn't want to back you know I could affect all of these people these women market in the streets look\n[laughter] we fought him and if you\nDidn't have the religious freedom and making sure you have a job he he's creating the atmosphere good economic opportunity for you if you want to become an entrepreneur you care\nI may have gotten more needs pass almost aired bottle was able to do and ... and and I love it though I'm not be anyone but the American working with the American people right not the president\nOf the I'm the president of the United states in for that\nWell as I say it's it's just refreshing to hear you say these things and you know I guess what you're talking about with religious freedom and that's one of the biggest issues that I've ever talked about on this program and wherever I go giving speeches religious liberty religious freedom has become the issue of our day because it's one of these things that we had so much of it in America\nNobody really thought about it until more recently suddenly\nYou realize he's under attack people are saying not just we want to live our lives this way but if you do not agree with us we will persecute you we will shut down your businesses and you know ... chopping up as they would have lost their businesses and some of them did\nUh because of this kind of activism that's on American and so as I say\nThat a lot of people have been pushed along with that and I think many people represented I Know many of my black friends who would have voted Democrat years ago have stopped doing that because the turn that the Democrats took mainly under Obama we know it would have been worse under Hillary unfortunately\nSo here's the sad thing about it you know the same Democrat attacked the Democrat taxes that's being used\nNow for being used back then the way they mate you made these up here a certain way just listen to how Obama said that the jobs will never come back they're not coming back folks you had the wave a magic wand he wanted to and Dr ... people mind that with that\nSo that when you don't see jobs here then well he said it it wasn't coming back\nBut who who he got bamboo though because president Donald date from\nShow to how these jobs and come right back here to America\nAnd what about when Obama gave the food stamp but not kind of give you you you think it gave you an Obama ... on the head\nRight I said I have a coconut smile and and I say I love it President Trump because\nHe's looking for Americans and the American people are feeling the effects of that is good and why don't we want the\nDemocrat that it wouldn't even come to the table for tax cuts right that we want them to immigrate to keep putting America could look at it this way we know it could yeah they want to take three out of America they want it it's our country\nAnd when they brought up around the country are they teaching people how to come in and respect our country as we want to and then we have somebody like quicken Hillary than what they had no we gave\nThem back and you believe that that's what she said no no no no but I mean I don't believe me\nThat the woman who who could have\nBeen president United States actually\nSaid that is one of the most shocking thing that she is that a lot of wicked family and a lot of bad things but that is one of the most shocking things someone is going to get killed and she will have blood on

I see I think that the Democrats because they have they've effectively decided um to rather than have\nA kind of a coherent plan that's different from Trump's plan they've just decided to attack the president which of course is their right but I think strategically it's an error\nUm and I think they're losing lots and lots of African Americans which is genuinely historic because since gosh I don't know since FDR since before FDR or African Americans have really been\nThat they felt like the Democratic party as their home and to the extent that that's changing that is shocking actually shocking when you have a major figure like Kanye West\nOf being respectful to the president visiting him wearing a make America it's just it's a fascinating a time I don't know if I get him a copy of Donald drain the swamp but I don't I don't know anybody who's friends with Kanye West because I live in such a narrow cry world but of non rappers but\nI gotta say hat or um you know a a ... when when when diamond in silk said that they if they like the book they would have me on their program mhm that's ... that's ... that is genuinely as exciting or more exciting\nFor me than being on the Tonight Show I Know you you mentioned that and that's and that I find out I don't yeah I don't know how I Would be on their program because they have it's an Internet program so I don't know if that means I got to know North Carolina or would I have to do but\nI I Want maybe I should have sky ... eleven or meet them oh I Would love to see whether they got to come to New York at some point will get them up here maybe had them on the show maybe anyway well this is since ... since we're coming up on a weekend I Want to remind people that next week\nMy um my Donald drained the swamp book comes out officially October sixteenth comes out officially I'll be doing as much media\nAs I can do you know we'll see uh what I'm able to do but I mean I'll be doing as much media as I can do I know I'm doing Hugh Hewitt and Dennis Prager and are are probably some Fox shows I help her I'll be doing Fox and friends we'll see but\nUm it it'll be an interesting week next week to see him kind of what happens and uh but it's so far all signs are are are pointing in the right direction that people appreciate the fact that it's fun and that we've got\nTo have some fun if we don't laugh at this time I mean I just think that that the level of sour ... bitterness and anger it's been I mean the Kevin offing was a real blood letting for America mhm and it was very very painful that we we went through that and it was just so bitter\nI'm so I'm hoping that some people uh will want to laugh at where we are I'm In any event um I don't want to forget to mention we're doing a fundraising alliance defending freedom\nWe just got the totals a I'm so grateful to every one of you are who have helped us a move toward our goal in a in working uh to raise money for lines defending freedom they\nThey you know when we talk about religious freedom that's for everybody I Want to say this is something that it it's not about uh let's say Christians defending Christians no religious freedom is for everybody it means that everybody has a right to be anything an atheist than acknowledge stick a Muslim\nAnything you want to be in America you know and that's being challenged right now are we talking about the jak Philips in the masterpiece cake shops and there are a lot of things like that it's it's really unpleasant but alliance defending freedom is stuck stepping up to bat and they're doing an amazing job they're fighting on the Supreme Court level they won the first case for jak Philips\nA but now uh the ... the the Colorado civil rights commission\nIn an act of what looks like\nGenuine mean spirited nests and nastiness they have come at him again you know and they said oh okay well you on that one now we want you to bake a cake are celebrating as somebody transitioning genders and we want on top of the cake or a a figure of Satan performing\nA pornographic act that I'm not going to remember them and they're not going to mention on this program\nBut I Want to say that this is what we're up against today in America that a nice guy this guy I met him he's a nice man of respectful man he sees nothing near a big it this is a really kind sweet man\nBut he's being told you know you can shove your religious liberty you can shove your religious feelings we don't care we want you to do this and I think wow the idea that somebody could tell you to do something a of an overt sexual nature uh and you say well no look I'm a Christian I'm I don't want to do that\nThe fact that he has to go to court I mean imagine now this can happen to anybody I'm Talking to you right now and and and people need to be brave you know you don't say oh I don't wanna get in trouble\nLook if if if if this happens alliance defending freedom will defend you for free yeah but I'm saying right now is

the inventor of my pillow or whatever kind of so many different things might you you just have a natural exuberance I'm about yourself we were talking a\nUh yesterday I guess on the phone before I even though you're going to be here about a this president and how you have been vocally supportive of him and you know a part of the reason I'm Talking to you lately because I feel the same thing I feel like there are a lot of Americans\nWho love this president thing they're aware of his foibles and his errors in his sense just as we're sitting here we're talking about years since I mean your life was a mess and somehow\nGod works with people whose lives are in a mess I mean the gospel is full of that now you can take that too far in ... becomes cheap grace but the point is that\nWhy do people so many people love this president and yet some people really know very deeply despise him it's a very strange time we're living in so what what did you say about that because it was so funny\nWell I'll tell you what what I said at the rally was everybody loves our president they just don't know it yet and I couldn't see\nIt as a Larry Larry ...\nAnd you know when I did I spoke at the rally the other day for about five minutes to pry open it up I said you know I used to because I didn't know anything about politics at all and came\nBy the way you're from Minnesota I'm from Minnesota spoke at the Minnesota rally from a rally a little while ago\nYou had this about a week ago or whatever and they are and anyway I got one of my opening mines was I said uh you know I was going on his radio station and they introduced me as a former Democrat and they are in the fall under my pillow and I said I didn't find my pillow invention my true and I wasn't a former Democrat it was a former crack\n... oh my gosh I got that I went into\nI went into I didn't I didn't I didn't know anything about politics in ... and Donald Trump at the time reached out to me before he was the president and ... and the summer of two thousand sixteen in a private meeting August fifteenth two thousand sixteen I walked into his office with a lot of hope\nAnd I and we try he talked about what he was going to do with the country talking about my my people are being made in the u._s._a. and when he was going to do and I seen his heart and I'm going\nI don't want anyone in the country and this is going to be the greatest president in history I walked out other\nI talked to his employees and it was like talking to my back then there's the every one of them had a great story about a minute you know a personal story and what an amazing boss is what an amazing man\nBasically they have a narrative and if you don't fit the narrative they're really not interested but the fact that you had been wildly successful you totally defied every story I mean the fact that you your life was a huge mess but you have the humility and its openness God reaches his hand in he leads you along now you're using your platform\nTo talk about Jesus I mean that was so hilarious and the most beautiful way and you do that's what you do your ... your life is a miracle Mike your life is a series of miracles\nAbsolutely in my book is like what are the odds from ... to see oh by the time to read the books we don't believe in God you didn't read the book I mean all these miracles and even in our own lives if someone's alter listen you're looking at one in a million and go wow that's like a one million or this one in a billion or this is a\nA zero chance and it happened you out of together when does it become a miracle I mean our presents a miracle I mean that was a you know God gave us grace on this country a second chance and I'll tell you\nFor my platform should be able to regard shows me to use this as a platform for him\nI'm I'm all in and they are and I don't look back and I don't know I just put it out there\nYeah well it's so funny because again there's so many people that they're so sour and so negative that they they almost they're in love with negativity like missing anything exuberant are positive are happier successful they kind of look at it like I don't trust it I don't trust that and I think to myself wow a if anybody knows your story\nThey notice hasn't been easy you know you didn't come up with a silver owning your out right go absolutely\nNot I've always been an entrepreneur but us when I've been broke I'd been a you know completely broke all the time I keep trying and even the ...\nHave you you've been through it you know you've been through it but you you've always sort of had a had a good attitude somehow or absolute optimism and and here you are a all these years later I mean so I I have to ask you cause people always want to know like when when you said you invented a pillow I was joking around with you I guess it would be less years does a pillow\nRise to the level of invention it's kind of guy invented a towel or awash caught he really invented that so when you say you can send you invented a pillow what do you mean in other words eat well what was it about standard pillows that you said I've got to do something new\nI ... I wanted it to the number one thing to make it adjustable where you could adjusted and that's where my ... got to ... the filled it's inside it and uh [noise] uh how these three different sides of

uh one of the things you know when it comes out Eric your leg because the uh\nUh uh there was like five hundred I think participants and once they tried to my pillow and then they had to go to the other pillow they couldn't do it a third among dropped out\nBecause when they should I quit I I'm reading but the bill they didn't want to Bill Bill ... or so is the magic piece of this puzzle what you just said adjust ability you know the way most pillows and do not have adjusted ... may\nGo flat any of your neck his bench you you have sleep interruption if your neck is too high or too low you have sleep interruption you wake up you ... a dump killed there's nothing worse is ruined America don't down is don't I used to always say it's a donor you lay on it down a goes you readjust you wake up to readjust awake and it's too bad because\nThey convinced us to buy a bag of air and pay the most money for just like they when they said you know we used to drink got a garden hoses and they said we're not going to buy a bottle of water you know I'm going okay that's weird yeah da da da dum pillows just\nAnd things are true higher too low nobody wants hard we are from we just want the hype and

night when we are voicing our advertisements on this program from my pillow we came up with the with the idea that it's the official pillow or rip van Winkle and we want you to know that uh we think that successful so if you want to use that\nWe're not we're not going to ask for much percentage in fact you can have it but I just thought we were joking around that this pillow is so effective\nThere'd be careful because you might not wake up for Twenty years it's so good you might not wake up well into your new ... well it's quality sleep I mean you know the president's ... these he\nWorks so hard and do you know when he does sleep it needs to be quality and that you know I think he like hibernate he goes way down his his pulse goes down to like twenty minutes right Yogi he goes deep down and when he comes up you only need only need about three hours sleep at night right up but it's got its quality that you know he told me that you said that to me the other\nNight again

glue\nThey tracked down his third grade teacher [noise] and they found somebody to say something negative about him he was alone or any aid glue [noise] maybe the teacher fed the glued to the other kids they'd be a top advisor to the most powerful person in the world just saying\nYou learn something new every day yeah and\nThat's one of the [noise]\nMy alma mater University of Michigan where I went to law school president has apologized to Jewish students over recent controversies what controversy and what are the worst run states have in common I think you know or I'm going with that one [noise]\nBut first [noise] we're gonna talk about\nWhat happened yesterday with [noise] Kanye West and the president and how Kanye West has been called Sambo by TI\nRapper who's not exactly in my play list [noise] he's been called a token negro by a pundit on CNN\n[noise] another punted on CNN\nSaid Kanye West quote is what happens when negroes don't read close quote\nWhen Kanye West mentioned in the oval office that he had some mental issues with bipolar disorder\nThey were laughing I thought this was the network that cared about people's feelings about\nMental illness and when it has to make sure that people who are mentally ill sought treatment because after all a lot of the recent gun shootings have been done by people who\nHad some issues and have people been more aware and have perhaps and I've been a stigma maybe\nThe gum and might have gotten help I thought that what you thought but I guess not now when it comes to a black renegade\nSomebody who dares to talk about the welfare state in the connection between that and like a father somebody who dares to say that if he said yesterday the issue with guns is not illegal is not legal guns it's illegal guns I have a right to keep and bear arms I was a short conversation wasn't it\n\nNever Kanye West of beer suggest that he had an issue because he grew up without a father when the person who sat in that Oval Office for eight years wrote a book about it is difficult relationship with his father and have a urine to have his own father and his house I'm Talking about rock Obama\n\nAnd it's been fascinating watching all these people ridicule somebody who has the cash shoes do deer bring up the number one social problem in this country and in a climate change\nIt's a number of people growing up with out fathers and this is an issue that cuts across racial lines although it's far more acute and the black community than anywhere else except for Native Americans living on reservations\n\nWalter Williams says you look at census report Eighteen Ninety Nineteen forty a black kid was slightly more likely to be raised my mother and father than a white kid\n\nSo perhaps it's long overdue for us to maybe have a discussion about whether or not the welfare status undermined incentives\nMy father used to say people are motivated by two things promised again and fearful loss and my father lifelong Republican said about Democrats they might give you something for nothing and when you're trying to get something for nothing you almost always end up getting nothing for something maybe just me and my dad was right when I have a discussion but I no no no that was the way to kill this guy\n\nT I actually used to um record with him did something with him and now since I'm embarrassed to work with you you don't have a discussion about this became they have to talk about this\n[noise] here's what gets me\nOver on MSNBC huh there were ridiculing him and ridiculing him ready to kill him do you know what the most watched cable network for blacks is\nMSNBC and I've read that MSNBC hall\nAbout thirty percent of the ratings come from black viewers you just the top\nCable channel watched by black in America and that is why you have people like Chris Matthews constantly constantly pulling out the race card only to admit when it's gone down\nThey didn't believe it how do I know that here is what he said day before yesterday listen very carefully\nBut I Do understand President Trump to it as much as any of us do he always shoot Simone hey do is the thing it does the thing and they get in the contest of ideas and politics than the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is it's got some sort of bizarre\nI mean this was just yesterday just Chris Matthews explaining why and his view ... was invited to the oval office\nOr politics that Doug Fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the idea that he's a racist it runs against the either Trump doesn't like minorities that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you could hear comes it will and politics\nAnd I sort of a racial way and areas flipping it I think if people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most them if they think they're racist\n\nDid you hear that mostly he invited Kanye West in the oval office for white people because white people most of them won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist as Chris Matthews if that's what you believe and why is that you were constantly saying things like this\nWhen he said today America First there was not just the racial I mean native I should say racial to hit Larry has a background so of course I don't think of a human rights something about gender writes thinks it here from a Democrat\nAnd Russia and that's a serious thing\nDid you notice anything sort of ethnic about his attitude and answering your\nQuestion something that wasn't it said something about they have all the three hundred and some executions in Texas and they were all Sherry I remember that was something that may have pre dated Trump but clearly it's I think you think it is I\nMean what did you think of this going after the football players father I mean uh I I don't get it he just seems like there's a certain aspect he likes to go for people of color and sometimes I I notice a pattern I'm Sorry I notice that fighting is it brings out into a ... as an added to the ethics each of the racial picture of you I think his love them saying throw them out from

smile on his face as if to say\nYeah I Know you're just saying stuff because you can make an income for you\nAnd I didn't smell back and I said uh would you mind telling me what you think that that I don't believe\nIn any stop smiling you realize that he had said something that I found a little little offensive\nI repeated I said I get that a lot tell me what you think I said that I don't really believe you out of a rubber\n\nChris Matthews is clearly saying a bunch of crap she doesn't believe\nHow does somebody\nCalled Trump or racist called Trump's supporters of racist and then say well the average white person would not vote for somebody if they thought he was a racist\n\nWhite but I Do understand President Trump to it as much as any of us do he always just among\nHe'd do is to say it does that thing and the getting a contest of ideas on politics\nThan the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is as gotten some sort of bizarre politics that Doug Fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the idea that he's a racist it runs against the either Trump like minorities that he's going after her Rona going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual
