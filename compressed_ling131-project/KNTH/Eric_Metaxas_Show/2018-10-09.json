all I've done thus far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned that show\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in the land and fine I'm okay with that but then we attribute it powers it does not have a forty does not half\nWere granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the person up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans\nAre going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like them and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\n\nThink about this guys think about this I don't care if you're on the left or the right can we agree on something I Am but let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes shoot a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we can go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to get those honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as a bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we half past\nHave been\nBased or negotiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sick sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\nAnd the left is supposed to be teen black right I began this whole program I made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way I support\nA person's right to self defense and what is sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is Saturn we've seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas knocked the Texas Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen them come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people really we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open carrying the he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile black people\nAnd Republicans other Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile by people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yeah blacks\nSupport Democrats and Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's Republicans\nSupported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney\nWho basically\nSupported Obamacare lite you see this we're we're fighting\nTeam a versus team be were accepting things we don't want\nOr don't believe do I have any liberal pardon\nMe do I have any\nDemocrat black men out there who think that the government should have a right to profile black man how many Republicans do I have out there how many liberty ... delivered by the guys who say oh no man\nEveryone has\nA right\nTo be safe and secure in their persons in effect but that's where we're lacking dude dude they're just going to do to the idea that Ari forget that my like eighties throwback kind of deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a focus on liberty because we have our vision has become myopic because of this left right fight\nGuys let's support let's get on one page and say we can support and respect liberty for each

like an animal lipstick shrieking and and and you know of course Mike Pence who's presiding had to you know after surgery and arms to take care of these people and and to take them out so I thought to myself\nThis is so sick sounding and on the TV it really I'm not getting it sounded like demons screaming at some point he got very ugly right\nSo on Twitter I posted the demons you know screaming in the Senate gallery there's they're shrinking because they know their time is is is short or something like that right now obviously a there's two things going on first of all it's half of a joke right because you know if they sound like demons but also\nUnfortunately it's only half of a joke because some times demons who are very real do screen through human beings and do manifest themselves in whatever right yeah so I certainly wasn't calling\nThese messed up people in the gallery demons right right but you know people like wrote back at me and how can you say that they're demons and even that was even an article where somebody said that I called them demons and I thought we were at a point where you can't joke you can't say anything complicated you can't see anyone knew what people are\nJust right insane\nAnd ... there's so much to say to unpack this I I thought uh in order to unpack it or we need we need to call in the professional we do and so I thought to somebody who's possible who's making bad if we can get somebody big and bad and professionally John's mirror because I Can't handle it so I have to tell you it's so troubling so uh can we get John's mirror today\nOr is he there looks like is he there beagles not as willing him\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I like them with a with takes now so the relative\nYou ride them with pig parts that sweet at Johns merit\nWhat happened this weekend and what's been happening over the course of these weeks to me um it's deeply disturbing because people some of whom uh many of whom I Would expect to know better or have descended into a kind of\nMob mentality that that says emotion is the only truth it's really something we've been living with this in this country for a long time but it's never been so high pitched literally and figuratively and it has never been so pushed\nA to this point we've come to a point where this idea that emotion is the truth the truth is ah we're\nLiving with it we we've been we've been seeing it people don't care about evidence or crop ration and if you don't give them evidence a corporation they say oh it's because you're hiding it were because the Senate didn't want to see it or it's just you it's a never ending battle with raw emotion what do we do like\nYou know what I think we're dealing with is the last two learned that lesson\nFrom the failures of the twentieth century they're not imitating the Bolshevik ... of the Nineteen twenties and thirties in Europe\nBecause those people failed their imitating the brown shirts in Germany and the twenties and thirties 'cause they succeeded and I think the ... the most illuminating way to look at the way the left is operating in America and Western Europe today is to study the brown shirts and what they did\nA they they went in and they corrupted the universities the highest percentage of voters for Hitler or university students and university professors of any group in Germany\nI mean the bizarre thing over the universities they\nPurged the books they they they ... how did it they purged books based on the ethnicity of the authors\nJust today to nowadays they want to purge white male authors well back then they wanted to purge Jewish authors it's the same phenomena and I think the best way to understand what's happening on the left today is is to study the Weimar period that's a fantastic book called the death of democracy or that just came out\nAnd it really does analyze\nHow the Nazis came to power in Germany and I really think anti ... and the radical left in America have studied the Nazi play book and that is what\nThey're doing and and who wrote this book the death of democracy ... well\n... well\nI Can't I Can't hear you well we can we can look it up we have Google here in New York as well you know ...\nCarter hit Benjamin Carter H. E. T. T. and what he says is it was the cowardice\nAll of the establishment in Germany the establishment parties the media the ... the army the churches the industrialists they\nWeren't willing to crack down on the extremists of both sides\nThey they crack down on the communists but they weren't willing to crack down on the Nazis and they thought the Nazis were fundamentally even if they were rough around the edges even if they were using violence even if there was silence in free speech they were doing it in a good cause so\nYou kind of had to let them get away with it\nWhich is actually what liberal authority whoa that was ... on the left today\nI mean look it started in this country let's let's be honest this whole thing really it comes out that this is the\nThe bitter fruit the sexual revolution and we saw this in the late sixties when students took over campuses uh invaded the president's offices at campuses like Columbia University right here in New York and the administration did not have the guts to stand that ride them now the harbor is\nThis is fifty years ago\nRight and they were awarded for those people who took over the campuses and burn the buildings ended up getting tenure going into the institutions and taking them over and or or facing now\nIs a replication of the radicalization we saw in the ... in Germany in the thirties and I think it's really that important and ...\nCall themselves crusaders against fascism well remember the Nazis claim they were defending German civilization from the ... of the Communist Party right\nWhen somebody has been known sing something really loudly ... you know look carefully maybe that's what he's really after maybe that guy dressed up as a fireman is in fact an arsonist\nWell that's that's exactly right and I have to say that you know when I was writing my book on ... I thought to myself\nThe horrifying thing really about studying history as close as I did when I wrote that book is that\nYou begin to see that these weren't demons these were real people just like us who fell prey to certain bad ideas and all it took a little lack of courage here in a little lack of courage there in the little sloppy thinking here that's\nAll it takes up for a great civilization to descend into anarchy chaos genocide and I have to say what we're living through right now\nYou know I we need to be aware I guess is why I Want to talk to you about this because this is not something that happens in a vacuum you have to understand that this didn't happen in the last year this is something that's been brewing for a long time so it must be really understand it or at its core understand where it comes from where it's taking us but I Want to\nContinue the conversation folks with beer taxes from talking to Jon ...

I've never seen\n'em something that smells as evil as what we're seeing right now I mean there there there are bad things in this world but there are things that that are so nefarious that you really can see the hand of the enemy I mean there are good people that I Know who\nWho have been so caught up in the emotion of this and who are so upset about their own sex abuse or something that that\nIs taking the foreground in this conversation ... ... you know you want to say listen\nIf you care about people not being sexually abused you better make sure that when you accuse someone you don't do it in a way that's even slightly false make sure you take this as seriously as you want everyone to take it\nUm when it concerns somebody who maybe didn't do it and I think that that's what we're seeing is that we're we're seeing the undermining of legitimate\nA sex abuse complaints because now it's us against them it's men verses women it's angry people versus law and order it's it's become this this ridiculous um hodgepodge I I really\nI as I say I'm I'm I'm really concerned for our country before uh we we return of this conversation folks I Want to tell you about alliance defending freedom

congratulated justice Kevin with these words he said justice Kavanaugh has demonstrated that he is committed to interpreting the constitution as our founders intended\nThat commitment must include affirming or most fundamental freedoms\nOf free speech and religious liberty which will most certainly be thinking cases that will come before the court\nIn upcoming terms now you know folks alliance

want to read your stuff where do they need to go\nStream dot org ... I've got a I did a lot of coverage of the Kavanaugh thing in fact I was one of the few people to report that Christine Ford or for six years for the company that makes the abortion bill\nThat amazing that people don't talk about that and um I mean look\nWe don't know what happened with Christine for one thing I Know is if you don't have the evidence you cannot pretend a that anything else will do that it I Would say\nThe odds are lower that it's Brett Kavanaugh than anybody else because they're every piece of evidence she offered that it was Brett Kavanaugh has been completely debunked so I mean the court of law ... she would not even get\nAn indictment I don't think that you could get a search warrant there was not even probable cause for search for it but Brett Kavanaugh based on the shifting invade testimony\nThat forward offered and I think her attorneys who are political hit men one of them worked for George has worked for George Soros for Fifteen Years that's his cats cats um I think they cooked up a story based on march ... memoir a story that could not be refuted that\nThey left out every fact that could be checked\nIt they they cut off every opportunity for for Kavanaugh to offer an alibi Eric I Would like to ask you what you were doing\nAt some point in the summer of Nineteen eighty two and I'm going to accuse you of having helped me Rob a grocery store yeah a\nOn Sunday night in some city somewhere in Maryland at some point in Nineteen eighty two you can offer an alibi you can't defend yourself ... charges are so big they were intentional out\nYou know what I have brought up I brought up on my Facebook page and on Twitter or we have to go back to the novel to kill a mocking bird ... case where a woman\nAnd her father angrily emotionally accused a man\nOf rape or of violence uh some people remember the movie maybe you read the book the movie of course during Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch defending a black\nMan or the black man a really couldn't defend himself very well things weren't looking good in this in this little southern town where you know ... the whites really ah had the power and so you have a man defending a Tom Robinson\nBut the woman who accused him her name is may Ella you'll and anybody who who's seen the movie it's just a a searing performance by this woman because the anger the pain it's also real\nAnd you and I realized John many people listening know that so many African Americans were accused of something sexual they couldn't defend themselves very well they were hanged either by the law quote unquote or by a mob\nThat doesn't connect with Americans he got up there he said when did it happen I don't remember where it happened I don't remember who is there I don't really remember but I had one beer\nI remember that that was born yet what he did was he boil download legal talking points into\nOrdinary language that said to the people of America an innocent guy is getting railroaded by left wing elites hysterical violet activists just because they want to keep control of the court so that can rural America by decree the way they've been doing for the last\nForty years since roe v way and I'm not standing for it and you know what I think the Democrats are not gonna take the house I think we're going to win limit terms precisely because we saw this naked power grab disguised as concern for victims\nI you know what I growl at once and I also think what I find interesting is that anytime anybody wants to frame thing as a men verses women issue\nThat's a failure and I'll say why because every woman has a father a many women have brothers and husbands and sons that they loved to death they loved them they adore them and they would want them\nTo get fair\nA fair trial they would want that and so when they see this railroading maybe they they keep quiet about it because uh they don't want to get in the crosshairs of of someone angry in the family but privately they see\nThat when you railroad all men your railroading them too because they love the men around them the men that have play them and and would stand up for them just as I Would my daughter or my mother or my wife or my cousins or anybody in my family my nieces\nAnd and there's so many men that would do that and so when you know those men and you hear men being demonized says all toxic you say you know what\nThey've all gone too far it's one thing\nTo say oh I Believe women are equal in women should have an opportunity to have a career when I went along with that because that was all reasonable but what is happening now\nIs madness and I think many women are seeing the limits of feminism that that you're seeing something in contemporary feminism that is actually not only not speaking for women but its bizarrely anti woman it's reducing women it's an she'll other road\nWhite certainly emptied motherhood but it's it's ... it's all women and women screaming and it'll tell art\nIn so far is now you have to pretend that a guy who takes some hormones and get his parts cut off is this is a woman and if you don't believe that if you don't believe the guy who said at the moment I identify as a woman you have to accept him as a woman\nOr or you or a trans phobic\nI mean how completely bonkers that things have to get before people realize that there is something the moniker insane\nAt wanting lose in in the feminist move I think the feminist movement right now really does come down to abortion UK there are no feminists organizations of any size that are pro life\nThat there are no women's studies professors that I've been able to identify no looting women's studies professor said I'd love to be contradicted who are pro life not one I don't think you could get a pro life opinion\nMentioned in a women's studies department they monolithic I'm so insofar as feminism is about abortion is evil\nWell again I think that I mean I wrote about this in the preface to my seven women book that whenever\nWomen are pitted against men or men are pitted against women everybody loses when you tear down men you are tearing down women women don't win and the lie\nThat it's somehow a seesaw one goes up the other goes down that is absolute nonsense justice truth justice and the true love of God elevates everybody on but we many Christians have bought into this uh many Christians of people who call themselves Christians seem not to understand that\nA a God loves men and women equally\nAnd to to track to to trash a whole group of people this way again I Know most of the women I Know there there is no way they're going to go along with this but they're going to be quiet about it and I think in the midterms are the Democrats are going to be in big trouble because they've just gone too far\nYeah yeah but when you introduced that kind of power struggle and to the family it's like what markets did with the class struggle you or your reporting the Marxist model of class struggle into the most intimate place in the world into a family that drew into the family room with the children\nYou are taking calming the communist idea that everything is a struggle for power and if one game the other writers and your accepting that divisive demonic doctrine and applying it to your marriage\nWell that's right I thought were most folks I think no that that ain't gonna work we're going to be right back folks talking to jumped American air attacks us show [noise]\n\n\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for

you'd think that they would have to\nDeal with the facts and even the New York times uh I just I'm strict report Taj they're leaning on this ... there's an article by my old friend Adam lip tack above the fold I don't know if what yesterday's paper Saturday's paper friday's paper uh it couldn't be it has to be ... might be today's paper but it was about\nHow this um this the Kavanaugh thing\nHas undermined the credibility of the Supreme Court and I\nThought [laughter] I Know\nA lot of us lost faith and the Supreme Court in Nineteen Seventy three when\nThey made up the constitution pulled it out of its bodily or if it's to invent abortion rights out of nowhere with that's when we stopped believing in the Supreme Court I wanted to bang on the doors of the Supreme Court when I learned about roe v Wade welcome to the club buddy well\nThis is this is what's so hilarious and it's above the fold and there are times I Do yes now all reasonable people are are upset about the partisan a\nCharacter and you'd think wait a second it it became part isn't when people started legislating from the bench and what we're trying to do now in fact\nAnd when did you come to face\nGrew up in the church so effectively always feels like you know well a lot of people grow up in the church and that don't mean nothing I mean you grow up in the church but it was real for you\nYeah it was it was pretty good and yet when I was like Seventeen Eighteen I looked at my parents have said you know I'd never actually been baptized so then I get baptized finally when I'm senior in high school and move on from there you go to church where do I go to know where did you go where a black church\nYou went to black rock I grew up in budget is incredible ... never moved in this miraculous stuff that I was aware of no it was very foreign to me okay so when did you start moving into this miraculous phase\nSo um when I was Fifteen I went on a mission trip with teen missions to Alaska for the summer\nAnd first time I've ever met any real like spirit filled people and I thought well this is the classic kind of story they got something that I don't have and it's really attractive than if I could have it I Want it\nBut then you have all the how do you navigate the experiential side of it and the reality different nuances of the theology that you can explain at that age but you feel it\nAnd but I still wanted it in so long the way I got introduced to the vineyard and the when I was by the time a senior in high school and you know John was still alive\nAnd John Limbert yep we mean John with so I think my ... who John is sorry John Limbert Jon Weber is is the man who created the vineyard\nA and was really used by God to normalize the concept of healing for today deliverance all this green stuff and I remember going to a like a charismatic conference in Nineteen Ninety I think it was an Indianapolis something like that and I heard him speak on while\nUh this is for today oh yeah but okay so and at what point did you think you go into the ministry\nUh when I was Fifteen I\nWow that yeah coming off the summer and I remember being on that summer and we're we're in a room in Alaska talking amongst ourselves just about God and how um a wonderful use and all that he's doing in this and that and a real love for him and while we would do that\nA president's would enter the room\nAnd you're like it was that I don't even want to breathe the wrong in case I it was so holy so profound intense I don't want a breeze\nWrong you don't want us scared away I don't want to scared away as if you could of course yeah but\nAnd I liked that I it was I was like this is where I meant to be so when I found the vineyard there was that presence there yeah but also I was ... counting the story one time with my brother between Fifteen sixteen years old and I realize\nThe ministry actually that's what I Want to do with my whole life [noise]\nIsn't that wonderful at that age has such a I mean it's a rare thing in a way and such are a\nBlessing [noise] um so ... what did you go to college\n[noise] um I did but I did not at the time I got kinda side tracked 'em by life and what not and so I went to college but did not finish a couple of bad decisions early on in life and I'm so currently I Am finishing a theology degree\nAll that I felt funny now you're doing now its way relevant now I think it's way smarter to to save college for when you you have a brain uh I mean really so many people are going to cause you're so young and you just don't know what you're doing I don't appreciate it and then years later when you really appreciate it you know you can think it'd be nice to go to college now\nOh I was sitting down on 'em Roosevelt Island this week and looking out over the East River and I'm doing my reading from ice cores and everything I'm reading is just so relevant to what I Need to be doing it's great it's a lot of fun okay so uh\nWhat do you do did you get married young like children how old were you I just turned twenty three it's not that young the well we're coming up on twenty four years now yeah and Marine I\nYeah his own affect some well no so okay so you got you got married I mean honestly I always say to people if you can get married young I I always would advise and it's a beautiful thing so you only three is pretty normal I think well anyway but so you get married you know how many kids did you have\nWell I'm all in all we have five and but one of them are passed away so have you ever spoken about times go oh I it comes up when I'm teaching and whatnot yes yeah\nI I didn't know that story until I read about it in the material you sent us and I didn't know if that's something that uh I mean I I Would be um\nAnd the future a little bit about how many people struggling with this kind of thing and they need to know they're not the only ones yeah\nIt that way yeah it's it's a horrible journey and yet I'm the shorter but of course is that of course God's gracious but I'm the way that I have found and it's really started to kind of form something in my life right now\nOf um how do we deal with the pain and our life when most of the time we just don't want to [noise]\nSo for example therapists would say\nTo us you got to go to the grief and my wife and I were treated differently she'd say are you kidding me you're crazy and I'd be like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense so I Would go do that I Would I Would\nVisit as it is helpful for me to visit his grave and stuff that how old was your son Hayden when he passed away he was four and\nA half [noise] yeah how many years ago is is a this is ten years ago now just this year I was ten years in June so um it it's some people asked me one time some friends said so how you doing is like\nThree months later and how you doing I'm living in their kitchen and of course when you talk about this subject it tends to suck all the rest of the oxygen out of the room but I just said to him were in the kitchen and I said well here's what it's like yeah like sitting in a fire\nIn all your friends are around you looking at you with these ... youth pitiful and they're looking at you with this concern and care but they can't do a thing you're in the fire meaning all the pain of it until it's done yeah and I'm\nJust trying to describe how bad you know kind of what it feels like and yet overtime is I don't think it's a God heals all wounds and the time he sorry God does your wins time does not ... by itself but if we'll let got endure pain he will heal our ...\nAnd having all that got into that pain I'm your your your son drowned you said it was ... he was four and a half this is ten years ago yeah uh\nDo you do how do you deal with that I mean you say you've got and how do you let got into something that you\nYou express to him and you feel what's going on emotionally\n... excuse me one time I was at a vineyard conference a couple of years later and I was asking or there was a son that came on it and talking about you know if you call us to the fire and you don't relent your hand you know I'll I'll say go I'll still go\nAnd I'm saying lord I Can't do this and I had just all of a sudden the lord started to encounter me in the same way in that room\nYears earlier and I started to cry out to him and said did you see me\nDid you see what I did for you when he died I

have a special name or is it had been called sanctuary sanctuary in Lancaster, Pennsylvania ...\nCentury of in your church at right there so uh I ... I began to\nWant to take the church and the people to that and in one sense it felt like there were like well when did we ever become charismatic and I'm like well it's not about charismatic\nUm per se but at one point I found that I got to a point of I don't know how to get to the next step and so a mutual friend of Ken's and mine had met Ken and I reached out to him and said do you think Ken would help me\nSo I he can basically said yes we started connecting and very so really I'm In about two thousand eleven in earnest when I um I had some basis from being so long in the vineyards and that was when it really currently started taking off and I'm One of Ken's\nFirst questions to me on the phone was so have you ever cast out a demon\nAnd this and I I so want it to impress them\nLike

more you do this where you press into the kingdom yeah as you\nWill yeah and sure enough it was probably within three to four weeks after that all of a sudden that was part of what we were doing\nI mean it's so fascinating 'cause there's so many serious Christians who just don't believe in this and they don't even get near it and I think it's weird or something and you think well no it's\nIt's pretty beautiful because you're bringing really palpable healing to human beings and they're not ... they're not the same one these things happened yeah so I mean I've seen some of this\nUm but now if if people are wanting to you don't have a book out not yet no but you're you're\nTaught I'm reading um yeah in a couple of weeks I'm actually start to outline at an earnest and then go from\nThere yeah um well I Want to talk about the miraculous because as I say there are a lot of people listening I I think your average person believes in the idea of miracles and stuff I just think the challenges\nAre they happening today can I see something\nToday and uh I always say I want to encourage people like absolutely but let's be realistic and doesn't mean that you know right now I mean I've got an e problem right\nUh I Know God can heal a miraculously and I've prayed a number of times people have pray it hasn't been healed yeah\nSo you don't want to make it sound like oh this is

anybody [noise]\nUh [noise] is a is still listening to this music but I got to tell you folks\nI Am a Barry Manilow fan I'm proud of it and are entities miracle Monday what a perfect time I'm sitting here with my friend ... Walberg rip we're talking about the miraculous return that you've seen this kind of stuff was the first time in your life that you saw an outing out miracle that you just said whoa like I you know\nUh [noise] in in this timeframe are probably\nI'm actually something as simple as a headache we'll lady walk into our church who is a part of our church on Sunday Morning and she had a migraine headaches you suffered from migraine headaches and sore worshipping God and guts as prefer headache in front of everybody now wait a minute\nGods as the tea mhm is he right there you this is so normal to you but the fact that you hear a God tells you to pray for a woman's headache to me that's a miracle like that's incredible how do you when you say you hear from God how does that work for you can you describe that to people who don't hear from God insured\nNot not in it for me not audible voice but impression um sometimes it just sounded like a sentence of sounds awesome like a conversation and in your head but it has a different tone to it it's like a you know some kind of tenor to it\nAnd um so it's impression sometimes you'll see things I'm this week I was at the meeting and praying praying for anxiety\nWell it was just that I in my mind I saw a whole bunch of people and the like it was the impression of the word anxiety were breaking his idea of of people [noise]\nOkay so this is I mean but to me that already is miraculous that that God is speaking to you I mean look when Ken fish that this came just as I get a sense that got God is is doing something and this group of people you know anybody here have a respiratory problem like you didn't somehow I don't know\nWhenever you hear anybody do that we've all seen a phony version of it in movies and stuff and they make fun of it but the point is\nGod really does speak this way and you're sitting here and you're telling me that's what happened so so that tells you when was this one and this was probably um two thousand twelve okay at that point yeah so so around then you're in a service ... and you feel God telling you pray for some of these headache yes\nSo because again it was taking a whole group of people and helping walk with them through something\nFrom your ... you're going to move the church into doing this to exactly and so he's just do this and\nIt was it attached to a head or person yes there was it that show person um\nFirst of all let's be more specific these are friends of yours yes okay they're walking downtown in Lancaster, Pennsylvania\nAnd that yeah that because what we're trying to do is is share the love of God as we go so when we're about our daily life not trying to just be event minded with evangelists and Russia are the good and so they saw a guy and they walked up and\n... ... ... in the course of their conversation they they realize that he's blind in his ... yeah just in one I just want to yeah and um so they asked if they could pray for him and they did and at first nothing happened and then eventually they parted ways but as he was walking away\nThey could see him from behind and he was kept moving his hand in front of his own face and they could see it from back in so he came back up to them afterwards and said when I was walking away from you I can see my I I was doing all this because I could see my I all of a sudden was restored as I was walking away from you\nYou know I always send to people who like by a metal detector and they go down the beach and they're looking for for something\nYou don't need to buy a metal detector you could just pray for people in the name of Jesus and it's not going to happen every time it's like a metal detector like you've got to kind of walk up and down the beach and see whatever but\nMan when you get something what could be more exciting than the idea that Jesus healed a man's I on the street and only because they pray for him yeah yeah like it wasn't it wasn't you know some big event they just chose\nTo to move and to to to talk to him and then to pray for him [noise]\nAnd and you get rewarded with something that you'll never forget for the rest of your life\nOh my gosh and it's so deeply enriching to her own soul which ... it'll make your day you just walk away and you're like you're good for the rest of the\nI've I've had a number of miracles I I've written about some of them in my miracles book and I'm I'm working on the story of my life you know coming to faith and everything and I'm In I'm going to put some more those miracles\nIn the in that book but I've never seen this kind of a miracle you pray I pray for my dad's ... many many times he's got macular degeneration he's not even one and you know I haven't seen healing a ... it really would be so encouraging to see something like that but I still believe\nI'm believing God and I'm going to keep praying and keep praying but the idea that your friends\nThe jury and experienced and I remember the Los Angeles then he ... he was in Shreveport, Louisiana he would preach uh Times Square church and he talked about this that that that they would a Walker and neighborhoods and pray for people and he remembers that they pray for this guy and one time after they paid for him a few times\nHe was able to see and you know ... it's\nNo so you just absolutely stunning\nYeah of of been a lot of times it takes a few times we had this will happen to be a meeting again number of years ago but um when Ken was in to our church and my my right hand guy Brent walked in this one night with a crutch\nAnd after the kids prayed over him actually probably eleven times did the crush turned into a serpent it did not oh good good but he walked out with the crutch over his shoulder\nSo he he experienced the change in a blue as my in a wonderful way of course it blew his mind and he's just never forgotten about that either you know\nI tell you we don't when when you start thinking about this just logically that if God can do this\nIt really feels like why wouldn't we push in even more to see more and more and more because lives have changed I mean if somebody doesn't believe in Jesus and you pray for them and something happens yeah boy oh boy that's I mean that's how people came to face\nWhen Jesus was walking this er yeah yeah so why wouldn't we try it today\nThat's what I'm thinking like Jesus didn't have um events he just taught his disciples the kingdom has your about your life\nIt's ... it's crazy enough um we have one more segment we're going to be right back but folks I Want to remind you we're we're raising money from winds defending freedom they defend religious liberty in this country\nFor free so if you are somebody or that get sued a for you know no good reason but for a bad reason that you have a biblical view of sexuality and somebody doesn't like it and they decided to sue you you could lose your job a lengthening bring him steps in and says wait a second\nThis is America and in America we have this thing called religious liberty it's happening all the time now I'm Sorry to say but the good news is alliance defending freedom um is there a\nAnd we had a couple of weeks ago I talked to fire chief of

their point about temperament which I Do think is disqualifying it was on a draft\nBy senator Collins this afternoon it it's really the elephant in the room and the prospect of a Supreme Court justice having in fact an enemies list I think is truly Petra fine for our democracy\nI mean I say something about this lack of judicial temperament this alleged enemies list because of the outburst that are in and I'm putting out bursting quotes that the left is accusing Brett Kavanaugh of having engaged and when he defended himself against an allegation that he\nSexually assaulted a woman at a party\nJuly twenty sixteen\nThis person said this and I'm quoting I Can't imagine what this place would be I Can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president\nFor the country it could be four years for the court it could be I don't even want to contemplate that now it's time for us to move to New Zealand [noise] that was an interview that this person did with the New York times\nThen the next day what CNN the same person referred to President Trump as quote a fake her quote\nShe is a fake or she has no consistency about him he says whatever comes up to his head at the

moment he really had an ego how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns the press seems to be very gentle with him on that in the ... you know he said\n\nTo also said this was his candidacy or Trump's Kennedy quote at first I thought it was funny to think there's a possibility that he could be president I think he's gotten so much free publicity every other presidential candidate has had to turn over tax returns\nInto food you know so the\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg she most certainly did and then what she apologized she said I shouldn't have said it\nOn reflection my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill advised and I regret and making them judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office in the future I Will be more circumspect and of course\nThis\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hair fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record ... fans on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups [noise]\nThis is worse\nShe said it over a period of two days to give an interview with the New York times give an interview with CNN\nAnd just trash Trump one more time\nI Can't imagine what this place would be I Can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump with our president for the country could be four years for the courts it could be I don't even want to contemplate that now it's time for us

more circumspect\nNo harm no foul nobody brings it up but because of what Kavanaugh said after having been accused of sexual assault well he lacks appropriate judicial temperament he\nGot an enemies list I I'm not I'm not about angry or or fat or as a member of the United States Senate because it is the result\nOf a cover up beginning with a concealment of millions of pages of documents a sham straight jacket and investigation of course the things will get Merrick Garland even a hearing and now a moment of direct threat that sickening\nAnd frightening moments that caused John Paul Stevens a former justice for the United States Supreme court has said it was just qualify\nAnd of course you remember this confrontation\nThat doesn't mean that young girl\nIn you know quiet because one\nOf the
