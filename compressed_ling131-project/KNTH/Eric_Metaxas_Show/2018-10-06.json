I've done this far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we have seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in a land then fine I'm okay with that but then we attributed powers it does not have a forty it does not have\nGranted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual right into person up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans\nAre going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like them and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\n\nThink about this guys think about this I don't care if you're on the left or the right can we agree on something and let let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes should a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself\nYes should a white man should a Hispanic\nMan should uh and we could go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense unfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to get a dose of honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as the Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the let just supposed to be team black right I began this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way I support\nA person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is sad or we've seen Republican and Democrat lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not to take this Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen 'em come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\n\nReally we did um I'm looking forward to hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open Gary and he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile by people\nAnd Republicans desert Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile by people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there's an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yeah blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats\n\nAnd Democrats support gun control do see this guy's\n\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney who\nBasically\nSupported Obamacare lite\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be worse accepting things we don't want or don't believe\nDo I have any liberal pardon me do I have any liberal Democrat by men out there who think that the government should have a right to profile black man how many Republicans do I have out there how many liberty might have a limited by the guy's going to say oh no man\nEveryone has a right\nTo be safe and secure in their persons in effect but that's where we're lacking do do that just got him when do you have you already forget that's my like eighties throwback kind of deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a

to know that uh they may want me to start paying them to do it but I spent a\nGreat year we've had some wonderful cast a it's a fun show to watch and people are really enjoying it it's the number one show on the TV and network and has been almost since its launch\nUm it's it's just been a great opportunity to give people just enough politics too informed them in a common sense way but it is intentionally not the kind of show that raises your blood pressure to three hundred over two hundred\nIt is a really designed to to be wholesome fun\nA variety of things we have comedians and music and\nA special features we we do a feature called in case you missed that we find obscure news stories and give a kind of a tongue in cheek looked at those stories and then we have serious newsmakers

they can do uh to attack this president or or take down his his nominees it's\nA scorched earth policy where do you see us going from here\n[noise]\nSo if we don't bring some sanity back to the system um I'm not sure that aren't great Republican survive long term and and for me Eric I Believe that what this comes down to is whether or not people who lose an election will accept the results\nWhat we're seeing is the outgrowth of people who never accepted the results of the twenty sixteenth presidential election and they spent the last almost two years trying to de legitimize the election\nAnd the person who won and every decision mix whether it was a decision involving protecting our borders where there was a decision in ... ah the negotiations with North Korea getting out of the deal of Iran every single thing this president does\nIts attacked whether legally or politically by those who were fused to accept that he is the president of the United states and that is a dangerous thing I didn't like it when President Obama was elected didn't vote for him either time um [noise] but I never ever\nThought that the way to deal with his presidency was to try to pretend that he didn't win the election and took ... he set elections have consequences\nIt appears that to uh to people on the left the consequences of the lecture and they don't like is to throw a tantrum act Petra slowly like a five year old a hold your breath to your face turns blue and scream and throw things across the room and break every window in the house\nIsn't that isn't that what George Washington did a it really is kind of funny actually because when you say that it it it makes a I I think\nMost people realize that something has happened in the country it's it's funny because I remember even\nThe election of two thousand and we have the hanging chads and that bizarre period no one had ever lived through anything like it where where you know the day after election you don't know who won in the week after you don't know who won and I remember at the time thinking this is undermining\nOur institutions because what it does is it it reads a kind of cynicism and people are that there are no clear answers that we've come to depend on you know a Supreme Court judges to make these decisions and somehow\nOr he did some things that I think we've been living with ever since that some of our institutions the things we take for granted\nA all seem to be called into question and when you have people are not a seeming to be able to accept the results of an election like this it it just reminds me of that it's ... it's bad for everybody I guess is the point where destroying ourselves with this kind of thinking\n[noise]\nWe truly are but what we're doing is is really teaching the wrong lesson to a up and coming young Americans are everybody doesn't get a trophy\nEveryone doesn't win sometimes you win sometimes you lose and the class and dignity with which you lose probably as a greater reflection of real character than how you handle your victories that's right and what we're seeing is a complete breakdown\nIn the class in character of people who did not get their way\nAnd who never grew out of this notion that I'm supposed to get a trophy oh wait you mean it didn't turn out like I Want it well then if I Can't when nobody can win and I'll just break the game up into a thousand pieces\n... that's what I'm saying or\nThe country can't survive that we can survive rate swings of the pendulum between the right in the ... we have before and we can again Democrats will be elected in the future but I Would say this to my Republican brothers and sisters\nWhen they are we take to the streets and we were funny hats and we refused to say that this person is our president and you know we screen the people in ... I don't even allow them to eat in peace at a restaurant\nOr go to their homes without being yelled Avon threatened if that's what we've become a\nDidn't truly that we've lost the country a ... and I

over this young woman for\nA while I Am and uh I admit freely that I'm about as objective regarding her as the New York times is about the president [laughter] so there is\nNo a pretense of objectivity but she's a tough kid and she's very good at what she does and I was in Chicago last night I was talking to some people who were telling me how much they love my daughter ... she was and and they said you know where did she get that I said well a couple of things first\n... two older brothers that were really mean to her\nAnd she had early on to the side that if she was going to survive she's going to have to fight back in stand your ground and she learned it or did she learned I mean after her brothers did things like super glue her fingers together\nYou sound like a couple of Irish sons have guns I really do I love the two of you because you you do you live your passion to use one of the cliches of our day\nBut you you use a your skills as journalists to tell these important story so for somebody who doesn't know anything about the story of ... you know obviously the movie is just coming out\nNow it's an important movie I Hope people will go see it desperately I Hope that and it's why I wanted to have you want for this hour but but tell us and in Salem um ... what are the\nBasic give us a thumbnail sketch in case somebody just tuning in they have never heard of this\nCriminal I mean who is going to have to pay them I mean what do you want to go ahead go ahead there are\nThis is this the perimeter of the ordinary or night so I was like such isn't a picture of a marriage it's like no you go darling no you go you go [laughter]\nCurb a God who is an abortion doctor who um is serving three light sentences and the principal in Pennsylvania for\nDelivering babies alive and then and then cutting our next whatsoever so he did that for Thirty years we've been ...\nBecause of the establishment who you who who\nYou know who wants to protect abortion did nothing about all the warning signs even though and in fact two women to either Hispanic and they still did not bring 'em so this is this ... this is the movie is actually about the trial\nThe investigation on the trial if we show nothing gory it's not at all like that it's a lot like a law and order episode but but I think they just went to a credit card Bill Gates I'm On a jury you know of\nPro pro abortion people actually over you know not pro life people convicted of murder for doing that and\nAssume brings up a lot of questions about how did he get away with it for so long\nUh why would a governor governor Tom Ridge a Republican governor Catholics have allowed that to happen during his during his time as governor and in fact why was it that that same governor said hands off the abortion clinics which was part of the reasons like off the last ...\nWatson discovered earlier um you know there's also the question that the story brings up and not the least of which is how did the media ignored that this happened once the story could break and was in the court in Philadelphia how it is that most people in the country have never heard credit golf name\nWhile we're having in very divided times and this is this is a horror knows if you want to know how divided they are\nA ... even when someone does a things as horrific as gruesome as this man did if somehow\nFalls under the rubric of of abortion nobody wants to know the facts and in this case up because we do have laws in this country we were forced to deal with the fact and this man as you said it's not behind bars\nServing three life sentences I mean this is an amazing thing so what precisely was this butcher convicted of that he is now behind bars for three lifetimes if that were possible\nFlow and he's you know he's convicted of murder and murder and\nBabies also killing his patient and you know he he won an abortion clinic there was a grand jury in Philadelphia and I'm sure a grand jury Philadelphia I've seen a lot\nThey called it a ... of horrors I'm about to get a lot to do this the the bodies were being the ... to ... to ... but they actually were literally piling up in a in his in his basement or ... bed waiting on them are coming out of a clinic\nOr the authorities didn't want to do anything and I you know we're ... we made a movie about it I Want to tell people look it's not it's not a gory it's gone a horror movie it's a courtroom drama and it's about the trial it's about\nHow how you go from being this mom being protected species or two detectives good detective some good lawyers realizing this sooner alright there's something wrong here on fighting against the political backlash\nWith media backlash to bring justice to let the machine or a boy so\nIf people want to know about the movie or just so ah 'cause people tune in and out of radio programs they can do to God's Nell movie\nDot com God's ... G O s N E L L God's Nell movie dot com um ... what what made\nThink the two of you that the movie needed to be made about this he wrote a tremendous book about it I Know the book did very well and people are interested in the book uh I Would recommend highly or that they get a copy of the book for all the details\nThose movies can never give those kinds of details but uh what what persuaded you to make a movie\nYou know nothing succeeds like like a movie in in in reaching a very wide audience um\nYou know not everyone read books\nThat don't have time or they don't they just don't like reading\nUm even documentaries or something that a lot of people you know don't really like to watch and we actually thought you know what you know what's really popular you know the crime genre is very very popular in the United states a lot of TV show with her about climate here for years with incredible crime story\nThat really happened um I think the truth you know it's true crime and you know at the central it is a very impressive investigation ... you know that's going on set with\nYou know they took me a cop Jim lord of the French with the story and then you know followed up very closely by the attorneys to women were legal investigates a story and put this guy behind bars um you know it it ... you know that's that's very much that I very much the attraction\nAnd and failing did you do wreck this movie\nNo real what we were used as a mixed seriously that veteran actor next year seat a directed at you know you probably know Nick from\nAh from justified the TV series but also Nick Nick was an actor and the shape of water he was also three billboards outside ebbing Missouri just just a names and you know are they going in and basically every movie you know a big movie the last\nFriday [laughter] he opposed us and he said that's what he wants to do that while he yeah he is he felt like this was something that he was he could do a really it's designed for him so he's done a good job\nUm you know thank God I didn't direct it uh you know as a journalist I Would have been too concerned with you know making sure that our the thing is you know its toll exactly ... you know but Nick Nick has about ... ... the story truth\nBut he's probably allowed to stay in Rio de ... into it I'm an told a story and that's very important we want this to be accessible to people I mean I'm a ... book was a best seller but you know that it's still a limited audience but a true crime drama in America\nFor a you know everyone watches out you know if you watch [noise] if you watch you know law and order you'll love this\nWhile I was gonna say that uh you know to tell a story like this\nIt is a gruesome story but you don't need\nTo show the horror you can apply it and there have been many films a that have dealt with abortion in moral bleak way this is of course before roe v Wade thing became hot button and movies don't touch it anymore\nBut there was a time when you could do that the movie ... feet with ah Michael Cain\nAnd Shelly winters brilliant movie from Nineteen sixty six\nUh it deals with an abortion and it just one of those things I Will never forget it they don't show anything but it just conveys the horror when we come back talk some talking to the authors of the book on ... does now and now they're behind the movie God's nail movie dot com is the website

our area you know pre screened offended they just think early it's fabulous has people will remember are billing the with the black guy for many years\nI'm not a great character actor until may think you're old\nWell I mean I Can't think of a more difficult role to play than this monster now you talk about a gods now of being ... you say and this is often the case with with people who have allowed\nGenuine satanic evil or into their lives that they there's often they can be very charming it's very creepy really uh the idea that somebody who is done\nHorrors unimaginable murdering\nBabies a bite sniffing their next would scissors one of the most gruesome things imaginable but he seems to be very jolly and cheerful and I I Want a strange thing\nYeah and like you know I mean you know he's ... he's got that kind of electric ... you know type of personality he you know he smiles he kept this very intellectual exploit very soft voice\nPosturing but when it comes to things like this are not only don't they care they often\nActively look the other way and I and I think that we are as parents and community leaders\nHave to take our young people to see this it is absolutely vital that we show them what is happening and they say it's American let them know that it's up to you to do something about this that this cannot continue and the fact that it continued as long as it did how many years was was the operating this house of horrors this guy's now\nWhat Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he's he he you know when he's operating within the city and we know that Seventeen of those years several teen of those years no one expected the clinic\nNo one of the department of health decided to to to see you know to do that and that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know but people need to know what's going on in the country we one of the parts of the film that we you know where most crowd opened up they think it's really important that we only certain ... were very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of credit card bill you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain\nTo the jury what a good portion good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between bass and murder 'em and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors\nWho who commented on that particular effects that the movie as educational to them as alert they learn something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine at least it's a very highly qualified to work all over the United states of America did not know\nSo this is why exactly what you're saying you know people get to go because they're going to get an education and it's the other side it's just like law and order episode you have this you know of course your doctor on the stand as can you describe\nA legal abortion to the to the jury and I remember feeling the night at the very beginning of this process that whatever how that testimony will be in the movie in the movie script was very important to us because we believe no one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first\nOn the court ... and and no one can criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcript of the trial you know it wasn't you know what would you know writing their you know um and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have it where where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and on you know on varnish way and I think it's ... it's quite shocking for people who hear it even people who think they know that subject there'll be quite shocked to hear that's\nThing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so well and certainly both of you do but but what God's nails did that makes them a serial killer or it's not just of course that he's doing very late term abortions which are gruesome but\nUnfortunately quite legal in America but he was also because he made a lot of money\nOf ah killing children ... that we are viable obviously and you describe a described that early on but but but these children would often be born alive and he would he would murdered them uh and and that is really why he is behind bars is it not\nYeah yeah I mean is he he he he murdered babies born alive he he murdered his own patients by the way a by allowing on registered unqualified style to give them a space here and he also operated on ...\nUm you know he he ...\nHe also did it in in the the the legal limit for abortion and in Pennsylvania is an incredible twenty four weeks an incredible twenty four weeks like you know six months she was six months pregnant and having abortion\nHowever that wasn't good enough for him heated even earlier than that uh during the week and then on the week on Sunday\nIt abortion sold at that he didn't trust any of the other members of style to a system to him and his wife did what he called the special kids is no if he was doing twenty four plus during the week what would you do in the weekend you know nine months and months nine months and that's that's what he was on\nAny new nobody would prosecute him he was ... quite confident that he could get away with this obviously with the with the with the liberal abortion climate in America and especially in Pennsylvania\nAnd he was white with right because we knew and we knew he was right because we know despite multiple complaints I Love to lots of complaints and in fact they all you know get complaints came to light during the grand jury investigation you know I get\nAll of the matter how bad things got and obviously I mean it doesn't get much worse than to women dying noticing what inspired the department of health and Pennsylvania to inspect\n... and you know that's a new reason why people need to go and see the movie if this is happening ten fu ... century not in some ... some other century now in the back in the dark ages because now it's happening now in\nPennsylvania or it can go to where you live in wherever you're listening to bring any holiday in Pennsylvania\nYou don't get more correct it the Pennsylvania you know get more progressive than the city of brotherly love the city\nWhere an hour we're going

and less than a meteor\nHits the earth tomorrow Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the next justice of the Supreme Court now I Want to say something\nTo those of you who have no problem saying all women should be believed all men should not be believed\nFor those of you who felt that it's perfectly OK to accuse somebody who's had up until now impeccable reputation of a sexual assault\nAny cooperating witnesses corroborating evidence\nAnd that's not to say and I never have said and I defy you to find when I have said that Dr Christine Blasey Ford has a liar I never said that I Do think something happened to her\n\nIs not my job to determine what happened to her though it's my job to determine whether or not\nWe have we have fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but certainly got to be more likely than not which is what she said\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have voucher his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of an allegation before given that he's now when you're gone seven background checks given that the four people stopped forward say where they're all say they have no recollection of it\nThat does not meet the standard of more likely than not\nFor those of you who were yelling and screaming berating people like breathing Senator Flake\nLook at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying they believe in a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America you have been listening\n\nFor those of you who took up on this issue [noise] not really so much because you're concerned about the issue because you want to stick it to Trump because as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about Kavanaugh is because they believe you overturn roe v Wade\nNot listen to me very carefully somehow\nSome way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining its laws on abortion\nIn states like New York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had abortion pretty much on demand\nThere's no reason to believe that if when roe v Wade or to be overturned in a matter of goes back to the states the land skate would shift in a sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd in ... states if roe v waiver overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly enact anti abortion laws given their unpopularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot what change now how and why Robie way became known as a quote right to an abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox\nThat Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago\nAbout the opening of the papers of justice black man he was re sign a rub the author of the decision and he thought it was going to be a very narrow decision he thought that the decision on whether or not women should have an abortion was a medical decision one that should be made by doctors\nAnd he almost issued a warning that the decision are not be can be construed any other way he was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a man gets woman thing just because everything that you dislike and Donald Trump\n\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think he focused because you think he's a bigot because you think he's a racist because you think this because you think that\nYes what his approval ratings are up\nHe's now a fifty percent according to Rasmussen guess what the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans do have to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two in favor of Democrats\nGuess what\nThe attack\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh effected some left us have referred to him as a attempted rape is for a serial rapist\nExcluded a backlash and the backlash is\nGoing to motivate Republicans even when Kavanaugh gets on because you've already signal that you intend if you take over the house to open up a piece when investigations so I'm urging Republicans not to let their guard\nDown just because Kevin ... is likely to be confirmed\nFor those of you who feel very strongly the other way and feel that just a referendum against women that it means that you don't believe women I mean she's not taking a rape and abortion what rape and sexual assault and things like that seriously\nYou haven't been listening I Know you're just like this\nBut one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected because he promised to nominate judges that would follow the constitution this is now he's second one and God willing the creek don't rise\nAnd it gets re elected he may have one or two more so for all of you who are very very unhappy\nAbout this I Want to see this very sincerely\n[laughter]\n\n\n\nSo are you where are you [noise] do you try [laughter]\n[noise] corner Ted Cruz and restaurants is safe to\nI watched it on Fox Fox had a little box in the lower right hand corner of a of people who appear to be in the hallways of maybe Congress holding up signs anti Kavanaugh science we believe for we believer and\nAs calling for speaking she woke almost half hour she started out very slowly and you didn't know where she was going to go kind of builds up to it [noise] you could see the screen and the bottom right the there were two women that were in the forefront and you could just tail they weren't happy\nThe way this thing was going and they put their hands over their head when she began to wrap up when you can tell she was going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh they just looked at destroyed\nAnd as I'm watching them and I'm listening to comment I said did you hear anything she said\nWith with what she said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you\nDon't you care about how she ... got to her position\n[noise] she said she spent more time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief to she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she can understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine force testimony and very sensitive Lee said as I said before that uh that she believed her she believes something happened before we can assign what happened to her to Kevin Oh there's got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply their standard of beyond a reasonable doubt it to a moral certainty certainly have got to be at least more like even the knot and she went over the evidence in such a name for people who she claims were were there and the four people either have no recollection of it or say they weren't there now now where do you do with that\nIn ... also said that the person who who took her to the party or or or brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly she didn't say that about didn't fly I added that but um she got home somehow and whoever it is who got her home never came forward and told us of who he or she was\nAnd so given the background of having all the reputation of Kavanaugh all the women that have supported him all the women he's worked with with no allegation\nAnd we're going to deny him a seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot corroborate her claim that doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where does know how she got there is no how she got back didn't tell anybody\nShe said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness tests and everything she said it was reasonable she's a moderate but the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't listening or have turned it off or felt that somehow it didn't make any sense I mean did you not hear what you had to say\nDoes not matter that you wanted people to think through how 'bout you wanted to be an FBI investigation that you have more confidence that Dr Ford allegation had been thoroughly bet if you
