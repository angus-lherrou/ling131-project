Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said bullies who identify as girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and\nSo it's a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show but we've been talking about what the dangers of\nAdopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms are the opposite sex well\nI don't really understand how can a little kid identify and gender fluids I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... cursed elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean\n... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah the the school district policy made this\nIt was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify\nAnd we're going to respect the desires of the child in the ...\nIn this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom ... a young boy that identifies as gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her and I and I sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade or it's posh his daughter and to give a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but with the the bigger problem is the school and a blend assemble\nWho ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what is that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies and indicators unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today the schools essentially say okay\nWe're not going to question that we're not going to determine whether that there's a better accommodations we can\nThat we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to ... regardless of the impact it has on other students\nWell it it's just a stunning thing that it's possible for a little girl I'm to be exposed to anything of any kind of a sexual nature when she just wants to go to the bathroom I mean the fact that because we all know that there are very troubled\nKids out there we don't know or anything it seems about this boy but the very idea that it's described as something of a sexual nature at this age it's just horrifying but you're telling me that the school\nHad this policy so they could not stop this boy from going into the girl's bathroom\n[noise] not only that but after all of this you would think the school might reconsider\nIts policy it hasn't done so you would think the school might even just say look maybe we ought to make sure posh his daughter and this boy you're no longer in the same classroom that didn't happen as well at left Pasha with the only option of taking her daughter out of that school something any parent would do when the school is so unresponsive to what happened here\nAnd that just shows that this is this is not about you know trying to keep the students interest first what it's about the school\nStanding by this a very dangerous unsafe policy even in light of evidence of harm it resulted in to pass his daughter\nWell I I think what you see happening over and over ... is that people have no courage when it comes to these kinds of cultural issues in other words everybody knows right now the easy thing to do is to go along with this sort of you know transgender trend and if you bucket people are going to say well are you are you a big it\nAnd so typically people in authority school authorities people in corporations they have very little courage in other words they just want to do whatever they need to do to not get in trouble and in this case who's going to suffer the kids so so they're not doing their job and they're forcing this mother to take her little girl\nOut of the school because they refuse to do their job I mean that strikes me as a what is happening here\nYeah that's exactly right you know the school has a lot of options that it could have offered to this young boy a dove given him a single user restroom that he has access to but what it should never do adopt a broad sweeping policy that says use whatever restroom you want go in there with a little girls are in there and that is the danger\nOf these policies as for other than taking a stand and say no we're not going to compromise the privacy and safety of our other students were going to find solutions but we're not going to do it at the expense of everyone else they took the roof to say no let's just adopt is brought sleeping policy let's not have the courage to take a stand and say is is really best for all of our students\nAnd we're not going to do anything to compromise the safety of ... shows daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I when I grew up there we would be in a world that is in some ways a crazy that this is craziness when you when you cannot\nUh have a common sense to say that a five year old\nShould not be given the option to identify as an anything other than what he is which is a little boy the idea that this kid is gender food I mean the question is did a doctor say that he needs to be a treated this way did his parents say it we don't really have those facts but the idea that\nThese schools are so afraid\nOf doing something wrong that they are allowing this to go on it really is a kind of madness I think we have to call it what it is it's a kind of madness a but it has to do with religious liberty in this case because ah as the lengths defending freedom has\nSaid over and over and over uh the people who believe that men are men and women are women were were were being treated like where this crazy minority when most Americans understand these ideas about these transgender trends have just been pushed on us and here you have a case where\nA this woman passionate Thomas ah his is not being treated right now what what are you and what is the ATF looking for in this case because you said that this woman I'm a I mean who who is suing whom and what are the details of that suit\nAs things stand right now we we had worked with Pasha to file a complaint with the federal government with the department of education office of civil rights and we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is\nNot only is you know this is a dangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law by adopting\nThis policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in and creating a hostile environment for policy has a daughter and and other young girls at this school so that's a bright light and all of this is that we now have a federal government is taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work throughout that investigatory process\nUh but at the end of the day what we're wanting is a good policy in place one to ensure something like this doesn't happen when that ensures that girl showers locker rooms and restrooms are reserved for girls ... and the young men and boys don't have access to them\nHang on one second folks are going to be right back oh we're talking with the alliance defending freedom smashed sharp on the air much access show\nHey there it's aired ma taxes for policy genius here's an on fun fact over half of bankruptcies in mortgage foreclosures are caused by medical issues that's

go to my taxes talk dot com and you can give right there\nWhere there is the phone number I'm now ... you know I I just want to say that a few years ago I Would hear people bring up cases like this like the case of of jak Philips and are kind of roll my eyes and say you know the people always they're always complaining about these these are these kind of fringe these crazy stories and\nAnd the time has passed and I think to myself you know I I've met jak Philips I've met a who was the the other the the the bakers of photographers who ... practically lost their business because all they did was say\nWe're Christians we cannot participate in a same sex a wedding ceremony it goes against our values against our religion\nAnd those people are told hey shut up do as you're told or we will sue your rear end you know all the way back to zero you will lose everything now\nWhen I when I really understand this I think this is the definition of an American in America you're supposed to have\nAnd right now people like that are being told you better do this or you lose everything now I Want to go back to Jack Philips tell us the story about jak thoughts and then I'm going to talk about the new case the jak Philips has\nSo jak Philips has a cake artist and does incredible designs on a variety of things but he's always operated consistent with certain ... certain cakes he won't designed he won't use utilize its artistic talent towards things like I'm celebrating Halloween but he doesn't like the\nYou know devil imagery and all of that stuff or a cakes that are a denigrating the American flag or or mocking any group of people well he was approached by a couple that asked him to do a cake celebrating their same sex\nUnion and jak politely declined and said you know I I Can't use my artistic designed to to create a cake that celebrate something that I think violates God's plans for marriage and as a result he was sued by\nThis couple and the state of Colorado are at fault all the way to the Supreme Court losing at every step of the way and we were able to represent 'em free of charge and gets to the U.S Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says no Colorado you cannot have hostility towards ... believes\nHe's entitled to those and you're a efforts to to denigrate those and punish them for those is unacceptable and so that's where it ended up that's we thought was the end of the story was that Jack was going to be indicated in his right to work and create are consistent with his beliefs\nRight so that that's step one right so um I've met Jack\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with the when the civil rights commission\nThat had just lost at the Supreme Court\nUsed jacks case against\nHim and said oh we're going to fight your own case defined probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body but\nGive him the freedom to decline certain cakes that saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks\nAh one we're fighting the civil war when we were fighting the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight a and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this was a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody it's just not us against them God Forbid the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do as I said his vote\nA please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again\nA and I want to say uh if you can give to the audience defending freedom I don't know anybody that is doing this kind of work right now so I Want to say go to my taxes talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny again will be doubled up please give what you can\nVisit folks this is why God gives us money\nAn energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it is tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually\nThey're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values are you going to say uh where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn to sending freedom so the number in case you don't have a a website you can go to my taxes talk dot com if that's difficult\nOr you can call one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six\nTwenty seven Seventy a match sharp uh what else are we looking at what other cases are out there right now because this seems to be a never ending\nThat's right I think one of the other big issues we've been working on dealing with a adoption and foster care providers\nSo we have a a crisis in our country with a four hundred thousand kids in the adoption foster care system about a hundred thousand kids\nAre eligible for adoption and we need organizations out there recruiting families trained them helping to connect kids with forever homes but the same uh effort to\nPunish faith based organizations just to the same hostility we saw towards the jak or announcing towards these agencies and so in Philadelphia in Massachusetts and Illinois and other places faith based agencies have been shut down run out of business simply because they want to operate\nConsistent with their view about the best environment to raise a kid that every child deserves a mother and father and so at the same time for example in Philadelphia that the city was saying we desperately need more foster care parents\nAre just a few days later they were shutting down by Catholic social services because\nThey didn't like Catholic social services views about marriage and this again shows this ongoing hostility and the impact it's having on kids that they're being denied of organizations out there working to find them homes they're being denied of these families that\nWould have been recruited all because this effort to push an ideology and for the government to punish those that don't like that they don't like their beliefs\nI have to say if this doesn't make you mad folks if this doesn't make you mad I I just assume\nYou're not listening because this is horrendous and the only good news and that's why I'm here folks I'm not here to complain is to say you can do something about it one of the things you can do and I hope you will do is give to the alliance defending\nFreedom it doesn't matter what you give give something we've got to help them do

have a value or let's call it a religious value that that you say I I feel uncomfortable with this or I feel uncomfortable with that\nThe government is increasingly saying oh we don't really care how you feel about your little religion shut up and do X Y or Z now I gotta say states of America\nAre traditionally we've had religious liberty the government cannot tell you or what\nI'm you've got to act it it's not enough to pray or to hope you have to do those things and you have to act and acting means you know a a glorifying God with your with your whole life with how you spend your time with

about this and I've come to the conclusion unfortunately and I send fortunately disturbing that they were right that if we do not fight\nFor these things that we believe in uh we're going to lose what we have the freedoms in America okay so religious liberty you are right to believe what you believe and to act on it or to not do something because of your faith\nUm it it's under attack and ATF lines defending freedom they're standing up for it so um anyway let me just to be specific ah America's a hundred and fourteen so I think Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in\nUm ... last night uh okay uh and he's going to start work\nToday which is kind of freaky right they're gonna they're going to work today and he's on the okay now alliance defending freedom this is the these are the folks that we're talking about and we just talk to 'em one of their lead guys met sharp in our one about transgender and all this different stuff\nThey won a seven to two decision from the Supreme Court just this past June okay\nDefending the man that we were talking about in the last hour Colorado bicker jak Philips\nOf firm actions by the Colorado civil rights commission and these people are unhinged lunatics I mean I have to say what they did it really it disturbing and the more you know about it the more I'm just telling you folks that you have to you have to fight because these people are and hinged\nSo they so the Supreme Court ... ... ah gave a seven to decision thanks to alliance defending freedom this is my point lengthening freedom for free argued on behalf\nOf jak Philips is something that shouldn't even have to go to court it's insane but despite the ruling okay this same agency okay the people I've just said our and hinged\nThey have again targeted jak Philips and we talked about in the last hour but I Want you to hear an ATF has a lawyer and there's a there's a clip here we go\nHe's back in it all over again um and so ADS on behalf of Mr Philips has not only helping him defend that action but as also filed affirmatively inaction in Colorado federal court saying that these violations of his religious free exercise rights\nNeed to be stopped a right at the courthouse skate so that he doesn't continue to be persecuted [noise]\nBook so to think about that thinking about this and and we discussed it in the last hour I don't want to vote labor it but it's it's lunacy\nAnd you can't just say oh it's lunacy you have to you have to fight the lunacy otherwise Lucy is taking over so um anyway the alliance defending freedom they are in fact second to none in defending religious liberty including arguing in winning cases before the stream Supreme Court as I just said\nBut they do this for free it costs a lot of money so you my listeners can help right now

through how it works yeah ah because we took those principles that transformed those young men and we find it and to operating principles and others have you have a school like I started in Milwaukee Fifteen Years ago one school the Bradley Foundation gave us a grant\nTo go into one school if you have a group of ... a let's say a thousand students are controlled by ten percent\nAnd that ten percent ten percent\nSo if you so if you get youth we put about eight years to ... and young adults from the community many of them have dropped out of those same schools they have been transformed and they are moral mentors and character coaches so they they spent two weeks to a dentist by who had a shot callers that people\nThis is this is really funny this is a movie by you understand somebody needs to make a movie about this 'cause this is real\nAnd so what happens if you're a dentist by that ten percent of the Cold War and then you reach out to them and and you give them a respectful way to be peaceful and ah and then they influence the other uh a Ninety percent and that's why we're able\nTo go into a school most dangerous schools we only went up to one and the principal said\n... ah I'm not getting reports from teachers or something we what do we call it climate survey we as teachers is\nDo you feel safer than the principal and the superintendent says hey the police are not getting calls to the school every so we did this one school\nThen we ... we went to a second we created the demand for it then the principal said and the soup pretend that can you do this to six schools so now we're going to Fifteen and it's Fifteen Years now we have been really is a Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nAnd it's a dramatic this dramatic wonderful stuff I Want to keep talking

the studio to Bob Woodson of the woods in center you need to go to Woodson center dot org I'm Bob eat you um you write you write books you write articles you are an article not very long ago\n... year anniversary of the horror of what happened in Charlottesville a little bit over a year ago or I Want to talk to you about a little bit about that where was that published this was in the hill are saying okay you know they tell us about what you're saying that article what\nI said in his article it was about the so called social justice warriors tearing down the statue of a of a civil war a character is just happened just happened\nAnd they tore down into police stood by and they thought they were a virtue a posturing for the country and so I wrote an article saying as a civil rights veteran I Am against a on all totally opposed\nTo taking down those symbols those channels we first of all it's a waste\nOf time it's a it's a distraction if symbols were related to substance than the safest places in America should be Martin Luther king boulevard\nBut it isn't just the most dangerous places\nSo I I think that it it because symbols are important for us to just because you want to remember something doesn't mean you're in bracing celebrating it the very fact that the Jews wanted the Holocaust museum so that people would not remember\nAnd as I said in the column and the Christian cross we don't look at it and think about the oppression of Romans we bet because the story of the cross is the resurrection\nUh and so that's how we are too but if we don't have the symbols around and we will forget and so I just think that it's a it's a distraction for people on the left\nTo a as an act of ... uh uh of social justice to take claim to be social justice warriors from taking them down\nAnd when we ought to be taking it does nothing for\nThe thousands of blacks were being killed in an inner city since so because we're taking attention away from those the the real problems facing America and that is the violence the increase in drug addiction opioid overdoses uh there's so many other problems but it's a distraction\nAnd it's it's it's cheap posturing or that's going to ...\nYeah and that's you know when he talked about cheap posturing I I really feel like the whole\nUh raised industry today it's become something that I I think to myself\nI Know many many uh African Americans and I went to college when I went to Yale University and they went to Yale University\nAnd they didn't grow up in a working class background I grew up in a working class background and so when you look at things to racial ends it really does become genuine racism it it it you you you can't see beyond that lens and it seems like we've gone backwards and that right now\nWell executive director of the second year allow the moms to burn toy vouchers by sewing by babysitting by performing certain chores that they would then or in a voucher and the toys that were collected workplace\nIn a store so the moms could shot for their own children so this is the fundamental principle that we should follow when we're trying to help the poor\nAssume that they desire to they've got the ability to and the agency to help themselves that you should never do more for people than they are willing to do for themselves\nWhile that's I mean again that's perfect common sense but the concept of dignity but it seems to have gone out of the culture it's not a part of the vocabulary of this culture dignity now I Know that when I think of\nCivil rights heroes like Rosa Parks Dr King Jackie Robinson there was tremendous dignity it seemed to be the main thing you notice with these people dignity that's just not a word that you hear\nNo but all of our grassroots leaders that's what\nWhat what really has help restore them is they their embrace of the ... the fundamental virtues and principles of our founders\nFelt self determination we look for agency we look for an opportunity to health\nAnd so we go in with the expectation that you have the answers to your own problems and therefore we will give you help we will give you access to money we will give you access to training\nBut the solutions have to come from you I'm not going to come and paint show walls you pay your own\nBall [laughter] that's the I mean it it it's wise is funny it's funny to me because it's so it's delightful to hear you say these things 'cause this is obviously true and anybody but a fool recognizes this I mean this is basic human stuff unless you really have a view of people that is deeply patronizing\nYou recognize that that people want dignity people want to be able to work people want to be able to earn something but it's as if it's not as if ... ... people cultural elites who have bought into these bad ideas are training\nOr people who are under privileged to think like victims and to say that dignity is a dirty word you don't need dignity you don't need pride you don't need to just take because it's yours you deserve it\nAnd I I think that we're training people somehow to think against themselves like people\nHave needs but more important than that they need to be needed\n\nBut that was a big spiritual statement you know I mean I really knew who\nBe needed but also a lot of well a lot of us suffer from intellectual Adidas him that when we come to an educated low income people\nThey always come is if we have something to offer you have nothing to receive I always approached people with the expectation that I'm going to leave\nHere better as a consequence of me meeting you but you got to subordinate the inclination to believe that\nCertification is synonymous with qualification\nMm [noise] well listen you you have you have lived that out that's what I find so beautiful is that these are just some nice ideas you you've you've you've put them into practice over decades and decades I mean it's an amazing thing and I don't know a with a track record of the woods in a\nA center is but you guys I Can't even imagine how or over all these decades\nWell I can tell you some examples of that we work with Jack Kemp a for seven years when he was in Congress yeah and we uh we we uh got seven amendments to the Housing Act\nSo that the gave the opportunity for low income people in in public housing too to own their own property a and one of our people do on sixty minutes Bertha Gilkey\nThat we we demonstrated that when you give low income leaders to power to change their communities that they can make dramatic changes in one community for ten years four hundred and eighty kids went to college from just one public housing project\nAnd they just about wiped out teen pregnancy a and the name of the woman this can be great streets name
