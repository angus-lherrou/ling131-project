great I Love reading or work\nThey can listen to this because this this sums up what we saw what the Kavanaugh hearings but I Want you to look at this through the prism\nOf your right to bear arms and she typed it together here very well for you because she understands you'll see what the right to bear arms is all about ... about ...\nIn this house understands that\nDue process these people were throwing due process for as long as it's in their best interest Hillary Clinton wouldn't want to abolish the electoral college if the electoral college got her the election would she of course not of

process rights you know like the presumption of innocence the right to counsel and the right to confront their accusers\nAren't they they really are right let's continue these basic protections we are told or just part of the toxic masculinity that contributes to quote unquote rape culture\nOn campuses so due process extra go\n\nShe continues in fact this week we've seen the accusation equals conviction narrative elevated to the national level\nSeveral Democrats and pundits have stated expressly that Brett Kavanaugh indeed any conservatives man\nShould be presumed guilty and have to prove his innocence meanwhile Democrat men like former President Bill Clinton and more recently representative Keith Ellison way to go Minnesota get a pass\nEven with abundant evidence of their misdeeds\nAnd government deprivation of our constitutional rights is far less likely if we can defend ourselves\nAgainst it so the second amendment has to go are you getting the picture yet\nIt isn't

Senate providing advice and\nConsent isn't this amazing\nTo heart back to the days when someone would be elevated to that or to nominated for that position and the process be kind of like you don't go back to Lindsey Graham\nIs I think Lindsay's had an epiphany I think Lindsey sees these people are not my friend anymore they used to be my friends but I don't think from what I've seen this week that they're my friends anymore\nI have a sneaky funny feeling that they would probably do the same thing to me that they're doing to Mr Kavanaugh or if they felt they needed to get something I just don't think they're my friends any more I think Mr grant was finally figured that out is done owners we figured it out a long time ago right\nKnown time ago\nBut they're gonna step on whoever they have to

happy happy\nEvery single friday that I have broadcast [noise] which which which which\nWhich which which ...\nI haven't done that before [noise] quite a bit about stuff you know when you pay attention you are an asset\n[noise]\nThat\nI really enjoyed see that a lot of care if he enjoyed it but I really enjoyed\nBy Dennis Prager every single primary they broadcast since Nineteen Ninety nine since the twentieth century met remembered the twentieth century is the century after the nineteenth gives you an idea\nFor how long ago I began to show\nI'd be happy Missouri it affects a lot of people it's meant to me\nAnd my basic thesis is we are morally obligated to act happy even if we don't feel that I don't mean every single instance you've lost a loved one or expect you to go bouncing around I'm not I'm not living with twilight zone\nBut as a general statement that is the way it should be happy misses a virtue there are people who think I'm happy with us as a virtue they get more attention what is it the squeaky wheel gets the Greece\nI mean I like that you know hell rarely I get these things right by the way if you think gets the oil no gets the grease out here here's another one by the way a stitch in time saves nine\n[laughter] don't go down that road\nRight yes yes if you Google the greasy we'll get to the oil okay\nMy friend's based on the contemporary events the immediate events of the day I Would like to devote this hour of the happy with our to the question of can one\nBe happy after trauma\nThat's the question\nNow I have not undergone trauma undergoing very painful episodes in my life but I came up with him a claim any traumatic event I had a terrifying event the Soviet remaining border\nWhen I was smuggling out a dissident materials from Soviet Union was midnight to me anyway that I in fact I was so terrifying for reasons are all good into now that I got sick for about six weeks if\nIt's very interesting I I very rarely get sick\nIt is a I think terror has it affect on your I'm sure it does have some effect on your immune system\nBut I've not been traumatized there's never beat milk or sexually abused or anything like that\nSo some of you will have to respond accordingly nevertheless\n\nI Will offer a few thoughts and then I Will ask you the question of the hour is Cammy you\nResume or even increase happiness after a traumatic event\nMy immediate response is it am I think it's it is accurate it depends on the person some people are better equipped\nTo deal with a traumatic event than others\nThe same thing could happen to to people\nAnd one marches on and warm\nAnd sexually collapses forever I'm making zeroed judgment here zero this is the happiness our enough the judgments our enough to even the morality our just want to make that clear but for example\nOr one of the victim of she was a victim or a high ... absolutely no problem in state\nUsing that word it's wildly overused but ... but that doesn't mean there are victims\nBut this woman who was the one who brought Bill Cosby the trial\nA victim of his ... years ago when she was much younger obviously and claims that at all\nLife permanently\nAnd that means in his case again I mean the the allegations in this case charge that was found to be valid was that he would put in some sort of drug in their drink\nAnd then uh then use them sexually while ... or the ... while they were unconscious I is that is that the ... yeah okay\nSo\nShe she says that this changed her life\n\nAnd I am not making any judgment in my heart goes out to her I Believe that I Believe that that happened I Believe I Believe it happened to her and I believe that have changed her life I also know that there are women who have been raped\nThere are men who have had been beaten up terribly I mean there are all sorts of terrible things\nThat have happened and they have resilience to use the term that Dr mom or psychiatrist that I have on the show periodically is that's the that's the term in therapy or in the cycle therapeutic world resilience\nOr to put it in even more for macular\nTerm shock absorber as there are people who have better shock absorber is than others so the question is\nHow do you develop shock absorber is how do you develop Brazilians I think we can all agree that the ideal is not to let the trauma ruin your life\nIs it's one of the few things maybe all Americans couldn't agree on is that is that a fair statement we we don't want you to be permanently crippled\nIn this regard I always use or frequently use the Charles crowd hammer example it's hard for me to even see the lake Charles crowd hammer\n'cause I knew him a and adored him and anyway the lake Charles crowd hammer was in a diving accident medical school\nAnd\nHis life was completely altered he was paralyzed largely from the the the the shoulders down\n\nAnd he decided immediately I Am not going to let this determine my life\nI mean that's a pretty big trauma is that fair to say\nYour your stress you see pictures of him before the accident I mean this guy was just up\nAnd\nA hearing goes from credible athlete\nTerrific physique to paralyzed\nThat's paralyzed legs paralyzed I was with him\nGod it's so amazing 'cause it was one of his last appearance as I mentioned before he went to the hospitals with me out here in California for Prager University\nI think we should put the the video up I I ... I think people know him better and he's worth knowing\nSo ... I saw he was able if I'm not mistaken to to utilize somewhat warm arm\nI think that that was the extent of his ability to to move from the neck down and you know he\nI have trouble breathing I mean it's amazing what he accomplished if he were perfectly healthy it's amazing what he accomplished\n\nIf he were here he would say I I decided to immediately I'm not going to let this trauma ruin my life\nSo I I have a question\nCan you will\nHappiness after trauma or are you either equipped for not equipped to deal with it why couldn't Charles crowd hammer have that reaction and another person their life is ruined\n\nThis is unbelievably important question for those who haven't had something equivalent even\nKen you will happiness\n[noise]\nSo that's the question on the table on this happiness our\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThe dentist Prager show live from the relief factor pain free studio [noise]\n\nI I Am is upset about what the therapist told them as I Am elated by contribution to his wife ... I I've equal reactions to books\n\nThis is not meant well it is an insult but it's not meant to insult\nEvery Sarah ... I've ever interviewed said the majority of therapists or incompetence\nEvery single one by the way that's not unique incompetent just the human norm\nBought the telling a person who has been traumatized this is the new normal\nThis is this is it\nCharles crowd hammer ... would have looked at him and said get outta here you're the last person I Want to talk to\nThis is this is an impediment\nIt's not the new normal it's an impediment that's all it is\nSubject today is can you be happy if the trauma and my answer is you have to try\nTo be happy after trauma\nI Can't tell you what you can be I'm not you\nCan tell you what do you need to do\n\nOkay that was very powerful so the reason that I set it aside from the positive obviously of this of this program Leah in Dearborn Heights Michigan Hi Leah\nHi Dennis attached to this afternoon and I have to be fast I used to teach it at all girls a private school years ago and within two years we had to grow die and the reaction from their families was so different\nUm one family retreated into themselves\nOn the press never smiled 'em and they were fine before the girl died you know they were just\nNormal family happy happy and but they couldn't get over this poor girl staff\nThe other family um started a scholarship fund in their daughter's name at the school and made a donation cannot grad all built on the ground for school and took joy in the memory of their daughter\nAnd right you know [laughter] I don't know them well and now it\nIs a different times that's the point\nThat comes to the great philosophical question of free will\nWill be back in a moment this is the happiness our I'm Dennis ... the dentist Springer show live from the relief your brain freeze through the\n\n\n[noise] but that sarin News I'm Rhonda rock strict Canada in the U.S of officially announced they reached a deal for candidates to stay in the north American trade pact with the United states and Mexico\nIn a joint statement released Sunday night us trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian foreign affairs minister Christian Friedland announced the newly named in the U.

I went and at one point I looked at the audience was about four or five hundred I guess an atheist and I said so many of you ever doubt you're atheism\nYou know you you see a child born and you think whoa that's that's pretty amazing maybe there is a God not one hand went up then I said you know that's really interesting because every religious person I Know does periodically have doubts\nSo you guys have more certitude than we guys\nQuestion ourselves more than you do\nThey were stunned because their self image is we all of the questioners the religious or the ... well you're wrong it's just not true we engage in far more self inquiry venue guys on the on the atheist that's my proof\nThat is my proof by the way needless to say when did they have their annual convention Easter Sunday\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOh boy is in Minneapolis I remember it well by the way I just want to say to their credit\nThey gave me my my speakers fee upon her arrival not every religious organization does that just for the record [laughter]\n\nSo I Try to be fair\nOr by the way in the news department news news alert should I bring the news alert so they have voted to take the Kavanaugh\nA vote it onto the floor Jeff Flake voted yes bought and it's a little hazy he's worked out a deal with the Democrats\nThat they will be a one week FBI investigation and if I really have to measure my words because I very rarely insult people I insult ideas and in fact often I insult people aware even save their main\n'cause I I I really don't want to personalize it but having said all of that he's a fool and I can't I Can't handle fools\nHe wants to bring the American people together\nThere's a war sure\nAnd you don't understand the Democrats think that they could play with you and they're right because they know they sniff a fool like a dog sniffs\nWhatever its ... okay that's why you're being played for as the fool you are\n\nYou think a one week investigation with the FBI is going to have what they will vote for capital let's say the FBI comes up with nothing new\nWhat will the Democrats do they will be satisfied but they will vote against him so there's\nOh he he believes they will vote for capital so there was no voting yes yeah I think also he cares about their emotional satisfaction that's what he's working for [noise] okay I blame you voters in Arizona I don't blame for like a fool is a fool you can't do anything about a fool\nYou couldn't do something with bad people they can they can be repentant\nYou can't there was there was a great old you were saying I rather\nIraq what is it I I'd rather lose to a wise man than when was the fool\nI understand it as that or some of us would have to and I'm prepared to do it and make a request to the White
