{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "In show that most people I think we need and talk radio right they do get television shows like I Do every day a new t._v. um I think most people\nWho are out in the public and put themselves out there and believed their ideas or we're hearing how your you know this isn't right I think that they're selfish maniac they're going to go kill somebody but I'm saying if you run for public office\nEspecially that state level or higher certainly for president at the United states I think you would have a difficult case proving that you weren't and not just that\nSome some level I\nFacts are right and I and I put myself in that category as well look I got the ...\nIn change and it doesn't make you evil and make an idiot now are all evil people are\nProbably but there is a place on a section of very very different kind of ... a lego maniacal kind of not just isn't that a it dangerous right and I believe you can other mental efficiency as well but people get really confused about\nPsychology ... science and it's really not Eric it's really a theory there's nothing you know it's not a scientific it's\nGlobal warming and I don't think that either and so you're right people have to be me\nSo I think one of them were really important things to do here according to make with you on the people we go any further and that is they started with the Trump Russia thing to try to destroy him because they don't like his ideas they went to the women thing they tried to destroy and look back now starting at the end of this paying his legal fees who knew that\nCould happen you know there's going to continue\nThat I Believe their final\nEffort is going to be to try to declare the president mentally incompetent insane or or perhaps with some sort of the generic mental condition that we have to be ready to fight back for our values and the things that we've accomplished with the ministry alone that set the working for for decades\nWell you're you're right and I also think that when we haven't mentioned speaking as a creative I think creativity\nUh and madness and I use madness in quotes but there's a relationship there knows if you're thinking out of the box and you think differently than others do\nPeople always want to call you crazy or you know burn her she's a witch because she thinks differently and I think that this president without any question is wildly creative his brain is churning in ways\nThat a lot of people and again doesn't mean you have to agree with him but you have to give him credit that he's thinking outside the box and he's\nExtremely creative you'll do things that you know you you would you could go to take classes on how to be president for a hundred years and they will never tell you to do what he's done with Kim Jong soon or others he really is doing some things where\nI I can imagine people say like oh I don't know that seems pretty weird to me but the point is that\nHe has a ... about it and he has been successful over the decades and so I think we have to give him the benefit of the doubt but I think you're right that that when people have nothing else this is where they're going to go\nWell and that's the whole reason why we're not politics because there is a good kind of crazy\n[laughter] you know crazy like a Fox as it turned out well I'll do that 'cause I get back then very well\nThere's also the kind of passionate kind of madness you know right where he was mad skills I mean the president does have mad skills and then there is a bad kind of crazy that we all hope to avoid in our life to the best of our ability by the grace of God I don't think he gets in that category and that's why I Will not take the title of it as such\nWell uh it's fascinating to me because I as somebody who\nUm you know has observed this president I often describe him as a maniac and when I say that\nI'm complimenting him I looser uh obviously I just wrote a book\nAbout Martin Luther a year ago Luther was a maniac people couldn't believe the things that came out of his mouth he was also a flat out genius I mean it's so so for us to be really you know simplistic about it and say well there's kind of you know you've got people that that uh\nThey know what I make widgets and they're very very simple and they're saying in anybody's creative well they're crazy well uh you know\nIt's as you say it's objective and and I think that uh you know most Americans won't buy it most Americans understand that even if they disagree with somebody like this that certainly

she's taught philosophy a Franciscan University of Steubenville\nA which is what I call an actual\nCatholic university not a fake Catholic university like Georgetown uh she she has many many other um a credentials which I I won't read now a merry rice\nHassan is the Kate burn fellow in Catholic studies at the ethics and public policy center in Washington DC wow uh she was the keynote speaker for the Holy See during the un commission on the status of women and twenty Seventeen and she's written\nFor the federalist and and on and on and on and I'm thrilled to have to read the front and Mary rice has an on the line right now welcome to the program\nThanks so much Eric\nI'm now this book is a very dramatic dramatically title to get out now why you should pull your child from public school before too too late I have my self made the case generally speaking that this is how I feel as well but you take an even stronger stand\nA so let me ask both of you and you can talk or as you like uh\nWhat is it that led you to this dramatic moment to ... to not only write a book on the subject but you write a book that take such a dramatic stand on this issue\n[noise] you know air both of us are in positions where we are talking constantly to parents around the country and we were hearing sort of lament with parents saying my and my child who is now in college or it's a young adult\nThe law or they've become so progressive in their their ... and they're they're leaving behind the values and the belief that we were trying to train them up and and so\nWe've both been hearing this and and we start digging in because there's been a lot of focus on the radicalization and college campuses yeah telling our kids left for the what we found out\nWas that the data shows this occurred and Ellen and in high school they think we're losing our kids so that there are a lot by the time\nThey're moving on to college so parents need to look at what's happening the impact on our kids they the growing confusion over gender and sexuality\nOr the lack of understanding of American history much less commitment to kill American ideals so that was that was part of the um just the personal impetus to these conversations we're hearing from people\nJust think that in spite of our best effort [noise] this is what's happening well\nI I guess I Want to say that you know we we all sort of know that this is true those of us who who take our faith seriously whether we're ah Orthodox Jews Christians are who are evangelicals are Catholics the point is if you take your faith\nVery seriously and you have a biblical sexual ethic a and on and on and on we know that in this day and age\nThe culture has gone mad they they don't even\nThey don't even postulate that we are wrong they have declared it and moved on and they are sprinting in in an opposite direction so that's the culture\nBut to say that this has come into the schools to the extent\nThat it has and you're saying that and I believe that that's actually dramatic how is it that public schools have gone from being you know\nThe one room schoolhouse what were they had a picture of George Washington and they taught about virtue how did we go from that version of the public schools to the current version of the public schools what happened what other what are the things that happened\nWhile I'm Erica my dad this process even though it was like for mental\nPeople went through the public school um they have this warm now my call 'em at home that we're not at all I have heard that in the work for the time oh John ... who is it the problem I'm\nVery very warm so\nPragmatic learning the children from their parents had embarked on independent investigation where there is no object [laughter]\nI Know now so let me let me a hit pause here to say that there are a lot of people listening or who aren't really familiar with John do we I don't know much about do we accept to know\nThat he's guilty of what you've just said that he's one of the seminal bad guys in this story and so when did he lives and and why were his ideas adopt and now we\nI heard of the Dewey decimal system in the libraries are so he's made that minor ah Anna dying contribution but the point is that he was a large figure in ... when did you live and when with these ideas accepted\nSure absolutely he um he was a a professor of education even though a lot for my background is a lot of the right so I'm always interested in and philosophical angle here and\nYou know talking this is Theresa Theresa yeah daily and lived around the I'm In the Nineteen very active in the Nineteen\nTwenties Cornel forties um and he was a philosopher but he also taught in education and if you look at\nThe um philosophy of education that permeates our public schools here ... years as really the father of modern education and so he had this\nVery outside impact on our children um how they learn what the school how looks like we're at here instruction hatred there to facilitate rather than teach everything is emphasize\nOn experience um and and if you notice education cycle through fad all of that being said that the concern here is that because of his employer and as a pragmatic philosopher I'm because of the pragmatism\nThat permeates the public schools they have become public education has become aggressively secular\nOkay now so when you say pragmatism we all have some sense of what it means to be pragmatic to be practical but you're talking about pragmatism as a philosophy\nHas a philosophy which which really in that there's no objective truth and so way to gauge and moral reasoning and this is one of the one of the subjects we catch on in the book in chapter on social and emotional learning our kids are encouraged to make moral decision\nThrough a consequential with land meaning\nThe criteria for whether or not they do something for whether or not they consider wrong or right there there are two criteria number one point if they're here\nFor the social group and number two the consequences and throughout at all because of the aggressive secularism of public education teachers are not supposed to bring in the concept of objective truth until right there right away on\nPublic education you have a moral for nation that is going to diverge sharply from any kind of Judeo Christian or any kind of take the moral ...\nI mean it's just staggering thing when you say they're not supposed to bring an objective truth\nA it's an insanity one plus one equals to a really him is different from lead there's objective truth than some of the disciplines we're going to be right back folks this is a very important conversations ... show we're talking to marry writes Hassan injuries of foreign and about whether you should pull your kids from the public schools immediately stick around\nMy business of the day because the government told me I Can't live on my faith in the workplace\nI was arrested for handing out the U.S

people are being pushed out because some bureaucrat has been given the authority or to to do that we are\nAt a dramatic impasse and so I Want to underscore the title of your book is get out now I mean I think the problem for a lot of people is how do I get out the public school is free uh where do I go I mean I think this is why so many people have pushed for school vouchers and those kinds of things\nThat Eric at one of that one of the things that were\nStarted running into that when we say though we we do get that response from the parents [noise] um what do we do and and I just wanted\nTo read them back um I guess I Want to emphasize that they can you know problem if you're a pastor and you're listening to this broadcast look around in your church kids in your congregation are\nBlooming aggressively avenge alive in secular and says no one that we see the numbers that millennials to practice their faith\nDropping and the numbers with the next generation the ice age and generation they eat in a lower and so then the responsibility while I as a parent how the responsibility for my own children\nOf us who are listening who don't have children or who are in positions to help Marshall three sources and try to come come together and think of creative solutions it's also it's on every one if you are involved in a church you need to look around and try to find a way to educate your young people\nWell I mean you can amateur this is the whole thing is that I Know so many people in these people to me that they are heroes\nThey are home schooling their kids it blows my mind that they can do this but then you find people that are homes when your kids and they don't seem to be as amazing anything how're you doing it and then they tell you well um we have different ways to do it there are other families are in the neighborhood or in the town who do this\nAnd we so the idea that you yourself\nHave to home school your kids there's a whole network or with all kinds of resources so that's that's a very real option I think a lot of people aren't aware of that\nRight and that's one thing I mean I Would emphasize theory that home schooling today is radically different from what it was before because of the Internet because of the availability of of collapsed because it's it's just much easier to accomplish it and it's no longer kind of the ... thing that it was maybe Thirty years ago or something\nSo it's I Know parents who are working full time who are home schooling but they do that collaboratively with others but I guess the real point out what it may care Eric is that\nThere is a cost to education right no matter what you do now it might be a financial cost if you choose a private school might be time cost if you're home schooling\nBut they're the cost to the public education system when we're looking at these results\nWere results are so dramatic we are going to go to a break here and there are so dramatic I I Want to come back to this because we've got to count the costs to the ground folks\n[noise] [noise] with the\nSarin News I'm Ron drunk sure President Trump says the U.S has requested turkey turnover any recordings of the exist

child from public school before it's too late the officers Theresa furniture and Mary rice has been on the line this is so dramatic you were talking about the cost\nAnd and the cost has you know if you ask somebody hey is the salvation of your child or is the uh development of your child or into someone whom you would be proud of a and excited about watching as an adult\nIt is what is that worth to you that's the that's the question and I and I think when people say well the public schools cheaper you really have to wonder\nUh is there a way to afford to send your kid to a private school that seriously religious war or to home school because what you're describing and I know this is true we don't have the time to go into all the horrific details but it is monstrous with public education in America has become\nLike yeah you know the thing is Eric you only um you only get to do the child who what when you're with each ... each one of your children you don't get it\nDo over and so I'm One of the first thing we have today that the parent is educate yourself I mean we have my kids are in a parochial school system and there's there's an insulate available\nThey the school why didn't fit than very good about working with students and families in terms of helping people\nTo come up with creative ways to hoard education for the first step for any parent is to educate yourself they keep in mind you're right these costs are here and can we quoted in our book tester fan who say I'm a professor of education and one of his comments that\nNow as Americans we tend to think our own public school is doing a great job and then and yet we know cognitively that public education on a whole hidden even doing that well academically\nHair corner was during his point was that even in the suburban schools if you look at our school back up and her national were falling behind so in educating\nYourself take a realistic look at the education your child's getting to that and this and that was the formation that they're getting and I caught the formation because we're supposed to morally for my children that they are morally being formed against our beliefs against our faith so in addition to that they're not even\nGetting the spectacular education for being promised them that the schools are sure that they're getting and we know that by testing\nAnd and Eric I Would add to that that people sometimes will say well I Know the teacher rhino the principal you know I Know these people I can trust them and what they have to realize is that teachers and administrators are wearing a straight jak they may be a person of faith they're not allowed to show that right so\nI don't know if you heard the news about I think it was Alabama there are there now going to have to us motto in God we trust you know some of the school district and the problem is you can have that model and that's a good thing\nBut if the child turns to a teacher and says who's God or why do I trust him to teacher cannot answer yeah and and they will be sued and and and this is one of the driving forces of why it's not possible to sort of wait it out and hope that the schools are going to recover\nTo use tutors supplemental services to afford a private school to home school whatever it might be parents are going to make a far better decision and they'll get the education they want but but we have a lot of um [noise]\nI hate to say this but kinda cowardly legislators who are touted by the education unions and buy all the advocacy unions who say you can't disrupt the public schools and my question to them is\nIt are the public schools doing what we want them to do they're they're turning out kids who are politically left who have no faith who are gender confused\nWhere activists in in the you know sort of left wing sense is that really where most legislators if you put it like that is that really where they think the taxpayers want their money to go we need to create alternative\nWell it really is a it is shocking that legislators I mean I tend not to think of politicians is being courageous people but in this case it\nIs up to the people which is to say the voters to make them understand you must do this we demand that you do this or this is why we elected you\nRight in there a lot of um [noise] uh how how they put it on his home here when it comes to the dialogue surrounding this you can't mention ... so that people complaining that you're trying to find the public schools\nThat actually if you look at um the proposals that are out there they always preserve the operating costs for the school and then they they take the money that the instructional cost per student so ...\nThat the public schools are not they find that they really don't they don't have the same amount of money they will need to educate and those children\nRight any amount of money to get into the parents certainly not a huge chunk that is normally allocated per student because every single proposal reserve the operating costs\nAnd so that that's one of one of the problem here is that that the teachers union has gotten out of the moon in terms of thinning this radical proposal to defund\nThe public schools and then presented as a matter of just two children in poor neighborhoods and and the reality is Eric that the parents in poor neighborhoods and you look at\nParents in the city until it out here they overwhelmingly support vouchers their kids are trapped in school and they don't like\nLook at the let's face it the department of education\nUh and the American public schools are part of what I now think of as the swamp they are no longer doing anything except serving their own interests they don't care about the kids they always pretend to\nBut unfortunately they don't demonstrably they don't end by the way it's not even a for them to decide whether they care it's up to the parents to decide whether they're doing what the parents want them to do and the idea that we've pushed away from this\nUh really is horrifying as I said it's fundamentally an American it certainly goes against face a which is what makes it on American ... in America we're supposed to have the freedom or to educate our kids as we see fit\nAnd the public schools are saying no you don't and you think where did they get the right to do that I don't know what happened but we need to undo it quickly\nRight and one of the things parents you relate to and this is again why it's not possible to change the situation before it's too late for your child is it not only do you have to ask that advocacy organizations from the outside pressuring in the end\nYou have all the professional education associations national school boards association National Association school counters elementary school all of these are have adopted the progressive mindset\nAnd they're pushing an agenda and so all of that weighs heavily on school boards and on on even the local um educators when they're trying to figure out which direction they're going to go in\nSo it's it's really not possible for a good teacher to to push back against the\nThe Saddam me of pressure that's coming their way\nAnd and it's just a it's a much more difficult situation than parents might realize that's why we encourage them to really\nYou know read what we've collected in this book and and just confront
