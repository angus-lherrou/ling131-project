chocolate love that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done this far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues and policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... supports the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in a land then fine I'm okay with that but then we attributed powers it does not have a forty it does not half were granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the\nPerson up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans are going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like him and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support\nHim think about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left or the right can we agree on something and much less break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes shoot a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we could go on and on and not it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to you to do some honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as the Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been based or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sick sad thing is most of the left\nIs anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\nAnd the left is supposed to be deemed black right I began this whole program I made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way\nI support a person's right to self defense and what is sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is sad or we've seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not the Texas Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen 'em come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile like people\nReally we did um I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open Gary and he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profiled black people\nAnd Republicans desert Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profiled black people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yeah blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats\n\nAnd Democrats support gun control do see this guy's\n\nRepublicans supported Obama are

I mentioned this a few weeks ago on the air this is\nI doubt nuts I got an email\nFrom the bass player for Elton John\nYes yes and he said he will not one to ... ah he said he loves my books and he wanted to know ... when when when open as playing Madison Square garden did I Want to come\nAnd I thought is this a joke is this is like a Nigerian brining I've got a million dollars do you want it I thought outlet John's music uh you know if I had to pick one person's music that I have loved the most its own John and so he's playing in Madison Square garden tonight and the bass player from John invited me to go\nAnd so it's an amazing thing so I'm going tonight to the Elton John concert but here's where it gets really weird\nUh after the concert I'm going to have to run over new vox news this is late at night eleven o'clock I'm after run over to Fox News because Shannon Bream is having me on her program tonight live ... ... ... to talk not to talk about John oh no to talk about my book Donald\nDrain the swamp so it's a crazy day I'm going to rest hard because it's gonna be a crazy night I'm going to get to go backstage I don't know if I'm gonna get to meet all of them but I Know I'm gonna meet the bass player Matt Bissonnette and I just can't believe that this is like so crazy so anyway I'm really\nI'm I'm just excited about this and or whatever it might excited about hey I mean first of all I'm excited about doing those media for Donald drain the swamp and did you know that yesterday\nI was on the Hugh Hewitt show I mentioned this yes it was on ... and Andrew claiming a aired my my pod cast with him we did it you could you could look this up on line so I've done a bunch of things\nBut the book\nBroke into the top one hundred on Amazon this was before I even done any TV\nSo this is like amazing to me tonight I'll do Shannon Bream but I have to say that folks this makes me feel like we can take down Steven Kobe or Steven called there has a nasty it's one of these classic nasty anti Trump books and you know what you don't have to like Trump but for crying out loud that the nastiness the ...\nHis book is number one on Amazon yesterday and I thought aren't there enough food like Trump who could make my book\nDo better than his book I mean honestly it's crazy 'cause his books not even a kids' book my book I'm hoping that people will actually buy for for their kids and for adults it's like one of those I mean it's it's it's a kids' book that works for everybody at first I just thought of as a humor book for adults but of course it works for kids right\nSo the weird thing though is that his book you wouldn't give it to a kid because it's just snarky adult humor it's not meant for for kids is not innocent and sweet it's kind of mean so anyway so if you\nUh by Donald drain the swamp you'll you'll help me or take take Stephen Colbert down a notch you know 'cause he's got a he's got to be taken down a notch and I feel like I'm just the guy who can do it too so uh years\nLike I Know [laughter]\nI I Would probably like him if I knew him but I don't know um so anyway uh I I just was so excited yesterday wanted an asset to the audience that's a big deal to get in in the top one hundred\nWhen you have it on TV or anything like that so I think the book is catching on that people who've gotten to see it are are starting to buy you know more copies and stuff but anyway I just want they also got to say\nThat this is this is a this is madness we have\nCreated campaign buttons that say he's my caveman\nAnd we're not selling them we've also created stickers that say he's my caveman because at the end of the book Donald says if you're looking for president I'm your caveman because they want to make him king and like George Washington he says you don't want to change your free people now you don't need a king\nYou need you need a leader who who listen to you right you're not going to listen to the leader like ... or dictators bureaucracy you're going to tell you a leader what to do in the leaders got to do it and they said you mean like a president he 'cause yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman so we pretty you know these are these stickers in these buttons that said he's my caveman\nAnd they're kind of red white and blue they're big they're like over three\nInches in diameter and the only way to get them at this point\nIs to buy if you buy five copies of the book and send us a booth for purchase now the book is like Thirteen dollars on Amazon but if you buy five copies of the book and sent prove or purchase does that info at Eric I'm attacks US DOT com info\nAt our taxes dot com we will send you ten buttons now these believe me folks these are big beautiful buttons you probably pay five bucks for one of them but we want to do this we want to spread the word so if you buy five books you get ten buttons if you buy a hundred bucks\nYou get two hundred buttons oh I just did the math in my head it's two buttons per book but it's got to be at least five two buttons for books are going to be\nDoing that I just fell off my chair ally terrier and hit my nose or are you\nAt your nose again man whom do you you'd be sure you have\nThat card arise well anyway I Want to say that this is really exciting for me because he's buttons are very much they're fun Michael in Dell is creating my pillow with the he's my caveman motif on it we're we're creating a plus I still haven't\nHaven't seen it but it it's just a it's a lot of fun and I I just hope that people will be encouraged by the

Roberts all of them\nAnd it was a failure to let's be clear with a seven to two decision Seventy two okay now this is a big thing I Want to say that again are we in America need to understand and this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wronged you still have to fight these legal battles it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong it will be figured out right away no the state of Colorado to get this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp\nIn legal bills if alliance defending freedom doesn't exist in somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and I'd say I'm\nBest part of my job as it were able to look at someone like jacket hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding our whole person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of printing freedom do they do it for free and that is why I have you on the program right now because I Want my listeners to understand\nThat this most basic thing that will be happening all across America if we don't fight it because if there's

defending freedom they defended jak at the Supreme Court level in one seven to two so even the Supreme Court recognizes that shouldn't be a fight we we should really\nAre not have to take these things to the Supreme Court it's ridiculous it's clear and yet you have to do it in the costs a lot of money so uh let me ask you then\nA Jack in ... when this uh this was over you win okay now we go around to most people think the whole thing's over but it's not [noise] right\nTo the very day that the United States Supreme court um fitness to media that they were going to take like a stack in two thousand Seventeen that very day and attorney here in Colorado [noise] um\nHeard about it Google and they've called my shop to just to create a custom cake for that person Paco news or glue on the outside to celebrate a gender transition than we informed this person\nIn a way way way way way hold hold on jak hold on hold your horses you're not telling the whole story now\nOkay what am I missing\nYou're are you missing ... said that they wanted to put something on the top of the cake which was a pornographic image\n[noise] um as far as I Know on this case they just wanted to get to celebrate a gender transition as being inside them not sure if we got as far as what would be on the top\n... but a ... am I getting something wrong I I read quite a bit about this that there was something about a a demonic figure and some pornographic thing\nYeah that's another one\nOkay well I forgive me [laughter] and that's why I cut you off because I was like I Want to make sure\nThat uh that we talked about that because I I was stunned when I heard about that so if you don't mind my uh interrupting the narrative we'll get we'll get back to the transition cake here but if you don't mind telling me when did that happen was that right on the heels of what you're talking about here\nPretty much all the same time yeah we're getting a lot of great cause a lot of crazy calls but now the civil rights commissioning Colorado has determined that they have probable cause to proceed on gender transition cake and so we're going back to court\nYet again of oil to point out that this has got just about can jak\nTurn away cakes and messages that he does this is about America's every American every creative professionals right to choose which takes the decree which click it extend\nIt amazing I mean if if I go to in a cake a cake shop and it's owned by Jewish owner and I want to kick that says I hate Jews killed Jews\nEvery American would say that that's ... does not\nDesigned yeah much begging me getting done [laughter] if you're constantly having to go to court it's kind of not\nYeah not enough food to yeah it's still busy\nRight um my goodness I just ah [noise] it it is that a cat\nThat's a torch I owe it will be watching the door of ... you know on a\nShow and I do have time to read and I'm rereading if you can keep it\nAll language everybody should read it gosh\nThat's pretty incredible I got to tell you I ah I get so honored when I hear stuff like that you have no idea I mean the principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them\nBut I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know\nUm what it means to be an American and how precious it is and so what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberty is the rarest thing\nAre really never had an nations all Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um thank you for I'm referencing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you or you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick that says we just said you did not pick this and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom\nWho knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now the map let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so that's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get\nAll the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this um so that jak doesn't have to be attracted to same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is that can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but it's not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court um but we're hoping that\nUh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado\nAnd and is your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the Seventy ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nGas or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't bring\nThese proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that ruling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law we think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court\nFound to be problematic and so I think that's a strong precedent um that we're going to rely on them and hopefully the federal courts will look at that and say yeah this is too much hostility this is unconstitutional um and and dismiss Colorado's charges against jak for the gender identity cake\nWell I mean I Want to be clear ah for folks listening that you know Jack you're Christian ... you're not an anti gay person you are a Christian with all that goes along with that so if somebody comes to you and says I'd like to bake a cake that says I hate gays because you're a Christian you would not make that cake either\nThat's correct people with similar requests like I'm just not going to do that work done or God Jesus Christ in every way that again and they can't do that I Can't honor him making cakes or hateful or go against is teaching [noise]\nWell I Want people to hear that because you you hear so much um you know obviously we're living in a time where are the news is very confusing and people say things and it's not corroborated but it gets out there and\nUh people try to paint folks like you or me for that matter as a bigot and you think well not only am I not a big yet but I fight bigotry in my life I care about these things just as you do or we may differ on our definition of bigotry but we don't take these things lightly\nAnd there are hateful people out there and you're not one of 'em and by God's Grace I'm not one of 'em and I think people even saying we're talking about religious liberty this is not the liberty to hate this is liberty deliver our lives according to the principles that we hold closest our hearts when we come back folks a few more

Eighteen twenty four but he's not actually doesn't actually attain the White House until Eighteen twenty eight and then he served two terms so if that's a summary of hopefully that's a good summer he just to kind of think about here's this spring tears when the scotch Irish guy who was kind of\nYour friends your hero almost legendary demi God it is day like Daniel Boone are ...

people hate him or say that we should take him off of a twenty dollar bill yeah well\nSo the two biggest things of course he's not guilty of this low and there were many people who are guilty of this he was asleep older he owns a number of slaves obviously slavery from any perspective is a in rural and it's an evil but\nEven with in that ... that is he was seen as a ... and with an evil system he was seen as a bear winter slave holder and certainly\nI don't really know I I guess I don't understand sorry to interrupt and say I don't understand or know how that becomes an issue because obviously\nAll of the people of that era were slave holders so we know it's a horror but it really doesn't you know like when you think about or any of them George Washington and Jefferson and and and

you can catch up with town hall review Sunday mornings at six am ten Seventy the answer is\nThe answer\n\nMall oh God of\nIs here my taxes show you want to learn about Andrew Jackson I Do and that's why I have on Hillsdale professor Bradley birds or who's written a book called in defense\nOf Andrew Jackson I we were talking about Haiti and removal\nOr you know that seems like one of those terms that what what the heck does it mean what does it mean exactly in his era or he was dispatched by what the US government to do this who told them to do or what he did with regard to the Native Americans\nRight actually he's the one giving the orders here so it's ... he's president that he gets through Congress sort of very first year he's president gets through Congress a bill called the Indian removal act this would have been Eighteen thirty\nAnd the goal was to take the tribes mostly in the south but there were a number of northern tribes even in Michigan right here with a pot of water means in Hillsdale there were a number of tribes that were to be removed and they were given land than older and tried to get it landed Kansas and the southern trends were given landed Oklahoma\nSo if there was an attempt in a successful attempt at least from the terms of the government terrible if you're an Indian but there was this loop of those the Indians and ultimately ends up under Martin Van Buren we add about what was called the trail of tears were the Cherokees were removed\nAnd there was a lot of bloodshed involved not because there was open warfare but removal itself was so brutal that a number of people died in roots\nBack a huge number of people died and outrageous number so the removal itself was a disaster but they were sent the Indians were set out white you on the kind of id Meridian\nWhich was called me permitted Indian frontier basically on the great plains which is where they were put in Oklahoma and Kansas\nAnd so ah he's were violent for that because he he didn't just executed but he was the one that was pushing for it\n... it was one of his main main things that he ran on to the presidency in Eighteen twenty eight and I think for a lot of people so they were asking why did you become this kind of a controversial figure in the Nineteen sixties there\nWas a a real move by the new left and it wasn't always wrong I think a lot of things that we're doing and I agree with their politics but I think some of their the ideas that they were not necessarily wrong\nNew left was trying to reexamine so much of what had happened in American history and the kind of latched on to Andrew Jackson as the old for that kind of capital was imperial is about as they would have put it right a pig or a dog yeah um and they really kind of waste upon him\nA huge burden that is he becomes to represent everything we did wrong at the ... century\nWell thank you for that to heightened so silhouette I'm Sorry when no since you've settled in defense of Andrew Jackson let me ask you let let's try to get inside his head or inside the heads of Shirley Lou voted for him knowing that this was the policy for which he was advocating what what was the issue because I'm not aware\nUm so what what what are the terms of Jackson's presidency or the year so\nHe yeah so he's elected in Eighteen twenty eight so takes office in twenty nine and he's been there for two terms so I didn't do him thirty seven so twenty to thirty seven\nAnd he is when he was he really is it is interesting 'cause he was even\nEarly on I mean I Know ... I read it but that but even as a as a boy a\nHe had controversy you were saying that he served as a twelve year old and a Thirteen year old\nIn the revolutionary war which is hard to imagine that a boy right today we don't we just can't imagine such a thing and that that he was captured by the British pass as white as a boy that's right ah and and if there was this controversial things that that he was\nCommanded by a British uh a colonel I guess to clean the British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing many young boy that's right would refuse to do something he's a prisoner of war he's a boy what does he Thirteen Years old\nThe ... uh he refuses and the officer slashed at him with a sword\nUh enjoy our scarring him on his head\nIn his hand for life and you think what kind of a human being\nOr would you become if you've experienced that as a boy I mean that kind of brutality and then obviously a and the death of his brother and you know it's just another universe this as an excuse or some what he did but it's important for us to understand uh\nYou know what life was like a in those days for some people not for all people but certainly for him\nAnd Eric you know I think it's important to note too that he really does come out of that very brutal scotch Irish culture\nSo it's not just that he's on the frontier but his mother who was an amazing woman and she died catching a disease helping\nAmerican sailors and soldiers during the revolution that she gave her life essentially as a nurse but she had taught him from day one as low scotch Irish children taught that violence is the way men solve things\nAnd that that was ingrained in Jackson as what so many people have a tendency in Kentucky frontiers it was just very much a part of it\nWell it's just extraordinary I mean I Know that he he lost his mother when he was fourteen uh sorry and his his brothers and that he blamed the British for that and that's just one of the whole\nLife it shaped around her forgave him\nYeah it it was a guy who held a grudge and we're we're right ah it it\nIt shapes you a forever um I I Know that we have a photograph\nWhen he was very very old uh I think it's from Eighteen forty five which is amazing to me to photograph like people you know born uh who who actually served in the revolutionary war doesn't seem possible but so he does kinda span a\nUh these periods a ... it's interesting just to think of somebody who would have been involved in the revolution a who then lives as long as he does and really comes into another era that Iran right before the civil war of course\nYeah I knew what a symbol to and you're absolutely right of course he would have had been super young in the revolution for that to happen but I agree with you there's this guy was remaining all the way until Eighteen forty five that carries that legacy\nThat memory about one that other generations really watch the other thing if you don't mind I'll just do this in the void that I Love about this generation to what they were talking about our search articles the Adams\nI feel very sorry for them in a lot of ways\nWe we were there the founders\nThe founders where their fathers\nAnd you can imagine how can John Quincy Adams ever live up to what his dad did write a great guy he was never be John Adams and I think that whole generation clay Webster Calhoun they are desperately trying to prove that they are worthy of the sound day and I think it needs a stream of ways\nBut it also I think it energizes him to do crazy things too\nWell it is interesting I I Know also that he adopted a Native American that's bizarre to me when you think about how he's perceived as somebody who hated the Indians or who was you know a was his policies were catastrophic to Native Americans but then he himself adopted a boy who was a Native American\nYou know his prejudices were funny a funny strange so yes there were certain Indians he just like certain why she does like certain Black Sea dislike\nBut in general is rule was you never committed acts of violence towards anyone who has a volunteer to be in front of you so if a man wants to do all you that's fine if an Indian ... that's fine but never attack women or choking ever under any circumstances\nAnd he will buy that rule so he could he was very violent he was very brutal but there were restrictions his only got\n... issue right now we're going to come back from ...

[noise]\nOkay the push for voter ID laws are obviously racist according to Trevor Noah and of course are targeting people of color and are therefore disproportionately affecting blacks\nRight because it's not right\nAnd holding in my baby grounded was hearing fingers were going to put up on Larry Elder dot com and article from the national review August twenty three twenty sixteen the majority of minorities support voter ID laws\nDoesn't mean that the voter ID laws weren't racist right doesn't mean the aren't disproportionately negatively affect the people of color just means the people of color too stupid to realize\nAccording to Gallup Seventy seven percent of Americans Hispanics in Seventy seven percent of black support voter ID laws quote the figure is simply the same among whites eighty one percent back voter ID laws into quote now regarding the effect negative effect on minorities\nLet me tell you where Mr know a very likely gifted from it was a study a bunch of researchers University of San Diego Michigan State Bucknell used to them six two thousand fourteen data from something called the cooperative congressional elections studies to study the effect of voter ID laws\nShe'd what they concluded quote the analysis shows that strict ID laws have they do for originally negative effect on their turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries in general elections in a quote right\nSmoking gun Mary likes data and here's a study that shows the voter ID laws are in fact negatively affecting minority voters therefore Larry you must be wrong when you say that they're that institutional racism backed up people decry does not really exist in America\nExcept there was another study\nResearchers at Stanford Yale University of Pennsylvania looked at the original study negative ... based on surveys that were quote extremely unreliable which do the results\nLooking at the broader research article in the publication called vox which is not a right wing
