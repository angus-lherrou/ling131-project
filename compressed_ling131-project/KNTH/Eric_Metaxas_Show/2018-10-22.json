S. could pull the mayor of tombstone do hereby proclaimed that from this day forward tombstone she'll be known as America's Second Amendment city\nIn full support of the declaration of independence and the constitution of the United states approved this temp day of January two thousand seven in the ...\nDusted asking pulled them era when he was sitting here made a\nComment that I've got to ask you about I didn't he didn't have enough time because\nI knew the response would be a little bit longer than he had he mentioned that all went away back in Nineteen Seventy is that they talk about that was actually Institute in this town by the ... seventies right\nBut you can carry a gun anywhere in town now question for you there used to be some businesses in town and I won't name them although I Know who they are it used to be you could check your firearm in this town at the\n... shop across the street from a couple of places if you wanted to carry a gun in certain places and I have done that before and I think it cost me like six bucks and I got to be honest with you I thought it was kinda cool that I was checking my guns at tombstone\nThe only thing on cool about that is having to check your guns in tombstone you see right there how both of those can you can you can say once cool ones not but it's cool but it's not at school to school but it's not really cool but it's cool but it's not\nDo those businesses now has there been a change since this proclamation that businesses allow UN with guns if it's legal in the state of Arizona am I making that did you is that question to that come out right\nYeah that's fine or the most of the best 'cause I think all the businesses and to some support our Second Amendment and this proclamation um there's some of them to still allow that um but I think the ones with liquor are that's an issue so they don't allow guns in an environment serves liquor like a bar of course\nNow is that Arizona law that you can't have a gun in an establishment that serves liquor or is that their choice they just don't want it in there or can you go in with a gun and not drink liquor because there's a distinction there\nI Believe it's that the the establishment choice and um but you know guns in alcohol don't always mix I think at any one of the great with that\nYeah and it's interesting and the reason I asked that is because I have contacted a couple of the establishment here in town\nYeah again I won't name names or the ... all great established it's often fantastic and asked because I was unaware and I'm going back a few years am I allowed to carry my gun and you were establishment and the response was under Arizona law you can and if you really want to you okay but we would prefer you not\nAnd you know I honored their I honored their preference so I I I think it's\nInteresting because I Know every single one of them that I spoke to said we support the second amendment and they do support the second amendment I Know they do but I just was curious if this proclamation\nChanged anything in town did anybody in town fight you want it did anybody say hey we don't want this or guns or bad I mean those people are out there did we did you get any pushback to literally\nOut of a of a whole city town and uh but it get support people that support the proclamation and they did support our constitution and and I write in our individual rights yeah\nYeah because there's some there's fun interesting politics in the town to them and I'm curious what did anybody push back hard did what did you get any particular level like you would in a you know in a place like Phoenix or where you know you've got groups that would actually come out and and actually picky you or fight you you didn't get any of that\nNothing nothing no demonstrators just just you know one person maybe wasn't happy with that but to everyone else was it was very positive\nGood it is positive thing I Love it now let's talk about some big names you got some big plans and I love the fact you said you like to think really big\n... I'm going to handle my back to you and I'll let you know you just run out the clock and I'm listening to Shaun when he says we've got to close it out go ahead and close it out because I Want America to hear what plans you have coming up next year and and who you're actually looking at bringing in here it's fascinating\nYou know what we did was after the proclamation America's Second Amendment city we created an event called a freedom day celebration of the American experience which is the end of June the last weekend in June right before the fourth of July which is a perfect timing gets a little warm here but I Can't do anything about that\nA tombstone is a mile high so we don't have the heat that Phoenix and Tucson has but we have I have talked recently to I'm a\nTalk show host and actress um she's on a lot of talk shows uh Morgan Brittany said she'll be here along with her daughter Katie kill and she's going to reach out to John voice we would love to have him here\nAnd er James Woods would be great James what absolutely yeah we'll work on that and we're also going to reach out to Kevin ... are among others um we'd love to have Sean Hannity here or judge Janine or one of those Fox type person now has to be\nTruly great to have them a we have a also reached out to several um gun companies go walk and Ruger have been excellent with us very supportive\nAnd we've had some medal of honor recipients here we've had a lot of dignitaries and and a lot of uh [laughter]\nThe dates will be a probably June twenty ninth and June thirtieth of two thousand Nineteen right in that period of about a minute a tell people where they can find the Larry and I didn't want to say thank you you're very kind mark the Lorraine Motel is the ... been here since Nineteen fifty seven and a\nWe're right downtown in the historic district on Fremont Street and Fremont streets been beautify than the last four or five years I don't know if you know that mark but they've actually narrowed it and put some beautiful old fashioned lamp polls in there and some trees and made wider sidewalks and\nUm put an ... on a historic chef on haul right next door\nAnd to Tucson is really looking up some new businesses are moving here in New people are moving here homes are being built and uh we're very proud of our town take\nUs back from here because I've got a closest out first of all we shake your ... thank you very much I Apologize for a little bit of the technical difficulty will be had but that's okay we got we have to worry about what we wanted to get out we're going to fix that will do it even better tomorrow\nBut it has been you know the last time I was here I was walking around some of those barriers\nI remember stepping over some of the barriers in the streets gets all finished now it looks gorgeous the first thing I thought when I came into the even when I was I said earlier when I got to Boot Hill I could tell that the over growth of the back of the cemetery everything was just pristine and the town looks great so come out to the Larry and look it up what's the website ... well ... the\nWebsite for the Larry a motel is uh WWW dot tombstone motel motels with an s on the back dot com\nAnd we the second amendment city also has a Web site at Second Amendment city dot com all one word\nIt is [noise]\nHello everybody I'm Dennis Prager and this is broadcast every week because life is a challenge for the vast majority of people\nI Would say there's a tiny sliver of people for whom life has been pretty much a walk in the park\nI knew\nTo such people\nAnd the ... the last years were not a walk through the park ... if it's um it's unbelievably rare unbelievably rare\nIt's for people with varying degrees of challenge but that's that's the way it is that's the reason I ever happiness our reason I wrote a book or American series a lecture on it\n'cause if you can bring people to understand certain things than you can increase their happiness and if nothing else at least have their act happier because that's a moral obligation not to inflict bad mood upon other people\n[noise] so today's subject is a as a life change or if you take it seriously\nWe determine how others see us\n\nYeah you get that people think that some objective reality determines how they are seen by others but the truth is your behavior determines how you were seen by others\n[noise]\nAnd I'll give you an example you you may recall the\nThe show with a remarkable woman\nGail McWilliams who is blind and who\nIf you meet her you don't think about her blindness you just think about jail to scale is charming and Gail is full of life\nAnd\nThat's in other words she's not when you when you deal with her you're not thinking the whole time she's blind you're thinking the whole time she's Gail\nBureau blind people with whom you would think the whole time that well I'm I'm dealing with a blind person\n\nThere are people who have I'm giving you some pretty dramatic ones and the issue here is not blame or anything like that it is just to tell you the truth about how you are perceived\nAnd I'm going to give you other examples all of them are sensitive by the way everyone was sensitive example or number one is ... parents who lose a trial\n\nThat can become and I'm not blaming or anything else but I'm just describing the reality that can become their identity there so and so she lost her ... she lost her daughter he lost the daughter she lost to some\nOr that is part of their by oral biography but it is not the defining element in how they are perceived because that's not what they radiate\nWhen they meet you\nWhat ever it is you or the one who determines how others see you\n\nBut it's also true we'll give you another example for minorities whatever the minority might be racial\nOr sexual or\nA a religious you determine\nBy and large certainly in the United states and the United states you determine how you are perceived if you are a racial minority and you are oh your self perception is as a a primarily a victim of racism you will be regarded\nAs overwhelmingly a member of that group rather than as job or Susan just take too common in America names but probably not that common now\nYou want to look up the most common names I should learn what they are and use them now what's the most common birth name of the list for girls and boys\nThis is this is a big big deal\nYou you are a ... you are in a religious minority you you are the one\nWho sets the agenda on the house majority will regard you know people and minorities don't think that way they think that that's how they're perceived the whole\nTime I suspect that does there are are we haven't we have the names there the link or going to need to go I mean that was the main but it's okay it's okay you did it you\nKnow no no no no no I Know there are here we are baby ... dot com and the answer is\nFor God as a sub nuisance okay here we go for like I don't believe that Liam\n\nLiam is the number one baby named for boys this past year\n... you you don't believe it or why would they make it up\n[laughter]\nWho has a lead Majid\n[laughter]\nPeople make up the because they are but ... but I don't know why there's a ... it's a it's very bad number two I Do believe below\n... ... wait a minute now the female number one is Emma I Believe that number two is Olivia very very nice and what is there we go number forty\nIs savannah how many ... as you know\nAnyway All right so that's what I'll do now from our I'm OK Liam or ever\nThey go by the way of John even on the list no Jack is yeah I Know but I Do but I Know there's no job it's amazing that is Susan and I'm a list\nThat you got to go to my team succeeded give Susan ...\nFor a wide she'll through [laughter]\nDennis on the other hand you have to go to the nineteenth century\n[laughter] you\nKnow why it's not there are no young ones all right anyway\nYou on the one who sets it you know I have been since I was in my twenties I have often been in places where I was the only Jew and I realized very early on it is up to me\nTo make everybody relaxed 'cause they ... it was great it was a great revelation to me that the\nThe obligation ironically 'cause I I I Believe Americans of goodwill and couldn't care less your religious ethnic racial background doesn't matter you want if you're gay you set the agenda whether do they see you as Liam how's\nThat act or as a gay guy you set that agenda\nDo they see you as primarily black or Hispanic or in my case as a Jew or do they see you as Dennis it doesn't\nDeny that you're a Jew doesn't deny if you're a black and doesn't deny if you were gay doesn't deny you if you want every minority group theory that doesn't deny it but you don't wear it any more than you where I'm blind or you where I have lost a child\n\nIt's almost impossible for me to overstate the importance of this subject because we have it all back which we think that it's the task of the majority to make the minority person or the person who's different\nFeel great yes to a certain extent but without their cooperation if they wish to wear their identity that makes them different\nThen they have chosen one eighth Prager seven seven six is is big stuff eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nWe now have a sponsor for the uh for the happiness out on my pillow you don't know how many times I've been asked to finish a sponsor for this great show [noise]\nMake sure we're thrives [noise] well I accepted it because it's I think the thing is like magic

more time to go get something and I'll pull him aside afterwards and say when mine them that\nYou have a brand and what did you advertise about your brand today\nAnd one is that brand what do you mean by you have a brand\nThat you know your your your name your reputation the image that people have a view that's your brand and and\nOh that's good okay All right I see what you're saying your brand is what makes you different it's what makes you you\nYeah your advertising who you are that's right then things yeah work with kids better so I you know your advocacy what did you advertise about

[laughter]\nThank you that's a good one that is exactly right\nIt was it was one of the great liberating things of my of my twenties when I realize that\nAnd I remember even where I realized that I'm very open about my life to to folks it's it's certain vulnerability but it gives you a lot of strength to credibility and because then if you're opaque people don't trust you\nRightly so so anyway I

I I hear that at the beginning but it quickly changed when I felt\nWell part of the reason and and this is very important I don't know if I'm wrong in your case tell me but I think part of the reason is what you mentioned very at the very beginning they weren't that many Mexicans in Michigan\nSo she so if that was an advantage to you because when you are with an immigrant community and you can stay with that community in a in a self imposed ghetto then you are primarily back and not Bob\nI agree with that because and and other cities in Michigan where I grew up there were REO so to speak

I've learned a lot of things from that as long as I'm One of them is I grew up in a in an environment and and the culture unfortunately in which it was always agreement first and foremost\nYou like that or not and I'm ... and a clarity was not\nA hot ... among adults and so um\nI I'm I'm Wondering and you know I listen to your I pick up a few things here and there but I'm Wondering if you have a question or a way to\nAh when you just got a strong opinions are differing views with people how how to achieve clarity\nI well I went back to the other adult right well\nYou have to say first of all it's a very important question and I I Will work on a more elaborate answer a butt off the top of my head\nFirst of all you must be clear ironically I'm using that term you have to be clear that what you are seeking is clarity\nEven though you may want to win an argument you have to sincerely seek clarity you can desire to win after that but your primary aim must be ... where do we differ\nThat's that's the ... the most important whether it is with a spouse a friend or or political foe where is it that we differ let's try to establish that then we can argue on on who was right\nBut first the least let's figure this out when I have done that with call was about half the time the conversation and did something like this so the truth is we don't really do for that much at all do we\nKnow that interesting and then other times it just becomes clear if somebody says for example that uh I just wanted to get a good example my last\nWas a huge Donald Trump or a massage therapist\nI saw was clarity I had no desire to defend him not defend him it was not the issue it was written after the election so nobody could charge me with trying to influence votes I just wanted clarity on the word massage any\nIf right and and I think that I provided venue before you answer the question or answer the charge that this man or any man is a massage missed let's try to define the terms\nAnd it turns out that sexually object to find women doesn't make you a ... it makes you a heterosexual\nJust as sexually object to find men if you are a man makes you a homosexual not a man hater\nThat is the way male sexual nature works object defies the object of its attraction\nAnd here is the great punch line it is possible to respect women and object to fight them at the same time\nNow if you got a PHD in women's studies you cannot possibly know that but if if you allow for clarity than you can so that so is is that at all helpful\nOr very thank you so much and thanks for all you do\nAm I happy said

break off your leg and be no no they don't to their great credit they don't uh I I'm Wondering about the person that there are ... I don't have an answer to that in fact the only thing you could do is it is really\nShort of acknowledge what I always say the elephant in the room say look\nObviously we really differ on these matters but it's very important to me that we we just continue to feel good about each other in every way possible and be loving\nAnd if you are on board with that I'm On board with that and and what's just let's just put this stuff aside because we're not going to convince each other and all those ... is is caused tension and its gratuitous tension because family\nIs is a given you you know
