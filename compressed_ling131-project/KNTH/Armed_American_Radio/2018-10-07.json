he is [laughter] I mean\nWhen you're that we do have drag queens reading in libraries a little children so yes you know I was worried about what am I come down this but like the\nThey're all this stuff is just this is all sides shows to the the big issue you know I was out last night a spring branch the residents against flooding a grass roots organization you know\nOperating without any money just regular folks try and keep their houses and being flooded which happens a lot out there and\nSpring rent hadn't made and had a couple of hundred people show up and ah and listen to the mayor and dirt made for a while and they also listen to Anchorage Sean Todd Litton talked about how the federal government roe was a great great meeting out there and uh I can tell you one thing everybody that meeting is voting against prop I I can promise you that\nGo out yeah I mean if you it my way there were just talking about this last night if ... if you read lived it and you remember what had happened it was a couple of days after Harvey when all those homes are just destroyed I mean this is a huge fear of theirs from king would only down anywhere from the ... river authority down to the X. reservoir stuff\nWhere there is there's almost no place in Houston truly say from the flooding and and that's because you know even if you live along the by use you know they're people forget there's there there's there's two kinds of flooding there's the by you being overwhelming backing up into the neighborhood [laughter] but then there's also pockets being flooded because we can't get the water\nTo them by fast enough for example the Sam's by watershed uh shouldn't have buyers not been out of his bank since Nineteen Ninety four\nBecause a bunch of great work the county and I coordinate\nAll night watershed but yet and Harvey we had sixty eight hundred houses flooded in the Senate by watershed because the city's infrastructure so outdated\nAnd so poorly maintained it couldn't get the water out of the neighborhoods to the by huge fast enough even though we act passed by that's a real tragedy\nIs in I don't think there's any new plan like we're still in October right something could always roll are way up in October of it I mean heck Hurricane Sandy ... new New Jersey in October near the way at the end of the law there\nYou know they're they're still down there taking over half the drainage than spending it on other things like hiking by coordinators [noise] um you know and I talk to\nYou know I talked to these people that are supporting proposition I and I said well you know we have to have a lock box because we don't have a lot about that can just do anything with the money they're already doing anything with the money I mean the only thing worse\nThan not having any lock box is having a pretend locked box\nThat for again like we're protecting the money\n[laughter] 'cause you're the one you know ... and an impromptu bilking for alerting us under the percentage of money spent on what was supposed to go to flooding right in charge and credible and\nAnd I do I think about this for a second you know we now have the numbers on what has been spent last church going back for a month or two thousand seven and if you take the years from two thousand seven up to two thousand eleven before\nI'm rebuild was Institute and you look at the average we spent on streets in drainage and you take the money after rebuild Houston we're spending less money on streets and drainage now\nThan before we added a hundred million dollars to the pot and how is that possible [laughter] we add a hundred million dollars a new revenue and we're spending less money I mean come on it's ridiculous\nNow is to be the response when you wrote a um an editorial but when I was a two or three days ago and the Sunday paper you're on some of it for the chronicle and the headline was vote no on property and insist on a real lock boxer flood control funding that that is like don't touch hot items like common sense right and you know\nBut but you know you've got the same cabal of special interests that are down there supported proposition I because they all make money off of it\nUh and it's a slush fund for the mayor to use every wants to and you've got you know let me tell you what we we need to spend the morning and talked about campaign contributions at the city of Houston something needs to be done to reform the system because special interests are absolutely running city hall for their benefit right now we've got to do something to step in and make sure the average\nVoter the people in spring branch whose houses get flooded every time they come to whine whine Meyer land you know we need to make sure the city's working for them and\nNot that special interest that fund these campaigns\nWell there's no right to work with the city and you have a business uh you want to keep that contract alive and well right semi\nPromise you they ... they look I used to I used to have a business had had government contracts over the country and you get calls a day late from people twisting the arms of hate one wants to shut my birthday party and that by the way the brain will campaign contribution I sure would be nice got those calls all the time\nIt's amazing to shake down and that's why the ... the cities in the sequence it is okay in terms of growth folks in terms of traffic the mess from the Galleria through the highways are these scandals out of city hall something's got to be done something's got to\nKnow your to the campaign contributions to the landowners along post up that we're promoting this ridiculous boast or this bustling project composed to\nWhat's going to have a real quick question on that that\nI'm not in the amount of transportation business I'm not an engineer in business I'm just in the people's business\nOr that is the worst thing that you're putting a bus line the Galleria expecting people to ride that when they find the numbers crash right when they find the numbers rise nobody who shopping together is going to stand outside\nFrom may to October waiting for a bus okay through the summer with the range in the the humidity women are not going to go and whatever what do you sort of be playing to scrap the damn thing and put put plants in the explanations of what\nThe [noise] I I you have to look at what happened with a light rail which meant two billion dollars on the light rail overall traits that ship ridership is down um you know the um uh the the the broader ship projections Hawaii relevant cut\nAnd cut and cut and they're still not making them and so what do we do they've got a plan to do more like braille amazing I mean it's just ... there's a religious belief and these projects that justify any kind of you know true in a statistical analysis on HBO Now\nRight but it and if they looked at it like a business bill and said hey we're going to increase

and if you have any questions about today's program or suggestions please email us ... impact Houston that Salem Radio used in dot com [noise]\nYour life is an important one am ten Seventy the answer we're interested in hearing about how we are making a direct I'm positive impacts on your life\nEach day our hosts enter your busy world of responsibilities challenges and the desire for personal gross every day or wish they would you years positively assess you and your family we maybe your main source of much needed information only provide you a perspective of the news that is truthful untimely\nYesterday intentionally I mentioned that on yesterday's program that was by design why because I knew what was getting ready to happen today here's here's the deal but let me clarify a couple of things for your first off I spoke to my mom earlier use this as an example called her early yesterday more said hey what are you doing she says I'm drinking my coffee and watching the news\nI said what do you watch and she said I'm watching Fox and friends just said you're not watching the news\nShe said well I'm watching Fox News is that it's not the news that three people sitting around a couch talking crap it's all they're doing is speculating and blow be aiding period sheer\nConjecture there's just not the ball they're doing is chatting no different than the three of us if I sit down and talk with my mom and dad and I tell you is this is what I think is going on here this is what I think it's going to happen well I think the American people this and the American people don't they don't know crap that's three people giving you their opinions on a couch in the morning while you're drinking your coffee that is not the news\nAnd that's what happened yesterday and that's why I didn't want to talk about Kevin ... there was no news the only news about Kavanaugh is what was happening today what happened today cloture\nThat's what happened today the Senate voted fifty one forty nine to end debate and go to a vote tomorrow afternoon I think it's thirty hours that's it\nThat's news that's what happened today why is that important well I'll tell you why it's important\nBecause what you saw the left due to Kavanaugh's what the left has been doing to you over the course of the last decade they just through an entire decade him in a span of about eighty seven days really that ... that adamant about two week period not an eighty seven day period\nThe nomination process took about eighty seven days as of yesterday and he said he ate today ... eighty nine days today\nRegardless they were desperate they threw what they've been thrown at you as a gun owner\nDoes she do riding you just calling you murderer was calling you names blaming you for murders around because simply because you're a gun owner they blame you for the actions of criminal what they did with Kavanaugh was all of that thrown or they just do the kitchen sink at him in about a two week period here desperation from the left but here's what I knew I was going to see today\nI knew I was going to see\nDianne Feinstein stand up on the floor of the Senate and literally lie her eighty five year old tail off it was remarkable\nTo witness first Grassley\nStands up gives his assessment factual assessment this is what happened on day one this is what happened just seven weeks later this is what the minority ranking member did and didn't do here's what she sat on here's what ... what was the result of that\nNow any clear thinking individual knows everything that Feinstein did was working in lockstep with Chuck Schumer behind the scenes and Nancy Pelosi to derail Kavanaugh's nomination and destroy his life in the process that was all part of the plant any clear thinking intellectually honest human being understand\nThat and today we got to see grass we talk about it he was followed by Feinstein who stood there and wide her satellite radio moment word\nOff literally lied like crazy it took her about two minutes maybe three minutes into her discussion of Kavanaugh to turn to guns\nAnd she completely mischaracterized\nKavanaugh's positions on fire but it doesn't matter doesn't matter what she said specifically we talked about what she has said before in the past what matters is it took about two minutes for her to go to gun\nShe hate Kevin uh because he respects the constitution and the right to bear arms something which she does not everything's okay with Feinstein that she agrees with if she doesn't agree with it she hates it\nAnd that's what we witnessed today on before the Senate OK okay you got me here's what she said about Kavanaugh today another issue that gives me great pause is judge Kavanaugh's extreme position\nOn guns that's what she said extreme position on guns in reviewing his record\nIs judicial opinions on guns she said I'm paraphrasing pretty pretty darn close it's clear his record goes beyond beyond the norm\nShe said something to the effect that goes that the beyond the norm being meaning more extreme than just simply being pro gun she said she then went on to talk about his dissent in hell or two and how Kevin are believed\nThat millions and millions and millions and she quoted this millions and millions and millions of these semi automatic rifles are in the hands of law abiding Americans possess\nAnd she claims that just because they're possessed doesn't mean their income and use so according to Feinstein and all of our infinite lying Democrats socialist wisdom\nIf the guy is not flung over your shoulder or actively being put to use on a range it's not you have to have in common use it simply possess\nFeinstein is playing semantics she has a flat out ball face liar and she knows her hypocrisy was on complete utter total display today on the floor of the U.S Senate as was Chuck Schumer\nHere are the two people that orchestrated one of the greatest political hit jobs I've ever seen in my entire life and so did the entire nation by the way\nAnd as it played out both of these individuals took to the floor of the Senate and blamed the Republicans for their extremism\nI I I honest to God I couldn't I was it was difficult for me to watch\nThe lies from Schumer and put an end and Feinstein today it is utterly remarkable I actually believe these people feel so beyond reproach that they are so morally superior any elite\nThat they simply are incapable of telling a lie\nI I I'm at a point where I just absolutely believe that well fortunately\nMcConnell jumped back on there and actually Mitch put a\nPut both to bad as did Grassley in his opening remarks so we got some sanity in there and then others spoke but that's why I didn't touch Kavanaugh yesterday because there wasn't any news nothing was happening it was nothing but a bunch of blow V. aiding by a bunch of people sitting on couches to get news decks new stuff just talking crap\nTelling you what they think and none of it is new just nothing but fake news it's nothing but opinion masquerading as news none of it was new and I'll tell you what was news was John Paul Stevens former justice Ninety eight years old\nAt first they said he didn't mind\nCavanaugh I thought it was a great brilliant legal mind disagrees with him about some things but nonetheless should be seated until he saw Kavanaugh exhibit is defensive and fiery rhetoric when he came back in\nTo give a more I Believe ... testimony or to to to face the Senate Judiciary committee and the accusation that were leveled at him the base was flat out balls they smearing live from the Democrats and somehow Justice Stevens former Justice Stevens has an issue\nKevin defending himself in his honor and integrity and decency his reputation\nAs a man as a father as a son as a brother or whatever you as an uncle as a human being\nJustice Stevens had a problem with that of course Justice Stevens is the same a lunatic\nThat said the second amendment should be repealed\n\nSupreme Court judge retired saying that he believes it part of our bill of rights should be repealed because why he doesn't like it\n\nIncredible absolutely incredible here's my response to Justice Stevens I don't care what you think nobody gives a crap what you say nobody cares what you've thick except a lunatic left to agree with you they care about what you think intellectually honest Americans\nDon't rabid rabid idiot logs do what if\nWhat if Steve is position where we should abolished the first amendment would we be paying any of the woods the media be paying any attention to him if that were his position of course not well they would they pay attention to what he said what they have a completely different take on it they'd be attacking him\nBecause they value and cherished their First Amendment rights to lie to you and to give you fake news without a First Amendment they can't do that camping with God Forbid Second Amendment so these are the people that we are talking about why we didn't talk about Kevin yesterday here's what happened today\nKavanaugh fifty one to forty nine was voted cloture was voted on and the nomination\nIs proceeding tomorrow where Kavanaugh will be\nConfirmed he will be sworn in and he will be seated on this court and the rabbit left can't stand it\nIn the meantime it backfired their\n\nTake away their guns right they ... as I said in the president's re election in twenty sixteen I Believe some people are going to be very very surprised when they wake up the day after I Believe they're going to be very very surprised\nTo go back to guns but give you a little hints of some of the things we're going to talk about on armed American radios monster broadcast the particular there W. R. Hawkins now he's got a couple of great he says out that I wanted to hit you with today one of them in particular LeBron James\nWow and you just nothing short of a clown he's a great basketball player

cut the politically correct crap go play basketball\n\nDo divide I don't want any division I want to sell as many tickets as possible I Want you to make as much money as possible I Want to make as much money as possible\nI don't want to hear it play basketball and don't do it during the off season just shut up now that's my opinion\nWhy am I talking about LeBron James\nWell it's interesting because LeBron James is a gun controls out you don't like your guns but you know what he likes his oh there was a shocker right\nHow would we have ever guessed that LeBron James like his own gun before he don't like yours will cause she's were brawn James he tell you those things on the brawn\nYou shouldn't have guns guns brag\nBut I Need guns to protect me 'cause I'm liberal on I'll be back

think they're all on the ... and on and I'm fifty four I have a son and a daughter I raised Catholic but the people I just am appalled and on the Republican I voted in every election since I was Eighteen and if\nThe Republicans don't get him ...\nI'm going to change the independent and I don't know what I'll do in the future but I Am so appalled at what has happened the nothing\nThank you so much twenty six first time women callers twenty six year spread Kevin uh should be confirmed we do not screened except for authenticity\nDialogue but last radio hour a week and boy is it a significant hour this week because in two and a half hour of the United States Senate will be voting\nTo close debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh will pre figure the vote on his confirmation tomorrow and I'm joined by Dr Matthew Spalding he's ... he'll sail college is director of the Kirby center which is the land her no reason that sits in the shadow of the capital run by Hillsdale College\nAll things Hillsdale are available Hillsdale dot edu including crucial courts is on the constitution including all of our dialogues going back to twenty Thirteen with doctors balding Dr Larry on the treadmill there are members of the faculty and of course you can sign up for him prime as for free speech died just their\nDoctor Spalding before we do anything else your reaction to the cabinet proceedings and whether or not you believe he will be confirmed today and whether or not he should be confirmed today\nA morning whew\nI Am Atticus [laughter]\nAtticus Finch that this is I I think this is a\nA a amazing thing he should be confirmed that he will be confirmed\nA I think it's falling into place but this whole episode I think is an amazing and revealing moment in our history\nThat is a drawing us back to a much larger debate about the nature of our country and behind that uh the ... the history and the standing of his western concept of the rule of law\nAnd I think this is a key moment that is now risen beyond Kavanaugh he's become a movement in a way about this representation of this idea and this has been engaged ad I'm\nAt so let me let me give you the background met your calling into the middle of a while to show I have spoken to Meredith in Los Angeles Lucy in New York hunting in San Antonio Debbie in Dallas Margaret in Hawaii Irene in Saratoga Jenna in debt and Kevin Illinois a truck driver my\nSeven kids a widow Cindy in San Antonio paralegal two boys chanted St Petersburg Melissa in Dallas Beth in Michigan ... soldiers on the border now Kelly in Virginia former sex crimes prosecutor Kim in Columbus Sally in LA Pam in Delaware a psychiatrist Renee in Pittsburgh\nPenny in Virginia Melissa and Winchester him showing the grapevine Texas Myron palace burgers count Carol in Wisconsin Helen in Philadelphia Marlene tamper Melissa in Detroit calling in Pittsburgh they all want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed\nMost of them are furious at his treatment and they have not been represented in the media\n[noise] no I think that's right I mean it to which I was going to add ... you know my my my sister in law down in Fredericksburg people I've talked to ... this is an amazing thing and I think that uh you know the the the initial\nPush of this and raising it the way it was the last minute strike\nBut then it's gotten to the point where there's now a a pushback from that as more and more people got involved in our thinking about this as um as parents as siblings I'm as moms have sons\nOr it's just it's just an amazing moment when people realize that that that that's what I met in the sense that this oddly ... I Know that\nPose this way people are seeing in a very clear in stark way\nBut this really is a moment in which a principal a core fundamental principle has become exposed\nIn a way that the demands a fundamental reaction and that is a point about fairness I was in a cab the other day coming in from Virginia and I got in I like to talk to my cabbies and I did not expect this conversation to go to the right way I was just chit chatting cabinet came on the radio\nHe asked me what I thought about it well what do you think about it and he and he looked at me straight\nThat this is unfair this mad as being mistreated and it's on fair I think there's a natural way which which uh other human beings\nGet this which does go to the root of what it means to be a self governing country and establishment of the rule of law rather than the rule arbitrary men and about something that's called due process a process to which we are do according to the law because we're all created equal\nAnd we have an opportunity to be innocent before we're proven guilty goes to the heart of\nAll those things and you're seeing that reaction in common ordinary solid American people\nThere is a story today and the wall Street Journal that a friend of Dr Ford dumped pressure to revisit her statement or one that would indicate manipulation of witnesses barriers that are in these twenty six color is a fundamental distrust of\nDr Ford's um appearance not her testimony non her but that this was manipulative process uh what do you do hear the same thing\nI I think I'm a part of this is is is I think the American people are a good compassionate people and they're trying to grapple with this question they don't want to they don't want to question\nA her they don't want to question her um ah her passion and in that moment ah I think a lot of them see her as a victim as well she she well might have been been the I'm a victim of of harsh treatment or many cases are but\nIt's there there's there's no evidence here so how do you weigh these things and and I think ... their reaction is is that\nYou know as more and more comes out there's manipulation going on here it seems that her own counsel does not share information with her or the story itself is really falling apart I'm\n... and I think this is a a reaction to that are about ... and then people are saying well what if this was my son what if this was my brother but if you know um\nThere's so much we we that has been put out there in the last minute and the eleventh hour and and now it's like people just sort of throwing mud up on the wall and see if it sticks\nUm this is precisely why we have the rule of law so that this is not what rules us ah we want qualified good judges\nUm you know we we're going to talk of the we mentioned the other day this this letter with all these ... signed on he does not have the temperament regardless of uh all the the what you think about all the particulars he doesn't have the temperament they make no mention of the constitution that letter isn't that interesting\nWell in there about what it was that\nThat's a whole subject maybe I'll do that the academy is revealed itself the media has revealed itself many institutions of elite you know the Yale faculty the the the ... whole norms they have all rushed\nTo convict judge Kavanaugh in a way inconsistent with our norms and indeed I think the Senate will confirm him\nBecause they actually the blue bubble doesn't include senators I think that they got out of the blue bottle I think they've heard from people\nI I I think they have I have two things have been revealed one is I think that uh the people who have broken through and senators have heard them I'm actually encourage because we're seeing senator zoo here to four I had my doubts about\nBut they they they are being political in in the good since they understand the politics of the moment ah and they're stepping up but the same time what broke through that bubble\nAnd the reaction that broke the bubble was because the the the these modern views that we ... we associate so much with the academy in what goes on college campuses that's come to Washington\nThat says Mr college just as Mr university coming to Washington that's precisely what's going on here and I think that's why this is really a cultural clash I'm In this reaction by a lot of people\nAre tells us once again that's not the America that people want they want a system or that still has a rudimentary rule of law\nA and this is unfair this is not how you treat people this is not how you you conduct a fair process and I think I think a senators have heard\nThat loud and clear and chips we'll see where they fall but I mean this is I think this is a debate we have about our politics are right now having to do with the judiciary and this particular man in this particular case\nUh during the course I never take callers during Hillsdale dialogue but I'm going to today so that Dr cabinet can react a little bit with the women who were called in and sharing in Pennsylvania Kimberly in Brooklyn Melissa in Cleveland page in Spartanburg we'll get to you but I Wonder first mass balding about the Hillsdale students who work at the Kirby center who study in Washington DC\nWhat have you heard from them this week\nI I think there ... there were the first of all they're watching this um carefully it's phenomenal thing to be here to see it happening before they're very eyes um and but I but I think they see it not in a um\nInstinctive ... I mean there's these are young people are but they are thinking about their own futures in there and what this means for for these arguments it at three in the show and I said I Am an addict is which is referencing Atticus Finch right\nYes we read these books this is a great book I'm a you know he was hated in his community because he was defending a black man who's being accused of rape by a white woman and it turns out he did not commit the crime\nUm they're they have studied these things they read the ... brothers ... miles off right about the meat treating it did he kill his father and now they're seeing it play out in front of them that's actually a powerful\nHad to put their heads down because they knew\nThe amnesty that he was saying we did not happen ... he did not do that and when ... when he talked about his daughter praying for Dr Ford we we both not that I mean what a great family and what a great way to raise children and to pray for her is is truly a threat\nThan Chris ... and get Michigan thank you all the right time with Dr Matthew Spaulding is the Hillsdale dialogue continues a doctor is falling in these accurate right it is a moment of justice and we will find out where the Senate is two and a half hours they can they give you a child\nPortions of the Hugh Hewitt show or brought you in part by the association of mature American citizens a Mac [noise]\n\n\n[noise] you're in the middle nonstop action packed information [noise] she when she was just coming right [noise] [noise]\nThis just isn't about my friend just about everybody spring when the government can come in and tell you what to do and what to think and what you need and you have to choose between your livelihood in your face and we don't live in a free America\nThat's ... that's been a grandmother and small business owners being ... by the ACLU and her state government if she loses it should be on the pay more than a million dollars to her opponent this could happen to her\nIt can happen to you that's why I wanted to funding cream exist they provide free legal services those freedoms are under attack but they cannot do it without your health\nYour one hundred dollars well ... why it's happening freedom in this crucial fight\nTo a matching grant you'll get to stumble when you've you've right now [noise]\nQuit the alliance defending freedom better at your dot com recall eight six six seven hundred and sixty eight six six seven hundred and sixty\nThis is a shoo shoo shoo\n\nATM ten Seventy they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that their president is another handler they use their movie stars in singers and comedy shows a newborn shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their\nPresident to endorse to return home and make them marsh make some contact making scream racism and sexism and Vina homophobia smashing windows and\nForeign cars shut down interstate an airport in ...
