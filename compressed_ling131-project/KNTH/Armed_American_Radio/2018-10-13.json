gonna we're going to get into that we've got some stuff uh from man what's what's what's going on with the Arnold Schwarzenegger does he just to use the losing his mind over there which is easy too much or\nToo much standing out in the ... and the California heat and I think it's getting him out there that's we're talking about all the the governor later you know he's he's got some issues\nOr Jamie Lee Curtis you know as as a as a matter of a coincidence you know remember they were in the movie together what was a true wise him in the Arnold Schwarzenegger we're going to be talking about a little bit about the Jamie Lee Curtis and you know trying to get some I guess we're getting some celebrity gun news out there you know where you're some celebrity or politics you know that's\nIt's a it's kind of kind of a you know I'm trying not to be TMZ here you know what we want we want to get the information out to you I I think the one I Want to start with\nIs a it is is Jamie Lee Curtis ego Jimmi lead their lives and we all know Jimmy remember from years ago when she was in uh what was it was a um Halloween the Halloween series of Halloween series movies in fact that's what she's back in the news for today is the er er er yesterday is is the Halloween new series she\nShe was the other movies I'm trading trading places murder the Eddie Murphy Dan Ackroyd movie that was a good one then of course we are we already mentioned to your mentioned the true relies so\nYou know it's a Jamie Lee is is\nYou\nKnow how do we say this politely she's but she's a but yup yup yup what do I mean like you can't call somebody but on the radio now she's a Second Amendment but we're going to get to that so we're we're we're going to talk of talk about her here\nShe she's in this new movie Halloween I don't know if it's Halloween you know two thousand three thousand whatever it is it's it's been it's the newest version of a of the Halloween you remember she was in it as original young actress\nOr she went back for I think was hollering two thousand actually now that you know what I mentioned in them now she's back in another rendition of Halloween coming up or you know just in time for the holidays\nChi wields again she uses a gun she she uses a gun in this movie and you could see her\nYou know moving throughout\nYou are using the gun in defense you like ... years ago and I guess if you're being attacked by you know are you a crazy Halloween monsters or you know that's that's what she's doing\nSo she got to get called on it they said Jamie Lee\nI don't know if the caller Jamie Lee maybe the caller Jamie Jamie maybe Michael J. I don't know daily they said Jamie Lee\n... you know you're you're you're a hypocrite you use guns in your movie but you're anti gun ... and and this this course covered by ... by CNN you caught uses covered by the left Fox was the one that called it out and said listen here's a here she is using these using these guns and she's a gun and she's a gun control advocate\nWell she in and said you did the title I love the titles how they make the titles of their\nStories so if you were just scrolling through your your news feed and you saw the titles\nYou would think oh man that's that's it there's the tears the title this this must be a horrible thing or title for hers was Jamie Lee Curtis uses two words to shut down all widely ridiculed Fox News guns story wow\nTwo words I'm picking these these must be strong words the way this title was written where the title of the stories written this has gotta be some serious strong language that she threw out there\nAgain if you were just scrolling through your news feed and saw that title and didn't read the story your brain automatically go to that this must have been harsh\nThis must have been harsh reality that she threw down on Fox where you want in order to words were her two words were just\nSilly yeah yeah that's just silly so so that's that's that's the uh the the two the two great word she flew back out I'm here here's the problem with that we have with the obviously with Jamie Lee Curtis doing are\nWielding these guns using these guns in the movies uh you know when she's a gun control advocates she she goes on and a ... and she says that listen she she supports\nThe second amendment wow she she supports the second amendment you guys you you know what's coming next do we do or to give it away they'll give it away right you know what's coming next she said she supports the second amendment\nAnd has absolutely no problem with people owning firearms\nYou're ready for it but yeah she's a second member but she supports the second round but she has no problem with people owning firearms if they have been trained licensed background check has been conducted\nAnd the pause button has been pushed to give time for that process to take place well what I I don't think I've heard that last part before I don't think I've ever heard the be let's give time for I have a pause button to be pushed so the process can take place okay Jamie Lee\nHopefully you're listening today I don't know if you're a regular user of a you know the armed American radio daily defense our with Mr mark Walters\nI perhaps you are I don't know the ... let me give you let me get let me get a little facts here let me give you a little how this works when you purchase a gun and ... and maybe Oregon Jamie ... I have no idea but\nThere is no pause push button let that process take place you're going to buy your fire depending on which state you're in you're going to you're licensed firearms dealer you say I Would like to purchase this fire and police\nYou fill out your federal background check for him you have to answer truthfully on that or you don't go any further\nThey do the federal background check which for the most part unless it's a really crazy busy hectic day\nAnd and for for gun purchases it's done in ten to Fifteen minutes tops tops\nYou maybe on a holiday weekend are you the the winners gun specials a special for everything going on around the country that might take a little bit longer might take twenty thirty minutes unless there's a delay if there's a delay which I mean yeah you know your name matches somebody else's name that's a you know convict or\nAre you you're on the the the the terrorist watch list you know then there's going to be a delay and then they're going to hold you back you know then then then you have to wait that's that's the purpose that background check to catch those people but\nNow unless you have your state with a a waiting period a or a county or a city with the waiting period you have to go in and you have to abide by the waiting period most places though is you have your if you've already gone and gotten your fires permit whether that's a\nWhenever you stay closer to carry permit a a concealed weapons permit you're you're you're you're a firearms identification card whatever happens to be once you have that most of those locations you get to bypass your your your your waiting period you don't have to worry about the waiting period for the fire him\nBut there are still plenty of locations out there I can walk in today and say I would like to purchase the firearm here as my driver's license I Will fill out your form I Will get my background check and I will take it home\nNow that's a majority for long guns I I'm trying to think if there's any places would still do that with handguns with pistols with the revolve around that kind of thing we've all ... um and and pistols what's your ... that's one of the other classifications for handguns underneath the ... and\nYou know long guns you can you can you can do it you can take it home that day if the if the law allowed to try to remember there's any for the for the pistols for the side arms\nHave to look at what struck out on a break and get back to you I'm not sure the but Jamie hears it you you can go in there you could buy this fire him the pause button and here's what I Want to go through with the second amendment and the pause button the second amendment says\nThe right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed unless according to Jamie\nYou've been trained you've been licensed you've had your background check and you have the pause button to give time for that process to take place and not sure if she's referring to cooling down period that we saw after your the Brady bill came out\nOr perhaps ah she thinks that it actually takes up you're going to do fingerprints and send them off and wait a month for the FBI to send them back to the old school style or you know she's she's a little bit out there so I'm not sure what\nWhat her goal is with ah with with the with these a pause buttons but that's that's that's crazy\nJamie Lee that that's not how this works and here's here's where we complain all the time you'll hear this folks that you've got to listen to when people talk you have to listen to when they start to talk about firearms because they're going to tell you\nI support the second amendment but don't\nBe a Second Amendment but I've got a list of ... proud pin that I wear a ... all the time I got it from or Mr Jerry Henry the or the executive director there at Georgia carry your first time I ever heard it and he had the pins I don't know if it was something he coined or something the organization formed\nGoing but you hear all the time I support the second amendment but will stop right there stop right there if they don't support the second amendment there for me if they if they don't support the second member they are going to say but this is this is where the bus comes in I I support the sacrament of button you know you don't know you you might as well say things like\nUm I support the first amendment freedom of speech but not for Jews you know I just you just not for them ... ... that's what we hear Jamie that's what we hear when you say I support the second amendment but I hear I support the Fourth Amendment for protection against illegal search and seizure\nUnless you're Hispanic that's what we hear that because you want to take some of our rights away from us based on your beliefs based on your\nPre judging us what's prejudged be prejudged me because I have a fire him your pre judges you know where that word comes from ... all of a sudden now I'm the racist we've already work their way back there well of course we have because they're liberals it's Jamie early and she thinks that it's okay to support the second amendment if if\nI have let's see training I have education I have a gun I have a minimum a salary requirements are my my car goes I'll be sixty miles an hour if you could just go everywhere it's ridiculous\n'em but they were they were hunting fronds and they were here to pump you up and they would call everybody on their a girly man a girly man now\nYou know I don't know Schwarzenegger stole it from one or or SNL stole it from a you know sports in ... but he used the term girly man when he was talking about the Democrats that he was running against and the Democrats in the California state a legislature and you know whether it be the the the house or the senator\nHe also said that he was going to terminate them remember how I'm going to terminate them I'm a ... the Gurley mountain in they don't do anything to terminate them that was a Arnold Schwarzenegger's\nCampaign slogans can't get campaign speeches when he was out there in I'm In California running well do you see what's going on we just saw the\nThe brutal attacks against a justice now justice Kavanaugh we saw that happened we've seen them against our president and how you know he'd furtive and getting you know it didn't push them often well now Arnold Schwarzenegger is is it is turn now he is now apologetic\nFor using the Gurley mental he says at the time it felt like the right thing to do it was in my gut I improvised and I called them girly man because they weren't willing to take risks\nThey were afraid of everything politicians in general want to do little things so there's no risk we involved I'm Sorry I probably should have done that in the accent you know maybe maybe next time\nA he said it was a short sighted in the long term it's better not to say that because you want to work with them so now he's coming out that ah the whole the whole girly man are you saying girly man is is is demeaning he shouldn't have said girly man\nBecause it's it's offensive really means offensive did this is a guy that carried\nHim a machine guns and and and blue people up and he was the Terminator and he ripped heads off and you know you remember he killed people with knives that came out of his hands\nAnd he's and he says you're girly man\nI'm going to terminate you and now he's apologetic for it he's apologetic for using these terms\nWhat has happened what is going on out there in California why are these people turning crazy or you know listen we know that the Schwarzenegger is no fan of the Republican Party anymore he when he became the governor out there he started as a Republican and by the end of his term he was pretty much a Democrat he was one of the worst thing ever happened to gun control\nIn a in in California out there he's he's he was horrible horrible governor\nBut now he's apologetic and listen you know here's what you need to do\nI'm Sorry man up you need to man up you'd be respectful of women you'd be respectful of everybody around you and you don't have to worry about these things you don't you don't you don't talk trash to anybody you shouldn't be talking trash dude a matter of fact man or woman the women this applies to you to\nYou why all of a sudden we have to apologize for things that happened twenty Thirty years ago it's absolutely horrendous it's absolutely ridiculous a ... and I won't do it how maybe that's why I get to keep getting thrown off
