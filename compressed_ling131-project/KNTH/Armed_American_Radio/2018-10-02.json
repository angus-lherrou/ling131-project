AAA nice and the ones that have to prevent with Kanye West Saturday Night live St Ninety percent of the media and left wing going off on the welfare state for making the father a fifth wheel wow and he wore the mega hats and he was told by\nBut nonetheless about a half hour of work to do after the my shuts down so figure it's approximately eleven thirty before I have some downtime get to the house and chill out a little bit and it it it just makes for a very very long days you can imagine makes for a long day and it makes for a long night so not a whole bunch of sleep\nAnd then I get to wake up and I get to start doing some research for the show the next day to day for Monday and it tends to make me a little bit angry and\nI get on Tuesdays and Wednesdays or Thursday and friday for example because I Am a little bit more tired on Monday and that happened today\nWhen I pulled up by started doing my regulars that the big sites with the you know the the networks on what the Fox News Drudge Report it to CNN and the rest of 'em and and there was a specific report on Fox\nThat came out at about eleven o'clock this morning\nDems accused of moving goalposts on Capitol after FBI pro ordered listen I don't mean to sound redundant on this but you have got to understand what's going on or what is happening here and I feel\nA tremendous burden your tremendous responsibility on my shoulders to try to get this point across I don't know\nIf I Am making this clear enough I Hope to God I Am\nBut you have got to understand why the Democrats are orchestrating this yet on Kavanaugh and that's what it is it is a hit Lindsey Graham apparently had seen that as well thank God\nBut it is nothing short of a political here they are going to continue they will continue to record this man's life it will continue to drum up accusation and they will continue to want more and more and more and more and more and I cannot stress too you enough how important is it the things that you need to understand about why\nThis is happening as a gun owner this man is a direct threat to the Democrat gun control agenda and they know it it's not just wrote the way\nIt's also the right to bear arms the two issues that the Democrats are most concerned about what Kavanaugh after they got through the little shenanigans on day number one and they actually started questioning this man the whole thing was a ruse anyway\nYou talk to issues jumped to the forefront number one roe v Wade number two guns what did he will Feinstein was guns right out of the ... assault weapons his ruling or I guess I should say his dissent in the hell are two case making it very clear to the left\nThe capping off is the man made in the mold of Scalia and the left can't stand it\nThey know and I can hot clarify this or not they know that if Kavanaugh is seated your gun rights are safe\nThey know that they understand that and hence why the personal destruction it mostly the politics of personal destruction it's just flat out personal destruction\nOf judge Brett Kavanaugh continues and isn't going to stop and I find it interesting when I looked at the Fox piece about the Democrats moving the goalpost the similarities here\nAbout what we the ... just the parallels fear or so in your face or so obvious to anybody who isn't at rash if you are even semi oh wait you're able to comprehend that but a lot of people don't and I need to I feel the obligation to make this very clear what am I talking about here look when you talk about\nLet's go back to the Fox news ... dumps accused of moving the goalposts on Kavanaugh after FBI pro order\nOf course they're going to move the goalpost lake new it everybody should have known it they all knew it but still\nThere's this most we can trust those people there are friends they are not your friend these people hey you they hate everything you stand for and they will destroy your life in the process\nOf eliminating you and the threat that you posted their agenda and their power grab\nAnd at some point in time to Republicans are going to have to figure this out or in this country is June but to go back to the parallels oh every\nMarket come out of the box so easy the parallel fear about the things we talk about on armed American radio and hear on armed American radios daily defense\nJust cannot cannot be overstated\nGive me an example Marc moving the goalpost what does that have to do with it has everything to do with God how many times if I asked you do you think they're going to go away if you\nThem that we used to talk about expanded background checks\nIt's a big deal back then remember expanded background check we need expanded background checks so we never have another new town that's a bunch of bull and you know it\nNo background check would have stopped Newtown and they know it the man murdered his mother blew off or face\nWith guns that he stole from her before heading over to the school and murdering murdering first graders and teachers\nKnow background check would have stopped it and intellectually dishonest Democrats knew what they knew it then and they know it now yet every one of ... just hated the talking point across the country the least we can do is expand background checks so my question to you then after Newtown\nGoing back to two thousand twelve to thousands Thirteen was do you think they're going to quit let's just say we gave it to him just shut up their screeching\nOkay fine shut up enough already go\nAhead would they have gone away\nHave they gone away of course not they continue to move the goalposts nothing is ever enough for these people\nGive them one inch give them one inch\nAnd they're going to immediately scream it's not enough after\nThey accept it okay we'll take the edge then they want the terms of the Green Bay rewritten\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary committee use last week's hearing over the accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to push unified message the FBI must investigate the allegations\nQuoting Feinstein if your very confident of your position and you appear to be why aren't you also asking the FBI to investigate these claims\nThe next day Jeff Flake of course capitulate it makes a lot for that Arizona\nAnd he wanted them so they will just agree to a supplemental background investigation or supplemental means to a Democrat\nThat means wide open they'll just continue to widen the goalposts no matter where you kick the ball it's going to count supplemental means just give us every thing we want because now we're going to be the ones deciding\nWhat's enough and what's not and they know the Republicans are so weak need they can get away with it how do they know that because they just\nDid they just did a couple of protesters scream at flake you look at me when I'm Talking to you I Want us to get outta my face it get out of this row how did you get in here have security please play doesn't he\nLooked at him and cried these are people that have signs pre made to fill in the black when Trump made his selection\nWho ever he selected what was going to go through this just isn't me making this up\nThis is reality these people hate you\nAnd they're not going to stop take a listen to what Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a weekend letter according to Fox he called for investigating whether Kavanaugh committed perjury given the very this is a quote given the very serious fact that lying to Congress is a federal crime\n\nA fundamental question the FBI can help answer is whether judge Kavanaugh has been truthful with the committee this goes to the very heart of whether he should be confined to the car\nSaid Bernie Sanders\nNot take a listen to what Connecticut Senator gun grabbing hateful Chris Murphy said yes of course there should be an FBI investigation he said but whatever they find doesn't change the fact\nKavanaugh specially after his performance yesterday\nIs the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetime that is absolutely true senator Murphy absolutely true\nKavanaugh is the most dangerous pick up your lifetime because you are done hating constitution hating freak show\nYou and your party you know what Chris Murphy you are absolutely one hundred percent correct judge Kavanaugh is the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of your lifetime why\nBecause he will not fulfill your agenda of the destruction of this country and use the Supreme Court to do what he will stop you at every twist and turn because this man understand and will uphold the rule of law and the principal set for fight our founders in the constitution\nThe possibility\nThat there may be a conservative another conservative on this court because they know and understand the importance of this one and again for the purpose of the show take it right back to your gun right\n\nI Wish I could say that we hadn't seen this coming\nBut isn't it interesting you every time I met a ... party or I'm at an event or I'm at some type of\nOf of venue where I'm dealing with like minded people it's interesting because we all see the stuff we predict the stuff we understand is coming we want we get frustrated we said why aren't the Republicans on this committee doing this or why are they doing it why is Mitch McConnell doing this\nAnd it that's why I said it looked like like Lindsey Graham finally had an epiphany of sorts you have a day it's like he saw it it's like he understands now hey wait just a minute these people might not be my friend\nThese people might not be my friend I could actually vision and a scenario where these people might try to do this to me you should see Lindsey Graham is now understanding that these people would do this to him to push their agenda forward\n\nIs a or we could just keep going on and on and on but I'm going to knock that one off are not going to move on to a couple of others that\nOh you know what before I go though did you do your homework yesterday on the monster broadcast I directed you over to a piece\nBy Laura ... that is probably the best written piece I think I've ever seen of hers anyway this this one obviously because it was something that we're so familiar with them we discussed you're on the program a lot\nHer piece and I I read it from I caught it her syndicated column from the Casper
