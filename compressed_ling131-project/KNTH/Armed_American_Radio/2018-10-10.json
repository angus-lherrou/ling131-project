you just\nHad with them is gay there [noise] um as to where I was questioning about a cap and all and you know stating some facts and are finding out whether\nA when a Democrat that I had no on social

this is racist when I'm not\nAsking is race you know I mean that's what we have to deal with every day\nIt is it is that we have to deal with everyday Matthew I often tell the story about a woman that I met at a party a friend of mine had a a at a birthday parties a Vietnam vet most of the people there are are conservative think the way we think and I'm sitting next to a woman name Irene is either Irene right wing I forget which one\n[noise] and she was going on about how rich people don't pay any taxes at first I thought she was joking and then I realized she was serious return to her and I said you know I'm One of the so called rich you want to see my ten forty\nOr have it in the car and she just kind of laughed I let me ask you something what percentage of all the federal income taxes do you think is paid by the top one percent and the top one percent of people that make about three hundred thousand dollars or more\nShe said what do you mean and I made up of a pie in the air with my hand\nAnd I said assumed this pie is the federal all the federal taxes are paid by all Americans\nWhat slice percentages paid by the top one percent what percentage of all the federal income taxes do you think are paid by the top one percent you know I understand what you're saying she said I think about two percent I said you think the top one percent pay about two percent of all the federal income tax and she said yeah maybe three percent\nNow Matthew I was waiting for her to tell me to ask me what the actual answer is because it was August for my facial expression it was clear that I ... that she said the wrong thing she never asked me\nAnd the reason I Believe she never asked me not so much that she knew she was wrong\nWhich he wanted to stay wrong she felt more comfortable being wrong because if she knew that the top one percent of all the federal income tax payers contribute thirty nine percent\nTo the federal income taxes would have to have to rethink or attitude about rich people not paying any taxes so she never asked me\nAnd because she never happened never told her I just wanted to see if you are going to wall with her ignorance and be perfectly content to do so\nShe

Bush after nine eleven signed into law that we needed a passport to leave this country or something\nUnder President Clinton you or I could walk across the candidate Mexico border with just an ID card that being said if I Need a passport to leave this country than they need one to come here\nThey should not be able to claim their country is too dangerous to live in to come here when cities like Chicago or the murder capital of the United states extra keeping the ideal lived about freedom in our great nation that's from Ron in Salem Oregon Ron thanks very much\nI got a bunch of emails on the on the I'm Colin Powell gig he's super fun from a for a general\nHe call he he ... pile chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as the ... lots of fun talking about him yesterday that was an important show for a number of different reasons and I hope I think I did based on the email responses anyway\nBut I Hope you understood how I tied that back to ... was Colin Powell have to do with guns and re asserting himself\nOr just by virtue of the fact he did that interview this this is this is stuff you're going to you're going to need to keep in perspective today I'm going to go over some stuff with you that will again off tie in together all of this is by design\nAnd I intend to bring it day by day by day to you I Want I Want you to see some things that are happening it's very very difficult sometimes\nTo keep everything in perspective when you're being beat down here here's a great example\nWhat happened to Russia I asked that series what happened to Russia what happened to clued in order to go gone\nYour wife's gone does the media is just you know they're just decided not to talk about it today they decided over the last few weeks it'd be talking about and they went on a feeding frenzy\nRight Russia story died\nNobody talked about it anymore this is the danger of the media and how they drive and pushing air how they\nChoose to select the news hey I'm going to make this news today\nBam\nYeah I'll take off on it and it becomes quote unquote the news the news I go back to this what is the news\nOf this is tied together the news is whatever they decided to make it if they want your gun rights to be the news and that's what they decided to do that day then that's what they're going to do on Thursday they're going to make guns the news today drive the narrative\nAnd why we have to be careful when we say we're watching the news I use my parents as an example the other day I called my mom and dad they just got down to Florida called him early in the morning you guys down there okay everything okay is that what you're doing my mom so you're not just getting a couple of getting up get some coffee and watching the news is so what do you watch it too so we're watching Fox and friends you're not watching the news\nYou're watching three people sit on a curvy couch talking crap to each other giving you their opinions that's not the news\nThat's three people talking on a couch on a morning show not the news just because they're talking about the news doesn't make it their news it makes it\nThree people giving you their opinions about what they are telling you is\nTheir nose and there isn't it interesting how those three people on the\nCouch about every thirty minutes turn to someone who deliver you the day's news with the morning's news\nThat's where you'll get stories but are you getting news you're getting what that person is telling you is news is that person to talk about Russia at all over the last three weeks\nHow much news or you really getting she plays out I Love the stuff I'm a student or the stuff I eat this stuff up but I'm going to take it in a different direction in the bottom half of this hour that I think you're going to find pretty fascinating I might get to it a little bit earlier\nBut I think you're going to find it utterly fascinating fascinating stuff and it starts with Kavanaugh it starts with the example of Cavanaugh I Want you to do some homework if you get a chance you know who Thaddeus McCotter is that name ring a bell to you\nMichigan eleventh district was in Congress I Believe through two thousand Thirteen I'll have to check on that belief to two thousand Thirteen\nOf two thousand twelve he was eleventh congressional district from two thousand two or three to twenty twelve that he is McCotter\nIt was a Republican he was also the um\nWhat was he on\nThe ... member of the house you ah forget he was he he chaired the committee I Believe I'll I'll get some more information I just know who he is running that off memory in been around a while but he's writing some column she writes\nHe's a great thinker and he's presented this idea\nA couple of days ago that I Want to run by that I'm going to do something really fascinating for you I'm going to take your right to some words from the U.S Senate pages themselves from the Senate website you can walk away from the show today on\n... ...\nAnd I can promise you nobody else is talking about this stuff today [laughter] because I can promise you before I Do that should I go to Senator Bill Nelson real quick I probably should\nI Know I hate to do that I hate to do that\nBut I Want to our good friend a W. R. Hawkins wrote a piece about Bill Nelson and his push for gun control\nIn in it he referenced\nThe Miami Herald peace in the Miami Herald piece that a W. R. Hawkins reference has a couple insightful little tidbits in it but it dates back to February twentieth and it was it was a piece that was later updated on February twenty second but it's by no means dated\nBy any stretch of the imagination because Bill Nelson of course down in Florida who is constantly calling for gun control has only done more than ... has done nothing more than add to what I'm going to tell you right now which you to take a listen to this title together during the show\nBut Bill Nelson\nHe is in favor of quote unquote an assault weapons ban which you know\nHe voted in favor of the twenty Thirteen assault weapons ban which failed in the U.S Senate now mind you Dianne Feinstein\nOn February sixteenth twenty Eighteen just five days before this\nTweeted this I plan to introduce a bill to require all firearms purchases from gun dealers be restricted to individuals who are at least Twenty one years old you can't buy a handgun or a bottle of beer you shouldn't be able to buy and they are Fifteen\nWell ma'am the only reason we can't buy a bottle of beer at a because I could buy a bottle of beer ATP here comes from mandated law\nI could buy a bottle of beer at Eighteen the only reason I Can't today just because somebody told me I can not because of some natural law\nThat makes it impossible for anybody under Eighteen to drink beer because somebody said we couldn't but somebody else earlier before that said we could\nKind of like what you want to do with ... guns and rifles Eighteen to Twenty one year olds can buy rifles today except in certain states that\nIn one of them in particular which is governed by Republican all the Jeannette talking about Governor Scott in Bill Nelson state who coincidentally is running against Bill Nelson for his long held Senate seat solve kinda fits together doesn't like a giant\nPuzzle slap a leg goes leg goes for thinkers\nBut miss Feinstein wants to get you know why because well now they can but now they can't\nNow you see it now you don't\nBill Nelson once more than that now but I just wanted to remind you of what Feinstein set because apparently Feinstein is like ... also tear up\nRaising the age to legally on rifles like the A R Fifteen from Eighteen to Twenty one he's in favor of that notion as indicated his support for raising the minimum age to purchase salt rifle since the Parkland shooting congressional action to ban bump stocks he's in favor of that\nShe'll carry reciprocity act he's against that he voted against the acting twenty Thirteen when it came up in the Senate purchasing guns while the terror watch\nList he's against that even though there's no way to tell who's on the terror watch list there is no criteria for it and they could put anybody that they don't want to buy guns on that list and thereby wiping out all due process\nYou've got to ask from the national Rifle Association and he wants more he wants more will go into that a little bit about what else he wants to now that they W. R. is reporting on in just a couple of minutes after this break I just wanted to give you a quick background will be back right after ... [noise]\nHave you ever met a Democrat ever ever\nThat hasn't embraced every one of these ... not one would oppose it\n\nNow we're no hold on a second you might have a Joe mansion who has no convictions and we'll wait to see what Susan Collins does before he decides what to do\n\nIf the Democrats were in control of the White House and both houses of Congress your Second Amendment rights are gone they're done\nFinish\nSupreme Court's conservative mark we'd have a that's a two three four year process\nAfter a bill has been signed into law\n\nAnd then another bill comes along and another bill comes along and another bill comes along and Dianne Feinstein is still alive\nWriting new bill banning new stuff it's nightmarish to even consider\nWhat the Bill Nelson he wants\nA database national data is not think about what that would entail think about that so you have to go back and you have to understand that that we got to take this to universal background checks were just to say what is it what's their big buzz where we need universal background checks they defaulted that doesn't matter that the guy passed a background check it doesn't matter\nThat no background check was necessary all they'll say to regardless of any question that that will be well the first thing we should do is we should Institute commonsense legislation and we can start right\nNow and it's common sense in which we need we need universal background checks if you ask them what that is they won't know but none of the goofy lives on the on the panels or none of the reporters will ask them about that they won't because they don't know either they don't have to ask well ... what is a universal background checks\n\nThey just been hearing it so long they just think it's something that work they don't even know what the hell it is\n\nBut what has to happen ... let me tell you what it is it's a background check for every transaction period every personal\nCommercial friends make no difference gun changes hands background check that's there I won't seats are holy grail because there is no holy grail there's no end to these people are just move the goalposts for another only grow what has to happen in order for that to be even enforceable\nYou have to have a national gun registry otherwise how the hell are they going to know who's got what gun\n\nThat's why they call for universal background check that's just step one minute a year they're gonna say well it's not working because we need national registry\nYoung people think sinking in\nYeah it is to you remember ignorance when left unattended reads stupidity [noise] I'll be back right after this next half hour to be a lot of fun [noise]\nAnd\n[noise] what else are and news off half the faucet National
