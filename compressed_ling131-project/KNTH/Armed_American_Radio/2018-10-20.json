Holly is he died in Nineteen Seventy four at the age of Seventy one born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama\nSame home to home state as mom and now they've named day post office building on a street called orange avenue near where I used to live downtown\n[noise] first person I've ever heard of in\nOf the fight for the right to keep and bear arms and it's an honor to be asked to go out there and do show last year I could not because of my wife's condition I was not traveling for that for a year\nSo that we could get this breast cancer think past us which we have successfully done thank God and that enabled me to get out there this year so lots going on what was it was he the emotional week\nFor a lot of different reasons not the least of which of course because my wife has completed overtreatment as of a two days ago yesterday yesterday actually when her chemo port was taken out\nBut because it coincided with the Arizona citizens defense league that I couldn't go to the year before I could now and it just made for a a great week a great way to wrap up what's been a difficult year which some fine fine fine people and I was honored to be able to do that\nSo thanks to you Arizona citizens defense week if you want information on easy CDL and I would highly recommend you get on their mail is to read what it is they're up to because not only are they fighting for Arizona they're also fighting for you regardless of where you happen to live they are literally\nLiterally walking point for you as Bloomberg is let's just say Bloomberg\nIt's hard to say his name and you should [laughter] if Bloomberg is dumping a ton of money into trying to derail\nThe right to bear arms in Arizona which in large measure means the railing Arizona citizens defensively and there are many many years of effort you know people say well Arizona has always been gun friendly but that that might be might be true\nBut if that's the case\nWhy is it Arizona citizens defense week is necessary in the first place how many more right do we need restored quite a few let me give you one indication of what I noticed in Arizona\nAnd I don't argue the fact that Arizona is the most gun friendly state in the country for a lot of reasons however depending on what's more important to you may be places off limits is more important to you than constitutional carry\nAnd I could easily easily make that case\nI don't care if I can carry it without a permit some people would say I have a permit I don't really care I'd rather be able to carry in more places\nSo you know it's six to one half dozen the other what's good for the goose might not be good for the gander so I've heard all of these arguments some people don't mind getting a permit some people wish they didn't have to get a permit but well that's just why some people put up with that okay everybody has different ideas different thought I Would argue\nThat well Arizona I Love constitutional carry and I do Arizona's got the freedom you look you come to Arizona you're a law abiding individual you don't need to ask permission and that's the way it should be nationwide should be that way in off if you stay eventually we will get their don't believe the media we are in fact winning this battle\nThat's why Bloomberg is requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to try to fight who off and he's going to fail freedom freedom isn't for sale\nBut well constitutional Kerry is great and it is and it should be that way I just had an office you state I\nWant to be able to carry wherever I have a right to be that includes a restaurant that includes wherever I happened to go\nI saw more no guns signs in tombstone as I mentioned earlier this week\nIn a day then I have in Georgia in a year because they just start for the most part non existent in the state of Georgia one to carry a gun into whatever sample Schmitt you go to Georgians and business people understand that and recognize that\nArizona is for whatever reason feel the need to put up a sign and they're all over the place you walk to you I was walking through old town Scottsdale you'll see tons of no guns allowed in Scottsdale a you know it's not just got up there just where I happen to be but you see those in a lot of different places\nSo how do you know whether you can take your gun with you when you get out of the car to where it is you're going unless you call in advance\nMaybe you have to call and I don't want to have to do that I Want to know why I Want to know when I get out of my car or get off wherever it is that I'm however form of transportation I'm faking it where I go oh my God is legal legal\nI don't have to worry about violating the law or somebody policy and worried about getting thrown out so\nThose are just some of some of the arguments that we hear across the board some to some people that much to me that's very important I'll tell you that right now that's very important I Want to know I carry my gun everywhere I go\nSo Arizona What a wonderful time I had a blast\nAnd wait to go back that's going to be in June if not sooner look I'm going to see a lot of you Arizona over the course of the next year let me give you a quick rundown probably be out there again in February just because that's one I like to go\nI Know I'll be out there again in June for the freedom day's festivities into stone I'll have a lot more information about that coming up over the course of the next few months but I Will definitely be there will be in tombstone in which means also be in Phoenix and the gun rights policy conference coming up in twenty Nineteen\nIn Phoenix at the same hotel the easy CDOs at at the Sheraton crescent in Phoenix so lots of Arizona coming up I Love this I I I'm looking forward to swear off months because I Love Arizona so I'm Glad you were out there as I toured around a little bit and got a lot of that a lot of work done and accomplished a lot of things\nSo that's a step back on Wednesday from that and boy we've had a lot to report since we've been back we've been telling you about some of the efforts of the Democrats the ... falls in California's ... district and so forth and I have got some e mail to read\nSo why don't I take the opportunity now to do that one of them was from a resident of the twenty fifth district in California we're talking about that liberal Ms
