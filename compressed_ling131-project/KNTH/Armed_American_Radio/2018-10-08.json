downstairs so the company to and eat breathe that young man to go upstairs number two\nWhy would she and the company to actually an ... young men go into a room that had no other exit and she alleges that Kavanaugh was trying to take her clothes off was lying on top of\nThe ... when George joined um so what are the three of them then supposedly they fell\nOff now you've got to see athletes they might have been drinking but if they were intent on taking her clothes off why is it not one of them was able to grab her arm and to read from getting before she could get out\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and I for nothing asked about that\nAll excellent questions Hillary even says that ah Christine forest testimony she cannot say with a hundred percent truthful\nI Want to ask you a question about Dr for for a minute if there are a lot of Democrats who are in a lot of other people who are absolutely certain hundred percent her her recollection is the absolute truth I'm asking this as a lawyer do you feel a hundred percent certain that the events that she described um ah are true and are therefore disqualify\nLook I I watch is not to protest money as I could I found her very credible you have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through this if they\nDid you ask a question about when he to Broderick\nDid not believe canceling willing that they hadn't been for flowers court information all the junk Ken I'm On the Lewinsky to convey to the Senate she basically said that she thought\nNow this was a fascinating exchange between Rick I between Chris Cuomo and Rick Santorum Cuomo keeps saying that Kevin testified that he was pure that he was a horrible you know you didn't\nIf he's lying about anything in this context short of his actions toward the women who are making the accusations\nDo you think that that is not disqualifying record\nWell look I first off I don't know how you're going to prove that he's caught lying about something that I mean this this is what he's he said that he drank he said that he drank to access that time said he was drunk at times he admitted to that the only thing he did not admit to his\nWas blacking out and not recalling things and he has you know he has his his college roommate basically you know what I'm saying I mean I live with this guy for three years I never saw him and his position for the next day he was ...\nFor selling on ... ah did also said that he never saw him blackout I don't know that the blackout standard is the sole criteria and I know you know what you're saying that he got drunk I might I didn't really admitted any more than he needed to I Do think it's fair criticism to say that he was not talking about himself the way his classmates\nTalk about him the question is does it matter\nAnd I get I I don't think I I don't see where ... is it does he have to go out and say oh yeah I got I got ... no I mean it's\nSo dry I feel like you watch yeah the interview wait I called us when it happened as a mistake and not because it was with Fox folk it's because he sat across from a friendly face and he painted a perfect picture of himself\nChurch and social project for me now Iraq it out here that we drank beer or but you know maybe you want to many he was not talking about himself the way other people talk about him but\nJennifer somewhat that characterization that's not a lie well then why are all these people all around her like why are these people coming forward and went to school with um wreck and saying he's lying about who we was we called him a ...\nAnd a lot I think that he has a lot of money coming in many many many more are coming in and saying\nThat the right Kevin or they know is exactly consistent with what he's saying yeah you have any like well yeah yeah backing off what sixty five women side to side of documents are saying this is all about checked or not that's not Brett Kavanaugh but just yesterday Romney there doesn't mean that didn't happen on weren't that they they are tightening\nNone of them ever said he didn't party he didn't get drunk a lot that that he said they were to vouch about his character your partner and I get why but it's got to be worse your party you say all these people came out to say that what the other people say is true but none of them say that\nNone of those sixty five you have a permit to parse a woman said and on the issue of his credibility about his habits drinking\nHe is so over a hundred percent of the time and the only a little bit too much and it's nothing out of character that's not true they don't offset Jennifer what your point\nWas in an interview was that interrogation is an interview with the prosecution or your commentator or you a journalist\nBecome back when I talk to her

I was a sixteen Seventeen something like that [noise] ah\nMy father got invited to this meeting it wasn't that politically active but he was a prominent figure [noise] and uh this was in\nThe uh Flatbush section of Brooklyn are underway for do think Charles Schumer to us ah and I think this is before he ran for Congress is what he was becoming a a state assembly person [noise] so um\nThey were introduced here and they were trying to sell them to us he was not a very impressive figure I must say it was a wine a a nasal ah didn't seem to have much confidence and they were trying to put forward and and sell them\nOn the basis and unfortunately the the all the assumptions that went into this horrible but they put forward on the basis that he's going to get the black\nOr if ... if you know the flap but section\nIt tends to be a wide section of a single family homes and for whatever reason over the years it evolved in that way but there's a cluster of apartment houses on avenue cave where blacks reside in [noise]\nAnd frankly they were there were not violent or was it wasn't any kind of a ... class is going on in the streets there was no fear it ... if there was a problem I didn't detect that problem I Lived there but go ever\nHad a problem with it it would only been on a strictly races type of basis [noise]\nAnd uh\nSo they brought over to us they see this guy is a genius he's got a plan to get the blacks or fair UK really how's he going to do it well as what he's going to do is going to make some kind of a state funded refurbishing of those buildings so our paper to look like he's helping the book\nAnd of course they carry furniture with the people living this so they moved to people or to other locations\nAnd while they're refurbishing and then\nThey'll turn into a type of a a co-op unit where you have to buy your way back and there was suing that most of those people would not have the funds necessary to buy back and and so by then they would already maybe it would take a year or two for the construction there would be settled in the new area anyway they wouldn't bother to come back and then\nThere was some of these apartments so white people and that would be the solution [noise]\nSo he was a man who is Korea was launched a racist premise or manipulation of political power to achieve racist as absolutely disgusting\nNow Jay this Chuck Schumer he was not in office he was running for New Yorkers simply at the time\nI as I ... the best of my recollection I see I I'm not positive on the date so I'd have to go back in his career it was either it seems most logical to me that we didn't know him at all you would have been running for state assembly\nNow he stood up how many people were were at this meeting roughly\nA you know it's not the kind of thing you say in front of a large crowd I was you know ten twelve people who are at some ... ... and I guess it was a a sort of assumptions that you could you know talk this kind of inside baseball ... I mean I was very very uncomfortable with what ... what a lot of\nThe promises that that one is that it's all a you know it's their accent I mean there was something that of course we want to get rid of the books\nAnd that this young Harvard educated you know with that but it's going to come up with a great solution had accomplished that it was awful\nAnd it was humorous planned the one that you just outlined about relocating them on the basis of these are going to be refurbished and then they get right up first refusal they wouldn't be able to\nTo a forward to pay for it and voila they would be gone just with Schumer outlining this plane right\nAnd that's it yeah and there was selling it to say look what a genius it came up with the strategy would have thought is this is a master stroke\nMhm now this plan never gotten implemented or do you know why not well\nThey do get in for months and then that they do the referral thing but uh\nThey underestimated the capacity of the people to move back they they were able to raise the father came back to them and it's pretty much the neighborhood is the same as though he's been except that uh the blacks ended up with with better housing which was all for the good but that was not the U.S has\nWhat did your father or think of this plan\nWell my father was not really that political figure and uh and I didn't really discuss it with him I was a teenager and to me it was is revolting mhm so\nUm why did you take so long before writing about that you were sixteen years old but you didn't write about it as a kid\nAt the time but that but that's really what got me motivated to politics at all the years as I was getting engaged and as a writer I used to ride for it to the Jewish magazines and eventually a broad and into the Washington DC magazines and I was working my way up\nThe ladder so to speak I always wanted to tell my story and in fact in Nineteen Ninety six\nI was a there was a fellow named Robert L Virgo who's running against sure for Congress and I actually went to apply to become his campaign manager and like you know who you are like you come from\nI don't understand I this man is is\nA you know even personified I if I could do I think the ring of the woods so so of course uh the local Republicans I never heard of me at the time and I and I didn't get the job but [noise] but uh so just to show you how past that I was about that and I would dress up particularly offensive because\nHe was the congressmen for a very orthodox Jewish section in New York [noise] uh he would go around and and pans it to them or talk a little you're the stuff like that mhm and then he would take\nTheir votes these is a really holy wonderful people and he would use their votes for all the evil society as a law it couldn't show was the most reliable vote for Bush has anything any type of thing that that involves\nA you know undermining right traditional society is the most reliable vote and his power came from Los ... sweet people who who is the record\nWe're ... we're we're putting ... article up on Larry on the dot com race to the top by Jay Honda Jay thank you very much for coming on maybe this time somebody will finally asked Chuck Schumer about this Jay thanks for coming on TALK shows and I really appreciate it always a plus you got it\nAnd now Schumer is blasting Kavanaugh for lacking the appropriate demeanor of a judge what kind of demeanor did you show when you were pushing that racist plan to get rid of blacks\nSir if you say well maybe he's telling the truth and maybe he's not he doesn't belong on the Supreme Court\nAnd I think most Americans are saying that\nEven if you want to discount that some people do what happens when he was Fifteen in high school\nAnd Eighteen in college and\nHow were you when you propose that raised a scheme that Jay on that just spoke about\nYou Tana this camp where he is saying and protesting at age fifty three\nHey if you were a racist in Nineteen Seventy four you're probably a racism twenty Eighteen right\nWhen it flies in the face\nOf being truthful unbelievable that's the key question here their demeanor you sure didn't show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing there is partisanship\nBrought out the most raw form of partisanship so on the coming of someone on the district court federal appeals court let alone the Supreme Court\nShow any semblance to always being a hundred percent on us than truthful which is what we need in a Supreme Court justice\nNow this week that the FBI supposed to take the Democrats really want
