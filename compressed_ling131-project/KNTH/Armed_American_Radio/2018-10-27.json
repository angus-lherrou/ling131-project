... recall often shown over the all to use more mobile ... shows to a mobile\nYou didn't set of very well Richard let's go you know Claire Wisconsin to Ken Ken you're on with mark\n[noise] um yes I voted for President Trump simply because he said he was going to drain the swamp it didn't mean if you were a Democrat or if you were Republican\nYou were banned the restraint and you're you're out and make America great again [laughter] and it didn't matter what side you're on but if you were bad and all these people that are against them or running like little dogs\nJail McCurry are like\nThat man I think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on was mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she opened recalled for civil unrest last week um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience\nGo wacko or want to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but Joe she's on the other side she can say anything she wants\n[laughter] right [laughter] I you know what\nIt it made the other day as far as that ... concern out how to eliminate all media coverage say hey we're going to let them in the ... to register Republican in\nThat delivered [laughter] you're not hearing anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're\nThat's a great point in fact a you know I I agree with you if there was any thought that illegal immigrants were voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even in a majority\nWhy do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from buying into um Clinton uh to Hillary Clinton all of them were against illegal immigration but now that it's convenient and they need to vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump is seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Ninety Ninety five percent of voting Obama's case if\nIt ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble\nBecause that's what they count on that count as I mentioned the store with ... that they cannot just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they have and help the poor the fact that if you look at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like an inner city none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from minorities because they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listening to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they teach you that for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business vote last time most of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly it wasn't a Trump fault and for Hillary Clinton\nSo this idea that Republicans for for of our big business and the Democrats or the poor and the people who and we had a caller challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised each not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to so many people because one of the things that gets them in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps and they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this spin and all the stuff the politicians usually do what'd you say one thing and then live another way\nTo do with a different way\nThis guy is different he surprised me\nHe says some things on Twitter in do you know to eat some things you wish she wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds everybody\nThat this is what makes America special it was an exceptional experiment\nIn the course of human history and Paul Donald Trump in his own way get said let me know what you're saying at eight eight eight nine seven one said mark gosh for\nAll of us [noise]\n\nI'm going to say something about relief factor here's the key eighty percent of the people who try to release after quick start buying again\nTake David from Pennsylvania is what he said I tried relief factor for hip pain and I was surprised that it also help relieve my shoulder and foot discomfort\nNow after taking it for a month I stopped and sure enough the pain returned my foot discomfort came back to where I started taking relief factor again and within a week the pain was relieved I now understand it I get it I'm now taking relief factor daily [noise]\nNow your body is already fighting inflammation also known as the silent killer a hundred million Americans suffer from information to try and do something about it tried to three week quick start Nineteen dollars in Ninety five cent Ninety five cents a day less than a cup of coffee a day for pain relief\nJust go to release factor dot com relief factor dot com that relief factor dot com\nAm dams\nShelves almost gum and do you buy values maybe you know here's indicated going into the um\nWhat kind of America would you like to leave for your children and grandchildren whatever resemble what our parents and grandparents left to us\nGiven our dysfunctional immigration system it would not appear so not even close\nA report by the center for Immigration Studies finds that one in five children born in the U.S in twenty fourteen had an immigrant mother\nBased on an analysis of Census Bureau data center estimates that nationally one in Thirteen bird shoes to an illegal immigrant meaning automatic citizenship for the child the total is three hundred thousand per year\nOne in eight birds says to a legal immigrant CIS also found more than half of the birds the legal and illegal immigrants are paid for by taxpayers including sixty seven percent of the birth stew illegals\nWhy the concern it's about assimilation because children from immigrant families were largely interact only with each other and it's more of a burden to taxpayers and just one more reason that we need any for immigration reform I'm Cal Thomas\n...

we\nPut because we can do is we want to um Piers Morgan is out with some comments a couple of days ago you know Piers Morgan the gun grabber gun hater but this guy bizarrely loves Donald Trump\nAnd he said that he wrote for the Daily Caller well he didn't write it somebody wrote about it but Piers Morgan says midterms may be Trump's biggest knockout punch Piers Morgan said the midterms may be the biggest knockout punch of Donald Trump's presidency given his popularity despite attacks from the left you know that Donald Trump\nIs more popular percentage wise than Brock Obama was at the midterms\nWhat have we been talking about all week\nMedia creating narratives right\nHateful left in the media now they're going to attack Donald Trump\nBecause this guy had Trump stickers on his dad or duty\nJust talk out all over the Internet I guess it was Rush Limbaugh I read somewhere today started this about the stickers are all new right\nOn the van how does that happen in Florida well I've been in Florida and\nYou know any stickers you put on the car and a matter of days start to peel off it gets hot down there man okay hot\nThey get good week they get weathered so I started looking at it and it's there they were perfectly place what does that have to do with anything that everything here just fix to perfect some something's wrong we talked about it yesterday something's fishy in Florida sometimes rotten in Denmark with something's really fishy in Florida\nSo to have fun with me for the day you can see what kind of day is going to be I'm going to be talking with my friend and your friend Andy Hoosier the voice of reason from Kate you am Andy you're ready to go down any rabbit hole we choose how you doing that\nA Mark I'm doing great my friend is great to talk to you and I don't know I got to say it is first of its going to be fun going down different rabbit holes tonight but I Will say you said you're drinking water come up and it's a friday what do you do with

specifically so\nThat's wonderful and I was going to cut some some promos and cut a couple of spots foreign today and I just wasn't comfortable doing it because I don't want that cold my voice you know and so you guys were kind enough to say yeah it's good for Monday so yeah I'm drinking water man you know ...\nWell you know that's true but whiskey really does burn stuff out of the throat I'm just saying\nWell you know my doctor actually told me that a couple of days ago you know that one honest to God honest to God for the sore throat and stuff like that you said a little bit of whiskey is really good whiskey has been in New Hampshire for a long long time right\nMhm it is it I mean it's the old cowboy trick I'm gonna tell you what you get you need to break a fever you got the sore throat you sip on some whiskey it depends on\nThe amount of whiskey I mean if the sore throat you just do a couple of Charlotte and met a if you need to break a fever you do a couple of more shots and it helps sweat it out I tell you what I Will do the best night sleep I ever had my entire life I was sicker than a dog I came home from work\nI took a hot shower I took about three Advil I took a little ... I took about three shots of whiskey and I was out for two hours straight and I felt good the next day [laughter]\nYou know if you want to forget your call at least I thought it was time being killed a bottle right wow they're not really enjoy tomorrow but see then you wake up tomorrow you know what that didn't work so you're never gonna do it again\nYou ought to be careful there man you got to be careful there not love good Kentucky bourbon you know it is good for the soul from time to time no question about it All right Andy\nI'm perplexed here okay I Want you to help me now I Know I didn't get a chance to listen to you today but I Know you were talking about this and a lot of what we're going to talk about not wasn't breaking at the time you were on the air\nCorrect sure All right\nWhat do you think now we've got the Clintons we've got Kamala Harris we've got now let's let's go through these losses Paris hates Trump anti Trump everything comes out of her mouth waters do\nWe need to talk about Maxine Waters end up you know you catch them wherever they are\nAnd and you kick them out you tell them they're not welcome here that's not hate speech is it now that's just the Democrats being a Democrat so to the Democratic media well that's just politics into them politics is a blood sport right and if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen that's just the way it is of course until it's turned on them that if the other way around All right\nBut we got a I guess a Obama's okay Bronx out there now talking crap about Trump All right you got Clinton is\nSaying that what what did Hillary just recently say\nAbout the Trump and the Republicans you ... oh yeah what what you say\nI don't remember exactly what she said but I mean she's come out and made a couple of statements\nYeah she she said something very negative about the oh you can't be civil with the Republicans today I Can't tell ya into until\nYou take over until you take the majority\nRight you got to come back and take and they got to hold or who's talking about kicking them when they're down ... funding all this crap bread and who is hateful all day long\nOn the news network Robert De Niro who is now all kinds of Trump hatred if we were to take a class or same thing by the same thing wanting to take them out and punch him in the schoolyard Booker and the rest of them if you want to take all of their statements and put them up on a big mural and\nYou didn't put their names on there clearly it would be ... I mean certainly it would be considered some type of hate speech right\nExactly now you got all these people all of a sudden get leases vicious packages\nAnd lo and behold the guy's got a truck van you know he just driving around South Florida which is not from town anyway and nobody noticed is this thing now he gets popped in a matter of days all of this before the midterms what's in your gut Andy some thinking it might write something fishy in Florida in Denmark\nSomething rotten just a little bit no I agree here's the thing I ... I never want to speculate never liked speculating because especially with stuff like this it's dangerous and with the threat that came out I mean we don't want anybody\nTo be harmed in any way shape or form and I don't like to be able to speculate I like to get the facts but there's something very fishy about this because it happened right before the midterm election this was right after the ... you know anti find many of the elected officials that actually are endorsing anti ... you have like you mentioned could Kamala Harris and you have\nA all these different elected officials trying to say that it's okay to go out and publicly of harassed Republicans and Trump supporters and then all of a sudden this comes out right after the caravan thing it's like it's stage it's set up\nA a one after another after another after another and it's all falling because none of it has worked against Trump he's right to let the campaign trail they were still able to get through Kavanaugh they still\nI mean he goes to a rally and you see\nTens of thousands of people I mean he just came to speak or just a an hour north of here\nWhat two weeks ago and they had over Fifteen thousand people show up in the state of Kansas when you have to travel to hours just to get to the town and you saw these\nThis amount of people show up its massive how much support he gets in everything they've tried has not worked so this I don't know I I don't like to speculate I don't like to put on the tinfoil hat and say it's a conspiracy if he is not so crazy Trump supporter than you know I don't care who it is he needs to be punished for it\nIf this is legit but why would why would this happen right before the election with this ever had helped Trump I mean if every let's say that one of these went out for all of them went off\nHe would become martyrs\nAnd that was would not healthy Trump's agenda now you can't think rationally if you're thinking of a terrorist wanting to blow up people and you write\nBook outside the box that sense but if you're a pro Trump supporter for trying to promote a political agenda\nThis would not help because whoever is that you do end up taking out becomes a martyr and then all of a sudden all the support goes towards that group because they're playing the victim ... which they do very very well so you're right at the fact that they found this guy very quickly that they had the Trump ban all over the place that he's a big road trip pro Trump supporter\nOr we caught on very early and saying wait a second this doesn't sound right now this falls into place I don't know I don't like to speculate and put on the tinfoil hat but I Am a little suspicious about what's going on\nWhere you have to be you\nKnow there's a there's a phrase for this they actually have it named it's called October surprise mhm it happens virtually every presidential election doesn't it exactly they handled it\nFor both federal elections and for local elections at the ... the October surprise always happens in the last week we're waiting for the big bombshell ... happened I didn't realize that it was going to be\nAn actual bomb threat because they never use something like that it's always the sex scandal that comes out at the very end or or the the crazy photo of them and some weird place they're not supposed to be under some wild scandal personal attack but the personal attacks haven't worked on trumpet nor any of the Republicans\nThat are sided with Trump yet so they're trying a different angle\nIf that's the case allegedly\nAnd if this comes out to be that way than it would be no surprise I mean come on they put on the for the return address uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz shows for crying out loud I mean who honestly think that it was her that that something like this but they knew the addresses come on\nI Know the the the whole thing reeks it's gonna be kinda fun to watch this thing unfold it really truly is now here's what we're we know and we'll talk about this when we come back to the left has very good at this there the ... the media the media I who\nShe got a hold on to it now anti I got a hold on to it but you know how I feel about the media I opened up yesterday show talking about it I kind of want to go there again because it has a gun owners we are very familiar with this type of tactic from the mainstream press and we're getting ready to watch it unfold now against Trump the lights you've never seen before if that's even possible back after this with Andy Hoosier boys [noise]\nObvious that we've connected all the dots that all of a sudden he's the Trump supporters Trump people or fascist and racist we would never do that because we are loving W people are even though we just kind of said look the anti find black lives matter and all those good jobs\nAnd we don't care what Maxine Waters has to say and we don't care what happens to Ted Cruz and his family and we don't care about\nUs Steve skull east being shot by end AK forty seven wielding Democrat lunatic want to be a sat then ... report that the media\nThat it's it's it's it's ... that's the whole thing again this becomes the lie of omission see the angry mark begins to come out of the box here because I Know what the media's up I've been studying this for years I Know how they do what they do\nAnd you know why they do what they do and when we see we call them out on it and it is fun to call them out on it but they're playing a very dangerous game a very dangerous game and it's unfortunate you know Trump set of weed out yesterday saying that you know the vast majority of his anger in the in the country comes from the mainstream media while the media doesn't like to hear that\nExcept they forget the fact that they are the source that\nPeople read see and hear your instance where their opinions come from because of what they see now I challenge you listener put it down for a week get off the TV don't\nCome home and watch the news\nThe crap off what's your phone down use\nIt for phone calls and that's it and then set it down you're going to find out that\nYou've got a life to live and guess what happens Andy when you don't watch this garbage you don't miss anything\nYou don't miss anything dried eight next is better than friday last because you didn't have to deal with all this come and go wow you know what what did I miss today nothing nothing\nAnd the and the well she didn't go ahead go ahead\nAnd here's here's ... to go on with it a little bit of I Would say especially right now during the election season so relieved focus on what's important when it comes to issue driven agenda ain't none of\nThis stuff none of the and none of the BS or the distractions or anything else but an election time right now this is one of the most important midterms that anybody's seen in a really really long time and it's time to focus on the issues and as you can see in the media it you're not going to get issued driven agenda discussions going on in the mainstream media\nNo and you already know what the issues are the impact you you already know where the people stand on that\nTurn the crap off mute the ad when it comes on or just don't turn it on to begin with you know where you are you know what your issues are and my gosh if you're looking to people like Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo and the rest of these people or anybody I don't care who the pond in it the retired so and so to form your opinion\nI'm not sure you shouldn't even be voting be honest with you or there was a bold statement when we come back we'll continue the discussion with if you lose your the voice of reason think for yourself is what I'm telling ya wow\nWe're watching the mainstream media and kicking into high gear right now it's only gonna get worse between now and November six so buckle down and down the hatches we'll be right back\nAnd\n[noise] that's for a news off half a sauce federal authorities have captured a
