R. Hawkins second hour he kills it as usual\nOf course they W. R. has been covering everything that's happened all week and we had a I guess\nAn opportunity to cover probably six or seven of his his writing this week largely focusing on the ... the ... effort\nOf the left in the wake of yet again in other domestic terror attack and their attacks on our rights and gun owners it's just\nShocking anymore I mean you come to expect it from the left\nThat vial despicable human being shed and what was tweeting about the n._r._a. and gun laws before we knew anything about what had actually happened in Pittsburgh she was tweeting minutes after\nShe got the news it it's just this woman need mental health evaluations she is sick\nShe sick in the head that she is a well however she's compensated I don't know what she's doing I don't know what she's trying to compensate for\nWhich you sick she demanded she is twisted she need mental health evaluations I Hope her family and I hope Bloomberg center somewhere to get looked at this woman needs help\nTo come after an attack millions of Americans millions of hardworking Americans\nActive duty military veterans law enforcement regular everybody from every walk of life every religion every color in the wake

as John always does\nJohn was John he has every single fact and number two backup everything he says he simply\nBecause the houses have at every twist and turn you but you know John is frustrated right now and I played an audio clip I won't play it again here today but John was frustrated and he put out about a minute and forty second somewhere around there audio tape\nOn social media did he recorded extremely frustrated about what is it going to pay\nFor these people to understand that gun free zones are murdered his own gun free zones are getting people kill John has the research we discussed it on the program yesterday on the monster cast that shows the D.C ... that these events\nAre planned as little as six months in advance to back up to two years in advance\nAnd the evidence that John refers to win the show last night is overwhelming that these killers\nPlan where they go specifically so they could rack up a body count they mentioned it in their manifesto at what point in time are we ever going to be able to convince\nGutless spineless politicians intellectually dishonest individual and some that are clearly suffering from mental health problems who are so overwhelmed\nAnd have to feel that that they need to attack millions of American such as she added what\n\nThat their push for continued gun free zones is getting people killed at what point are we going to be able to convince those people yeah sort of that as we are not they're not interested in fixing the problem they're interested in making more money that's in\nAnd then watch case bringing in more do even more than Bloomberg supplier looking fundraising off of this is just sickening it's evidence of a bigger problem as far as I'm concerned\n\nIt if it's all just awful but nonetheless it's speech about\nNo we're not going to change their mind if it's just it is what it is when it comes to these people they are not concerned about fixing the problem they are simply concerned about their agenda power and money it's it's sad but true\nI opened up the program yesterday with a really fascinating exchange that I had the whole thing started very interesting yesterday morning\nI got a phone call early in the day or early what's early early as a relative term right if you're a person that we'd still ten am I Am as early it was about it was about nine nine thirty eastern time\nI got a call from a a British producer who I I get a lot of calls from them in situations like this I Do a lot of interviews oversees\nThis one was leading Britain's conversation obese the Ninety seven point three radio\nKevin Maguire is the host I've been on the show with Kevin before Kevin is looking for red meat I understand his game he's not interested in quote unquote debate he's interested in attacking is gassed in this case to be in an attempt to I don't know compensate for whatever it is he feels he needs to compensate for\nWith his gas you some of these people look for red meat radio Kevin is one of these guys\nI've gone round and round with Kevin before is that my first rodeo wasn't fun to what to expect but the producer they're so nice over there it's it's so hard to say no I'm busy\nI Know mark Hey Mike of the LDC we drove to have you on the show today with Kevin ... companies talk which is just a little bit it's there are so friendly in her so nice it's so hard to say no but I didn't want to say no I wanted to do the interview and I knew what to expect from Kevin so having said that\nI agreed to do the interview Fifteen minutes later the obesity producers called me back and I found myself on the air with Kevin McGuire he originally went to a reporter dispersed gas\nWas a reporter for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette a gentleman by the name of Paul I didn't catch his last name but Paul was\nExtremely thorough in his response to Kevin question about what can be doing to stop these Mad Men with booms\nAnd uh I I Can't say you know the guy didn't come a crop I don't know anything about Paul from Pittsburgh Post Gazette what he was one hundred percent rational response was essentially look unless you come up with less American pass a law on all Americans agree to take every gun\nAnd somehow do that this isn't a this is very it's impossible stops very difficult to very complex issue he was saying\nAnd you continue to point out the gun control laws simply don't work no new laws going to stop someone else and Kevin did not questioned him at all you left the journalist speak from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette then came to me\nAnd the attack began and I I started by admitting that I've bought Paul was correct I thought it was I was listening I thoroughly enjoyed it\nAnd I started to elaborate on some of those things I did it politely\nI did it graciously I never lose my cool when I'm On the air with them over there if you lose your cool you lose the argument\nFirst one to lose their cool loses the arguments and it's always Kevin McGuire I get the biggest kick out of it he simply cannot accept the fact we talked about background checks you want background checks to stop these lunatics reminded him that the killer in Pittsburgh and about\nThirty others packed background checks you said we've got to do something of course everything he asked for we already have and then he can't propose anything different and I begin to flip the question on him and say listen I'm interested in hearing what you have to say tell me what would work let's let's do what you think would work\nAnd he immediately goes to banning guns which of course is it going to work in the United states he doesn't want to hear that he gets off the\nPicks up his little toys run out of the sandbox\nCause basically Cosby an idiot slammed the phone down\nJust weren't all interested you I'm not interested in your thoughts and prayers anymore Bach and he hangs up knocked the whole thing's on video because he's televised doing this show\nAnd it was really fun to watch\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter go watch the video it's on my Facebook page at armed American radio Facebook dot com slash armed American radio and it's also on my

fake news media true enemy of the people must stop the obvious in the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nYou wrote on Twitter quoting that will do much to put out the
