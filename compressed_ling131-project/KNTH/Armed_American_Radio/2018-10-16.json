have to go there\nI knew it was actually I have to go and I did I went out later that year and I've been coming back to the city every year since then I think about Eighteen months without a stretch and I got to tell your polling into town today you have done an unbelievable job here at the place looks great\nThank you thank you are listening to you know it takes a lot of a coordinated effort with all of the merchants and the citizens to make the town look as good as it does today and uh\nYou know on them and I like to talk about the citizens or you know which by the way I don't know if you told your listeners but as of today you become a U.S on our citizen of tombstone Arizona the town to to die alone when salad and over here and I was a pleasure for me to be able to\nMake you

my honor I Will tell you though a market it doesn't work on the job you can't\nGet on a joke [laughter] I have absolutely no intention of finding out I Do know that they were hopeful over the next two days that were here that will be able to talk with the sheriff which quickly because your time is very valuable I Know you have another meeting used quite a history of tombstone you didn't just get here\nNo I'm actually force the generation native of tombstone my great grand dad came here in Eighteen Seventy seven it was a reporter for the San Francisco chronicle doing a story about the movement southwest and capture drowned them all\nAnd ended up at camp which you could ... about two miles west of here\nAnd they told him about a fellow man I met a chef who made a big strike here he ended up over there I'm friends with him and it wasn't long after that to give him a contract to haul timbers into the end of the newly found mines and we've been here ever since\nYou know I Know I Know a lot of the history of the town soup ... and I've told my audience over the years the story of edge of when and\nHow he was told how the town got its name that he was told by the guards at Fort which you can now that he would find as you know what are you doing going out there in the middle of the night and Apache cut you off what are you looking for he said he was looking for silver and gold they told him and you tell me if it's true that all he was you'll find out there's this tombstone and that's how he named his first strike is that true\nThat's absolutely true we are actually a a chaplain had him he had a unique way of name and his ... and his first one called students don't be called a tombstone because that's what the soldiers out their temperature could totally all you're going to find out ... does your tombstone\nAnd uh and and believe it or not to next a\nSiamese decked out what is called the graveyard\nIt when I was a fascinating to me is that your grandfather your great grandfather and during that now after that strike he went back to Illinois which we will see from Illinois and he raised enough money with his brother to come back out and this is one stone exploded from that point forward\nPretty much yes from that point forward it wasn't long have you had a a prospectors coming from all over and uh all over the country most the rent from Nevada um northern Nevada northern Arizona tombstone to stick their claims and that's how it started\nAnd now tombstone became in this made national news and I want to talk about it now it became the first\nAmerica's first second amendment city how how did that tell me about that\nWell you know it's it's only appropriate that a tombstone would recognize the second amendment since uh you know we're famous for a lot of things that are mostly for the gun fights a but also were famous because we've always believed in having firearms to protect ourselves along the Mexican border and we're a\nAnd you know and I'm not talking about bad about Mexicans are are Indians but we had to watch out for the Indians too so\nThe second amendment was important back in the Eighteen hundreds just as just as it is today\nI often say I use the phrase that the city not not just the city state of Arizona real at American General but where we sit in our particular was\nOn the gun is that a true statement well uh I I think that would be a true statement yes or\nNo you're getting ready to again because we have just a couple of minutes and do you have another point but but you're getting ready to celebrate Eldorado day here in tombstone that starts next weekend this coming weekend and it kicks off of course eight October twenty six as the University of the what\nIs that was ...\nThe big gun fights that make ... famous um\nA wider the was successful in getting tore out about the gun fight when he moved away from Arizona into California and the you have to it's become very famous down worldwide\nNow is that a good thing for the city of tombstone that it's known for the gunfight at the OK Corral\nWell I you know it it's ... it's a lot of folks\nThanked the tombstone as the Old West is anonymous with with the tombstone that doesn't mean that tombstone supports treating people down in the streets right there just means that we know order history is and then we know\nHow important was to have the guns back in the Eighteen hundreds as well it is today or in the you know wider and his brother actually where his brother perjure was was the actual Marshall tombstone\nAnd they actually trying to control the guns by making the guy's either carrier gunner or check it in and they weren't allowed to carry guns in town\nAnd a lot of people don't realize I've talked about it a show but this was early form of gun control by Virgil or it was not very successful in town was\nNo it wasn't didn't actually that law is on the books up until the seventies and somebody challenged it and said you can't do that that's against the state statutes in the constitution Second Amendment and to the judge overruled an overturned ordinance\nAnd did away with it so that you can carry a firearm anywhere in city them ...\nIt is absolutely and I am carrying right now I Hope that's okay right I'm going into stone okay good I'm going to things that you know it's fascinating because the gunfight at the OK Corral of course was actually fought over gun control emerge or from the boys walked right down the street outside where we are now down Fremont Street made a leftover by flash photography studio\nAnd said we're here for your guns one of them went for it in ... said hold that's not what I Want it was over\nGun control some threats by the by the folks who were actually violating the law right\nThat that's absolutely correct into ... and actually it didn't start just that day they'd been wanting to\nThe ... or that you can\nShare your guns in tombstone we've made the law and you're going to live by the law and uh that that that day was the more than point where it finally blew over and and they can do a lot you know I Wonder sometimes as many shots as they shot and there was only a couple of guys here and I don't\nKnow what's real quick and we've only got a couple of minutes but it was a if I'm not mistaken about thirty four seconds was the total fight summer didn't last thirty five seconds to wrap it fired shots when often succession it to this day we don't know who fired the shots is that right\nThat's correct the there's no record of there's no way to prove which who shot the first show\nWas your grandfather here in her great grandfather here in town at that time\nJesse was\nDo you have any writings are stories I mean this is fascinating Alan Gottlieb is sitting across from me and he's he's grinning from ear to ear with each question with these with each after we've been a long time coming trying to get it going to talk to him shortly but does do you have any family heirlooms recollections or anything from that\nWell I Will tell you that uh my grandad or and my great grand dad were pro Clinton the climbers they were ranchers is that right Bill Clinton had eighty some dollars in his pocket when he was killed that we're here in that eighty some dollars had been paid by my great grandfather for breaking some horses foreign\nSo wow see I I'm just sitting here\nIs that
