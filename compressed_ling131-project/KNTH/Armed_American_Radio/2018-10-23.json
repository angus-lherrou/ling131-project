R. G. lots of other things going on I Want to take it today to Florida Lakeland, Florida we discussed the the commissioner the Lakeland commissioner city commissioner\nWho owns an Army Navy store I guess to a surplus store\nCaught a guy stealing and acts shoveling down his pants trying to get out of the store with it\nWound up in a confrontation with him shot him twice and killed him\nI told you a week ago that I Would be shocked after watching the video if that Lakeland city commissioner were not arrested in fact I was surprised he wasn't arrested already I'm Glad there was a thorough investigation and I know is shores anybody else does that sometimes while videos look very damning\nThey're not the whole context they might be the very beginning of or the end of a confrontation that doesn't show the whole story and they're very damning in many cases if we don't know the other context this video though\nThis was hard to take out of context let me give you a little run down let's push them theater of the mind I Want you to picture\nIf you will somebody in a type of hardware store taking an active small hatchet and sticking it down the front of their waste man trying to exit the store that individual was seen by the owner who's been confronted him as the individual was trying to leave the store\nIndividual who was attempting to leave with the ... stall had gotten out the front door and was trying to get away when the owner of the store reached over and grabbed him by the shirt pulled a firearm had a firearm out actually had drawn and pointing at him and was attempting to bring him back into the door\nWhen the individual was attempting to leave\nIn that video I saw no overt threat made to the store owner I saw an individual trying to leave now that separate from the fact he's a criminal and he was stealing something but we have a separate that for just among the individual was leading\nThere was no obvious threat to the store\nOr at that time\nTo try to bring him back into the store maybe bring him back into the store one thing\nWith a firearm drawn changes the dynamic of the situation with that drawn gun attempting to bring him back into the store as the individuals attempting to pull away\nThe store owner fired two shots my comments last week were after watching this the tape appeared extremely damning I was absolutely shocked\nThat the individual had not yet been charged there was no question in my mind that he was going to be charged with the very least\nSome type of voluntary manslaughter and after most of the second degree murder charge individual in Waco and is now charged with second degree murder and has no bought I don't expect him to see the light of day\nFor an awful long time\nLet's go over a little bit about what happened here and you don't want them to do them and use the New York\nTimes for this why not let's just see what they have to say I already know what they have to say\nBut it's I think it's important but first of all it's very important that we covered this because this was an educational this was a teaching moment here for you as a concealed carry permit holder what happened in essence wasn't I'm gonna go over to the times\nThis man Mr done he's a Lakeland city commissioner he was charged with second degree murder friday just a few days ago after fatally shooting the guy that he suspected of stealing the hatchet what happened was the guy saw the ... you dropped it down he took it from a display wreck\nAnd he hid it in the front of his parents this guy's fifty years old and he's out the on ... All right I'm going to go back to that in a minute that's important\nYeah I I Know I Know you know you have nothing better to do man I mean come on save save up Fifteen bucks to buy the damn hatchet whatever\nWhat he dropped it on the front of his past that was according to the affidavit the police affidavit done the city commissioner saw him do it from the office exited with his gun concealed in his waistband okay I don't have a problem with that at all\nDone confronted lister Lopez the fifty year old who was stealing the hatchet and when he did confront him the hatchet fell down Lopez's pant legs and\nIt fell onto the floor that's at the at that time done\nHad the gun out Lopez was saved him I Will pay I Will pay while walking according to the New York times quoted while walking over to the counter Mr Lopez then tried to flee the shop with the hash it in his hand video footage\nThat we've all should I don't know if you've seen it I Would absolutely watch this if you carry a firearm for self defense you need to see this because you're going to see an\nAwful lot done wrong we're going to cover some of this and the next segment as well\nThose city commissioner of the co owner of the store Mr done reaches out and grabs the sleeve what looked like the shirt\nThe shirt sleeves oh Lopez's the criminal and that's what he is he's a criminal each dealing in ... that makes him a criminal\nReaches out and grabs the shirt as he tried to as you these tried to pull you back if you look at the footage of this is obviously the momentum is gender pull this man back into the store okay that's fine too I don't have a problem with that either the problem is he has a gun drawn on him and his pointing it at the man as he is attempting to pull him back\nLots of mistakes being made here all the way around in that confrontation but I digress only because we want to cover exactly what happened and not go down to many rabbit holes here what should've could've would've happened because it did what happened is Lopez was killed\nBecause of two gunshots that were intentionally fire\nMr done according to the New York times kept the hand gun pointed at Mr Lopez for several seconds after shooting while he was on the ground\nAccording to the affidavit at no time did the victim appear to have made any threatening movements towards the subject that right there is a case in point because that's what kicked in stand your ground or not\nRemember this man is the co owner of the store he has a right to be there he has a right to be safe and secure in his in his possessions and his store his place of business\nNo one has the right to come in to steal from that man\nBut they're stealing a hatchet should stealing a hash it costs the man there's life well that depends that depends on what happens after he steals the happy to be able to address\nAnd his waving it at the man trying to cut him in the ad or break is stolen happy absolutely can be shot nobody would've look twice data they would've thank them for saving the cost of a trial but he's fleet he is but we\nNow I Know the store owner doesn't want to lose a hash it we all know what happens\nI Want you to think about that for a second\nHe didn't flee he came out aggressively at the individual now there's an argument that he took a step back when he saw the gun any good defense attorney who's going to knock that went back I think this guy has a chance in court\nTo defeat this I really truly think he does the problem we have with that case in Clearwater is you got the media involved now has a racial thing everything's a racial thing you know I'm sure the guy was thinking I'm going to go out and I'm going to kill a\nBlack man today that's that's not what happened\nThere were multiple people there it went from his perspective a good attorney can make it look like and make it appear\nThat there were three individuals that he was facing ad after being knocked to the ground and I mean he could have been killed ... absolutely could have been killed he didn't know who these other people were you didn't know who was with them I think a good defense attorneys going to have a field day with that case again there's a lot of political pressure on it now\nBecause now you have the ... out and the haters out claiming that he's a racist and everything else\nSo that was predictable in that case this is a different ball game here I think and in this particular case in Lakeland, Florida we've got a clear cut second degree murder case I think Mr done unfortunately for him were unfortunately or fortunately you can't\nKill people simply because you have a God let the guy go call the cops none of it is worth that is it Mr done and that's what I Want you to take away from\nIt you know I was talking about Rob Pincus a couple of moments you go see here I go home and go on a\nRoll down\nIt was a couple of years ago Rob was on the show talking about can you shoot someone who look he he gave us a hypothetical you wake up in the middle of night or someone in your house you come down the steps your arm you see someone urine aiding on your living room floor at two thirty in the morning\nYou shoot that individual\nWhat's your objective your objective is to stay safe without getting hurt and get that individual if you can out of your home\nCan you shoot that individual I Would argue that in most states you probably could claim in your castle that you were in fear for your life when someone invade your home you have a right to shoot that individual\nNo question about it nobody's going to argue that\nShould you\nJust because you can should do you what if the individual starts backing up and saying yeah man I'm In the wrong I was I just want to get out of here and these are and\nWhat do you do that you hold him do you call nine one one you hold him at gunpoint\nThese are some of the things that we talk about we think about where do you shoot him in killing is that really what you want to do to provide or I'm asking a legitimate question is that really what you wanted to ask Mr done\n... the individual knocked to the pavement in Clearwater I'll be back right after this think
