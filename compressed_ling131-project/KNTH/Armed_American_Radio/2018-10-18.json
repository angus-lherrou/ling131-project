tell me that the last time you know I guess that's probably a great point huh that's a good thought about that and it just kills me that you would be the one the thinking that well we had\nA couple of really fun shows in tombstone Arizona and I got to tell you we have brand new technology brand spanking new technology and I had some issues with it but that's how you get out there and you know the ... you want to you wanna get wet cough you got to jump to the pool man and one place to try it\nNo tombstone Arizona does not have\nThe Internet capabilities where I was I'm not tombstone ... you know they have Internet my gosh it on the other side of the globe or you know ... stone Arizona's Arizona for gosh they bought the Larry a motel\nOr didn't have the the Internet speed and ban with that we have in the studio of course nor should that but that's the technology that we were trying out their shot into\nBecause voice that is very small doesn't require a lot of bad with\nThe difficulty we had was not with the connection actually except for one time but it was with the piece of equipment itself that wouldn't allow the second microphone and so we have to really get to maneuver one microphone back and forth was how how did that have that come out OK Shawn now we're going to fix that but came out All right right\nIt was doable okay it was doable as he says it was doable [laughter] in customs might\nWell no I mean you know here's the thing most people don't know when I started working in radio I was a a a own\nLocation technical director so I Know very well or anything and everything that can happen I mean I've had sent trucks go completely down and have had to switch maneuver use cell phone signals\nThat for those of you who might not know it was like\nIf this were doing meteorologist tried to be cool and they call hurricane you know instead of just saying category for ice to hard to say category so they say cat for these that make them sound cool when in reality and make them sound like dogs that are trying to sound cool by saying cat instead of category so pro tip\nThey category no he said it sounded like no I Know that I'm going there hold on you just see you're jumping the shark on me\nSay that at the same [laughter] same sad this\n[laughter] jumping the struck [laughter] around ... isn't it [laughter] say instead is John's way of instead of saying satellite truck you said set trucks you just reminded me the ... war cat five goofy weather person you know I was a racial ethnic buffer the George ... the director\nA long day already brother and it's really not that later today but it was a lot of funding to them so now the the the actual quality I haven't gone back in and take it off but I appreciate you program directors and affiliates around the country bring with is why we attempted to do that remote you know there's an old saying for those in the kitchen and John I Know you'll notice\nYou know you don't cook a new recipe for a party of a hundred\nPeople that you've never tried before oh no right well that's pretty much what we did I I have the technology to take with me that wouldn't have been an issue and I you actually you know what we're going to go in with this let's go in with this and try it's why didn't bring what I knew work\nI liked that you know I'm that guy that stays up late and cramps or the test and still get a decent grade I liked the push I liked the edge I light not knowing what I'm going to say when that might those live until that might goes live\nSome of the best radios ever come out of my mouth has been under those conditions then is shot as you were saying that you know in radio when when that satellite truck goes down especially if it's during a category one storm\nIt always happens at the most inopportune like one second before the microbes live or it's down and you've got eight seven six five four and you know that's radio comes right down to that split second doesn't that shot\nOh yeah but I but I've actually had a much ahead to host a show first time I ever correct or my ...
