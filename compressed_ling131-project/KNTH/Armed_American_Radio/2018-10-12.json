I. T. V. news wow forced to resign\nFor posting I stand for the flag I Neal is across and for posting for donations to a man has been accused of murdering\nA suspect and happened to be black and the police officer has been a family for instance sky was three years old oh by the way the now resigned Democratic Party chair has a biracial child and says he is black from his family of course that doesn't matter does it\nNow back to a Mr holder Michele always asking them all over you know she and my wife like really tight um which will you scared me a rough [laughter]\nMichelle Williams says if you don't when they go low we know they go low we go [noise]\nThat was this new democratic already about well\nI don't think so I you know my rallies in very peaceful and even at the beginning when there seemed to be conflict they sent paid people and to disrupt our rallies and when you do that\nYou know bad things happen but they were the ones that started everything so no it wasn't us it was it was totally the other side by I Would ever rally and paid people were going into those rallies causing trouble\nAnd in many cases it didn't work out so well for those people may know Jetta pay people were in those rallies but when I hear oh they're making a statement like he made today I think it's a disgrace and ...\nI really understand she just says they can get it she never did she never will\nMeanwhile over an innocent be how Andrea Mitchell tried to slam Trump because Trump said that we can get a bird dress was controversial historian who's your panelists agreed with Trump\nStuck as presidents have war and extraordinary is compelling and bring it to life one quick question one quick fact check the president has been saying that OK by him Lincoln was criticized for the Gettysburg Address at his rallies in defending his own\nAbility to [noise] for history to prove that who will come out with the criticism wasn't going to\nSay it was criticized for the Gettysburg Address by newspapers that hated Lincoln and wanted to support his opponent of the next year when he ran for reelection not too unusual but there were huge numbers of newspapers who understood ... and even at that moment new Gettysburg Address would be a great documentary in American history\nSo Trump was right whether all fake fans there was no fake news\nHere's what Adam said about really factor\nI'm In the automotive business so I'm On my feet all day you know a lotta aches and pains in the knees and the back\nWhen I sleep at night I Would get okay sleep but it's like every time I Would toss and

information also known as the silent killer relief factor dot com relief sector dot com that's released factor dot com when we come back after yesterday assuming you voted against Trump\nArgue pleasantly surprised are bitterly disappointed after the last two years or give the results and we have a new question for tomorrow I Am Larry older [laughter]\nAm tends\nWhich sounds almost ... to ... do you buy values or maybe you know here's syndicated columnist do them\nDid you know that President Trump bears responsibility for Hurricane Florence yes that's what an editorial in the Washington Post says\nIt's true the leftist now certified like crazy the Post's editorial says it because the president doesn't believe in climate change nonsense\nHe is complicit in this hurricane the Post's doesn't explain why other storms that hit America and indeed other parts of the world are also his fault many of those storms occurred before Trump was born there was supposed to mean that Trump was complicit in those storms\nEven before he or his parents and other ancestors were conceived I'd like to hear the editorial board's position on that question\nSetting so called climate change aside for the moment it ought to embarrass all of journalism that it has identified itself with a hard left activists\nWho are trying to remove a duly elected president from office started with this fall's election every story almost every column every editorial is anti Trump his successes are ignored because the left wants Democrats running and ruining the country again it's shameful if there's much had any shame I'm Cal Thomas\nFor recovery of today's Missouri visit to almost felt more white Isabel used through media view of bugs thirty seven thirty three forty below Florida Wrigley zero three seven that view bugs thirty seven thirty three forty key Largo Florida three three zero read\nThem who's the date and subject you're about to begin to use the media hopes\nFor the gal Thomas

mix very able to show\nThe Larry Elder show weekday afternoon just five maybe before Jay Sekulow in age phone ATM Jim Seventy the answer\nLarry Elder weekday afternoon just five right after Michael mid voted to own a um ten Seventy the answer America\nWe have to say now here's Larry Elder no one rain ... [noise] from late\nNight seven one estimate GD I Want them to ratify it very hard to believe that the dot com studio up on Larry on the dot com I've got my we'd be article if Kavanaugh's part is then should we impeach Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and I talk about the\nHarsh comments that a majority is RPG made during the twenty sixteen campaign\nWhen she called Donald Trump with speaker said he had no consistency said that he had a big ego and that the media was letting them get away with not turning over his taxes and then she said I shouldn't have said those things [laughter] did that suggested she had the wrong judicial temperament to be on the bench\nAnd the numbers of people who've died in hurricane Michael's now to be at least seven\n[noise] yesterday I ask you the following question President Trump's presidency he's now almost two years old if you voted against President Trump or do you present personally surprised for or you bitterly disappointed Mr McConnell what percentage of people said that they were ... pleasantly surprised versus bitterly disappointed\nFifty seven percent\nActually closer to Seventy percent said that they were um pleasantly surprised only three percent so deeply disappointed about that now and antifa\nAnd I got to tell you this one special for a number of different reasons not just a regular trip but I take them out going on a vacation\nGoing to work but I'm going to speak to one of the greatest groups of people in the world and that's the Arizona citizens to fence league\nOn Saturday for their annual meeting a call to order at eleven forty out the door by for it's a short sweet and powerful meeting\nI'm looking forward to that that will be on Saturday can't wait to speak their now on Sunday I'm going to be bringing you of course the monster show from out west but we're going to do something a little different\nI may take some of it in advance I might tape all of it depending on\nThe amount of people that I'm able to bring together for the show these are people that I I have a very difficult time getting in a room altogether alone\nLet alone just on telephone to bring them into the show at the same time\nSo it it it's going to be so good I Can't even tell you who's going to be on the program yet\nBecause I just simply don't know but I did speak to the organizers of the event we've got a place to sit and talk to people as they come off the stage at the easy CDL meeting just as a a meeting with great important as we head into the midterms\nAnd into twenty twenty ... more about that over the weekends broadcast so I'm either going to bring you a full taping because I've got all these wonderful people veil to make an error Sunday or I'm going to do a combination\nOf both\nBut I Will have some amazing people sitting with me including Alan Gottlieb who will be sitting with me in Arizona and now this gets even funnier\nIf that could be if that could be the case because on Monday\nIf everything works out the way I expect it to now I Will actually be broadcasting from tombstone Arizona\nWith Alan Gottlieb and the founder\nInto stone\nOf making tombstone America's first second amendment city I'm going to leave it at that I'm teasing you something I'm not positive about yet but my goal is to bring you the show\nFrom that history rich city town of tombstone Arizona which I have done before in the past sitting on the heels of this week which has been a pretty fun history lesson\nThroughout the last four days of armed American radios daily defense and we're going to continue that again today I Hope you've enjoyed the program this week uh one fact I Know you have I've gotten more email than normal let me read just a couple of them as I pull some of these up live with you on the air\nOr this just came in today from fab she wrote earlier this week\nMark I wrote you a few times this week and this was because the shows have been so powerful I wanted to let you know I sent a message to my mother this morning then re posted by message on an end are a social media page and in doing so I invited all those on the page to join the radio waves and tune into your show hopeful your numbers increase off of it it was my message on my post\nI Hope you are listening to the armed American radio shows this week is understanding the threat of what really is of what reality is and how America is not only an idiot logical disagreement but past the threshold of one side for control and and he spent the other try to live at peace while playing by the rules listen to it\nBut like dealing with criminals when only one side plays by the rule book the others will always live in a state of defensive awareness or die blind and unprepared\nThe next on civil war slash American Revolution is stirring that's from Joshua Joshua thanks for the email well done I wrote I excuse me I read one of ... was emails earlier in the week that one\nJust popped in earlier this morning\nThis one came in from Ken Thompson mark you've really been bringing it this week I was wondering how you would follow up your analysis of Colin Powell\nI wasn't disappointed the Charles Sumner and Hillary discussion was fascinating to say the least then he goes on to tell me that earlier this year he read a book called Nineteen Seventy Nineteen Seventeen written by Arthur Herman\nThe book about two men president Wilson and Lenin\nHarm it is no pundit of any kind left or right he just gives you the quote unquote news as it was in history and so history tends to repeat itself\nThe book describes Wilson's progressive isn't where it came from and how it was implemented\nA real eye opener as far as letting goes it describes the tactics he employed which are chilling Lee and eerily resemble what we're seeing from the left\nOnce again today like some of the things that could happen in our Senate manipulation of the masses and the later bait and switch and gun Herman steam describes how these two men were in many ways very much alike in their goals for the world\nThe book reads well and I think you've personally be interested to available as an audio book take care sir here so the fresh start to a new year for you and your wife ten times and Ken thanks\nThe email I can promise you I Will read the book yeah we can take a lot of things back to Wilson ah of course the beginning of what we would call modern day progressive that's but that's a whole different subject on a whole different theories of radio programs no doubt but I appreciate it and I'm Glad that\nYou're enjoying the show but this one came to this one comes in from Mitchell Mitchell loose says yesterday I accidentally saw the um on poor and company interview with Hillary Clinton accidentally mic shows you accidentally stumbled on that [laughter]\nI Love it she lays out her agenda and she and bill will be starting a Thirteen week tour across America letting people know what is wrong with Trump's America\nShe just will not go away great email here's why the final on she just will not go away mutual you're right she won't go away and here's why in large part because the media doesn't want her to go way remember\nThat over eighty five percent of those writing about hosting the shows your viewing as such as cars John among poor and company production staff writers camera operators\nBoom Mike operators everyone behind the scenes directors et cetera voted for her think about what they if you were going to go into\nThis today we're going to continue this discussion today because ... and I I you know I I had planned on kind of trying to wrap it up but no no no representative ... tend to piece today an op ed what you got it over at Fox News I Want to go through it with you it will probably take the hour but it's a great exclamation point\nTo put on this week's program and I think it would it it's just funny how stuff gets handed to you let me put it that way and that's what I Love about doing daily radio in live radio we we can go wherever we want to go\nAnd we just never run out of time in the sense that we can do it all over again tomorrow when we wake up and that's where we find ourselves today\nBut you are absolutely correct she Josh will not go away\nAnd that's the reason why the Barry media who creates the news and drives the narrative doesn't want her to go anyway the incendiary comments that she made this week\nAbout being impossible to be civil to Republicans\nI Will tell you today how damaging they are along with others\nBecause guess what else happened yesterday on my way through school Eric Holder made comments that we have to bring up today\nIn the context of the follow up by Steve ... and of course holders literal call for violence and that's what he did I was playing it more\nAs we continue on in this radio program\nBut Michel your comment she just will not go away is key Eric Holder will not go away\nWho gives a flying satellite radio moment word about Eric Holder who\nOne Eric Holder is re injecting himself as we talked about Colin Powell earlier there's earlier this week in to the forefront\nHe's trying to make himself visible anybody wonder why this scrawny little character of a goofball goon leftist believes he's got a shot at becoming president\nHence why you're seeing from him while you're hearing from him\nAnd make no mistake about this it is not a coincidence that the leaders of the Democratic party\nAre encouraging this type of rhetoric these cost to violence against their political opponents oh but wait the I don't I don't remember oh I don't know I haven't heard Joe Biden come out and say attack anybody were ... they don't have to the mere fact that they're silent\nCondones with their colleagues are saying and make no mistake about this American gun owner armed American you they're talking about\nWe're going to have a great program today I'm going to buy a lot of things together for you as we always do but this is a fascinating topic it's a frightening topic and unfortunately it is high time if the disgust\nWhy because the left requires us to discuss it just like I don't want you walking around all day and conditioned white thinking it can't happen to me I don't want you walking around thinking they would never do that\nBy an individual who tried to wipe out an entire baseball diamond filled with Republicans\nIn large measure because of ... being perpetrated by Brock Obama's notes just calm leftovers Hillary Clinton's in the rest\nWe were informed by a letter writer just earlier won't go away by ... they will not go away and they won't for good reason so that the ... knows a little bit about this because of the rhetoric coming from the left he and dozens others\nWere the attempt ... were the were the target of an assassin political ... job by a leftist lunatic\nIn Virginia on the baseball diamond that day Steve sleeping with a little bit to say about that\nOh you know what maybe I should let me tell you quickly what Trump said I don't want to have to circle back\nLet me tell you a little bit about what Trump said about these disgusting comments from Eric Holder here's what Trump said take a listen to Fox and friends this morning let me play a clip where he was just Donald Trump earlier this morning on Fox and friends when he was asked about hold her statements here's what you had to say let's go\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's discussing safe and sound iMac bam to make a statement like that is a very dangerous taping\nAll right that Donald Trump telling you he'd better be careful what he's wishing for\nAnd that's great advice for all of these Democrats Maxine Waters\nAnd every single one of the top that are not decrying the statement and not think about this note top Democrat none of them not a Bernie Sanders he's an independent you get the best right not a Bernie Sanders no one\nNo Hillary Clinton no in fact she's making the statement I'm Sorry I forgot about that sorry about that slipped my mind I I Do apologize\nBill Clinton Brock Obama Michelle Obama silent\nDurban dialing polo Z please waters\nLeaves their silence they're complicit\nThey better be careful what they wish for\nPretty profound words from the president of the United states now see I I got myself a little bit longer than I wanted to hear but that's okay because I Am going to go to Steve ... when we come back and talk a little bit about this and why do that I Want you to go back and think because I'm going to remind you obviously\nAbout what we talked about earlier in the week\nAnd we're talking about Charles Sumner and the ... the painting of Charles them think about what we're getting ready to talk about when you hear me discuss these police words and keep it in the context of where we weren't Eighteen fifty six keep it in the context of the things we talked about together this week this is very important stuff\nI'm going to make some predictions for you before the show is over a lot of people are too Chicken Little to do that I'm not back after this don't go away\n\n[noise] with the sarin News I'm Rhonda ... over a million people in the southeast still without power after hurricane Michael tour through the Florida Panhandle before wreaking havoc
