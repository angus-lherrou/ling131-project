sure what that means maybe one day we'll find out\nAll right let's move on to some other things Hillary Clinton is a two time loser\n[laughter] the hop isn't it but it's true isn't it\nBill Clinton is a two time loser big capital L still can't get over the fact she's not president I bet she walks right can you imagine what goes on behind closed doors in her house how angry she must be\nWhy am I saying that yesterday's program was fascinating I I Know you enjoyed it because I got a number of emails\n\nBut we talked a little bit about yesterday some things from the Senate the cold civil war\nYou know these are fascinating topics to talk about it I find them utterly fascinating and then of course we're talking about may twenty second Eighteen fifty six the gaining of Senator Charles Sumner that most history professors probably don't teach anymore you gotta kinda ask if you want to learn about something like that\nIn except that that was from the U.S Senate page a little bit of history lesson the crime against Kansas of course what step that up and that was the the the talk or the one hundred and twelve pages long\nAddress by Charles Sumner when he rose to speak on may nineteenth Eighteen fifty six you directly there's higher at two individuals one relative of one of the individuals that he directed his fire at was a member of the house of representatives came into the Senate chamber and beat him nearly to death\nA cane in the U.S Senate rhetoric\nToday is so bad particularly coming from the left\nIt comes from everywhere if you get out on the Twitter and all these goofy social you know social forums that you can go on to any more you know today's day and age\nSocial media which is doing terrible damage by the way to the psyche of the country I Would recommend if you can live without that stuff if you don't have it for a business purpose just get away from it go live your life get off that stuff it's unnecessary Twitter is not life\nPorters wear a bunch of people with a lot of time on their hands go nothing again for business I have to have it for business it's it's a great forum for businessman reaching people in this type of stuff but if it's if you don't need it for business get get away from it\nYou don't need it you\nDon't need it\nBut you got your social forums are people are just so angry in these things getting back to the rhetoric being so bad\nLet me before I get into all this let me start with this every thing\nOf the research for this program today began and about quarter to two in the morning\nI have four teen different areas to go today that I'm going to kind of tie together I I Will tell you all fourteen of them out just for the sake of telling you how it came together today it began at quarter to two in the morning eastern time quarter to eleven at night Pacific time\nWhen I was awake that late by fall asleep on early so I slept kind of hard woke up early middle of the night and started reading some new study I you know start looking perusing with it and it just started falling into my lap\nToday's research as to why I was just uncanny store I began sending some of these things to myself further follow up later in the morning after I got some more sleep but started coming to me in the middle of the night as I was perusing stories on the news the news right we talked yesterday about what the news the\nNews sites that I went to when I go to a number of them\nWere talking about rhetoric and being so bad today Rand Paul is talking about he's afraid they're going to be an assassination\nAnd I can promise you Rand Paul is not worried about it conservative assassinating liberal or the other way around he's worried about the radical unhinged unglued laugh\nWho are taking their what do I I don't like to use the term but you know the dog whistle garbage because if not a dog whistle\nWouldn't Maxine Waters stands up and tells fellow Democrats and unhinged lunatics to hassle Republicans everywhere they find them including in front of their homes that's not a dog whistle you know anything about a dog whistle you can't\nHear it only dogs can hear it it's meant to be some type of silent clues to those who pick up on things put the radical in his left out\nThey don't worry about that they come right out and say at Maxine Waters comes to mind but the rhetoric is so bad Rand Paul is very concerned talk about that few minutes his wife sleeps with a loaded firearm\nAs well she should as well he should\n\nRhetoric yesterday from the Senate page itself the resulting beating galvanized the nation and haste and civil war\nThink about that the painting\nOf Senator Charles Sumner Eighteen fifty six may twenty second from the Senate own page the nation's suffering from the breakdown of reason discourse that this event symbolize humbled onward toward the catastrophe of civil war\nLet's focus on the breakdown of reason discourse that this event symbolized the event be the beating by Cain of Senator Charles Sumner by an unhinged Democrat\nThat's the events\nThat symbolized in Eighteen fifty six to break down of reason discourse\n\nMcCotter yesterday reminded us in no uncertain terms that history may very well look back and see Steve school leaf as our modern day Charles Sumner\n\nTo be exact he said if they do not meaning if the left cannot begin answering fourth lawlessness\nWhich is creating the political divide in this country and deepening are cold civil war he called it\nThey have better come up devise you said an answer soon and I quote now if they don't one day the story in school record that the violent left had turned Steve ... into our Charles Sumner well there's a difference here\nSteve Sebelius was not attacked by a fellow elected official was attacked by an unhinged leftist wacko trying to murder as many Republicans\nAt a ball field that he could\nBut the rhetoric heated rhetoric that we were talking about yesterday\n\nIs doing tremendous damage to the country and of course it is coming from the radical unhinged left I e Maxine Waters Maxine Waters is a nut case is a nut job he's got screws loose I don't know who votes for these people I don't\n... who walks into a what what normal intelligent honest individual walked into a voting booth and pull the lever for Maxine Waters\n\nI don't get it [laughter] I just hard for me to wrap my head around that quite frankly maybe it's not for you I don't know what we have to look at where she's from two right\nYou do falls out there and the Golden State Maxine Waters but the rhetoric coming from the left so what's the first thing I see a quarter to two in the morning\n\nHillary Clinton is the headline Democrat cannot be civil with Republicans anymore now I don't care what you think about Hillary Clinton you know what I think about who will require\nRegardless of all of that Bill Clinton ran for president twice [noise]\nA man who want to kill went to the ball field to kill as many Republican members of the house that he could\n\nHere's what Steve Scully set seriously Hillary in a tweet seriously Hillary\nAnd of course he linked to a CNN politics quote of hers you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nMitch McConnell yesterday took to the Senate floor\nAnd used Clinton's remarks to remind America and the Democrats in that chamber and anyone else who cares to watch and lifting\nWhat Hillary Clinton said here's what he said on the floor of the Senate she told CNN exactly how she views millions of Americans who whole different political views than her own\nNo peace until they get their way more of these are hinged tactics apparently these are the less rallying cry\nYou already knew that\nWe have been talking about the danger the threat of the radical left\nOn this program since the daily defenses inception and on the monster cast for ten years now in ten years we have discussed this type of behavior from an idiot allergy that hates our right to bear arms we've seen this as gun owners for years\nApparently this is new to people like McConnell when a gun owner like you or I here's Hillary Clinton call was deplorable we know exactly what she means\nWe know she hates us when we hear Brock Obama say we cling to our guns in our Bible we know exactly what he me\n\nMeanwhile for a large part of America these comments or brushed off\n\nBut I Want to take you back to the Senate dot Gov Web site again in its history minute pages the painting of Senator Charles Sumner\n\nThe nation suffering from the breakdown of reason discourse that this event symbolize tumbled onward toward the catastrophe of civil war\n\nThe resulting Beatty galvanized the nation and Haitian civil war I don't know how to make it any clearer to you just how dangerous this rhetoric is back after this [noise]\n[noise] that's where a news off half the fall of the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's panhandle
