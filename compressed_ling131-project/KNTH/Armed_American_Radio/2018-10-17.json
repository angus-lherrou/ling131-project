I'll get a little bit a little bit controversial here just a minute on that for a couple of good reasons I Want to give you some things that I noticed when I'm here in the beautiful state of Arizona which I Believe is the most beautiful places and an American was beautiful place on earth\nNot to discount everywhere else but I happen to be drawn here for whatever reason colleges bizarre as it is the fact of the matter is Arizona wins the most gun friendly state every year because of its legislative its legislative victories over the years that have given Arizona constitutional curious what you look coined the term constitutional Cary what does that mean\nYou come to Arizona you don't need a permit to carry a gun you are law abiding American you come to Arizona you carry a gun you don't need anybody's permission you don't need to have a reciprocal permit you can carry your firearm in Arizona period that in and of itself makes Arizona in my book\nProbably the number one most gun friendly state in the nation so only makes sense that we get out here and of course would let let me segue into the second reason that I'm Out I'm a member of Arizona citizens defense league every year their annual meetings held at this time\nAnd it happens to coincide pretty closely with the anniversary of the gunfight at the OK Corral and I try to get too soon as often as possible this provides an opportunity to do that and it also gives me the opportunity to bring the broadcast from just a fascinating place let's go to the easy CDL meeting this year Arizona systems defensively\nI Believe that there are this is not to discount any other group all grassroots organizations around the country are incredible Kevin in Oregon with Oregon firearms federation and all the rifle and pistol clubs across the country\nVirginia citizens defensively Georgia carry a four to carry up and coming now and many many others but I Believe that Arizona citizens defensively ac CDL has done incredible work\nIn this country and has probably been the most effective\nThe most effective grassroots organization in the country today and that's important for a number of reasons because again Arizona is the most gun friendly state in the country how to get that way it got that way from a lot of assistance from activist around the country many of whom most of whom\nAre part of a Z CDL and that makes a huge difference in the grassroots organizations when you get out here and you see the size\nOf the group I Can't stress that enough to stand at that podium for the fourth time\nAnd look out at that organization of which I'm a proud life member of in the hundreds of people in attendance at the meeting why\nWhy are there are hundreds of people and attendance when\nGosh why are we putting so much time and effort into a state that already is widely recognized by gun owners around the nation\nAnd various publications and organizations as the most gun friendly state in the country why do we need to put so much time and that's a legitimate question\nAlso begs a response and the response is how do you think they stay that way\nAnd that brings me to number three why we're here because the enemies of our freedom have a target placed right back over the beautiful state of Arizona\nBecause A. Z. CDL has been so effective and because Arizona is the most gun friendly state in the nation I Want you to think about that for a minute you see how these things all tied together\nSo being able to come out here and speak taking the opportunity to relishing the history of this of this place my history buff and me brings me here and draws me to to him so not a regular basis\nTies everything together I'm able to do that and it just the timing of the the the timing of the events works now here in tombstone we are literally order we hear a ten days away we're ten days away from the anniversary of the battle the battle the gunfight at the OK Caracas if you were in it it was a battle\nBut the gunfight at the OK Corral Eldorado week begins in about five or six days runs out for a couple of weeks Val Kilmer is going to be here of course he played that fantastic part of ... in the movie tombstone back from Nineteen Ninety five is was Nineteen Ninety three or Nineteen Ninety four\nSo all of this stuff ties together so we're able to bring you some great programming from this beautiful place and every single bit of it getting more and more important every year in particular now as we come up on the midterms and subsequently twenty twenty\nWhy who are those enemies of our freedom that have a target on Arizona's\nBack well a former mayor of New York city by the name of Michael Bloomberg might come to mind here is why when you\nCan't move something legislatively because your agenda is so\nUnpopular yet you will not back down and you have the money to move it forward and your name is Michael Bloomberg\nYou're going to subvert or circumvent the system in place by that I mean Congress isn't willing to pass any new strict federal gun regulation at this point in time there's no appetite for it [noise] [noise] this is Michael Bloomberg care Michael Bloomberg now he doesn't care who didn't give a crap is going to circumvent Congress how do you circumvent Congress when\nIt comes to gun control us is what we've been fighting on armed American radio for years in the fight will never end it will\nGo on and it will go on and it will go on\nThese people are relentless and they will never stop what they're doing is using the ballot initiative that's why we've been talking about Washington sixteen thirty nine instituting twenty new gun controls on the ballot initiative there are twenty states in the country Twenty one states in the country that have ballot initiatives\nOn their books that allows the people through\nGathering of signatures to place something on a ballot during any election for a vote the fat intern circumvent the state legislature Michael Bloomberg has this down to a science he is spending tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars across the country\nTo circumvent federal legislation that we knew that he knows will never happen Congress\nTo Institute local gun control at the local level state level and this particular case by using ballot initiatives to do so Washington is involved in a very bitter fight right now with initiative sixteen thirty nine Alan Gottlieb of course we'll be hearing just a few minutes we'll tell us a little bit more about that\nArizona is a ballot initiative state Arizona\nIs widely regarded as the single most pro gun state in the country this would be the holy grail for Michael Bloomberg we have a problem here as you heard yesterday if you were listening to the show and particularly if you are listening to the show on Sundays monster broadcast there is a possibility\nA very real possibility an honest like when I tell you this I never thought it would have to tell you this but there was a very real possibility that Arizona could turn blue you heard Allen Corwin talking about Arizona changing\nCalifornians bringing California liberal left his values to the state as they flee the taxation and the liberalism that they want to\nTry to instill in the state of Arizona I Know it doesn't make any sense let me get out of here because I don't like it and let me take everything I don't like with me you see how the\nDisease liberal mind works more about that in subsequent programming but for now Michael Bloomberg is working behind the scenes on Washington he knows that if he can get Washington\nHe can then use those same techniques and tactics to move because Washington's a fairly blue state\nActually now that would be an argument those of you listening on our four stations are for affiliates in Washington would take issue with that and I agree with your your right ... ... ... ... unfortunately the politics in your state or blue while there's a large portion of the state that is bright red the politics are being dominated by blue right now and that's just the fact that something that we're going to have to change for the future but\nMichael Bloomberg nose at the demographics in Arizona are such that there is a possibility that Arizona could begin to see some blue ... and if that's the case\nThen they know that they can use the tactics on sixteen thirty nine in Washington Here in the beautiful state of Arizona\nThat's why we're here bringing attention to this as we come up to the midterms why it's important to defeat sixteen thirty nine and Washington and it's going to be difficult as we fight billionaire money left wing billionaire money in Washington is fueling the fire Michael Bloomberg is stoking and breathing onto it with additional millions hundreds of millions of dollars\nWe have a fight on our hands it isn't going to go away anytime soon\n[noise] Arizona citizens defensively has taken legislative preemptive action to send that off\nBut it won't be possible to fend off all of it it's all going to eventually come down to the voter so that's part of the reason we're here we have an opportunity to speak we have an opportunity to come up to this beautiful place give you some history\nHere in tombstone Arizona have some fun doing it while highlighting the importance of what the hell is actually going on behind the scenes as the two thousand Eighteen midterms ramp up in addition to the two thousand Eighteen midterm even more importantly believe it or not\nThe twenty twenty presidential elections\nWhich as we all know are beginning to heat up as well\nPocahontas out what their goofy DNA tests and everything else so it's going to be a fascinating two years but we've got to get through these midterms and we've got to get through these midterms with victories alright I'm here in tombstone Arizona I'll be back with our guest I still have some other things I Want to talk with your first stick around don't go away live from tombstone back after this\n[noise] she wants new gun controls on anything she can get her paws on\nAnd Missourians you must show up at the polls this is the kind of stuff that we fight against every single day and here's what makes it so difficult when you've got billionaire money you've got organizations like moms demand action at every town for gun safety these groups thrive on their ... they're good at it\nThey hide it they work at it they are professionals at it and like criminals it's hard for most law abiding citizens to realize that criminals do commit crimes for a job that's what they do\nThese people work at the seat for a job\nThey spend their days figuring out how to deceive you\nAnd how to take things from you Claire McCaskill is one of them very very very very very disturbing and very disgusting to say the least let me shoot over to Florida for just about a minute that we have left Lakeland, Florida to be exact commissioner city commissioner Michael Dunn\nConfronted and a parent criminal and alleged criminal\nChristophe Lopez at the vets army and navy surplus store back on October third after done suspected him of shoplifting and I bear apparently he was trying to take a hatchet of some store there is video out now released by the lake when pd\nShowing Don restraining him attempting to restrain him pull him back into the store while holding a firearm on him it is\nObvious to anybody that he's carrying something in his right hand you can see if he's holding up the door the criminal is but the owner done the lake on city commissioner is attempting to grab and pull him back into the store apparently trying to keep him from fleeing while holding a firearm on him\nA shot two shots are fired when the individual resistant pools and tries to get back out the door we are going to be CEO seeing a lot more about this case for it if you ever want to find anything crazy can always look in Florida but\nThis is going to be another stand your ground type deal you've got a criminal trying to get out the door and individual holding a firearm on him\nA very reminiscent kind of what we've seen in other cases in the state of Florida over the past few years I'm not defending myself I Am defend we got the movie theater case\nSomeone says he's defending himself the other person says he's not a this is going to be an interesting case to watch it is after what I've seen so far I Am absolutely utterly shocked at this point\nThat there is not been a charge filed against the city commissioner I Believe there probably will be here's what you've got you've got somebody committing a crime he's fleeing he's running out the door the individual with a gun is trying to pull him back in when the two shots are fired\nI'm not feeling too good about this is all caught on video I'm surprised by seeing this\nThat the individual done in the city commissioner in the store who fired the two shots I'm surprised at the stage that he has not been charged I anticipate\nThat he probably will be we will be talking about that and more of the reason I wanted to mention that to you before we go to our guest along with all the McCaskill stories you are probably seen this on national news and you undoubtedly we'll be seeing more of it\nIn the coming days we will be talking about it of course we'll get what they W.
