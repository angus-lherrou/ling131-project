because you need to know this Alan Gottlieb is the single most influential and powerful man alive today in\nThe gun rights movement that's a bold statement to make it's also very very true if you've listened to him yesterday whenever you hear Alan talk you have to dig a little deep and pick up on some of what he said because sometimes it just goes right past you like when he said yesterday on the broadcast in our one\nWhy I talk to the White House about okay he talks to the White House\nAbout the Supreme Court that the White House use use him for counsel on Supreme Court picks thinking about what you heard him say yesterday since we were talking to here\nThey seek his guiding when it comes to selection of a potential justice\nAnd went out and got leap tells you that he's content with the other names on the list you can believe that I mean you can absolutely take that to the bank um time when he's confident I'm confident I Want you to know that\nBecause I Know you turn to this program and to me to hear some of these things and I want you to know that when I hear him say that I'm confident and if I'm confident I Want you to be confident very very important\nYou know the enemies of our freedom are not going away anytime soon\nI've got to pull this up for you this just absolutely drove me crazy I Believe this was on Drudge Report\nIn fact I Know it was I'm going to pose up for you right now Colin Powell rich Trump on immigration NATO anti press rhetoric the world can't believe what's happening he was on CNN with that goof off for ... the car\nAnd his other panelists was Madeleine Albright what what does that tell you right there\nCan you take this guy serious at this stage of the game I don't think so you heard what Colin Powell said during the twenty sixteen election\nYeah he was all took a shirt because George Bush and the bushes were being hammered and and Jeb Bush was being hammered and I don't think Colin Powell like that very much too bad for Colin Powell Colin Powell puts himself out as a Republican what Colin Powell is\nIs in a tablet Schmidt guy he is a flat out moderate establishment guy can flip either way with the wind blows he's just this political animal of a bygone era let me let me give you some exact details as to what I'm Talking about here\nVery important I you know ... when you read these things you got to understand that stuff\nExample power Republican was maintained a low profile during the Trump Administration called out\nQuote what we are not doing as the United states of America First of all I don't recall anybody asking him but\nHe said what are we doing we're walking away from agreements were walking away from alliances why would correct\nColin Powell we're not walking away from agreements were walking away from bad agreements or as Trump would say bad deals were not walking away from them we are fixing them\nNumber one number two he says we're walking away from alliances were not walking away from alliances we are reshaping our alliance as we are fixing our alliances in large part we're\nFixing alliances that's understandable why he's upset because he put together some of these alliances years ago he's watching them unravel because they were bad deal\nTwenty Thirty years down the road this stuff becomes obvious things need to be changed Colin Powell doesn't like that his name is on some of these things so it's understandable why he took gets hurt\nMadeleine Albright same thing going back to the Clintons these people put together a lousy crappy deal that have been costing America hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars over the years\nWe've been screwed because of some of these deals that looks given the benefit of the doubt maybe it was a good deal at that time let's just leave it at that maybe it was a good deal at that time was I ran a good deal no I mean I don't I'm not sure what\nPowell was talking about a year but we all know what Trump is doing we're walking away from agreement what does this have to do with guns this have everything to do with guns this guy puts himself out as a Republican he's an establishment\nThe guy he's an establishment guy that would come back to your guns in fact well okay I I really don't have a whole lot of time to go into that but let's do it right now Colin Powell well let's talk about Colin Powell in two thousand Thirteen on meet the press shortly after Sandy Hook Colin Powell was asked by you know that\nOn meet the ... yeah exactly this is the bastion of objectivity Colin Powell was asked get this I Love these left leaning questions right just how they hit you from what what kind of further restrictions\nWash must we put you see your show obviously the basis is we have to have further restrictions what kinds should we have that was the premise that was the basic question he was asked what further restrictions do we need to have put in place\nColin Powell did his typical hey I'm a I'm a Second Amendment guy\nI support the second amendment I'm I'm well studied on the second amendment he said he understands a well\nRegulated militia and he's a gun guy himself every but we should be able to have done\nBut he said he saw no reason for an American citizen to own a Bush mash to remember it was a Bush master a are Fifteen that the lunatic who murdered his mother and went into the school used to murder those twenty plus kids and teachers\nColin Powell saw no problem with registration and why can't we register\nYou saw no problem with testing for both commercials sales and private sales he has no problem restricting you are right you can go watch that video on YouTube I'm not going to pull it up and play it I did go through it when I was doing some research with the show earlier this morning and it's Colin Powell views on gun control go pulled up Google it up\nYou'll see him on meet the press telling you everything you need to know about Colin Powell that's why this has everything to do with guns remember Colin Powell is irrelevant\nNow why are we even talking about him he's irrelevant yet we're talking about him today because the left dug him up\nAnd we have to we will not let these statements go unchallenged we can't other shows do other shows blow right past the stuff I tied their stuff together for you why because it's on the head of trying to come right up back in the center column and the Drudge Report today\nWe have to talk about it and talk about it we will we are going to go back through some more of a show remember it all started with we're walking away from agreements no we're not we're fixing agreement as Trump would say we're fixing deal we're making new deal because deals you made suck\nThat's why that's what we're doing well of course he doesn't like that we're walking away from alliance has no or not the alliances you make sock\nFixing those alliances\nIt's understandable why he wouldn't want to do that\nHe was asked by a car you do you think this president can be a moral leader for the world and LBJ said I don't know that he can do that because right now that is not the way he's acting recently it has become me the president as opposed to we the people\nThis is Colin Powell lecturing us today\nOn Donald Trump\nAnd here's what power said we're going to talk about this for a while I'm going to go into this little bit longer than I anticipated because it's way too fun and because it has everything to do with your gun this is the problem with this part of the establishment in Washington\nAnd plus it's just fun to talk about on a Monday\nHow can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of uh of American he said he asked hasn't he read the first amendment you're not supposed to like everything the press says or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech\nI Hope the president can come to the realization that you should really stop insulting people power that\nI use this two years ago when I said I could not vote for him in the twenty sixteen election why that is just weren't going to break down in the next segment\nHe insulted everybody he insulted African American insulted women he insulted immigrants he insulted our best friends around the world all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debate I don't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United states\nBut I don't see anything that's changed in the last two years\nAlbright added that Trump's rhetoric about America being a victim as so not true the world is watching Powell said they cannot believe we're doing things like separating mothers\nAnd children who are trying to get across the border from South of our border they can't believe we're making such an effort to seize immigration coming into the country it's once kept\nTrump is acting to fix all of the things that everybody beforehand that tried to be the moral leader of the world screwed up\nThat's what Trump is fixing today America\nFirst because Powell and his\nCronies is un global lovers who screwed everything up and shipped millions of jobs over this is what Trump is fixing\nThat's why he's acting the way he's acting to use ... terms\nRecently it became me the president as opposed to we the people that's not true we the people are the American people not we the people of the global world of earth\nWe the people Powell mean us America\n\nAnd ... cents and you see things that should not be happening how can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of American because the media is the enemy of Americans call and you don't like to hear that\nI've been the you know I Wonder if Trump got that for me\nYeah right bald bald question huh I've been calling the ... the ... the the the greatest threat to Americans for years on armed American radio and it's great to see Trump rip them apart because they are a threat\nHe's metaphorically speaking how not an enemy on a battlefield but a battlefield of ideas metaphorically speaking to understand that\nBecause they are the enemy of half of this country probably more than half\n\nBecause of their left wing propaganda their gun grabbing gun hating for example for the purposes of this show I can immediately point to that as an example\n\nFor their propagandize again weaponize ...\n\nWhatever topic it is that they choose to use against us whether it's Christianity whether it's gotten right I could go on and on but again for the purpose of this program is armed American radio would it be difficult for me to point out you\nHow much the press you want me to go I don't have enough time in a year to go over the anti gun stores I've been covering them with you for years\n\nAnd that's why he's doing it Colin Powell hasn't he read the first amendment you are not supposed to like everything depressed as or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech it works both ways\nOn last year that establishment guy good habits\nWere going to have oh I'm going to just go oh I'm going to keep going through this
