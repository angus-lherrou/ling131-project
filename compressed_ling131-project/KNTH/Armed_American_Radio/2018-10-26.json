their goal so that leads me to believe that well gosh that's an agenda driven plan is it not being go it has to be there is no other explanation for it right\n[noise] absolutely and we as gun owners have been suffering as for years because you were there were they were all given some kind of tacit license to have an incredibly slanted incredibly biased stories about guns that could be chock full
