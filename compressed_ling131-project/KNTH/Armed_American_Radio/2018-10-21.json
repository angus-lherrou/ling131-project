insanity was doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result well this is the quintessential example and his saying right here\nYeah but I could see some you know building joins use business leaders Kennedy I could see someone putting out a video\nWhere it says wait you're against prop say well you must not hear about this city why if you were against Rob me you don't care about streets and flooding and try to own the narrative that way right because if you're in Ghana that's something that's and that's why not\nAnd that's ... that's exactly what they're doing because you know this program ah you know uh all of these ad campaigns that you're seeing on TV and property in probably ... finance by the special interest that you know for which city hall\nIs run for their benefit and so they end up paying up whenever the mayor wants to go out and do an ad campaign then he will go out and ask all the people they are doing business with the city to contribute and he goes to spend some money\nTo get on TV and you know the rest of us have to rely on you know social media and reintegrate programs like yours and going out to the community but I think I think the ... up I think people are beginning to\nUnderstand what this program is all about how to them to um community means I'm going to him and overwhelmingly opposed to it so I'm hoping it's going to work out\nHow there's somebody you know here's the here's a moral outrage\nAnd to me Sam [noise] you know show we collected a hundred million dollars a drainage fees since two thousand twelve when the sun implemented the city's own records show that only about three hundred and thirty million dollars of that was spent on drainage\nHere's the question I think every Houston or ask themselves how many\nHouses would not have flooded\nIn Harvey had we actually spent that half billion dollars that was collected on drainage on flood control instead of hiking by coordinators and three eighty agreements reimbursing developers and all the other nonsense\nThey spend it on how many families in Houston would not have flooded if we had ... spent that money the way they voted for promise typically ... it's an outbreak\nIt is um\nWhat are you going to do the mayor Turner's is very weak guy he's a he's not a confrontation any way shape or form which\nWill be playing 'cause you you're not going to want to sit and talk about look he's got his former press secretary now with new charges like what's her name during war they saw down into the woman who's running business out of the city hall and he was okay with it you just well I'll just spend or pretend that he's got a huge number of scandals what's your\nAnd if he he's gonna for not he's not gonna want a debate you but what's the plan\nWell look we're going to continue to take the message out a pub in court and I are going to do some um uh some robocalls on this next week we can [noise] um and look for is going to try to do the grass roots are trying to get the word out [noise] um you know look we've got to the problem with for\nA long time those of us that are more conservative on the physical side have tried to tie the city hands with property tax caption spending caps and all sorts of things and\nAnd this long box which was some you know supposed to keep this money isolated and the problem is that you know unless you're ready to go down there and shoot somebody every day at the city which you know normal people\nDon't have the time or money to do then they just ignore them saying at some point in time we got to talk about leadership [noise] you know how about electing somebody who actually felt like there was a moral imperative to spend drainage found drainage ... you know how crazy is that you know [noise]\nYup let me know that works out because it's been an absolute disaster or keep up the good fight are good for bilking a former mayor your all Kennedy and a business leader former mayor of other wonderful job of chemo\nSlugging it out buddy let me know even when the mayor should ever go okay let's talk about it I Want to be I wouldn't be there from\nRoad trashing the last thing they want to do this debate me on this\nIdea right I Know you're the numbers guy bilking former mayoral candidate in the last election [noise]\nWhat a disaster city all the scandals scandals good luck finding new people\nIn the little starving newsroom TV news to cover this kind of stuff is up or maybe one or two people\nLike Sam Salem Radio Houston morning show host Sam alone politicians in the media are obsessed with the topic of immigration and it certainly has to be in the top five of topics discussed by Americans in their personal relationships their living rooms their workplaces and even their churches and synagogues\nDemocrats socialists are in favor of a Lucy goosey approach to enforcement some even argue in favor of open borders and giving illegals the right to vote\nNone of us on the right that all seems just nuts\nBut how do you argue against it but how do you argue against it\nWell there's a book and joining us to talk about the politically incorrect to guide immigration than America First manifesto is coauthor John ... Iraq so welcome were so happy to have you on with us to talk about this subject because I'm sure a whole lot of people wonder how do you deal with the\nQuestions and answers you run into in a discussion about immigration strong feelings about the topic so tell us a little bit about the book first\nIt's the politically incorrect guide immigration I think a lot of your listeners know about that theory\nI think they also understand the pressure's there are to be politically correct these days so sometimes challenged just to go there\nOh yeah they're trying to remove immigration from from the list of issues are allowed to discuss\nThat they're trying to say that you have any anyone that the killing right to enter any country in the world and go with the public assistance in that country and vote that the lecture and the little girl's family there\nUm that that somehow human right and if you deny that you know you're guilty of racism and Vina phobia and you know your your monster commit hate crime\nWhich is interesting because as you know racial until very recently Harry Reid Bill Clinton\nAnd Barbara Jordan and Dianne Feinstein we're all very strong very strong on the difference between a legal and illegal immigration but the Democrats have been rushing to laugh like lemmings going off a cliff on this issue they want to abolish\nIce so that was no way of identifying and removing members of vicious gangs like endless Thirteen\nNo way of print protecting you know young children from Central America from being made in the slave labors are being caught up in the sex trafficking in history no way to protect our country at all just because the radical left activists have captured\nThe imagination and and and the conscience of Americans left we need to make\nThe upcoming elections ... on a policy guy a referendum on opening the borders we need to make it clear\nDemocrats are the party and that's their team [laughter] they at a party that would enable gangs like that\nTo flood into America and take over our city one by one and that's already happening\nIn the absence of a border wall the southern border the U.S is the sovereign territory of drug cartels they are the ones who control who comes into the country and who\nThey charged five thousand dollars that had smuggle people in eighty percent of women and girls who at the country illegally that way a rape eighty percent according to the having post\nUm southern border is covered what they call ... trees those are trees with the torn close the women too but it's actually exploited by these gangs\nIs looming don't take control of that that's our our were guilty of that that's on moral responsibility stop those kind of crimes from happening on our soil but the sheer number of people\nWho want to come to America and take their chances on getting a job or getting on Medicaid and getting on food stamps that kitten being anchor babies\nThey're just too many people that want to come in we can't control it without a wall a hundred and forty seven million adults\nAccording to the Gallup poll wanting to enter the U.S that doesn't include the number of kids they bring the magic hundred our our population going up by ... percent and it's just a few years\nAll our our social programs collapse\nThe minimum wage disappearing dropping to a dollar an hour\nThat the kids you're hoping for their mother John's America there\nAnd that's it for this edition of impact used them under the pressure\nJoined us again next week for being used in that if you have any questions about today's program or suggestions please email us ... impacts used in Salem Radio used in dot com [noise]\nAre your credit cards maxed out do you owe more than ten thousand dollars are juggling your bills only making minimum payments credit card companies are playing a dirty trick on you they want you to think you must pay it all back and that's simply not drew credit card companies hated when we expose their secrets in fact\nThere are ways you can become debt free and you don't have to pay the entire amount you owe national debt relief offers programs that help you escape overwhelming credit card debt national debt relievers help tens of thousands of people just like you reduce more than one billion dollars of debt\nThat make up the Arizona symptoms of ...\nIn Phoenix it's well I've spoken to Tucson at their meeting in Tucson a couple three years ago and in Phoenix a couple of times I've I've ... I've lost track but regardless this is an organization that is at the head of the fight there at the front\nOf the fight for the right to keep and bear arms and it's an honor to be asked to go out there and do so last year I could not because of my wife's condition I was not traveling for that for a year\nSo that we could do if this breast cancer think past us which we have successfully done thank God and that enabled me to get out there this year so lots going on it what was it was a real emotional week for a lot of different reasons\nNot the least of which of course because my wife has completed all of her treatment as of a two days ago of yesterday actually when her chemo port was taken out\nBut because it coincided with the Arizona citizens defense league that I couldn't go to the year before I could now and it just made more of a great week a great way to wrap up what's been a difficult year which is fine fine by people when I was honored to be able to do that\nSo thanks to you Arizona citizens defense week if you want information on easy CDL and I would highly recommend you get on their mail is to read what it is they're up to because not only are they fighting for Arizona they're also fighting for you regardless of where you happen to live they are literally\nLiterally walking point for you as Bloomberg is let's just say Bloomberg\nIt's hard to say his name and he really is if Bloomberg is dumping a ton of money into trying to derail\nThe right to bear arms in Arizona which in large measure means the railing Arizona citizens defensively and there are many many years of effort but people say well Arizona it's always been gun friendly but that that might be might be true but if that's the case\nWhy is it Arizona citizens defense league is necessary in the first place how many more rights do we need restored\nQuite a few let me give you one indication of what I noticed in Arizona but I don't argue the fact that Arizona is the most gun friendly state in the country for a lot of reason however depending on what's more important to you may be places off limits is more important to you than constitutional carry\nAnd I could easily easily make that case\nI don't care if I can carry it without a permit some people would say I have a permit I don't really care I'd rather be able to carry in more places so you know it sticks to one half\nDozen the other what's good for the goose might not be good for the gander so I've heard all of these arguments some people don't mind getting a permit some people wish they didn't have to get a permit but well that's just life some people put up with that okay everybody has different ideas different thought I Would argue\nThat well Arizona I Love constitutional carry and I do Arizona's got the freedom you look you come to Arizona you're a law abiding individual you don't need to ask permission and that's the way it should be nationwide should be that went off to the states\nEventually we will get their don't believe the media we are in fact winning this battle that's why Bloomberg is requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to try to fight who off and he's going to fail freedom freedom isn't for sale\n\nBut well constitutional Kerry is great and it is and it should be that way I just set it off if you said I Want to be able to carry wherever I have a right to be that includes a restaurant that includes wherever I happen to go\nI saw more no guns signs in tombstone as I mentioned earlier this week\nIn a day that I have in Georgia in a year because they just are for the most part non existent in the state of Georgia went to carry a gun into whatever ... you go to Georgians and business people understand that and recognize that\nArizona and for whatever reason feel the need to put up with China and they're all over the place you walk to you I was walking through old town Scottsdale you'll see tons of no guns will outside in Scottsdale a you know it's not just got stuff that's just where I happen to be but you see those in a lot of different places\nSo how do you know whether you can take your gun with you when you get out of the car to where it is you're going unless you call in advance\nMaybe you have to call and I don't want to have to do that\nI Want to know why I Want to know when I get out of my car or get off wherever it is that I'm however form of transportation I'm faking it where I go my gut is legal legal\nI don't have to worry about violating the law or somebody's policy and worried about getting thrown out so\nThose are just some of some of the arguments that we hear across the board some to some people that my to me that's very important I'll tell you that right now that's very important I Want to know I carry my gun everywhere I go\nSo Arizona What a wonderful time I had a blast I Can't wait to go back that's going to be in June if not sooner\nLook I'm going to see a lot of you Arizona over the course of the next year let me give you a quick rundown probably be out there again in February just because that's what I like to go I Know I'll be out there again in June\nFor the freedom day's festivities into stone I'll have a lot more information about that coming up over the course of the next few months but I Will definitely be there will be in tombstone in which means also be in Phoenix\nAnd the gun rights policy conference coming up in twenty Nineteen is in Phoenix at the same hotel the easy CDL was that at the Sheraton crescent in Phoenix so lots of Arizona coming up I Love this I I I'm looking forward to swear off months because I Love Arizona so\nI'm Glad you were out there as I toured around a little bit and I got a lot of that a lot of work done and an accomplished a lot of things so that's a got back on Wednesday\nFrom that and boy we've had a lot to report since we've been back we've been telling you about some of the efforts of the Democrats to ... falls in California's ... district and so forth and I have got some e mail to read\nSo why don't I take the opportunity now to do that\nOne of them was from a resident of the twenty fifth district in California we're talking about that liberal Ms Hill who wants to California gun control or you America\nBecause why because while I'm running for Congress in California's twenty fifth district and the whole country\nOught to take my craft and let me shove it right down their throat that's the way they think here to take a listen to this email\nAll right mark is that it's titled Katie Hill Tenn Seventeen show in his room at the un

describe a nonexistent creatures Sunday a non existent creatures like sasquatch or a Jeb Bush supporter is nonexistent the person who has seen first man actually seen it and believes that it is anti American ...\nYeah absolutely I mean look this is a uh there there is a controversy that has been picked up a about first man and it is largely the fault of the star we have to we're ... to do with your uh you know at a press conference at the Venice film festival Ryan Gosling\nThat something really do is that he's got a dumb thing we can all agree that this was a dumb thing he said that uh Neil Armstrong thought of himself not as an American hero but as a war hero now ... what kind of couching it in in his own experience at the Canadian Canadians of course don't have any heroes\nSo they have to appropriate the world's\nHero I thought I understand I understand what he was doing and look it was it was a mistake\nAnd instead of putting out the fire the the the director he didn't doubled down exactly but you said at truth day which is that a within the context of the story of the actual planting a flag I mean again what we're talking about here is the planting of the fight the spring of the pole\nIn the moon rock they do not show that that and that can slip of the moon Germany okay\nUm but within the context of the film it makes perfect sense why they wouldn't do that uh when they get to the moon\nThe film switches to kind of a more subjective experience that kind of put you in the head of Ryan Gosling uh Neil Armstrong and\nAnd it is it is designed that way and it works I mean look you see you see the flag on the moon everyone is talking about how the flag and then a race from this movie insane new uh everyone everyone who talks about how this movie downplayed the American achievement or or suggest that it's not about the face rate is insane\nEveryone who talked about how this is not\nA an event that had fired the rest of the world to follow American achievement in American greatness\nIs is just wrong I mean there's ... after the moon landing takes place there's literally a montage of people talking about how great America is there's a French woman says the French we could never do it but America can do it I only believe in them\nBut I mean it's like it is ... ... anyone who actually he is the movie I don't know anyone who actually goes to see it in and out of just relying on the angry uh\nI mean and I get it I totally get it because Hollywood is a snake puts a snake ... filled with America hating Dennis ... I Know it's so it's an easy target business a lot so I just I'm I feel I feel cleansed and\nIt was great and also by the way all this crap aside it is a magnificent films ... does an unbelievable job putting you inside the sole inside the helmet inside the spacecraft is a remarkable movie\nYeah I I I thought it was quite good I mean look and there are reasons to criticize the film I read a plenty of negative reviews that that had in a intelligent accurate things to say about the film but if you the reason you're avoiding the movie because you think uh that it eighth America\nBut you are you're doing it wrong as hard as we as we can say\nI Know we've got at least one or two new ones but give me thirty seconds is star is born as good as thirty people I Know say it is\nI mean look at its height melodrama it is a it is you know we've seen the story before so it's not like there's going to be anything particularly new or interesting a Lady Gaga is fine uh in kind of her first big breakout role a for as as an actor I'm Bradley Cooper is great\nI think Bradley Cooper is the best the best thing about\nThe movie ... it's fine if I if not really my cup of tea but it turned out to be well made and it is a the the songs are you know they're good\nPop darn good er about it works I'm thinking of things that here's something is not my cup of tea but I'm prepared to respected did America need a Halloween remake\nWell what does America need a\nHoliday [laughter] [laughter] it's a good thirty seconds it at a good\nIt's it's good I thought I thought last night actually with a with a paying audience um\nAnd ah we were we were all kind of enthralled at the at the right moment that was it was scary where it needs to be a funny where it needs to be\nAn interesting one quick thing I'll say about it is it is interesting\nUm [noise] uh how\nThey they try to treat the idea of evil or throughout the movie people are trying to get Michael Meyers to talk to explain themselves\nMorning or any any great music means as soon as time for the sale dialogue will last or radio hour a\nWeek and I enjoy and as I Am by most rapes Dr Larry on President of bills sail college all things Hillsdale are collected in Hillsdale dot edu including an application that by the institution the opportunity to sign up for him prime is there a newsletter\nAnd a bunch of great online courses especially about the constitution but also about Winston Churchill in Shakespeare and all of our conversations which began in twenty Thirteen about Homer\nAnd it brought us to the constitution itself today are all founded cue for Hillsdale dot com doctor on Good Friday morning to you thank you for joining me good due to\nThe right we're back because of current events I have to go backwards in our constitution series\nTo article one section three the United States Senate and the reason I'm doing that is\nNot surprisingly as the Republicans seem intent upon keeping and indeed expanding their Senate majority we've seen online and on the air arguments of the Senate is non representative and must be changed but it's wrong for North Dakota have two senators et cetera so I bought\nBlurry aren't as the founders key author one of his great books on the frame or is that what they intended and we're going to talk about the Senate and what it is supposed to do this morning\nAnd article one section three says the center of the United states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature there are for six years in each hunter show have one vote now\nThey're choosing part has been changed by the seventeenth or limit which now reads the center of the United states should be comprised of two senators from each state elected by the people there um\nFor six years in each ... one boat that was ratified in Nineteen Thirteen\nSo our original document was updated in Nineteen Thirteen wrongly the right way but we kept Matt Larry aren't we kept that two senators would you explain the theory and practice their up\nA well the the ... the original is slightly different from the current uh they both have the same central principal the original was a compromise in the ... the biggest compromise in the ... made the constitution come together\nAnd ah the compromise was shell there'd be two chambers both represent a just a population of the United states or shall there'd be two chambers one of them represent states\nAnd uh that compromise was necessary to get the constitution through\nAnd in my opinion also good and I will tell you that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton who was the initial enemies of the compromise\nThey came around to that way of thinking to doctors convention produced a consensus on most of the big things\nAnd why well uh the the thing is they were looking out already upon a continent and they didn't know how big it was yeah they they do find that out for almost Twenty years uh actually yeah the almost Twenty years\nLewis and Clark yeah Lewis and Clark right so somebody came back you know is big day when Lewis and Clark got back\nTo [laughter] it's a big country [laughter] what what is this thing you know\nAnd that but they were keenly interested in the thing right so George Washington's army was called the continental army and then the question is and they also very much believed and this is in the art arguments of the federalist papers more than the anti federalist but it's in both sets of papers in various places\nThe argument is you're going to have to have a big country and you're gonna have to have a big country for a lot of reasons but one of them that's obvious and simple is national defense\nAnd we don't want to build another year up here we don't want you know all that you know ... borders neighbors wars constant intrigue and so they were interested in extending the fear of the United states has a deeper reasons or in federal it's nine\nAnd then there are about how you can get better divisions of power and ultimately more excellence in government by having to watch here so they're they're gonna be a big country now the question is how do you represent\nAnd just take the Senate is like\nA massive fact that happened in the same summer is riding constitution in the northwest ordinance they devised a method for the country to grow and the method is not that uh the new territory will ever be treated as a colony it would not\nIt would be treated as a territory soon to become a state\nAnd then there's one thing that's always a consensus in the ... in in the founding era and then the costs\nIt's a convention and that is most things done by government will be done locally as close to the people as possible so\nNow at the national level you've got to represent the continent and and you know huge diverse\nIn territory and geography and therefore the way people live and so you want to represent that too and you want to represent the whole of it because the challenge is to unite\nA great empire of liberty so the Senate is for balancing its for protection of local and it's for uniting the country section by section into a whole\nTo stitch out of many disparate parts one quilt of liberty now Larry our and our framers\nWere often on horseback traveling great distances not just during the revolutionary war but before and after and back and forth to the Annapolis convention to the Philadelphia can mentioned this day ratifying you mentioned and they were acquainted with the diversity of this great country and this is not merely though it is partially\nA slave owning interest versus the abolitionist interest is not merely that they also recognize that there were Merck until the states like New York in agrarian states like Georgia and small states like ride Rhode Island and ... states like Virginia which at the time of this\nWas literally unlimited I Believe you are because they got the land grant all the way extending as far as it could go so what part did that recognition of the of the deep diversity of America play in the coddling together of the Senate\n[noise] yeah well they they would not yeah they did the the word diversity a curse in the federalist papers good point [noise] um so yeah and just remember people today people have real attachment to the place where they were born\nAnd grew up in the Michigan you lived there although unbelievable edge as they used to even Michigan they're attached to yeah yeah but 'cause you know first of all what choice if you got you're going to go to Ohio [laughter]\nSo it's uh so it's a a it's a\n... yeah you you know you like the football team from your state and you like the baseball team and all that right and that's just a reflection of something larger you\nKnow yes yeah if you grow up\nIn California if you go up in urban California you know where I Lived a long time and you live a long time then you know God help you it's it's in some ways very similar to growing up in urban Boston but in other ways really different\nCompletely a hundred percent different because of the freeways and the beach because of the the music and the restaurants because of the fact that you have to drive these vast distances as opposed to Boston getting on the MTA the green line to go down three stops\nThat's right yeah so in LA you know nothing is more than Seventy miles apart\n[laughter] make across the ocean [laughter]\nYou know and that's just and see just remember we\nWe we forget these days right but we have these bodies and they have to be somewhere and it matters what their surroundings are like and so the idea that you would eliminate that uh would be ultimately to eliminate the consent of the government\nSo I Want to go back to you you said that handle to Madison were originally opposed to the Senate very is abroad the argument that the Senate reflects the slave holding interest that is profoundly wrong but it is everywhere\nYeah that that uh the slave holding interest\nInfluence the debate but it did not drive the debate and and the way to understand that is a you know there was an assumption and it was very widespread that slavery was going to pass away and then they had\nAnd it did pass away in more than half the union and that doesn't mean they weren't exceptions to that they were very few prominent ... exceptions to that\nAnd for the south Carolina delegates are for example a slave holders paint me um\nYou know they they said things in their lives that indicated that they thought that this institution was incompatible with the declaration of independence and it is so so they're not you know there but protecting their interest is not the same thing as protecting their slave\nYes one of the big holdouts\nWith New York state and what was its interest right there were slavery in New York state Senate abolished after the after the founding but what I had is\nA big old port and a big old city in a big old state and they were powerful and important and they you know they're they're the way people made a living and I remember that's very influential people the way people made a living in New York had very much to do with the fact that\nYeah we're not going to I Would I we're not going to reopen the seventeenth amendment as a practical matter I'm against the convention in the states as a matter as well but when we come back we're gonna continue to talk about the glory of the Senate and this current eruption of attacks upon it as an institution\nNot any particular decision the decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a great and good decision\nBut it launched it triggered on the left a mad\nCap rushed to denounce the Senate and we stand here as we always do it every Friday at

ago in GQ magazine that noted I'm a Journal of political science chicken magazine as an article in the case for abolishing the Senate\nBy one J will is the ... which is the upper chamber has become far more undemocratic from the Constitution's framers could ever imagine what would American government look like without it and I read you a paragraph from the same article\nIn the Senate transformation into a fun house mirror version of the house is a quiet emergency for democracy because its members are still al acquainted allocated equally among states\nAnd since there are now at greater number of sparsely populated mostly white\nRight leaning states than there are heavily populated racially diverse left leaning states who said act to preserve power for people in groups who would otherwise have failed to earn it a voter in Wyoming population five hundred and Seventy nine thousand\nEnjoys roughly Seventy times more influence in the Senate than a voter in California population thirty nine point five million which sounds like the most unfair to stick in American politics until you realize the tax paying us citizens in Washington DC in Puerto Rico have no influence in the Senate at all\nA closed quote Dr on your response to Jay will is\nA that's a brilliant that's uh that's one of the most intense and dance pieces of nonsense that I've ever read\n[laughter] and here's why ah\nFirst of all that's just if you go read there's so many wonderful passage in the federalist\nWhat he's calling for by the way is a majority faction heating there's a bunch of white people scattered here and there which step one because there aren't very many of them they're not likely to dominate the political system although they're influential in it as they should be\nA and because they're there and they get in a way\nThere's more of us right and so what these things have a tendency to do is to turn the national national politics not just presidential politics
