picked up on this yeah was it Associated Press a piece that Montana are empty P. R. dot org picked up Missoula passes amended emergency gun ban in public\nPlaces I think about the headline okay you know me tell you what do I what what do I try to instill in you every single program when you watch this stuff don't just be that headline surfer Missoula passes amended emergency gun ban in public places what\nMakes it an emergency if you're a liberal gun hating Democrat professional gun prohibition is banning ... guns themselves or an emergency\nWe talked about it yesterday hell right that's what the twenty fifth district in California has guns listed under her health issues for her campaign\n\nSo if if you heard this this is a health issue this is a public health crisis everything's in emergency to a Democrat everything is an emergency to these\nMissoula passes amended emergency gun ban in public places this is a daunting headline let's dig a little bit deeper into this and it's funny because there's a photograph of an extra de with though to through looks like six rounds\nOn the on the top of the peace and its caption underneath it\nHand guns handguns\nI was unable to discern that by looking at the picture of the handgun myself\nHand gun to separate words hand gone\nMissoula city council passed two ordinances banning firearms in public places that's what actually happened they passed on Monday This piece is dated October six feet which was what\nMonday no one was Monday Monday was the fifty\nTwo on the sixteenth was reported by the a P we're talking this week is just recent stuff both ordinances past this past Monday just what four days ago banning firearms at all polling places schools parks museums libraries\nIn the city council chambers where we can have fun with this at the end they'll tell you why just a second according to the a P the first emergency ordinance that went into effect immediately due to the fact that the general election this November six while\nThe regular ordinance will go into effect in thirty days so I take if this was the first time Missoula\nOn Tana has held in the election just the first election ever held in Missoula, Montana how many polling places have been shot up prior to this coming election the answer to that is a big fat whopping\nZero so what makes this an emergency emergency as the election is coming up what about the last election\nAnd the one before that and the before that and before that and before that and before that I'm for that\n\nHow long is Missoula, Montana been in existence how many elections have been held in Missoula, Montana not maybe I'm wrong because I haven't researched this\nMaybe this is the first election maybe this is the first polling place ever opened in Missoula, Montana and when they open that they thought oh God we forgot to ban does we got an election coming up and just under twenty days this is an emergency we have to pass the ban\nYou following\nMe here are you walking with me or are you seeing the stupidity of the sheer ... beauty of this isn't about banning guns this is about pushing an agenda one band at a time\n\nIt's moving forward one step at a time this never stop\nThe amended emergency ordinance prohibits members of the public from bringing firearms and do any building where the city council meat or to public assemblies public museums the public library\nCertain public parks on those parks are the ones that are under the city's jurisdiction and quote any other locations of public assembly where persons gather together to conduct an door administer any public election well election related activities are taking place\n\nThat is very reminiscent of what Georgia wants had with its public gathering laws that took the state of Georgia over one hundred and forty years\nTo get rid of which it finally did very reminiscent of that\nAnd word in such a way that they could probably make any public gathering\nAny public gathering fall under the constraints of this ordinance the previous ordinance\nAccording to the a P only band weapons in explosive devices in city hall and public school buildings just those two places so it's an emergency we have to get the rest of these places fixed before this election\nBut here's what they forgot to do they forgot to tell criminals because you see this is all about you\nYou can't take your gun in these places but if somebody wants to murder a city council person they're going to go in\nWith a gun this ordinance isn't going to stop them it's already illegal to shoot and kill a city council member\nAnybody else for that matter and staying your banning something isn't stopping that person that wants to do that it's only stopping the person who has no intention of doing that in part or polling places\nOr any where else he does a farce it is fake it is evidence of what you face as a law abiding citizen every single day in America where Democrats run the ship\nMontana I'm not really sure what's going on up there I really don't know I'm going to pick on you a little bit today I've got a couple of other stories I Want to talk with you about two\nNow my programs Aaron Missoula, Montana and I want to get some feedback from you would ... the
