{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "And you know I was just thinking to myself man that I overdo that one\nYou you just waited all this information in a very short amount of time and I want to go into that a little bit because I think what you are too was\nHuge seems there were very good reasons for these\nSocietal norms that we used to live with that would make it very difficult divorce very very unpleasant to produce a child out of wedlock those kinds of things\nSo despite moral issues involved it looks like most things have given way to the idea that happiness is more important\nThan the societal norms\nExactly in fact I'm no I was on the board of directors of the national organization for women for a number of years and we began having our first conflict or when I when when feminists who are members of now\nI Would write it and say I don't like the the quality stuff when it applies to I'm divorced because I I Know my children better than my husband do does I should be the one being able to um be fully involved with the children if I Want and get him involved ... to the degree that I feel is right\nAnd I said wait a minute you're asking the wrong question here the question is the question should be\nA what's best for the children and they said well women shifted every spots but women should have the freedom to be able to raise their children children by themselves\nAnd I said well that's freedom I I'm a hundred percent in support of women having the freedom to have children\nBut the freedoms have children implies at the moment you have them your child's life becomes more important to you you have the freedom to make that decision as to whether you're going to allow that to happen in your life or not just be single and not have children and so um and there's there is where we broke\nBut I then started to you so they said okay you know this was back in the seventies and it and they said well\nYou know there isn't a huge amount of research proving that children do better with both parents but um and because at that point in time there weren't a large number of divorces for a long enough period of time to have really good research on that\nSo I went out doing the research but you know because you know I was making a very large amount of money from speaking on behalf of now ... feminist issues my desire was to find research that did prove that they were right that the women were you know we're we're the best\nAnd raising children including boys\nAnd I found out that that was that just plain wrong and so that\nFinding the research that found that that children get so much better with fathers as well as mothers involved and that what I call it checks and balances parenting is really the best and most effective parenting understanding of what they say\nAbout ten differences between dad's style parenting and mom style parenting like the boundary enforcement\nAround that I was mentioning and the and the pressure to to have postponed ratification those are two examples of those differences um and when those differences are all in play that's when the children to the bass while I was really hoping that I wouldn't find that because of that cost me many millions of\nDollars that speaking engagements that fell on\nA doctoral it seems to me that are in that previous time when these norms were in place\nIt was basically a religions that enforce these norms are what are we do today with the fading influence of religion in society how how do we restore some semblance of a\nI don't know but how how do we find more value in a returning to these norms which\nClearly promoted a better crop or ma'am\nYes absolutely first of all we really do have to understand that children need both moms and dads secondly that have to start reading and finding out what they contribute why you know why is there propensity to lead a boy or girl climbing a tree\nI'm much higher than a mile would be comfortable letting that boy or girl climbing a tree out why is that good and then where does it become dangerous too dangerous to be worth the the fall or that might happen when they go too far and and the wrong place\nAnd so this balancing act as part of it but like you know usually with a mom looks at a dad rough housing her only thought it\nOn my God I just have one more child to have to sort of um monitor air and then if they if they keep this up sooner or later there's got to be somebody's head it's got to hit somebody ended up crying and he doesn't even realize that I don't know why don't why that's the case\nAnd then ... there is someone whose heads are hit or there's someone has cry and it's just proves to her that she is right and she should've intervene sooner she feels guilty about it or he thinks it to their dads don't say yes I returned to turn rough housing after they hit their heads\nAnd returned to rough having exactly the same way as I was doing it before because I warned them not to do when they had their first hit as heads\nThat was the signal that something went wrong and so I'm telling them not to do that again or what to do differently and then I'm returning to rough house housing to give them the experience of that\nAnd what type of experiences where they giving to each other\nThe the the the the older brother and they may be middle aged brother and a younger sister or they were being held back at too I'm not push shove her elbow or somebody out when they're having a rough housing and then whether the goal was to Penn daddy down and dad was supposed to pretend to all three of them down first\nAnd show that site and that excitement\nA which is which is what psychologists call emotional intelligence under fire and what in simple terms can be called teaching the children to be empathetic to their brother and sister but you don't teach the children to be authentic to the brother and sister by just lecturing them to be authentic because\nThey agree with you at the moment you say that but then as they get excited and want to pin you down they forget about that and so it's only by\nLetting them not forget it that it by knowing that they're going to lose their fun time rough outing\nWe'll buy dad saying okay I Want you\nTo know about your sister and push right out the way she's younger than you are and\nEt cetera um so now there's no more rough housing till tomorrow night and then they lose their rough housing and that that encourages them to start having empathy for somebody else's feelings and in a moment of excitement besides fairs\nAnd so we find that rough housing for example is far more likely to get allow children should be empathetic\nTo allow them to understand the difference between the assertive aggressive\nTo have that emotional intelligence under fire and often built a much deeper bond with the father because of the physical connection and that the preponderance used unwittingly by the father to enforce boundaries that that that moms could not enforced without having resentment build up toward them\nSo dad's have to explain all of this um and and and explain the other nine different style of parenting and so ... and then moms and dads has to be able to listen to it without becoming defensive\nAnd I mentioned that couple of communication workshops before they find that that that the Achilles' heel of all human beings as our inability to handle personal criticism without becoming defensive but that's especially true for my loved one who we love so much we feel fragile when they criticize us\nAnd so part of what we need to do a among families who are not religious and don't have that do tend to their to their psyche and assistant\nI'm Institute communication not legislation that communication skills training and then others and fathers have to think of their parenting is checks and balance parenting assessing each situation their child gets involved with\nAnd and knowing what dad's had to contribute knowing what moms have to contribute and respecting that contribution 'em and hearing each other's reasons for killing the way they do\nWell you clearly done some extremely important work and\nYou're very good at communicating it so I Hope you have many chances to get their message out it's one that Americans I guess you could say based on your research that it's the men and women of every continent me to hear about how we returned to the the good parts of the norms of the past which produced healthy\nYoung men and women\nYes and and and what you are getting it and I didn't really quite acknowledge it up\nIf there is a wisdom and the accumulated history of the way we've brought up children and the way we value family\nAnd I'm afraid that my feminist trends that didn't never never understood the value of the family and never understood the value of fathers and the resistance to hearing that message to the important stuff that\nComes in great conflict with their own focus on personal freedom\nAnd that is really a mistake or that they that the political left has made today\nDr Warren barrel author of the boy crisis why our boys are struggling and what we can do about it is recommended reading especially for parents of anybody who might feel that their opinion leader in the world because it's a message people need to hear\nDr barrel thank you so much\nYou're very welcome and that's it for this edition of impacts Houston I'm Jeannie Peeper\nJoined us again next week for being used as you have any questions about today's

series movies in fact that's what she's back in the news for today is the er er er yesterday is is the Halloween news series she she was the other movies I'm trading trading places murder the Eddie Murphy Dan Ackroyd movie that was a good one then of course we are we already mentioned to your mentioned the true relies\nSo ... is is [noise]\nYou know how do we say this politely she's but she's a but yup yup\nYup what do I mean you can't tell somebody but on the radio now she is the second amendment but we're going to get to that so we're we're we're going to talk talk about her here she she's in this new movie Halloween I don't know if it's Halloween you know two thousand or ... thousand whenever it is it's it's then it's the newest version of a of the Halloween you remember she was in it

don't know if the caller Jamie Lee maybe they color Jamie Jamie ... I don't know Jay Leno they said Jamie Lee ... you know you're you're a hypocrite you you you use guns in your movie but you're anti gun and and\nThis this discourse covered by ... by CNN you can use is covered by the left Fox was the one that called it out and said listen here's a here she is using these using these guns and she's a gun and she's a gun control advocate\nWell CNN said you did the title I love the titles how they make the titles of their\nStories so if you were just scrolling through your your news feed and you saw the titles\nYou would think oh man that's that's it they're here's here's the title this this must be a horrible thing or title for hers was Jamie Lee Curtis uses two words to shut down all widely ridiculed Fox News gun story wow\nTwo words I'm thinking these these must be strong words the way this title is written the way the title of the stories written this has got to be some serious strong language that she threw out there\nAgain if you were just scrolling through your news feed and saw that title and didn't read the story your brain automatically go to that this must have been harsh\nThis must have been harsh reality that she threw down on Fox where you want in order to words were her two words were\nJust silly yeah yeah that's it just silly so that so that's that's that's the uh the the two the two great words she flew back out I'm here here's the problem with that we have with the obviously with Jamie Lee Curtis doing are\nWielding these guns using these guns in the movies or you know when she's a gun control advocate she she goes on and a ... and she says that listen she she supports the second amendment wow she she supports the second amendment\nGuys you know what's coming next do we do or to give it away to give it away right you\nKnow what's coming next she said she supports the second amendment and has absolutely no problem with people owning firearms\nYou're ready for it but yeah she's a second member but she supports the second woman but she has no problem with people owning firearms if they have been trained license a background check has been conducted\nAnd the pause button has been pushed to give time for that process to take place\n... ... what I I don't think I've heard that last part before I don't think I've ever heard the the let's give time for\nI have a pause button to be pushed so the process can take place okay Jay really hopefully you're listening thing I'd I don't know if you're a regular user of a you know the armed American radio daily defense our with Mr mark Walters I perhaps you are I don't know\nThe ... will let me give you let me give you a little facts here let me give you a little how this works when he purchased a gun and in ... and maybe Oregon Jamie I I have no idea but there is no pause push button\nLet that process take place you're going to buy your fire depending on which state you're in you go into your license firearms dealer you say I Would like to purchase this fire and police\nYou fill out your federal background check form you have to answer truthfully on that or you don't go any further\nThey do the federal background check which for the most part unless it's a really crazy busy hectic day\n... and for for gun purchases it's done in ten to Fifteen minutes tops tops\nYou may be on a holiday weekend are you that when they're done specials are special for everything going on around the country that might take a little bit longer might take twenty thirty minutes unless there's a delay if there's a delay which I mean yeah you know your name matches somebody else's name that's a you know convict or\nA you know you're on the the the the terrorist watch list you know then there's going to be a delay and then they're gonna hold you back you know then then then you have to wait that's that's the purpose of that background check to catch those people but\nNow unless you have your state with a a waiting period a or a county or a city with a waiting period you have to go in and you have to abide by the waiting period most places though if you have your if you've already gone and gotten your fires permit whether that's a whenever you stay calls it a carry permit a a a concealed weapons permit you're you're you're you're a firearms identification card\nWhatever happens to be once you have that most of those locations you get to bypass\nYour your your your waiting period you have to worry about the waiting period for the fire\nBut there are still plenty of locations out there I can walk in today and say\nLike to purchase the firearm here as my driver's license I Will fill out your form I Will get my background check and I will take it home\nNow that a majority for long guns I I you know trying to think if there's any places would still do that with handguns with pistols with the revolve around that kind of thing revolve ... I'm In and pistols what's the other damage that's one of the other classifications for handguns underneath the ... and\nYou'd have a long guns you can you can you can do it you could take it home that day if the if the law allowed to try to remember there's any for the for the pistols for the side arms have to look at what struck down on a break and get back to you I'm not sure\nThe but Jimmy here you can go in there you could buy this fire and the pause button and here's what I Want to go through with the second amendment in this pause when the second amendment\nThis is the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\nThe right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed unless according to Jamie you've been trained you've been licensed you've had your background check and you have the pause button to give time for that process to take place and I'm sure if she's referring to cooling down period that we saw after your the Brady bill came out\nOr perhaps ah she thinks that it actually takes up you know I gotta do fingerprints and send them off and wait a month for the FBI to send them back to the old school style or you know she's she's a little bit out there so I'm not sure what what her goal is with ah with with the with these a pause buttons but that's that's that's crazy\nJamie Lee that that's not how this works and here's here's where we complain all the time you'll hear this folks and you've got to listen to when people talk you have to listen to when they start to talk about firearms because they're going to tell you I support the second amendment but\nDon't be a Second Amendment but I've got to listen to a proud pin that I wear a ... all the time I got it from or Mr jury Henry the or the executive director there Georgia Carrie ... first time I ever heard it and he had the pins I don't know if it was something he coined or something the organization formed\nGoing but you hear all the time\nI support the second amendment but will stop right there stop right there if they don't support the second amendment every see me if they if they don't support the second member they are going to say but this is this is where the bus comes in I I support the Sacramento but ... you know you don't know you know you might as well say things like\nUm I support the first amendment freedom of speech but not for Jews you know I just it's not for them ... ... that's what we hear\nJamie that's what we hear when you say I support the second amendment but I hear I support the Fourth Amendment for protection against illegal search and seizure\nUnless you're Hispanic that's what we hear good because you want to take some of our rights\nHe's used to use the joke and say only ... ... there'll be a girly man don't be the girly man and this was something a used when he ran a in two thousand four for governor of California when he ... he would start to say he would talk to the girly man don't watch watch out for the girl I mean I Know this and we've seen it many times before that he um\nIn center in late Saturday Night live even used it to you remember the the characters and see if I remember off the top of my head I'm a Amazon's in France and we had Dana ... and oh boy boy a brain block\n'em but they were they were hunting fronds and they were here to pump you up and they would call everybody on their a girly man a girly man now you know I don't know\nTowards the nigger stole it from one or or SNL stole it from a you know sports in ... but\nHe used the term girly man when he was talking about the Democrats that he was running against and the Democrats in the California state a legislature and you know whether it be the the house or the senator\nHe also said that he was going to terminate them remember how I'm going to terminate I'm a I'm a ... the girl a mountain in they don't do anything to terminate them that was a Arnold Schwarzenegger's\nCampaign slogans can't campaign speeches when he was out there in I'm In California running well you see what's going on we just saw the\nThe brutal attacks against a justice now justice Kavanaugh we saw that happen we've seen them against our president and how you know he'd tougher to get you know it didn't push them often well now Arnold Schwarzenegger is is it is turn now he is now apologetic\nFor using the Gurley mental and he says at the time it felt like the right thing to do it was in my gut I improvised and I called them girly man because they weren't willing to take risks\nThey were afraid of everything politicians in general wants to do little things so there's no risk we involved I'm Sorry I probably should have done that in the accent you know maybe maybe next time I'm he said it was a short sighted in the long term it's better not to say that because you want to work with them so now he's coming out\nThat the the whole the whole girly man are you saying girly man is\nIs is demeaning he shouldn't have said girly man\nBecause it's it's offensive really meant defensive did this is a guy that carried [noise]\nYou know a ... machine guns and and and and blue people up and it was the Terminator and he ripped heads off and you do you remember he to people with knives that came out\nOf his hands and he's and he says\nYou're girly man I'm going to terminate you and now he's apologetic for it he's apologetic for using these terms\nWhat has happened what is going on out there in California why are these people turning crazy or you know listen we know that the Schwarzenegger is no fan of the Republican Party anymore he when he became the governor out there he started as a Republican and by the end of his term he was pretty much a Democrat he was one of the worst thing ever happened to gun control\nIn a in in California out there he's he's he was horrible horrible governor\nBut now he's apologetic and listen you know here's what you need to do\nI'm Sorry ... you need to man up you'll be respectful of women you'd be respectful of everybody around you and you don't have to worry about these things you don't you don't you don't talk trashed anybody shouldn't be talking trash do doesn't matter if it's man or woman the women this applies to you to you why all of a sudden we have to apologize for things that happened twenty Thirty years ago it's absolutely horrendous it's absolutely ridiculous\nA ... and I won't do it and maybe that's why I get to keep getting thrown off the Facebook in the winter but the you know because I I like to be string to the point I listen to get more program coming back for

the Chinese in in this effort I Would say the shareholders of these companies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future\nReally you want to make money off of repression I if I were a shareholder I'd I'd want to know or what the answer of our corporate leadership was\nThe shareholders though we certainly would not have allowed and pre war Germany Americans to sell the cry or works the designed for new artillery are we is there a role for the government to step in the Silicon Valley and control technology transfer where\nWe were looking at the export the control area look we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear chemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile\nDevelopment I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing that because we've abandoned free market principles but because we have to be realistic about the adversaries we face in the world today that use\nThe fruits of American freedom against us and we shouldn't let that happen we want to do it in ways to protect our open economy but the night others the ability to take advantage of it\nOr to return to the previous administration and Bob Woodward's book a lot was overlook one thing that was overlooked was a candidate missions that they had to hit the scope of the north Korean nuclear problem in\nFront of the country so that they had to work for a President Obama had the war in President but that was his biggest problem didn't they in fact conceal the extent of the problem and we're we prepared for pre emptive strike the Woodward describes well\nThat the Obama policy they described as strategic patience that is a sending in for doing nothing about North Korea\nAnd it's another example of a do bill coming due for President Trump a I think the combination of the potential use of military force against North Korea and the maximum pressure campaign that the president waged on the economic front is what has brought\nThat Kim Jong onto the table my parents just returned from another\nTrip there will see a meeting I think between a chairman Kevin President Trump sometime in the next couple of months\nOr we'll see other efforts go forward the president has held the door open for North Korea he gave them a great little uh a movie in a in Singapore\nWhen he met with Kim Jong on that showed what North Korea's future could be so the doors open they need to denuclearize completely and ... and if they do that and walk through the door of the future could be very different for the north Korean people\nJohn Holdren has been known for Twenty years is the most skeptical of skeptics of a feel good diplomacy are you feeling good about the diplomacy with North Korea\nLook I don't think we'd be in the place we are today if we'd continued to pursue\nA rock Obama's policies I think four more years of that under Hillary Clinton would've guaranteed in North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons or the the future remains uncertain on the president's diplomacy he's optimistic he pressed his heart he does not have stars and his eyes about this\nNow they're just my palm pale neither does Jim Mattis neither do I\nShould we be encouraging our allies to match what the Chinese are doing the creation of artificial age holes in Harlem in the Philippines and Japan can do it I think it'd be doing\nWell I think we've got to do more first to establish for the Chinese that we do not acknowledge the legitimacy of any of this\nThe ship or near a collision you mentioned a is an example of how dangerous Chinese behavior is\nWe have now gotten more participation by allies the British the Australians and others are are sailing whether it's through the south China Sea we are going to do a lot more on that uh I think we could see more exploitation of mineral resources in the south China Sea with or without Chinese cooperation\nThey need to know they have not achieved the fed accompli here\nThis is not a Chinese province and will not be\nFrom getting the light up so I ask you to things Russia's in the rearview mirror and Christopher Wray said this yesterday they're worried about today's problems trying to write about tomorrow's problem how much it our strategic thinking stuck in a rush of first as a problem and not focused on China as the major geopolitical strategic challenge of eccentric\nWell I think we do see China as the the major issue of the century I don't think we're stuck in the rearview mirror but what I Would say is in a world that's now\nPost post Cold War we are in a very complex environment the United states faces a range of challenges globally summit the strategic nuclear level summit the level of terrorist threats\nWe've got to be prepared across the spectrum of threats in a way we've never had to be in our history and the nineteenth century we were much more isolated than we are today we are being global power and are threats are global as well\nAnd what is the president's grasp of the geopolitical complexities of the war we get this question all the time you deal with them daily\nWell I think he's got a all the grasp of it he needs\nThe the one difference between a President Trump and other presidents is his economic background and he sees and emphasizes economic issues in a way we've not seen in a long time that confuses some people but as you followed him through it or he is striking problems that have the devil the United states for a long time\nMorning glory monitor on Canada to the fact that our studio inside of the winds [noise] northern Virginia don't way where Michael\nExhibited stage right towards England last night after taking two hundred thousand people in power and southern Virginia and leaving a trail of destruction tears from the panhandle north I Am joined by Dr Larry on President Hillsdale College Hillsdale dot edu for all of your Hillsdale needs\nAnd his online correspond Churchill which is apparently very necessary reading person people in America who pot and Churchill gotten to the cabinet business doctor before we begin with justice cabinet or the\nTragedy at this level is a little hard for people\nTo grasp but when you look and see that Panama city's gone Mexico City beach has gone to Dale air force base which was home to three thousand people in the military all their possessions are gone ... why do you tell your students about tragedy and sadness of it\n\nYeah well you got to pick up and go again but that that's you know when this thing come true and they the water is the big thing you know when ... modern buildings don't really blowed out all that much but the water comes to not just you know you got to start over\nWhen when England went through the blitz and large parts of it were destroyed and every night this terrible stuff what happened how ... how did they introduce resilience or was that just part of the national character already\nWell uh you know people don't like being bombed and\nThat makes [laughter] and then makes them just like the people who are doing it they got\nReally rapidly now they they uh you know Winston Churchill as prime minister of Great Britain and he was pretty good at the job so not only did he give eloquent speeches\nIt's also true that they came up with an insurance scheme you know and so you didn't bear the burden of that yourself and the way it worked you know you can drive through London today and if you see\nA cluster of old buildings and then an interruption with new buildings and then the old buildings resume\nThat's the bombing pattern and if you go up a block and turn left and left again you'll see the same thing repeated in the next block over and so it just cuts swamps down of London and you know if you were in the law and you got you got hammered\nBut it was it was a you know people wanted to know what's so it's different than you know a natural thing like this or is anybody with him to get angry here well I guess you can blame it on me for global warming argue\nBut yeah yeah that was there was a lot of that going on by the way a ... and they forget the Labor Day storm of the Nineteen thirties the destroyed a lot of Rhode Island they forget Camille in the sixties I mean it it's convenient for Gulf goes up and down and different years it's up this year and that made it tougher\nMhm yeah it did and uh and it\nIf you live on the coast you know and what we see in this Michael thing is living right on the coast\nIs dangerous if you live in the Gulf for all the Atlantic seaboard but uh if you know if she lives five miles and that's not like you're enjoying wonderful coastal living now and so those people are getting punished and that's too bad you\nKnow I talk this morning where they northern are they a Virginia Beach family or because they have two hundred thousand people without without a power down there and so it started in Florida went through Georgia South Carolina North Carolina in ... Virginia that's just never happened before that is a weird thing and we're going to have to see the president respond to it but now\nAnd I told everyone a chamber of a con usa dot org if they want to help out let's turn to the other tragedy which was the violence done to the presumption of innocence and I think this is a\nAnswer the mob rule that with legitimize a and to the difference between political rallies and chanting lock her up which I don't particularly approve of it but it's a rally and it's a chant versus menacing Ted Cruz and his wife and a restaurant with the imminent threat of violence or the ...\nThe mobs in Portland I think we've lost our capacity\nTo distinguish Larry between political speech and political violence\nTo two weeks ago a ... I read something but they can send her to talk at Hillsdale by Charles cancer and they both use the expression cold civil war and uh you know this is like the early Nineteen fifties right\nEntertainment and do you mean they think is er Eighteen fifty ... ...\nAnd ... what's the feature of it the point is we have to have an agreement that we're going to decide our political differences through a process and the process has to be agreed in advance and especially if the process is hallowed then you don't want to mess with it\nRight if you read Lincoln's great first inaugural address he says that the first time that a ballots ever placed bullets in a fundamental political it was just it was an eight hundred in the United states of America which I think is true\nSo so the point is you're going to so the the people elect under the constitutional process sees a majority in the Senate\nAnd the president of the same party and he gets to elect a bunch of people out of the Supreme Court [noise]\nCan't be planned in advance that's you know that's how the constitution works\nAnd so to obstruct the process does you know what what I think is\nIt was a shame for this thing even to be taken up and the reason is that that lady seems like a fine lady ... sincere but there is no evidence for this and it happened you know a human generation ago when\nBrett Kavanaugh was it was a kid so the thing is that something that you just would not be able to get to the bottom of\nIt is it is a problem of proof that the very beginning that ought to have been recognized adventure amount of old but it was politicized with weaponized\nI Want to pause for a moment of cold civil war veteran I have a disagreement about this from Charles and I I went up the ante them two weekends ago and that's a hot civil war that twenty thousand people dead in one day from the dunk or church all the way down to burn side bridge and\nEven in the Eighteen fifties we had you know John Brown and the Bush sweaters in Kansas and stuff like that but we're not there but I Do think the warning about what happens\nWhen we don't realize\nThat debate can be fierce but you cannot men is that is the constitutional pests by the way and in the in the Supreme Court which is the intention and the ability to incite violence is illegal if not protected speech\nThat's right that's right and you know the so I I think I said this on a couple of weeks ago but in in the\nNineteen forty five Winston Churchill last elections the socialist whom he said what ultimately result in it to stop and the socialist got forty eight percent of the vote and they got over sixty percent of the seats and so\nOf course the conservatives were rumblings about that and Churchill gives him a species the leader of the opposition now and he says we're not gonna complain about that this is the constitutional system this is how they got in and this is how we're going to replace them\nAnd so you know it\nIt contrast that with the ... of the electoral college and now the Senate in the country in other words there isn't any constitutional range but that shouldn't be it's not subject to a salt in the interest of partisan politics of the day\nIt is that is true everything is under assault\nAnd if you're not on the right team the media will absolutely demonize you and by the media I mean the broadcast networks with the exception of Fox I mean the big newspapers I mean the beltway Manhattan Media late they are on the left\nAnd they will demonize you if you are not on the left and they will protect you if you are and Kanye West is finding out big time on CNN or they're mocking him in terms that were any other commentator to use concerning any other minority ... that come to it or would be off the air\nThere but we did have the Donald Trump rule now and that is anything can be said about him or anybody connected to him [laughter] that's a new feature of American politics\nThe repeat that that is true yeah you can't go low there is nothing so low about Trump that will get thrown off the air yeah maybe in violence may be a threat of violence that would do it\nWell that's a crime as you said and then not protected speech and uh violence against the president is particular crime a so they don't they don't do that but I mean there's a movement to impeach Brett Kavanaugh going on right now\nAnd it's in you know that the chief justice has referred to complain that he did not laugh is judicial conduct in answering the charges against him before the Senate that's been transfer it to the tenth circuit but the point is\nEverything is going to be harassed at every step\nAnd that's the tone of politics these days\nWhen we come back to break Dr Larry on I Will continue to talk about the choice of it now in front of the country it's very clearly no the choice of the mob or it's the choice of the the Republican Party and out or play out in Michigan with John James and that will play out in Montana with Matt Rosendale and Wisconsin when we're book mirror\nAnd everywhere we come back we're going to play for your um you the seminal\nExchange in the media John

shuttle made reference to church joy was\nJumped on by the online ... he apologized for siting Churchill and said\nSomething I'm paraphrasing mark here in fact he did not realize that Churchill was so offensive and I immediately began to dumb people go watch the Churchill video back this\nCan't be allowed to happen where Churchill cannot be turned into a pariah in history because he was a product of the nineteenth century and and and wrote to greatness and the twentieth\nWell first of all isn't that a shining example of of a public courage this fella [laughter]\nYou just got a buddy for that on the line and he he's a he's a navy fighter pilot astronaut and then you always walk with Gabby Giffords' aides an admirable guy but he pulled it up because nobody wants to be thought to be a racist and so it'd be so Churchill was a racist\nPeople run away instead of saying no no no he wasn't no he was not Great Britain is perhaps police braces country in the world\nYeah so he says the point is I have little doubt that he's brave and kind of combat and if so thank him for his service right right but the truth is if you use the guy\nWho does turn out to be a great guy evidence that he didn't know anything about that apparently right if you use the guy isn't it and you get resistance that isn't it easy to just abandon that guy enjoy in the slander against him but any look it up\nYou know I mean he he he apparently formed his opinions about something that happened two generations right so that means it's over and you can go look it up he formed his opinions about it from a Twitter storm and what do they know right\nI I wrote a line in my book I said I can find no place in the in the corporate siblings and Churchill where he said or slide implied that the right to anyone depended on the color scheme\nAnd that's I I ... that today somebody finally the place where you sit there and I've been looking for forty years now\nWhat you're pretty slow [laughter] I'm not going to grow up at
