talking crap that's all they're doing is speculating and blow baiting\nPeriod sheer conjecture this is not the ball they're doing is chatting\nNo different than the three of us if I sit down and talk with my mom and dad and I tell you is this is what I think is going on here this is what I think's going to happen well I think the American people this and the American people don't they don't know crap that's three people giving you their opinions on a couch in the morning while you're drinking your coffee that is not the news\n\nAnd that's what happened yesterday and that's why I didn't want to talk about having a there was no news the only news about Kavanaugh is what was happening today what happened today culture\nThat's what happened today the Senate voted fifty one forty nine to end debate and go to a vote tomorrow afternoon I think it's thirty hours\nThat's it that's news that's what happened today why is that important well I'll tell you why it's important\nBecause what you saw the left due to Kavanaugh's what the left has been doing to you over the course of the last decade\nThey just through an entire decade him in the span of about eighty seven days really the ... than it adamant about two week period not an eighty seven day period the nomination process took about eighty seven days as of yesterday and he said he ate today eighty eight or eighty nine days today\nRegardless they were desperate\nThey threw what they've been thrown at you as a gun owner\nThis do riding you just calling you murderer was calling you names blaming you for murders around because simply because you're a gun owner they blame you for the actions of criminal what they did with Kavanaugh was all of that thrown and they just do the kitchen sink at him in about a two week period sheer desperation from the left but here's what I knew I was\nGoing to see today I knew I was going to see\nDianne Feinstein stand up on the floor of the Senate and literally lie her eighty five year old tail off it was remarkable to witness first Grassley stands up gives his assessment factual assessment\nThis is what happened on day one this is what happened seven weeks later this is what the minority ranking member did and didn't do here's what she sat on here's what ... what was the result of that\nNow any clear thinking individual knows everything that Feinstein did was working in lockstep with Chuck Schumer behind the scenes and Nancy Pelosi to derail Kavanaugh's nomination and destroy his wife and the process that was all part of the point in any clear thinking intellectually honest human being understand\nThat and today we got to see grass we talk about it he was followed by Feinstein who stood there and wide her satellite radio moment word\nOff literally lied like crazy it took her about two minutes maybe three minutes into her discussion of Kavanaugh to turn to guns\nAnd she completely mischaracterized\nKavanaugh's positions on fire but it doesn't matter doesn't matter what she said specifically we've talked about what she has said before in the past what matters is it took about two minutes for her to go to gun\n\nShe hates Kavanaugh because he respects the constitution and the right to bear arms something which she does not\nEverything's okay with Feinstein did she agrees with if she doesn't agree with it she hates it\nAnd that's what we witnessed today on the floor of a Senate\nOK okay you got me here's what she had about Kavanaugh today another issue that gives me great pause is judge Kavanaugh's extreme position on guns that's what she said extreme position on guns in reviewing his record\nJudicial opinions on guns she said I'm paraphrasing pretty pretty darn close it's clear his record goes beyond beyond\nThe norm she said something to the effect that goes that the beyond the norm being ... meaning more extreme than just simply being pro gun she said she then went on to talk about his dissent in hell or two and how Cavanaugh I Believe that\nAnd millions and millions and she quoted this millions and millions and millions of these semi automatic rifles are in the hands of law abiding Americans possess\nAnd she claims that just because they're put it that doesn't mean their income and use so according to Feinstein an offer infinite lying democratic socialist wisdom\nIf the guy's not flung over your shoulder or actively being put to use on a range it's not\nThis in common usage it's simply possess Feinstein is playing semantics she has a flat out ball face liar and she knows her hypocrisy was on complete utter total display today on the floor of the U.S Senate as was Chuck Schumer here are the two people that orchestrated\nOne of the greatest political ... jobs I've ever seen in my entire life and so did the entire nation by the way\nAnd as it played out both of these individuals took to the floor of the Senate and blamed the Republicans for their extremism\nI I I honest to God I couldn't it was it was difficult for me to watch\nThe lies from Schumer input and and Feinstein today it is utterly remarkable I actually believe these people feel so beyond reproach that they are so morally superior any elite\nThat they simply are incapable of telling a lie I I I'm at a point where I just absolutely believe that well fortunately\nMcConnell jumped back on there and actually you know Mitch put a\nPut both to bad as did Grassley in his opening remarks so we got some sanity in there and then others spoke but that's why I didn't touch Kavanaugh yesterday because there wasn't any news nothing was happening it was nothing but a bunch of blow V. aiding by a bunch of people sitting on couches to get news decks new stuff just talking crap\nTelling you what they think and none of it is new to nothing but fake news it's nothing but opinion masquerading as news none of it was new and I'll tell you what was news was John Paul Stevens former justice Ninety eight years old\nAt first they said he didn't mind\nCavanaugh I thought it was a great brilliant legal mind disagrees with him about some things but nonetheless should be seated until he saw\nKavanaugh exhibit is defensive and fiery rhetoric\nWhen he came back in to give a more I Believe are caught testimony or to to to face the Senate Judiciary committee and the accusations that were leveled at him the base was flat out bald they smearing live from the Democrats them somehow\nJustice Stevens former Justice Stevens has an issue\nWith Kevin defending himself in his honor and integrity and the decency and its reputation\nAs a man as a father and son as a brother or whatever you as an uncle as a human being Justice Stevens had a problem with that of course Justice Stevens is the same a lunatic that said the second amendment should be repealed\nSupreme Court judge retired saying that he believes a part of our bill of rights should be repealed because why he doesn't like it\nIncredible absolutely incredible here's my response to just deceived I don't care what you think nobody gives a crap what you think nobody cares what you think except the lunatic lap to agree with you\nThey care about what you think intellectually honest Americans don't rabid rabid idiot logs do\nWhat if what if Steve is position where we should have ... is the first amendment would we be paying any of the woods the media be paying any attention to him if that were his position of course not well\nThey would they pay attention to what he said but\nThey have a completely different take on it they'd be attacking him because they value and cherish their First Amendment rights to lie to you and to give you fake news without\nA First Amendment they can't do that can be with God Forbid the second amendment so these are the people that we're talking about why we didn't talk about Kevin yesterday here's what happened today Kavanaugh fifty one to forty nine was voted culture was voted on\nAnd the nomination is proceeding tomorrow\nKavanaugh will be confirmed he will be sworn in and he will be seated on this court\nAnd the rabbit left can't stand it in the meantime it's backfired\nTheir dubious devious evil\nRotten sick twisted\nPathetic the Monica [noise] ah yeah [noise] attempts to destroy this man's to advance their agenda at all costs [noise]\nThey ... as I said in the presidential election twenty sixteen I Believe some people are going to be very very surprised\nWhen they wake up the day after I Believe they're going to be very very surprised to go back to gun would give you a little hint of some of the
