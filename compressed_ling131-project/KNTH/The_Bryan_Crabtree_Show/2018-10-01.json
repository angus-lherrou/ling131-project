the freebie could even walk into the show brother is actually going to be on what I Know short notice for you I Do appreciate it\nYeah absolutely\nHey man I'm let's start with capital because if you we've been going here with our weather here with a W are Hawkins can't wait to get your assessment very quickly I I kind of wrapped it up and tied it together that what we've done owners have been facing from the left for a long time and we know they're capable of because they've been doing it\nTo us for a long time we saw in just a blatant outright despicable display with ... and the politics of personal destruction as it's referred to as wow what are your thoughts on that [noise]\nAh ... um yeah loaded question I Know [laughter]\nYeah I mean I you know I watched the hearing and it was a you know hopefully 'cause I feel like\nBoth for the both of them\nCame across as very sincere mhm I'm On a personal level right or like they both acted the way that\nI Would sort of if I'm looking for someone to act a certain way given what their say like they don't have those kind of thing that I didn't catch all of a Ford stuffed nice so I don't have as much as I ... when I was very angry and but if\nIf you fall being falsely accused of something let her pick I mean you would be angry right I mean\nI I don't get there's still a lot of people out there are like oh yeah she doesn't have the temperament is shows you know because of this and I'm like well no this is exactly how I expect somebody that of course they are also accused [noise] um so yeah it's you know it's hard there there's not\nI Would say that you know if if I was on a jury there certainly nothing that is certainly not enough to convict him of anything\n[noise] um [noise] uh you know there's not enough\nEvidence or something in time for people that were supposedly at this party or upset that they don't remember it or that they weren't there [noise] um one of the day was the one from the woman said she never even let\nCattle at all so I you know I don't know that's it's hard uh I I Will say that I don't\nI don't know that I Know a lot of people are upset about the idea of the FBI or taking the lead to to look into the\nInterview everyone involved [noise] um\n[noise] and while I don't think that will convince\nYou know Ninety nine percent of Democrats his son in law have no real\nImpact on my third one or two I don't know that's really a bad thing either I'm a postal a but only a week [noise] um and maybe that'll ... you know this is a lifetime appointment right so is this just couldn't be sure as possible about what what's going on you know\nI'm old enough to I said this in the first thing I said I said I preface it with a\nSadly I'm old enough to remember Bork being Bork and Keno Thomas Anita Hill that whole debacle I don't think I remember seeing the politics of personal destruction played out\nLike this\nEven ... even even in those cases I and I say that because I Know yeah I I I mentioned this to to both Alan Gottlieb into a W are hockey to people I Know you have the utmost respect for the call ask you to you know if you parachuted in and do nothing about Feinstein do you\nThink oh look at that little old lady how sweet until you realize that this woman had this information sat on it knew what was I mean look this was all orchestrated and you've got you you've got to think\nHow do we get here how do I mean every year to this point\nThere is I think those are really good piece of the Weekly Standard a about all of us are from Johnson last year was ... this played out in the worst possible way for everybody you know because it was the accusations came out in the way that it was so clearly\nUm politically kind of do the most damage but it's created this situation where\nWe're going to do the accuser accused terrorists and the worst possible a situation because it's it's just such a mess it's such a circus or ...\nI'm like well you know any of the hill or no you know I'm not quite as [laughter] I wasn't around that they're having\n'em carrying attention to politics all day long but um I Know that that that came out at least through the course of a background check investigations by the first time around\nOr before the hearings are until you have to have looked into that and then they have the hearings and you know I was a nice to meet with this was even more ridiculous than how that went down on I think if there was a disservice to everyone involved\nUm and it makes it hard for ... for people to to really like being able to be sure about anything\nYeah and again that was done that was done intentionally by Feinstein she knew exactly what she was doing she's no rookie you know I I'll I'll tell you what I told the got Levi ... actually the ... by mentioned in my opening statements in the end segment one of our one Steven\nIs part of the problem when we came to light to me when I was watching Patrick Leahy\nA get ready to go after Kevin on he said and I quote I've been on on this committee for forty four years and I I was like I said well they are you there is part of the problem the fact that you've been on this can be used as you've been in Washington for forty four years\nLet alone this committee is part of the problem I don't believe this is the most designed so that Patrick Leahy can dominate Washington and expect\nVermont for forty four years come on Vermont come on same thing with New York and to be fair there's Republicans do I mentioned the same thing all of that are in Washington these people are the poster children\nFor term limits and when you think about that that all comes into I hate to use the term deep state in that case but will but this is the swamp these people are doing nothing but protecting their own power dishes they expect to be there there's a sense of entitlement there Steven we've got thirty seconds when we come back I Want to start going down the list\nOf some of what you've written\nCrews and Rubio pushing school security funding bill I Want you to tell us what that's all about\nA Washington state we've been talking a lot about that is you know and it should sixteen thirty nine you've got a peace out there from just about four days ago and our and gun rights groups to oppose Washington gun control issue that want to get your perspective on that and then this thing with Phil Bredesen in Tennessee I mentioned is fun to daytime\nShow you got a Democrat out there running around lying about his is at our age rating and the n._r._a. and Chris Cox have stepped out and say do shut up quitting lie about your NRA rating watched the cover was Steven gets asked you from the free beacon in the next segment which is the only one we've got 'em for but we'll be back with him right after this ongoing [noise]\nOr you know improving infrastructure a hardening schools that that sort of thing\nUm hiring new ... a school resource officers are so this is you know an extension of that but yeah I mean if you recall and the debate with a ... says opponent a beta O'Rourke in Texas a Ted Cruz lunch and\nThat he um [noise] you know he's not it's not just about thoughts and prayers he's also offered real world solutions I think this has to another one of those examples of some saying here's another one of my\nUh another one of the things I Want to do and the real world to actually help prevent school shootings um until this would allow us look local schools to use a current federal grant programs um for school safety projects if they choose to\n[noise] it's interesting because the left caused this radical [noise] excuse me they think we should never be doing is using federal funds guns in school protecting our kids but it's okay\nProtect federal banks and federal buildings\nLiterally brick walls after Dick our that's what he does he protects a brick wall with federal money with a firearm but we can't use this money to defend our school's kind of pushback is this going to get if any I maybe I'm wrong I mean do you will get some are worse than we've already seen\nI mean you know it's a good question I Would expect it to be a a more bipartisan no I'm not a lot of the other\nKnow proposals we talk about either of us in the program side or or the control side um just because it's so it's about like it's mostly\nFocused on improving infrastructure hiring police officers more than you know it doesn't have anything to 'em [noise] allow teachers to carrier or anything more controversial\nI Would I Would think it would get more sport I mean the the last time I did this with the stop school both accepted end up passing and a lease on and off so\nI I you know this is something where I think they could pass this could definitely become more\nAnd this yet you but you're right about this because you're talking about armed police officers if you will cruises to distract us has not been exempt from the horror school students all of us have been horrified by the violent attacks on our students these students along with parents\nLocal school board teachers and communities across the country wants to Lucian much like the majority of Texans I Believe the number one thing that make schools safer having more armed police officers on campuses expanding the use of being ran to empower community leaders in education officials with the resources they need strength in our schools higher school safety officers\nAnd keep our children's sake so we'll watch how that flows Florida is doing some of this as well\nHey
