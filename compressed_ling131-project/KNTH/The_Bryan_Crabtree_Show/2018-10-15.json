Miller in Georgia Zell Miller changed party he came to our side but\nDeacon Seaney after the Keating Five thing I think it was actually a penance that he had to pay to the Democratic party because he carried the water on the assault weapons bill\nAnd I believe that that that was why they said we'll let you off the hook on this Keating Five things but you have to quit this pro gun stuff and quit being a friend of the n._r._a. passionate and there you go but right now what we've got\nIn and here's the thing the Kavanaugh bump a because Kavanaugh was eventually a confirmed\nThere are going to be a lot of people that said okay yeah we won that and sit back down in front of the on the couch\nAnd we can't have that you have to stay active you have to stay involved and so I think that the way to do that that what Mitch McConnell could do tomorrow to ensure that that cabinet bump lasts on through November the sex\nIs bring the sheer act to the floor of the Senate for a vote you know everybody what it is it's been passed out of the house it's sitting in the Senate to whatever committee but the sheer act is an omnibus\nDoors hunting fishing land access bill but it also includes the I'm hearing Protection Act\nIt also includes the a lawful purposes act which I think is critically important if you don't know about lawful purposes act you need to look it up that's that's a great bill and I\nJust saw it on the on the years you know ... something else he told me from a because you're right Mitch Mitch McConnell's not going to do\nThat probably not he can although they promised that they would they promised a lot of things yeah man that's the biggest Republican problem is that they make promises that they don't keep in our guys say\nHell with them they don't do what they promised to do\nMitch McConnell could bring up concealed carry reciprocity if you want it to absolutely he could do it today and it would have the same effect springing up to share it with ... he couldn't move that over if I'm not mistaken could he not bring those two cars you reconcile those two together\nActually the I Believe I don't know from a vigil standpoint if I go to ... I'm trying to remember whether that was incorporated into what was passed out of the house I don't think it was but and and even\nOne of the tactics\nWhen you get into inside baseball one of the things that I suggested would bring the national reciprocity act into the sheer act and then negotiate it back away again\nSo that you get the sheer act because you say okay I'll tell you what will drop your ... give us that and and then we can come back and get that again\nYou're telling procedural strategy is too far above in D.C at this stage of the game you know why and I said I mean obviously Mitch McConnell knows what he can do [noise]\nHere's the problem that we have right now you bring guns up right now the liberal heads are going to pop like that yes right now they'll go absolutely crazy and you know what that would do is more than likely I Believe Mitch McConnell might think this was ... there'll be even more which could be\nObviously we'd be straddling a very fine line there obviously if you're going to do it I don't think conceal carry reciprocity would be the way to go they're going to come after that and not see gun bill but the ... is is absolutely brilliant idea a boy\nWho do you write who do you call it looks tell people where to go to get that done at least ask\nWell you need to call your your senators both of them call McConnell's off the call McConnell's office um I used to know to to\nTo to uh now I'm not going to do it\nI was getting a you can remember that here on live radio sitting at a table and he's the CDO you're you're more of a patriots than I thought you were ... I read it off after\nYour piece see last year or just in an impromptu speech and rattled it often somebody checked me and yes I was right but I'm not going to take that chance right now but just look up a congressional switchboard right and you can ask for whoever you want to talk to at the congressional switch board and they will route you there\nAnd um [noise] that's [noise] that's worth doing send them an email they've all got their messaging apps you just look 'em up and and send them an email\nUm but tell them we want to gun vote bring the gun vote it could help people like like a\nJon Tester in Montana yeah well if if test or decided well hey I've got to vote for this it could help him survive\nBut at the same time it would keep Chuck Schumer out of the majority leader spot have signed on to critical now we're talking about the ... the incredibly fine tactical nuance us involved here\nThat what you just mentioned you know it could help Jon Tester survive but it could do this to Schumer we're we're in we're in a scary place in American politics today are very dangerous place in American politics today\nSo let's get started what happened yesterday on armed American radios huge monster broadcast Alan Gottlieb let me tell you something about Alan Gottlieb\nCan't say enough about the man mentioned it last night I Believe in the third our of the show when I was just kind of recapping a little bit of\nOf what we heard from himself in front of you are Hawkins but I got to tell you this because you need to know this Alan Gottlieb is the single most influential and powerful man alive today in\nThe gun rights movement that's a bold statement to make it's also very very true if you listen to him yesterday whenever you hear Alan talk you have to dig a little beep and pick up on some of what he says because sometimes it just goes right past you like when he said yesterday on the broadcast in our one\nWhy I've talked to the White House about okay he talks to the White House\nAbout the Supreme Court to the White House use your temper counsel on Supreme Court picks think about what you heard him say yesterday since we were talking to here\nThey seek his guide when it comes to selection of a potential justice and with Alan Gottlieb tells you that he's content\nThe other names on the list you can believe that I mean you can absolutely take that to the back ... when he is confident I'm confident I Want you to know that because I Know you turn to this program and to me to hear some of these things and I want you to\nOh that when I hear him say that I'm confident and if I'm confident I Want you to be confident very very important to the enemies of our freedom are not going away anytime soon\nI've got to pull this up for you this just absolutely drove me crazy I Believe this was on Drudge Report\nIn fact I Know it was I'm going to pose up for you right now Colin Powell rich Trump on immigration NATO anti press rhetoric the world can't believe what's happening he was on CNN with that goof off for ...\nAnd his other panelists was Madeleine Albright what what does that tell you right there can you take this guy serious at this stage of the game I don't think so you heard what Colin Powell said during the twenty sixteen election\nYeah he was all took a shirt because George Bush and the bushes were being hammered and and Jeb Bush was being hammered and I don't think Colin Powell like that very much too bad for Colin Powell Colin Powell puts himself out as a Republican bought Colin Powell is is an establishment guy\nHe is a flat out moderate establishment guy can flip either way with the wind blows he's just this political animal of a bygone era let me let me give you some exact details just what I'm Talking about here very important I you know ... when you read these things you got to understand that stuff\nExample power Republican who was maintained a low profile during the Trump Administration called out\nQuote what we are not doing as the United states of America First of all I don't recall anybody asking him but he said what are we doing we're walking away from agreements were walking away from alliances well I Would correct Colin Powell\nWe're not walking away from agreements were walking away from bad agreement or as Trump would say bad deals were walking away from them we are fixing that\nNumber one number two he says we're walking away from alliances were not walking away from alliances we are reshaping our alliance as we are fixing our alliances\nIn large part we are fixing alliances that's understandable why he's upset because he put together some of these alliances years ago he's watching them unravel because they were bad deals\nTwenty Thirty years down the road this stuff becomes obvious things need to be changed Colin Powell doesn't like that his name is on some of these things so it's understandable why he took his hurt\nMadeleine Albright same thing going back to the Clintons these people put together a lousy crappy deal that have been costing America hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars over the years\nWe've been screwed because of some of these deals that let's give them the benefit of the doubt maybe it was a good deal at that time\nLet's just leave it at that ... was a good deal at that time was Iran a good deal no I mean I don't I'm not sure what Colin Powell is talking about here\nBut we all know what Trump is doing we're walking away from agreements\nWhat does this have to do with this had everything to do with guns this guy's puts himself out as a Republican he's an establishment guy he's an establishment guy that would come after your guns in fact well okay I I really don't have a whole lot of time to go into that but let's do it right now\nColin Powell well let's talk about Colin Powell in two thousand Thirteen on meet the press shortly after Sandy Hook\nColin Powell was asked by you know\nOn meet the ... yeah exactly this is the bastion of objectivity Colin Powell was asked get this I Love these left leaning questions right just how they hit you from what what kind of further restrictions wash must we put\nYou see your show obviously the basis is we have to have further restrictions what kind should we have that was the premise that was the basic question was asked\nWhat further restrictions do we need to have put in place\nColin Powell did his typical hey I'm a I'm a Second Amendment guy\nI support the second amendment I'm I'm well studied on the second amendment he said he understands a well regulated militia and he's a gun guy himself every but we should be able to have done\nBut he said he saw no reason for an American citizen to own a Bush mash to remember it was a Bush master a are Fifteen that the lunatic who murdered his mother and went into the school used to murder those twenty plus kids and teachers\nColin Powell saw no problem with registration and why can't we register\nHe saw no problem with testing for both commercials sales and private sales he has no problem restricting you are right you can go watch that video on YouTube I'm not going to pull it up and play it I did go through it when I was doing some research for the show earlier this morning and it's Colin Powell views on gun control go pulled up Google it up\nYou'll see him on meet the press telling you everything you need to know about Colin Powell that's why this has everything to do with guns remember Colin Powell is irrelevant now\nWhy are we even talking about him\nHe's irrelevant yeah we're talking about him today because the left dug him up\nAnd we have to we will not let these statements go unchallenged we can't other shows do other shows blow right past the stuff I tie their stuff together for you why because it's on the head of tons of ... of smack in the center column in the Drudge Report today\nWe have to talk about it and talk about it we will we are going to go back through some more of a show remember it all started with we're walking away from agreements no we're not we're fixing agreements as Trump which they were fixing deal we're making new deal because deals you may suck\nThat's why that's what we're doing well of course he doesn't like that we're walking away from alliance has no or not the alliances you made suck we're fixing those alliances it's understandable why he wouldn't want to do that\nHe was asked by a car you do you think this president can be a moral leader for the world and LBJ said I don't know that he can do that because right now that is not the way he's acting recently it has become me the president as opposed to we the people\nThis is Colin Powell lecturing us today\nOn Donald Trump\nAnd here's what power said we're going to talk about this for a while I'm going to go into this a little bit longer than I anticipated because it's way too fun and because it has everything to do with your guns this is the problem with this part of the establishment in Washington\nAnd plus it's just fun to talk about on a Monday\nHow can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of of American he said he asked\nHasn't he read the first amendment you're not supposed to like everything the process or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech I Hope the president can come to the realization that you should really stop insulting people power that I use this two years ago\nWhen I said I could not vote for him in the twenty sixteen election why\nGet this just weren't going to break down to the next segment\nHe insulted everybody he insulted African Americans insulted women he insulted immigrants he insulted our best friends around the world all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debate I don't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United states but I don't see anything that's changed in the last\nTwo years Albright added that Trump's rhetoric about America being a victim is\nUp that's what Trump is fixing today\nAmerica First because Powell and his cronies his un global lovers who screwed everything up and shipped millions of jobs over this is what prompted fixing\nThat's why you acting the way he's acting to use house terms\nRecently it became me the president as opposed to we the people that's not true we the people are the American people not we the people of the global world of earth\nWe the people Powell mean us America\n\nAnd power says and you see things that should not be happening how can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of American because the media is the enemy of Americans call and you don't like to hear that\nI've been the you know I Wonder if Trump got that for me yeah right bald bald question huh I've been calling the ... the ... the the the greatest threat to American for years on armed American radio\nAnd it's great to see Trump rip them apart because they are a threat\nHe's metaphorically speaking how not an enemy on a battlefield but a battlefield of ideas metaphorically speaking to understand that\nBecause they are the enemy of half of this country probably more than half\nBecause of their left wing propaganda their gun grabbing gun hating for example for the purposes of this show I can immediately point to that as an example\n\nFor their propagandize and weaponize ...\n\nWhatever topic it is that they choose to use against us whether it's Christianity whether it's done right I could go on and on but again for the purpose of this problem is is armed American radio would it be difficult for me to point out to you\nHow much the press you want me to go I don't have enough time in a year to go over the anti gun stores have uncovered them with you for years\n\nThat's why he's doing it Colin Powell hasn't he read the first amendment you are not supposed to like everything the press says or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech it works both ways\nOn\nLast year that establishment guy\nGood habits were going to have oh I'm going to just go oh I'm going to keep going through this this has everything to do with your guns back after this [noise]\n[noise] sarin news time round rock strip FEMA chief Brock Long toward the damage and
