email that said okay this is an interesting you know\nLet me or if this up who set this up for a while I was in Arizona I was talking when I was at the ... this broadcast the monster broadcast Sunday broadcast last week\nIn Arizona at the Sheraton I was talking about how Arizona is widely regarded as the most unfriendly said the country and it is and that's because of the method of care you don't need a permit you go to Carrie abiding citizen to go to Arizona you carry your gun simple as that\nCarrier don't take it with you the Arizona feel free however but\nI made the comment I see more no guns allowed sides in Arizona on one trip that I see in Thirteen Years of living in Georgia okay there's a reason now here's here's the email Matthew Murphy writes in March to soldiers now Second Amendment city on yesterday's daily defense you mentioned that there were all kinds of signs around to some\nSaying no guns allowed how can I claim\nBe a Second Amendment city went all the establishment say no guns allowed now let me give you my answer they don't want to turn it over to you\nMatthew that's a great question I've heard it before here's why it's Arizona State law it comes from alcohol serving establishment predominantly I don't think I've ever seen a no gun side at a at a at a at a stepson\nOr gift shop if you will it only seems to be in restaurants that serve alcohol now those signs in Arizona do carry the weight of law\nWhat I mean by that is if you walk into that establishment in violation of it sit at the bar and have a beer you can't be charged with criminal trespass\nImmediately and the signage in Arizona doesn't have to meet a certain standard some owners of those establishment for whatever reason\nAs their owners have decided they don't want you when you can walk away now I have spoken and I won't name two of the popular bars in in Tucson I won't name them by name doesn't matter Johnny but I've spoken owners of them on both occasions and both times I got the same response we would prefer you didn't but if you want to\nUh let us know and we'll check it for you that one Arizona law for ... if\nIf if a business tells you and has a sign that says no guns allowed they by law in Arizona have to provide you\nA safe storage for that firearm while you were there most business [noise] believe it or not are not in compliance of that but that's why that is left the alcohol serving establishment Johnny you want to take that email from their\n... and you're right Omar pretty much and realize that you have we have people from all over the country over the world come so style and and some of these folks are are not familiar\nWith guns and they they want to make a statement and you also you've got some people down there but just on the Gulf trouble so so\nWhat that is the insurance policy against someone told me and drinking too much and having a fire or maybe not knowing how to handle it again the er visits or someone that might not be familiar with was just how this goes\nAnd and you know personally and the the law is that if you you can go if there's not a sign on there you can take your gun on a ball boy says ... alternate\nBut you're not you're but but you can't drink you've got to say a ... if you got you know drink and so that's that's how that works\nAnd out of sight and I'm going to be there to cause I got to throw this disclaimer into Johnny and that is Arizona is a constitutional carry permit let's carry state you do not need a permit in hand to carry a firearm in Arizona however but in order to carry into an establishment that serves alcohol\nYou must have a permanent constitutional Kerry is probably a permanent let's carry is prohibited sea so Matthew I what I'm telling you hear is it's the it's really state law that's in play here and not every bar and restaurant has that side\nThat's right but there are a lot to do and and when you're in an area like Scottsdale like combat\nWhich is lots of bars and great restaurants you tend to see more of them in Arizona because state law allows for that and it does carry the weight of law you still have anti people out there even though it's a gun friendly state so I Hope I answered your question Johnny did you want to put an exclamation point on that\nI think he did really well and you're right and personally I just prefer not to freak all the places they'll go well maybe by ... on it\nYou know\nThe simple but I'll go to where I can because again the the bad\nPeople to the criminal is not going to build a ... you know a a isn't it amazing how we see countries that\nThat wall to disarm the citizens of the people go out there with their little signs that say oh I Want my freedom them but you know that sounds don't work very well just bullets are now the water real food that amazing\nYeah they also don't work out they don't work well against no food or drink and studio either hold on one second\n[laughter]\nI was getting a little bit thirsty there so yeah there you go about ice cold water and you know a lot of these expensive equipment here Johnny as you well know\nNow there is\nThere is it W. R. wrote this up on the twenty first which is today and I wanted to get your opinion on this with the last minute that we have gun control group urging people to Texas authorities and report armed citizen and the name of the group is guns down America let's see where they're at USA Today quoted guns down in America director ...\n... saying given the troubling political rhetoric we've seen over the last two years and the guns are far too easy to obtain this campaign will help the majority of Americans who believe there are fewer guns keep us safer\nFight back and cast their ballots free from fear of intimidation well you know I just read that for the first time here's what it ought to say given the troubling political rhetoric from the left that we've seen over the last two years and that bonds are far too scary for those on the left\nThis campaign will help the majority of ... who don't trust Americans feel a little better my response to that is go to hell what's your response to that one\nI'll tell you what\n... we have a special program and as coal adopt the ... if you have a go out there they're struggling you at home and and you feel like it's a problem because we have families waiting to accept your\nEgo certainly you can head over to Johnny Rowe dot com and find the concept of what is that well\nHey Johnny I Can't wait to have you back I have thoroughly enjoyed our time together thank you thank you're sticking with me for the extra hour I Can't wait to bring you back listen I have a feeling we're gonna make each other famous\nLittle ... out there and let's go right
