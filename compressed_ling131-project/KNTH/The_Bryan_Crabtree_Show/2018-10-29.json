Hawkins limp let's go to\nWhat you wrote about a student's bill of rights\nFor state for community so I'd read this in in its entirety able to go through each one with you this is the stupidest thing I think I've ever seen in my life and what it is it's just a bunch of people getting together to put something on paper and feel like they did something I Can't think of any other reason for this can you\nKnow no it's it's it you could tell was written about kids it's ignorance\nEstablishes school safety committee whose meetings are open to the public at every school\nEqually compose the student's parents than faculty so a safety committee I don't know what that means they don't tell us number to provide immediate access to qualified counselors and safe space is a good lord\nFor students of all demographics at all levels of education off case you didn't realize that this was coming at you from the left you big left books\nYou had to do is look at safe spaces was that a giveaway to you too\nRight yeah well I mean this is laughable it gets worse so that's the worst part\nIt does go here encourage all school personnel to foster positive relationships at all levels of education\nOkay\nProvide professional development around mental health awareness and interventions were students parents than faculty provide professional development around mental health awareness I don't know what that means to you by chance\nNo I don't I don't think they do either\nOkay but it sounded kind of important the way it was written number five require cultural competency require cotton and listen to this careful require cultural competency and ... trainings each\nQuarter for law enforcement provided by the local police department in conjunction with equity training organization and companies a boy do an attack on that one\nWas just great but it's more of the list said what the left doing the police the bad guys they're the ones the ... the escalate no this I rarely do I see a police video where I think that also really messed up normally you see a police video they tell the guy put your hands up\nStay still don't lose\nThe guy who's he stands up puts his hands his pockets reach for something to get shot\nAt just how that works right or if you're that ignorant a you know should just you shouldn't be in a car driving around and you may have a chance so they ... to ... to to talk to him so yeah this makes police look like they're the calls the problem and that's a clock classical left his position\nIt certainly is and it was a give away with cultural competency that was the give away right there before the rest of that or whatever it did [noise] excuse me as I fight the cold I Apologize right now\nAnd tell you one of the things that cultural competency see they don't since they're left is they're not capable than we thought but if they were they'd have to realize that whose culture do\nYou have to be competent in they didn't find it because it did I mean the cultural competence a competency in the culture that we see in Saudi Arabia where only if we can grab\nTheirs or is it the culture in another Middle East company\nCountry where women have to be completely covered only their eyes could show is that going to be competent in or do we need to be competent in a culture where they they don't love the neighbors but they make me which culture are they talking about the they want it because they want to be multi cultural embrace everybody so who decides which culture camp that's another mess in the city\nIt is and it's a great question to ask and one that they won't have an answer to if you were to ask them that no one asked them that\nIn the meeting where they discussed is nobody brought that up that's why it's there but you know something else I Want to point out about these police officers do that maybe these kids might want to think about and that is sometimes like happened here in the state of Georgia last week sometimes officers simply approach a vehicle\nAnd get shot and killed as they're approaching the vehicle sometimes that happens sometimes at Georgia State highway patrol officer pulls a vehicle over on interstate Seventy five and gets shot at\nIn this case had an opportunity to fire back sometimes officers are murdered in the line of duty before they even have an opportunity to say Hi how

whistle and by that I mean\nThey had little phrases that when people hear him one day no one left us just telling another left to say I want to you you're one of me and that's all they're doing so they want to work in all these words velocity and magazine capacity and bought stock it doesn't matter if they don't go together\nIt doesn't matter if they won't work late to the other to form an

was great to have her here\nAnd also of course a W. R. Hawkins and the second hour where we went through and had a lot of fun with him to going through all of his writings at Breitbart of course I opened up the pro both programs or excuse me both previous hours with my surprise call I got this morning from\nBritish radio and Kevin McGuire show over on LDC ah obese I guess it does it there'll be see let me just double check and make sure I'm getting the right one or it is yeah L L L BC\nAnd Kevin of course a very popular journalist and longtime radio guy and journalists and pundits over in Great Britain and he says anti ... days long I've gone round and round with them before\nThey called me out of the blue or Fifteen minutes later I found myself on the air with him earlier this morning and as expected you knew he was going to try to stop me from a lesson that's exactly what he did he can't stand my response was and he he can't argue and of course he did what most liberals who lose arguments do he got\nMad and hung up on me and then attacked me\nAfter I was off the air with him apparently and I know that from reading the column that made\nSome news over there today there's a column Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporters do read it Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter and down at the bottom you'll you'll enjoy the column and there's also a link to about a minute and twenty four seconds of much segment with him I played it in the first hour\nAnd then at the bottom is a comment about how the host was incredibly rude and ignorant and that after I thoroughly\nDestroyed him in his argument slam down the phone and went into a tirade behind my back and he\nOf course the commenter also mentioned that I was in the the American way of course was polite courteous and gracious throughout and you know it's interesting because I've done a lot of British media over the years a lot some of it some of it the attack ambush style stuff from others they genuinely they they they are fascinated\nBy our quote unquote what they refer to as our gun culture in America they should we do not understand it and that's understandable from people who have been disarmed and now a generation removed in Great Britain\nAnd this is what they always warn us about gun rights supporters in Britain of always warn me over the years in St Louis in Australia which got to realize in Great Britain now there was a new generation who have never known the right to bear arms\nIn Great Britain at all from the time they were born\nAnd those people it's not unusual to have them a little flustered by our culture and many of them are fascinated of course others are just haters they're out there but it was a really fun while fast moving two hours and\nI got Sean were good to go now right we've got John on the air so let's go now to Dr Jon ...\nAuthor of many books more guns less crime and the rest of them I'll let him tell ya and of course a frequent guest on the radio program and someone that you see\nTalking about the numbers and crunching the numbers and talking about the same things we talk about here but in a little bit more methodical and economic way to present these numbers as facts John welcome to the program is always a pleasure to have you thank you for joining me today\nGood talking to\nSay I know you've gone round and round with some of the Brits over there and their media including Piers Morgan do you ever get frustrated by him\nNo I mean [noise] uh I get for just gotten used to it over time I suppose that's done much pointing get angry and frustrated by it but you know it's\nIt's kind of wanted to stay animal people keep on hearing the same things so there's no one really to kind of explained the logical arguments to them over there and uh you know you think academia is bad here probably even worse there\nI have to you pin to tweet up and you're right about that it's it's fun I've I've done some television an some radio over there in the no doubt in my mind I'll be hearing from them on Monday or Tuesday or even before this day is over believe it or not because of the time she's or wouldn't be shocked so listen I'll keep you posted you can follow me on Twitter at a our mark and we'll put the links up just like we did to this one\nJohn you end up on your page and I was very important\nBut she PR see crime prevention Research Center but some of your research how uh [noise] excuse me how a botched study fooled the world about the U.S share of mass public shootings us rate is lower than global average you try to tell that to somebody overseas they tell you you're\nNot cases ... Phyllis in on that what did you\nWrite well we had a study that was put out a couple of months ago few months ago now or that basically we went through and collected mass public shootings around the world are we had to hire people in different countries in order to try to help us out on that\nAnd um you know it's\nYou know people get the impression of how the United states stands by let's say the media stories we hear cases like a horrible tragedy that happened yesterday and a Pittsburgh\nUh but we don't hear about cases that have happened in the rest of the world so just this last week or there was a large mass public shootings in uh the Crimea which is now part of Russia\nVery strict gun control laws there and are they at a school shooting at a college student went and shot up the place a shot to death Twenty one other people and wounded Seventy\nBut my guess is a very few Americans heard about that story I mean that one guy war media attention\nIn most cases most it it sort of ended up look students\nAround the world uh you know or if you have a big school shooting in Germany uh you'll be lucky to get a you know one minute brief on the news on that and that will be it and they'll disappear\nOr the Europe gets much more news coverage and mass public shootings in the United states and uh we get in it then you're even gets on other attacks and other countries in Europe\nAnd uh you know it has a big news coverage has a big impact on people's perceptions of a of you know the rates at which these things are crazy so I'm not I'm not surprised but that's resulted in our paper in our research\nWe go through and with the case for all the different countries so people and we live news sources so people can go and check those things themselves if they go to our website\nAt crime research dot org and click on the button at the top that says research they'll go down and among our various research projects so the uh the the data and the project but we did on their public shootings around the world\nYeah CPR she original research I'm On the page by the way listener and I I Want you to go there when you soon as you get a chance it's real simple crime research dot org crime research dot org and when you click on the research button which I've done many many times you will see CPR she original research and it is just filled\nWith data that you can use for whatever purpose just for your for just because you want to gain the knowledge maybe you want to answer a question maybe you're preparing for a debate whatever the case may be it's all here for you\nAnd you know it's interesting John ... we're going to get ready to take a break your second but when I see these numbers and I look at\nThis the first thing we get hit with and I have before myself is along the lines of a dozen happiness frequent as it does in America you got the highest homicide rate in the nation it's crazy around the world and that's not true when we come back after this break coming up maybe you can address that\nAnd I what brought that to my attention was a tweet that you put out earlier today showing with Ninety six percent of them\nFly to pick easy targets\nYou know they may be kooky or dumb or whatever but they're not so stupid that they don't try to pick easier targets in the same thing is true with the\nMass public shooters they may be crazy in some sense but they're not stupid they want to try to kill us like people as possible so they want to go to a a a venue where they know victims aren't going to be able to defend themselves because they know the longer it takes\nTo somebody at the theme to arrive with a gun and the more people they're going to be able to kill\nSo yeah I guess I Am frustrated but I'm frustrated because on one side they seem to think that they have all the moral authority that they're they call for laws that either had no beneficial effect or actually cause harm\nYou know these gun free zones are wanting to sample of that and yet when a when these attacks occur they want to posture as all people who are willing to do something well my responses\nYeah you're willing to do something but let's do something that actually works let's do something that actually matters it wouldn't make people safe\nYou know\nThere's so much meat in what you just that I could take the rest of the hour whether it was quickly I'll go to a point out the media when you were talking about the media\nThey won't because it doesn't fit their narrative that's why they leave out that portion of course you know this was from talking to you what you heard John Say about the Kroger shooting we're going to be talking about that on armed American radios daily defense tomorrow in fact and probably on Tuesday as well but as John Locke pointed out on his Twitter page you can follow him\nAt John are locked junior on Twitter by the way to get all this information real time as he puts out it's a great great Twitter page what he points out Stephanopoulos doing the same thing in ... just eliminating the fact\nThat a white concealed carry permit hold her in the attack and he goes on to tell you in a tweet in what comedy which doing it that he wrote about how the headline could be totally different\nHow it could be white concealed carry permit holders saves blacks from shoot I mean it's just that the media narrative your listener\nIs what drives us we've talked about this together for so many years and it is very dangerous the way the game that they are playing in the way the media handles this for a lot of different reasons when we come back\nI Want to ask John ... opinion about what the Pittsburgh mayor that and I do want to go back to the homicide rates where we stand will cover that I promise we'll get there when we come back with John ...\nFrom crime research dot O.
