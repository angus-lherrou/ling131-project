Wells Fargo for crying out loud of course they're going to lend the gun industry some money good habits what's that you you say what what Sean you said\nI bank rhythm you back with them yeah yeah I've got some business interests with them over there a little bit All right let's go back to somebody I think I just think that's fascinating stuff and I appreciate your writing about it in the history of it is it's fascinating to me All right we've got the armed customer over there we talked a little bit about him I you know I got to go to\nA this guy is Seventy four year old Vietnam vet\nWho ... what\nIt is this guy shot seven cops AWOL Hawkins seven cops\nRight killed one wounded six\nRight do we know anything about this at this stage of the game\nYou know uh you know I I'll probably know in the morning a cabin I'll just sucked up the air so much\nFriday Saturday it certainly certainly did go ahead\nBut yeah this uh\nThis is a weird situation they were going to that house circle worn it a very upscale neighborhood the war was not for the Seventy four year old Vietnam that it was four twenty seven year old male and the house or in the war was on suspicion of child molestation or or child sexual assault something like that\nJust so weird to me that\nThe person who was not the target of the search warrant open fire on the place and uh you know there's there are dogs to be connected here but um [noise] that's one of those stories it sound news works it's one of those stories it happened\nUh it just happened to happen the day before the cabin out just suck the era of the room and ah so everything everything other than Kavanaugh was getting ... so let's just put it that way and so uh I'll Try to do a follow on this\nI'd be curious to find out about what some of those dots are it's a very strange story and we've got seven police officers in South Carolina that was shot one killed one of them Thirty years on the job unbelievable I don't want to find out what happened there All right\nI'm I'm just curious or Russia collusion Mahler oh where's that Ben\nHaven't heard of ... backed\nUp that bring that back up [laughter]\nNow that Kevin though you know once they get ... get I get done stand in in the kitchen or wherever they are and then within themselves with all that changed or whatever else they're doing once they're done with that they'll go back to Russia collusion and all the stuff that's not real or just to try to keep it going but\nYou know what I'm gonna say mark you remember during Sandy Hook a ... that you remember I I hate to use the word but there was a fear on the part of gun owners that\nMy right you know there was another one\nWho's going to push through gun control but they they overreached as usual and they showed their hands are probably figured out hold on these people are in Africa also make a difference there just after more control I think\nThey did the same thing with what they did the cabin though and I believe that when they circled back for Russia now than when they circle back for all the other things now they're going to have a lot of trouble getting any kind of sympathy especially the ... they weren't getting maybe say even six seven weeks ago it's over\nThere and I I think they're barely proven that they're just a bunch of animals that's all well\nAnd I think their credibility I think they've shown that their credibility ... as I talked about it and you know this you do too I Know you talk about it on your podcast and the two of us are spoken about with Curt Schilling on his show we've discussed it here on this program over the last couple of years\nAnd that is that the Democrats in the media in particular has shown that all they're doing is driving and pushing a narrative they they're they're they're they're shaping the news the way they want you to get it then they move away from it they don't cover it anymore because they choose not to and then all of a sudden they're going to try to go back and I think what's going to happen is\nThat the rest of America who doesn't have their head in this stuff neck deep like we do every single day is going to look back when they circle back around to it saying well wait a minute here\nUm\nIs that news again their credibility is in the toilet and I think it's very difficult for them to drudge that back up and I'm sure Miller a mother is probably real ticked off about that because his Fifteen\nAnd it's probably about up right so there's a there's a link\nTo it for those who are paying attention not only really to say it but I'm the say it in Trump's winter\nTripling the election Trump got Gorsuch on Trump got Kevin on Trump cut our taxes truckers build up the military to ... unbelievable scrapes levels on and on I use my mocked him when he tried to use tariffs well he doesn't understand economic and then what happened\nThat he's got a deal Canada and Mexico and China's coming around but he doesn't understand the sea so Trump is a winter and I think that combined with the fact that the Democrats just show themselves to build destroy a good human\nTo achieve their agenda I just think that they're going to have trouble getting ready to buy for them now\nInforming and Andrew Jamie responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast theories you are a host of farms American radio\nBars walls are\nRadios monster cast powers to read about Allen got leaving our one of your ... an\nHour to they bring it don't do they always do let me tell you something just gets lost on us a lot I think because we begin I Know I Do as a human being you probably do as a human being you begin to take certain things for granted Alan Gottlieb and W. R. Hawkins are two of the best of the best at what they do\nAlan Gottlieb is by far the single most\nImportant single most important\nLiving breathing fighter on behalf of the right to keep and bear arms then there is anywhere else on planet earth today no one else is more important no one is more important than Allen got leaving we're proud to have him as a regular contributor it W. R. hawk is also with Breitbart News award winning\nPutting up the facts counterbalance thing and it's such a state W are there are many many many writers out there for many organizations many outlets and all the good conservative writers out there but he W our\nFocus is unlike the Rashed strictly and purely on the right to keep and bear arms and we have him here also\nAs a regular political column a political analyst every single week here on armed American radio very proud of that these guys do this on their own time\nAnd they can bring so that they can bring their writings and their words of wisdom and their information to you to help act as a counterweight to all the garbage that we hear so obviously these two guys I mean a lot to me let me tell you a little bit about what's happening next weekend I Will be at ...\nArizona citizens defense league meeting in Phoenix on Saturday and on flying out on friday and just about five or six days five days and so that's assuming that the\nNewest tropical storm looks like it's going to be way past me by friday anyway but nonetheless you never know\nHopefully everything works out okay and I get out of here on time where I'm going with this is I I leave for Phoenix friday mid morning get out to Phoenix late in the morning\nAnd I have some meetings scheduled for friday afternoon radio station in a number of other a number of other things I've got a cover while I'm Out there quickly and then Saturday I Will be attending the Arizona citizens defense league meeting\nIn the morning most of the day anyway it's a lunch in meeting this thing is unbelievable off you're attending this if you're listening now in Arizona in any station that plays in Arizona where you're coming out to that ... that meeting and beautiful Phoenix I look forward to meeting you ... the first time\nI've been asked to speak at this meeting I Love it I kind of invite myself I'm a ... I'm a lifelong member or a lifetime member of the studio and I really look forward to this grassroots meeting this is one of the organizations\nOutside Georgia Carey movie V. C. CDL\nVirginia citizens the the the L Virginia's defensively ABC deals that caught myself with this\nBut the the the the group at Arizona citizens defense lake fights a legislative battle expertly unlike any other group I've ever met except for maybe Virginia citizens defensively\nAnd Georgia to carry it to be honest with you I think all three of these organizations have fed off of themselves now on Saturday when I'm Out there I'm bringing a surprise with me to the meeting that's all I can tell you if you're coming and you're listening to my voice now\nYou'll want to be there and you want to come up and shake my pie promise you the [laughter] that much I can tell you but here's what's fun\nAbout going to Arizona next week I have an opportunity next week to use some new technology really attached I gave it a I gave it a workout at the gun rights policy conference and was able to get\nGas on the program by taping them live\nAs they were coming off of the stage at the gun rights policy conference and then bringing you the interviews\nThe next day on armed American radios monster broadcast I Am going to attempt to do the same thing in Arizona wow I Am there on Saturday there ... there are just some amazing people who otherwise I Would not have an opportunity to bring on this program\nFor lots of different reasons\nThat I Will be able to sit down with face to face and the beauty of it is the new technology I'm referring to provide incredible studio quality audio on site\nUsing simply my laptop and a couple\nOf little very cool gadgets\nAnd some of the the of course the professional studio microphones to utilize\nBut by ... by by taping this day of us I don't need to worry about using the studio in and bring guests on by having them contact in the studio were able to do this one on one and it opens up tremendous possibilities\nFor me and the program down the road to bring you a lot of guest appearances that we might not been able have been able to make to work out for example\nNormally to taper broadcast which we don't generally like to do I want to tape it a specific interview to bring to you because maybe somebody can't be at a certain time and can't be on the air with me at a certain time we're able to tape that segment\nThat requires an individual to be in the studio in Dallas that requires me to be available and it requires them to be available at a certain specific time everybody's schedules have to be expensive and it's time consuming what\nWe have at our fingertips now you gotta look technology has the ability to eliminate having to utilize that studio and now bring that studio directly to my laptop and enabled me to bring to you [noise] studio super high quality\nAudio worthy of a national broadcast on two hundred plus radio station we would do it no other way hence why we haven't done it unless we had the studio available to us we can now do these things so I Am hopeful\nThat really what worked out for CGI our PC we're going to elevate that to the next level out as I'm Out of the Arizona citizens defensively meeting here's the fun part of absolutely no idea\nWho I'm going to bring to you one person in particular works that room like a champ\nAnd I hope to bring to you would be of course Allen Corwin I Will be spending some time without Corwin at the Arizona citizens defensively meeting he's very busy working in stable doing his thing is you can imagine he's very very popular at the studio meetings and they have to gun shows the crossroads of the west coast\nBut I Am hopeful to be able to bring Allen Corwin to you among many others while I'm Out there for the Sunday show yeah and that's the fun part I don't even know now start working on your progress is\nBut right now I don't even know there are so many amazing voices and I don't even know yet who some of the special guests are\nOut there who are going to be some of the keynote two or three keynote speakers are going to be\nI'm One of probably thirty people that will be taking the stage out there I'll be given about ten minutes but I'm there to see the keynote just like everybody else has and I don't know who's going to be and I'll find out tomorrow when I started doing some more research I haven't had time to really dig into that I'll be looking into that this week but whoever it is\nI mean I've sat next to you know ... a former state's attorney general out there at those lunch and meetings before who are nationally known that worked in presidential administrations et cetera state senators\nOr you know Congress people are so who knows I have no idea Arizona citizens defense week is a powerful organization that makes waves across the country and then listen let me tell you something I could you not what I tell you that they are at the tip of the spear\nIn this fight against Michael Bloomberg New York's obnoxious multi billionaire gun grabber and gun hater who surrounds himself with private security arm to the teeth\nWhile he cries your right to harm yourself to defend yourself and your family hypocrite is does the word that doesn't even got satellite radio moment word is what I Would have to use to define Michael Bloomberg at that point but have these studios at the tip of that fear\nThey have taken some preemptive strikes\nIn their legislation in with legislation\nIn their state legislature over the last couple of years because they know that Bloomberg has Arizona in the crosshairs coming up in twenty Eighteen through twenty twenty and a lot of it is going to be dependent on what happens in Washington state was sixteen thirty nine about initiative up there because Arizona is also a ballot initiative state\nAs Florida you have got to be paying attention if you are one of the Twenty one states across the country\nThat has is that is a ballot initiative state you had better be paying attention\nArizona knows they're dead center of the cross hairs and they've been working to thwart Bloomberg in advance of what they know it was coming for the previous two years\nSo I'm fascinated to find out more when I get up to Phoenix this coming weekend so it's going to be one heck of a show out there at easy CDL and I'm looking forward to bringing you some voices that don't generally come on this program put this new technologies and I have\nEnables me to bring super high quality high definition audio to you as if they were sitting in a studio with me are calling into the studio in fact it's even better because they're my up with me so it it just is is the top of the line top notch stuff cutting edge and I'm proud to have it at my at my fingertips for you so\nAh next weekend that's what's happening coming up in the next three quarters we're going next three segments I'm Sorry for that three quarters of an hour we're going to go over what happened this previous week and talk about just how important it really was but\nI Want to get a little bit personal with you\nIn the next segment because this weekend marks one year at armed American radio ranch when I sat\nDown with you and opened up with you about a very emotional topic that was going on in our lives particularly my wife and my family here and it has been exactly one year this weekend so when we come back I Want to kind of use that as a reminder as we segue into the rest of the program\nAnd the things that I went through as a as a husband has a father I more than happy to open up to you reach out to me please mark at armed American radio dot O. R. G. as many many many of you have and I'll be more than happy to help you in any way that I can you help me and trust me\nI've got your back on this one I bought my whole family does so hard to believe that was a year ago that\nWe were sitting around this very weekend waiting for the worst news of our lives it was just it was awful but the best possible outcome in in large part because of you so thank you\nAll right\nOh and by that I did mention in the in the previous segment it was exactly one year ago that I sat and spoke with you it wasn't I I we when we found out what was happening and armed American radio ... was about three weeks later when we knew of course of treatment when we knew what we were faced with\nEt cetera is when I sat down with you and I talk with you about it and I'll tell you why I did that I'm going to remind you of that again\nBecause while it was one year ago this weekend we got the news or were awaiting the news got the news on Tuesday it was about three weeks later that I opened up to you to tell you what had happened and here's why\nThat's my wife and I sat in that room at the radiologist scared to death knowing something was coming back not knowing what it was\nIt was easy to say this can't be happening is this just cannot be happening is just not happening to us and I had\nTo remind my wife during a conversation when she said this was in a quota she said this is a nightmare it's just can't be happening to know that it is happening in Haiti is happening to you and it is happening to us and if you and us and we as a family are going to defeat this we have to accept what's happening you cannot refuse to accept the situation\nThis is the same exact concept that we speak about on this program together every single day even if we don't have to touch on it as a topic\nYou cannot begin to take your own personal self defense seriously if you do not first except that evil exists you must accept that evil exist and evil takes many forms we've discussed it over and over and over again\nAnd it's easy just as you\nHear someone say I cannot believe that this happened to me that my house got Rob that I was a victim\nUnderstand that the first step in defeating evil is accepting its very existence then and only then can you give evil what it needs and that's a good\nSolid butt kicking and you can but first you must be ... that that it can happen to you we found out at the ranch [noise]\nAnd that's how we defeated it with a lot of ...
