{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "But [noise] kind of pre judge females that come into your unit before it even get a chance to prove themselves in this kind of an unfair advantage\nAnd the drawback is being a new person over and over again when I became a civilian and two thousand sixteen and I didn't realize how morale sudden exterior and then I had because I spent so many years happening to prove myself and I were to your mechanic loaded weapons all these things that someone I transitioned Mimi varies\nAlmost an approach of all because they're like you are too much personality I had to learn to calm\nDown and really I didn't have to prove anything anyway anymore I just wanted to do I need to get there but that came from my whole air force career over and over again trying to prove that I can work hard chest as much as the guy I can pull my weight just as much as the guy I had to carry two hundred a con man to safety I worked really hard to even get close to that\nWell there we go I mean to a large extent if the person male or female have their attitude and their willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job done\nI think you agree with that and obviously bigger stronger people regardless of younger can do some things have smaller weaker people kept to and you don't really have a role in that you don't get a chance to decide how tall you are I guess you could decide wait but only to living degree\nSo yeah there's a difference there we need to take that into account ... what are your thoughts on\nWhy live with amber said about commitment and determination because you know there's several things that a warrior need first of all you have to have a deep abiding passion for a particular ID or subject for cars but you also have to be committed to it in other words the first time you come up to an obstacle you can't quit so you have to have the determination and that stick to it in it\nBut you also have to have that willingness to sacrifice personally sometimes even physical sacrifice and I think where young men have a significant advantage in combat\nYoung men just have this disregard for their personal safety they jump off bridges they drive motorcycles real fast they get into trouble they fight each other\nWomen have a totally different in general now women have a different way of\nDealing with each other it's more of a social violent you will but it's the same reason why you sure companies if you're a male under twenty five check out your race if we were all the same I mean it's just intuitive insurance companies know that's why if you rent a car or if you have insurance if you're a male under twenty five even if you're a gentle mail even if you're an artist doesn't matter\nBecause in general young men\nAre violent and they like danger so I think in in that specific sense they're much more suited\nIn general for violence combat war that kind of situation\nAnd certainly history has shown that history\nBut I Would like to add that there's a lot of different lawyers in our country their social lawyers or domestic whereas I mean\nProbably the biggest worry is we have our women that first of all give birth to children let's face it if it was made up to want to go in there would be no you know\nAnd then the number two just raising kids right way is a constant constant test and you talk about the the three things I talked about you've got commitment determination and the ability to sacrifice I mean there's no better warrior than women that are raising your kids I mean that is not for the faint of heart but enough to\nThe point this is going to get on the front lines of freedom but it's got some women are warriors with automatic weapons of mass phase\nOne thing we haven't talked about is sexual tension boys white girls girls like boys and skipping the twenties when you put them together they are going to pair up or at least tried to pair up\nAnd that kind of all kinds of tensions if the three of us were about the same age and in the same unit ... and I are going to be in competition for arms attention probably and whether she likes either one of us that's one of the costs of tension in our unit\nAnd if you happen to like one of us that's going to cause more attention in our unit ... is a reality which does not occur in an all same gender unit and example in World War two the Russians who were desperate to beat the Germans\nHave all female every freedom have they worked in the Israeli ... their first wars in Nineteen forty eight they put women anywhere and everywhere and it worked but they don't anymore\nIsraelis do have all female artillery units and stuff like that they don't mix the genders you look at the Russians anymore in close combat units because of at least sexual tension so that's something that has to be considered to all of us we're wrapping up what she points would you like our listeners take away from our chapter\nYeah that turn had made me a stronger person let alone a strong woman\nAnd therefore it that will carry for you know when I said have kids that I'm going to raise them to be strong individuals to be\nAnd it's a carrier for itself we let women being in a stronger role it's just going to carry forward next generations because we're letting men and women be strong and we will therefore teach our kids to be strong can make this country great military great keep going on right now and that makes sense [laughter] well\nIt does make sense because what we're talking about here is real life not some academic points that we're trying to make and I certainly if there's anything our country needs today it's kids who know who they are growing up to be adults you know who they are what their values are who have their culture and want to go ahead and they only learned that from their family\nYep Matt your thoughts\nWell in terms of the top of you brought up about sexual tension reminds me of the movie a few good men where\nThe colonel was supposed to tell the men that private Santiago wasn't to be touched but then he transferred him off the base and he's being drilled or the jury it's like why the two wars it private Santiago wasn't to be touched your men always follow your orders then why wasn't necessarily transfer him off the base and he couldn't answer it right\nBut it's the same thing we should be able to tell our young men in the military hands off these women or your\nComrades ... they're not the sexual object but\nIt's going to happen invariably you put twenty year olds in a box oh yeah and some things are going to be having specially in today's environment where lots of different things can be construed by either gender as sort of an unwanted sexual advance so many things in fact I had a friend the other day\nWaiting very highly adding she'd be knocking comment about a a girl in college that she is mentoring\nSaying that a guy made a pass at me and now I've got to tell her that that's not appropriate and I said\nAnd so I said you mean if someone starts with you it makes it past that you did that can be considered ... sexual advance and she can backtrack and said well not necessarily but if you don't like it you should tell them I said I completely agree but\nYou know so there's there's such a disconnect these days in what's considered appropriate and what's not appropriate and most twenty year olds have no idea you've got a line where the line I'm\nThinking back on that real good around here and\nPlay the other part so working in and they'll have the ... luckily I grew up in a first responder family so I already had the scan knowing that put on top of all the facts are harass Matt and Matt's at all this kind of thing that I'm you know I was told\nAs long as they don't put their hands on yeah it's just words so I always had that like I say 'cause if I was offended by everything it what it really made a bad work environment for re sign up and just say whatever they say and not think anything but I think the silver lining there too but if\nWe have a hard time this ensuring kindness ... yes\nAnd so I kinda want to remind our female if there's too that if someone says something and we always tend to like make our judgment on how attractive we are to that person\nUh-huh style right that's another thing is just take the compliment it's okay as long as they're not doing anything to invade your space they put their hands on you just it's OK\nBottom I Love the fact that you had that mentality\nIn all honesty I Try to get into the air force first and I guess I was an Airforce material but the already was allowed to take me to I think we would have served very very well together have you been in the same time\nCan't let the little things bother me at like ... I got to remember who I Am working with and ... what's going on in their mind and I hate to say that that it's almost want to have the upper hand to where they can set the tone of the environment if I can tell someone straight theater they let it get to meet because their word I don't know how I ever would have made fourteen years\nVery well put well obviously this conversation is not over it is for a day but we need to pursue this\nBecause this is a direction our nation is moving and we need to be thinking about it\nOnce and for sure if we conclude and if our nation concludes that women can serve anywhere Houdini and for three or march over the next time we have a war all women will be drafted and most of them will end up in the country 'cause that's where most of the need is because if we don't do that there'll be lawsuit\nIs that where we want to go to a batch for our next discussion so thank you out on the map for taking the time to join us today thank you for your service to our nation I appreciate you ought to\nWell thank you for having me I really enjoyed that math glad you could join me today\nThank you Daniel was a privilege\nHere's our sample theloop report for today this is when we find it on any form of duty and we all get on and just find truth\nIn Pennsylvania National Guard soldiers completed the American ninja award television show in Philadelphia on may nineteenth of twenty of army sergeant tighter waters motor transport operator with every thirty shovels engineer battalion maneuver enhanced my brigade when he was able to to begin with seven teams\nAnd the competition going to say on the show for years and I've always said that I felt that I had a combination of strikes in athleticism to show on the ever changing courses Walter said\nYou came in with a second to advance into the national competition held in Vegas which have required finishing in the top Fifteen oh the experience was great it was interesting to see the different competitors are different walks of life or children of course so we mean physically fit some of the competitors appear to be sculpted from stone just wasn't enough\nWalters principles his family on this year for supporting him for his competition in civilian life authors of the Pennsylvania state trooper which he said as many similarities with military career allows you to carry the same mindset he's ultimately as a soldier at all times\nDo stand tall soldier Walters or maybe I should say ... oh I just bring 'em and all of our nation's patriots so you can go first or the show\nWe'll start the second hour discussing buying a house using a VA loan ruder city lousy mouth and mortgage guy Brett Stillman will share their insights naturally with a spouse last week of troops got to be football games of course we'll conclude with our weekly mailbag military history or on the American before\nWhoever you this hour\nWe're going to discuss buying a home using the VA long with real Cindy allows more from Jerry truly partners\nDon't discuss VA loans with mortgage guy Brad Stone\nNational Review last week's service academies football games and of course we'll conclude with our weekly mailbag military history and around America report groups I welcome your comments or questions contact me through fertilizer freedom dot com\nIt's a pleasure to welcome back to the show my friend Cindy lousy ... she was real the partners in Michigan her husband is my friend and they've event Dave\nThanks for joining a solution the guinea thanks for having me which will be in my opinion buying a house who's like buying a house is complicated however you plan to pay for whatever your goals are it's a complex thing but you have to do it right you need to plan you need to know what you're doing going into it\nBecause one of the costs are during lunch money and to your family is going to live there in the neighborhoods or schools and everything so the impact that so you got to be thinking how should you be thinking their hand when you're thinking about a house before you approach anybody\nTo first cat that people need to take is\nTo contact the mortgage lender make sure their credit\nIs in shape establish their budget and then they can start looking for the home with in their budget and just because they're qualified\nFor two hundred thousand dollar it doesn't mean that they have to purchase a home for two hundred thousand dollars they can look below that price range so that they they comfortable because when a large wind or get them their top dollar amount they still have\nTo take into consideration the utilities and the taxes and the insurance\nAnd I think that that where sometimes people get a little excited when they hear that they're qualified for a large amount they start looking at pictures on line and they start to fall in love with the home that that the top of their budget and then they realize wow with this budget\nOf two hundred thousand dollars for higher they still have everything else to pay for rent groceries do you believe\nThat puts a ... in a whole doesn't when somebody comes and they want something they can't afford or they're looking at something that is the wrong house even though it was cheaper\nOr they can't afford it at all or they're not qualified for anything or they're qualified for much more they could have more\nThat sort of puts the router awkward spot doesn't cause I'm telling you I Want this one I Want that but I Can't afford to grow more if somebody came to you would you immediately remember for mortgage person and then have them come back to you\nI Would I Would make sure they were pre approved prior to me taking them to look at home because I don't want to be that agent that hates them to look at something that they can't afford because I don't want to be the one to Taliban after they've fallen in love with it that they can't happen\nYeah who wants to be that person right and I don't want to tell them something that in the long run they can't afford even though I paper they can afford it in reality\nYou know the impact on their lifestyle will be so negative\nAbsolutely and I don't want to be responsible for that\n[noise] so if I were coming to you wanted to my house you told me to mortgage first to find out what are your mortgage wiser for that's not necessarily what my wife and I walk to afford track that's where you pick it up\nRight and if you don't have a mortgage officer you know I I work with several of them so I can refer to one of course however if you don't have that established first bang you're just spinning your wheels and you're wasting everybody's time\nSo if I come to you is there anything peculiar that you were telling me to do or not do if I Want to keep by using a VA mortgage\nI Would suggest you find a lender that specializes in VA mortgages okay because things change constantly and you want to be sure that you had somebody that knows all of those changes can keep you abreast of everything\nBecause of action already know about it once it's a moving target so you need somebody who's current federal once they do that then they're approved for a mortgage and then there are just a person with money they can borrow and they know how much ... and you could help them go find a house correct\nAnd I would work with their land or\nWhat they found a home to make sure that it's within their budget\nOkay this is important folks because if you haven't bought a house these are the kinds of things that you can walk into it if you go in with your eyes closed\nOr just thinking we're all just find somebody in a bubble you need people particularly via Williams who are very current and shouldn't be there are real insurers who specialized not exclusively but who specializes in helping military veteran people buy homes Arthur\nCorrect there are relocation specialists that works specifically you know obviously with other buyers and sellers by specifically with ...\nOkay and obviously they are going to say more current than the average person who you all do it but I go go do some research first crack\nAt it than an agent that specializes a relocation for ... working with a lender that also special life is in the VA loan because there are a lot of changes not so much on an agent standpoint but from the lenders standpoint there's a whole lot of changes\nYou are a realtor who does some specialization in helping veterans may because you're married to one and Brad the mortgage I Will be on next also focuses on helping veterans that's why you two guys are on to that let's wrap it up before veterans came to you saying\nI Want to buy a house my family were moving here or we want to move up or down sized wise whatever\nI Want to move help me wrap up the two or three things you'd want him to do first before anything else\nIf they reached out to me first and they did not have a lender\nPerhaps they said you know we're going to go through maybe usa yeah or navy fat girl or something they're great lenders however if you\nCan find somebody locally that specializes in da lo such as Brad\nI can get ugly go to Brad sausage and get answers from him versus if somebody were to work with us a and I just called the eight hundred number that they don't know me from Adam and they're not accountable\nWhereas I can go to some of the local who specializes in bailout and that person I can hold accountable for answers and keep the ball moving so that that by or a stellar can get their qualification\nThat sounds like good advice wherever you live\nDo research and find a realtor that is trustworthy and preferably ... specials and we'll go to the vets and if that person find it during the year mortgage type person that's a technique you were working anywhere in the world where there were in the United states anywhere\nAnd it'd be creatures of probabilities that you're not going to run into a brick wall at some point along the way\nThat safe yep\nCindy wrap it up for us if people anywhere United States want to touch base with you just to get some more advice more inside more whatever hardly rich\nThey can go to

weather warmed up to about eighty two as we look over a where able to look at pikes peak and watch a pretty good game as well even though the falcons did not prevail\nWell as we were talking before their second half was a whole lot better than the first half wasn't\nIt really was standing in the first pass a playing the Nevada wolf pack where they sell twenty to twenty five the first half was really I really a catastrophe was bad football there is no sugar coating it no way around this\nArea and a word meant just could not get anything going for the off chance that defense Everytime you looked up from talking to my buddy's there was another past going into and all that at the half\nThe wolf pack had a Twenty one seven league and truthfully air force was fortunate that it wasn't any worse at that time\nBut in the second half of these shows from resolve and they show something that they're really going to need next week they change quarterbacks\nAnd and the second half they started off with a forty three year if you go from Jake concave than there was another touchdown sprinkled in there from Nevada but the markers Bennett damn hauled in a two year our past from\nDonald ... third who replaced area and worth and asked a quarterback\nSo that was a twelve plate fifty eight yard drive\nThen and the fourth quarter Hammond scored on a ... yard run\nEleven place sixty seven yards and those are the familiar types of drive that we like to hear from our academy teams towards the end of the game Airforce made it close to defense held and Nevada ran out of the back of the end zone for unintentional safety\nTo make the score twenty eight twenty five ... to air force with\nSeventeen Seconds left to go and air force they had about two plays one which they completed a path

about that what about this mass of people out there that still the election you if you took the sixty let's say on those and say sixty five million people voted for President Trump and sixty million

I think it's actually and you're a logical feature litter\nHard wired against lot check by the time they come out of\nThe systems the common core and all the other kinds of um uh programs that have been devised essentially to create this massive people and so that is another\nThing we're fighting against constantly\nUm but yes these things these things to educate themselves so we'll see maybe people can be shocked out of it given this this really ... I mean I Do feel that the left way overreached itself it's time out of desperation and just because that is who they are now this is what it evolves too so\nMaybe maybe there's hope at the other side of that once people do I'm really really sort of take it in and and uh I think about it\n[noise] whose ... are held to affect a human behavior but\nThey'd never stopped it right since fraud and all those girls and women too of course and I'm just thinking the only way to hardwired someone against logic\nIt must be it's either the devil themselves or there's a psychological operations nurse somewhere you\nKnow I think it's throughout the education I I think it throughout the education system does a really tremendous researcher by the name of Robin Eubanks who studied that she's\nShe's um an absolute expert in it and she has gone to all of these different programs and she actually it's related and back to the Soviet system I'm as well that she has gone through all the different ah fats in our education system programs different kinds of ah enforced learning\nI'm a I'm a fairly paradigm that have been foisted on on our education system and and and\nDiscussed and shown and analyze how it actually does hot wire us against logic and again create this this set of\nReflexes motion reflexes and in it it's okay terrifying thing because once that creature is created by the system it it is not just a matter of providing new\nUh streams of information or reading different books more books um it's it's kind of over for that brain ...

also greatly upset\nOver head of all time Democrats who found your heart I think she'd be dangerous and being so overt\nBecause they had been getting away with so much for so long Under Cover up just
