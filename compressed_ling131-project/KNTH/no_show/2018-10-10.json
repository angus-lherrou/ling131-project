others\nWeek on the international front Pakistan and turkey the same week [noise]\nLot going on for people held for the fate would pray for these judges in Pakistan to get that decision at any moment back with more than just a minute\nSo here's the story that may sound familiar I used to post a central ... only to be overwhelmed with tons of the wrong resonates because there were so many residents that must have to separate the great candidates from those who were in the past fat I mean it's not easy to find the right person for my winery my sports medicine but\nI Love NPR agencies that old process was definitely not smart then went to that because\nThey figured out hiring\nRecruiter did the work for me\nPowerful matching technology scans thousands of resume to identify people with the

and spirit\nEvery single day in my kennel looking better than they had ever left their skin is so\nMuch better now that they're on the diet I don't even gave them the cable anymore [noise]\n[noise] what am I wrong yeah so the Supreme Court a three judge panel of the Supreme Court and Pakistan heard\nThe appeal of a sea of baby she's been sentenced to death because of her face she'd been charge with blasts from me we have intervene at the un I Want the forests\nIs that intervention they'd been in our director of government affairs and are designated un representative we upstanding with the United nations are ... ... talk about what an intervention actually is here\nYeah we always engage in these cases in a variety of ways gay and you hear a cheer her ER go through a lot of the legal arguments we make we also engage domestically with that leverage point\nInternationally J. when we have this this accreditation at the United nations it allows us to make a what are called intervention sometimes they're written interventions where we file a legal arguments on behalf of of a victim of of a wrongful\nA religious persecution gauge as in this case sometimes they are or all interventions where one of our staff members one of our attorney who will go and make an intervention of verbal eat well actually appear before the chamber whether it's the human rights council or the floor of the general assembly and make the case of verbally so that's what you're about\nTo years here where the European Center for a law and justice or European affiliate took to the floor and verbally made the case inside the United nations for a sea of the er here we go\nThank you very much will Center for law and justice the food is you know it's like he was to vice presidents\nThey make Republicans Pakistan's that's I mean I was presented continues to religious minorities\nThat taking that section two hundred Ninety five seat of the Pakistani ... states whoever by words he just kind of a\nWritten or by visit the representation or by any implication innuendo or inspiration directly or indirectly [noise] besides the sacred name of the holy\nPerfect Mohammed shut the finished his death row in prison for life and shout also be liable to find [noise] since the announcement of these laws of at one thousand cases of that stuff\nI mean you have been adjusted over fifty people that have been extrajudicial killings by less than ... and at least for the people that are currency on death row or serving life sentences and law\nHave stuff are serving prison sentence ranging from three ten years [noise] one claiming in case is that as being a Christian mother of five who was convicted of ... for\nOffering her coworkers water from her cat [noise] the coworkers till that's yeah that\nShe had met the cup certain among the elite team by drinking from it [noise] they or the chicken veterans ... have you ever choose an espresso have faith in Jesus Christ chose chose ... semi convicted and sentenced to death [noise] she has been in prison for the last nine years waiting for the Supreme Court to Pakistan to hear\n... therefore we're just kinda so to investigate cases of that sent me an extrajudicial killings cry Pakistan to repeal or\nMandates that's and you know thank you\nSo we're handling it on the domestic level in Pakistan with the court but we're also handling it on the international level right there at the un says how important do you view those kind of intervention\nI think they're absolutely essential we have to let Pakistan know that we have not forgotten these people who have been falsely accused falsely convicted at our now awaiting their sentences\nAnd I think that period at the un has a has a very broad stage but also having a government like the United states which is a very strong government are some of our allied governments make individual appeals for the government of Pakistan I Know that the Vatican has done so now we've appealed to the Vatican\nThe same way there are religious groups in the west and nations in the west to continually are reaching out to Pakistan and making\nA the appeal that individuals are like a sea of BP should not be executed for their beliefs in violation of major trees and the provisions of major trees that all of these nations have agreed to\nSo when you look at that situation you're Harry ours the lawyer that's responsible with our officer handily that's what it what is the what is it realistic outcome here\nI think they're realistic outcome looking at ... how the judge is handled the case would be and hopefully would beat that they would eh quit her they would overturn her conviction\nOr but again at the same time they have to keep in mind with the the security situation\nAnd it has to be a sort of under the radar or or not read publicizing what they're doing and and I think that's what the court has kind of a done in this case by not giving the verdict today\nAnd just quietly releasing the judgment or at at a later time so all those actions kind of support\nWe can ascertain that that that's what the court is kind of aiming for\nIs what what's your sense Harry well sure ... hours analysis is absolutely correct\nI think the Pakistani government the justice system of the entire country has to take a decision\nThat the decision is will they remain a rule of law country or will they allow mob rules to rain\nAnd if they go down the ladder road this will simply empower the field crafts this will empower mob rule\nAnd this will increase the level of subordinate should of Christian so I Hope uh the Pakistani Justice Department stands up for the rule of law and for the presumption of innocence at the end of the day\nAny impartial observers looking at the evidence will find that there is indeed no evidence in support of this conviction so I Hope the justices will do the right thing and they will find a C a bb is\nYou know you're looking at the trial transcript release the aspects that have been reformed in the press gives a indication that the judges think if this were what we call put up charges the witnesses aren't there that\nWere the ones that will be accusing witnesses the mom who wrote the accusation out does not show up in court so the judges close question both the legal foundation of this as well as the actual the evidence for foundation\nAt the same time it's sad sad we took this to the United nations and will continue to\nUntil she's release and frankly and the reason we're Hammond is hearing any attention at all\nIs because of what's going on internationally here let's be realistic I'm not saying that somebody else couldn't have done and I'm not you know we we took vacation would have been very aggressive and our advocacy both and media and in international tribunals but the fact is without that oftentimes these cases the end result is not a good one\nWell Jay skiff said earlier in the broadcast the reason these blasphemy laws a strike such fear in the hearts of Pakistani just because of two things one how frequently they're used\nIn to how often they stick without evidence to I think you're right to read into what the judge is all about the lack of evidence here but look those those charges still stick in other cases where evidence is lacking so we take this case to the United nations to make sure that the visibility is raised and quite frankly Jay ... a lot of our audience here as American\nThat you have sex with that people have set up we're going to hear about that last week on another radio station that we are going to talk about it I haven't really read a lot I'm just going to go off the cuff\nMhm it'd be ... I I I heard\nThat you that you can't what\nWhat did you say the about the robot something about obey or something that you have to I don't I don't know she was like laws of robots where they can't harm people apparently yeah but you have to obey or something like that I'm like well yeah I Can't wait to\nTalk about it we're going to do the podcast after the broadcast or after the show but to get back to la Croix okay so for those of you that don't know a a ... is a very popular on beverage and their sales have just continue to increase\nAs an as it natural foods movement kind of is gone across the country and people are concerned about what they're putting in their bodies with all the high incidence of diabetes and heart disease and everything but so this is out of Fort Lauderdale Florida October fest it's faded a national beverage Korb who owns a the brand look cry a firms\nThat look for ways sparkling waters are compromised a\nA R R R compromise of natural ingredients there are no synthetic ingredients in la Croix\nAllegations of a recent lawsuit have absolutely no merit and we'll be proven false in short order attention to these charges as an enormous disservice to those who drink and appreciate like Cory sparkling water all essence is contained and like ... are certified by our suppliers to be a hundred percent\nNatural uh the lawsuit provides no support for it's false statements about ... ingredients\nAnd they're not a sponsor and I'm not getting paid for this and I'm not publicly trading and and I don't buy you know ... that's what they are on the NASDAQ that's there's there's\nI have no I have no dog in the hot or whatever they yell at a pony ... I don't have a pony and the race I've got no reason other than I Want to know the truth because my daughter's drink the south to okay so it says the law supervise no support for it's false statements about the courts and greedy and\nThe United states food and Drug Administration that's the FDA\nConsiders natural on a food label to be truthful and honest leading when nothing artificial or synthetic including all color additives regardless of source has been included in or has been added that is true with all the court products and Michael King or Esquire or a special corporate counsel for national beverage stated that a national beverage\nWhich is look right\nAnd sadly denies all allegations contained in the lawsuit and negative press articles related to it there are neither a sugars are artificial ingredients contained nor added to our liquid products all of our ingredients are certified as natural\nAnd for more information you can go to read the true facts dot com but I'm going to natural is the problem here is an ... I have a\nCouple of things that the problem I think it's just a war of semantics I think to the things that jump out for me because I've worked a long time in the supplement industry and these are two phrases or ways to describe a product that get you in trouble in that space to\nOne is natural and the other ends synthetic mhm so what do those mean like there's no definition and to your point I'm On the FDA's website if the dot Gov and they quoted that just in the same way you were making that they don't have\nThey don't have a term to the fine they say this on their website they don't have a formal definition for the term quote natural they have a longstanding policy that it's not um does have you know uh the added artificial colors but they say however this policy was not intended to address food production methods\nSuch as the use of pesticides or if your if your product gross where quote naturally and it's sprayed with something that chemical ends up in the food and it ends up as a chemical in your food and someone tests since ... finds a chemical they might say oh this is quote not natural but it was part of the growing right so how\nHow far back do you go with this quote natural story when you look at the word synthetic because this is something that gets really confusing in the supplement world\nWhat a synthetic mean if you look up a deck and ... says made by chemical synthesis but it's all chemical sent this is bad right when we cook food it's potentially being chemically altered Herman Cain was that bad yeah\nSo it's semantics here as a play on words and while I'm all for making sure that we are transparent with how we label food and anything especially that we consume so supplements beverages and food\nI think that we also have a very litigious society is that's the only thing I read on the haystack right because they don't have anything better to do especially with the climate we live and they're going to potentially takedown of brand which\nYou know I don't know maybe it is a problem with us ingredient and maybe it's not but I Will let me talk about why Harry every right to defend themselves as these people back for for for defamation of this comes out to be not a problem it's it's not okay\nWell you're the expert here so let's talk about these three ingredients Ethel ... is one of the ones that they're talking about I did my homework it says that Ethel ... is found an apple a\nApples apple ... is president and many fruits apple Africa banana Plano Tangerine et cetera and it's used as a flavoring and great okay that one that one's fine here's what they did though I'm this is what we are there's so much a ... in the media that's misleading you said do on that you were watching us what were you watching yesterday I wasn't watching\nGood morning America yesterday they were talking about this and that it had a good\nMorning America is what ABC NBC CBS which one it doesn't matter there all the same [laughter] really are but here's the thing I said that second ingredient let me go to that I'm getting all jacked up here when I Do with my\nWhere's my cheek she oh here it is limited limiting okay limiting ... is the second one on that list and let me go in ... the rind citrus fruit okay yep fountains at ... but that's the one\nOkay so they use it it's a pain to which uh which naturally occurring in plants yes yes yes yes and so that's what this is where they get where it gets tricky and this is where it's very misleading and we're I'm going to defend the court\nBecause it says it as an aromatic oil often found cockroach in insecticide\nWell that's to attract the cockroaches down these foods might put a little natural smelling there together they could come the way of the traffic that doesn't mean that there's insecticide in la Croix so I just wanted to clarify and I want to say this to did you come up with that number ... about\nI Know in twenty Thirteen a liquid their their revenue for that year at one point eight billion a I was looking for the most recent one but here's eight to eight point one billion you know by twenty Seventeen it's at least doubled or tripled okay um maybe maybe not trouble but double but anyway the point is one point eight billion dollars\nThat are you know a sales that are being taken away from big companies like Coca Cola and Pepsi\nWho cover cola by the way it was what Seventy four billion dollars in revenue last year you guys are having Pepsi Starbucks Red Bull and Budweiser crying and they do a lot of advertising and all those big shows on CDs or a CBS NBC and ABC so you have to wonder as an American citizen and as a consumer\nYou know why why that story was late I'm just and and not end the journalism conjure up who conjures up and why didn't they do their homework like we're doing right now I just think there's a lot of stinking the air\nI can imagine because my first reaction after CNN or good morning America was around and got my wife like hey you have to be out in the kitchen with writers of drinking me and I would just be being formed on exactly right in it and what's going on trusting my sources lose too much\nWell you know what that is why there's one life radio okay we're going to literally course today it is\nMisleading and while they could be you know we don't know that could be fine with their labeling their other products that call themselves quote natural\nThat caught that quite frankly aren't and a big problem in a supplement industry that leaves the consumer very confused\nAnd I do think we need some tighter regulations and we need a longer trail of understanding how far back to this natural label have to go up to go all the way through well Anthony you ... that mean that that plant didn't get sprayed with any pets either herbicides as if so nothing will be called and I'll throw on\nLabel here's the thing so this woman's getting herself this woman Lenora rice as a woman a wink wink that\nPosted Lee was the one that decided she wanted to start this lawsuit how can how can somebody hasn't started up big lawsuit against against and I'm sure they have aspartame and Coca Cola and how damaging it is why are we not up in arms about that\nBecause everybody loved their Diet Coke they love their Diet Coke their diet Pepsi the money so you would be afraid to him what you can't find them right to bear untouchable untouchable they'll they'll drag it out in court for ten years till you're broken and and dead from stress but I Know is this\nPart of the longstanding consumer agreements that consumers are afraid that you know they don't know what they're paying for it they don't know what they're getting a judge and there\nAre many products out there that are claiming to be natural and their art and there are some products that you know essentially people are claiming that aren't natural we're you\nKnow if you really look at things you did your research you noted it's still a natural product\nRight well all I Know is my kids aren't drinking high fructose corn syrup so I'm sticking with ... and uh I'll watch for cock roaches [laughter]\nApproach free technically there you

states if we're\nTrained may not like we said was that what we do they know that if we think we are going to do\nSomething we fall for when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether to try and deal forgives intimate thing they get the private means business and they all agree with that\nWhether it's his promise to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem she should've included that but he's done so much now you can't expect me to remember everything\nBut then if you look at these ten years in the last one point three\nBillion and the un by we've\nMade it so I'm Glad we made it more [laughter]\nSouth Sudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming

because they're in a method ministry and you also have to say for a\nBetter country because Jerry ... in a bunker and the administration wow and Nikki Haley is one of the probably the cabinet member who is the most respected although the United nations ambassador is not typically a cabinet level position but of the top\nOfficials and the Trump Administration to people on the left she probably is the most popular\n... and that's quite on the curb of course\nOf my family my phone at the same and um my two little ones I adore them ... you know they sacrificed a lot I think a lot of time and energy into it [noise] um but as they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America crowded with that I'm not leaving\nUntil the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in place and that for the next ... to come in but it's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to then part of the team now I don't have anything we sat on where I'm going to go I\nThink that

special to me she's done an incredible job\nShe's a fantastic person very important blame but you also is somebody that gets she has been in the United nations from the beginning with us\nFrom the beginning and work with us so they can pay that's been barely a long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period for the end of the year I Want to take a little time off a little but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina for eight years\nAnd then she uh she did this and this is possibly the more in tune\nWith what's going on in the world very dangerous thing a lot of things [noise] what she's doing a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning of North Korea was a massive\nWe're moving along moving along really nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of state Mike if I'm fairly things in the world of nicotine and the and so we're all we're all happy for you and one way for we have to lose hopefully it will be coming back from\nOne of your wife just said is is maybe a different capacity and everything but uh I just wanted to let you know so at the end of the next year will be leaving and then it will be in constant touch I Know that one of the evidence is you're going to vote for you know all the players\nThat that was doing the thing I think she did best in the United nations\nYou got to know the players [noise] she got to know in China Russia\nThe she knows everybody I Know very first day basis and they like it or maybe a couple of normal again all like because they do they really like another thing maybe more importantly they respect her\nSo the gear

chaotic administration in states such nice things about\nAs for why I Believe she's leaving and then she just burned out I think it's a difficult job and the difficulty boss he's demanding puts a lot of stuff in the box and I think a lot of people can't keep up the man sleep four or five hours a night\nHe's frenetic\nHe wants to accomplish a lot and I think for people to have to do the stuff he wants to do with a lot of work a lot of pressure\n\nProbably two years under this president is like four years on any other president people come and people go is a story about two new rock knee the legendary coach of every day\nAnd he would feel one and he had an assistant coach the game in the in the system won and won pretty handily and new rocket he admitted to one of the seniors at the college that bothered him that uh this assistant won the game and his dad\nAnd to me and said well we are all useful but none of us is necessary and that includes the president United States\nThe sun is going to rise in the eastern said in the west irrespective of what happens we keep going\n[noise] people come in people go in the midst ration and those who don't like the administration always looking for the ulterior reason doesn't appear to be you know to your race and she said she doesn't have another job so apparently does not have an offer that's a substantial she decided to quit I
