including Medicare fell eight hundred three three one Ninety six Ninety eight hundred three to one Ninety six Ninety six eight hundred three three one Ninety six Ninety six\n[noise] and so you know\nThere's been received by the U.S with the White House first because the executive branch agency they have to submit to the U.S Senate sitters or going through it just so you're clear\nA series on both sides the house said there's nothing new there that's the best case there for Brett Kavanaugh after I wasn't going to clear him and this has to say Dr Ford is a liar these other people are liars but what they have said is it not a single other person will corroborate their their their accounts\nAgainst their allegations are an accusations against for capital\nThat's the best case there by Kevin ... so where where are the Democrats Kodak's it's temperament so that's where we are there there's been cloture motion filed that means the first vote or a would occur tomorrow or that is not a final vote or if that is too successful\nThat would open up uh the uh the final floor debate in the U.S Senate and they are set up a vote for Saturday on bread counts a cabinet that would actually be the confirmation\nVotes that would put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court now they're all caught up\nAnd we have a dating site though in the days have very quickly very soon as all coming to a very quickly let's go and take your phone calls when we do in the final say where the broadcast Sarah is calling from Maryland on line three Sarah welcome to Jay Sekulow laws\nAnd they are\nHaving a ... percent airing carried the step back and American Eats a lot of it that a kid but kept their country and their families as well as the laws of our country [noise] and I only have a plane carrying ... the Democrat\nAnd I really feel this is the topic I hate to have a standing up for our country and\nIt's really making some angry at the oh like he had to go through with the Democrats [noise]\nWell that is the big boys series is how angry or the America is the American public by what has been done to Brett Kavanaugh as an angry enough to a pushback against what may be a blue wave in the house or even though the houses no role in this but you know as people vote or\nOn a just a to Z as there is a big question there remains a is it something that is kind of habits\nAnd know for many of us who are very engaged in the process most of our listeners I Would say you would fall that category will not forget this or\nThat that many Americans will move forward [noise] um and will this be a deciding factor that\nThat also race we see we have a couple of times if you call right now you may have time to get on the broadcast to the one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to let me go ah to to Harry Harry ... the the idea here though now is I think we've reached the point I'm\nAs we were just discussing that even those Republicans who have tried\nLike Lindsey Graham to be the types of say people deserve not even just up or down vote but a yes vote if they're qualified even if I disagree with their entire philosophy of looking at the law that that has may have changed dramatically because if Lindsey Graham\nHas decided he's he could start voting no a odd nominees because they're just a philosophy things have really shifted Republicans may be starting to get it back or they don't take time out a lot of these uh some of these Republicans like Jeff Flake if some of the ones that are in the middle are not going to be there\nA next time around others probably wouldn't like Lisa Murkowski of that that she was in college\nI I think you're absolutely correct recent events suggest that Republicans have to grow a backbone because the failure to do so will do what it was simply encourage the Democrats so you have a democratic Senator Feinstein\nWho saw an FBI investigation with how are the ... ... information from the accuser for something like two months she is now crying wolf\nShe is responding to the death clean roar of missing corroboration and the basically the war that comes from the American people because of her own misconduct she is now saying Dr Ford deserves better\nWell perhaps she writes in one sense a doctor for needs a better senator\nSenator who is on us to the American people and so I think Republicans need to respond to recent events but you need to grow a backbone and they need to stand up to the misconduct by the Democrats or they should uh move on with their lives\nAt least it's common for Texas on line for Lisa welcome to Jay Sekulow live [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I just think like giant ...\nChina\nI mean they're not going to be easy to Democrats voted yes I mean I think that's that's the point they may have tried to again gets a favor I think that they were used by those Democrats will be a better way to look at it I I kind of heard it on his head if they were pressured\nBy people who may have a good personal relationships with ah like Jeff Flake and Chris too if you're taking this action but they're not ultimately if you're a yes vote on this you're going to peas or the Democrats are at all on a ... and and uh they're gonna all you know for the most part B do votes except for a couple\nWhich are which may come over after a break have reaches a fifty one votes\nIt's abundantly clear during that no matter what Senate Republicans do it's not going to satisfy the Democratic caucus inside the United States Senate I Would say this though even within the three Republicans that we've been talking about\nI think there's a difference I mean I think if you look at senator Collins or statements from the very beginning and frankly uh she has been very sober she's been very deliberate she's been very thorough and\nShe has consistently said she wants to see as much information as possible and today she said that this investigation was very thorough I think that is a\nVery reasonable way to approach this I I I Will say I take a little bit of an exception with the way Senator Flake handled this during committee member he came out and said I'm satisfied\nI'm a yes vote and then I think it might be fair to ask the question whether or not he was trying to appease his friend a center or coups that they got this agreement they got a fairly clear FBI report but guess where senator Coons is Jordan he's still a no vote you said it again this morning so I Do think there's a difference between the wasted or college approach this and the way Senator Flake\nThe chassis in Florida on line six Cathy good question you're on the air\nThat Clark Kent able to go back and be getting what they said that he does get a\n... it's as for technically yes if he doesn't get approved is it like lose that seat on the circuit court or in D.C than if the cloture vote fails though you can't move to the next vote that would probably be the end of the nomination\nYeah technically they're not the debate on the nomination could continue but Jordan if that fails I Would expect his nomination to be withdrawn\nAlright Diane and California last call of the day died welcome to Jay Sekulow alive [noise]\nHello thank you for taking my question is what ... instead of their tax credit for and involved in that thirty hours to get the following culture\nBeing for all living things and animals just happened to be one of them because they're so easily victimize 'cause they don't have a voice well I could be called the nut but this kitten just walked up to me and of course I was going to take it I wasn't going to leave her outside and the dart right\nYou know I was just thinking of you know read walked up to you a kitten public hidden yeah OK the kitten and it and the ... and again if he could talk with say\nPlease tell me that they always\nHungry and water and he had been to me [laughter]\nSo et cetera [laughter]\nThat's what the kitten with a ... year okay and you uh she needs a home you already have health proclaimed very Christian Woman I Would think that you would have a huge amount of compassion for animals uh\nI Do definitely have more compassion for human beings than I Do for animals but I Do have a big heart for animals as well I mean I'm totally a dog person for sure yeah I have lots of both of my life\nI'm a I'm a I'm a beach person I'm ... I watched the movie last night with me I Love the movie\nI said oh are you the type that doesn't kill the insect in your health like your capture and let them go but yeah I\nDon't know how that all of that not being about ... about three years ago I killed the Hornet because I was afraid it was going to staying one of my cats and so um it was it was way up high on my windows to and I was losing my mind trying I think I've\nSeen her in the mall with the cricket cricket I mean\nMy\nMom who may very well in the middle of the law outrun big economic crisis in the end of the mall [laughter]\nYeah that would have been great I like to keep the economy going so I like to shop yeah and I have them all [laughter] gosh or get their current get okay so there's beauty all around it around is would you agree with that killed for sure [laughter] okay so this morning when\nI got into my car with my daughter and I took Suzie Q with me my little newest rescue Suzie off the ground they found me actually I didn't find her she's amazing at so much joy in my life yeah does she pee on the floor sometimes and she's having a little anxiety you know 'cause if she's in a new home and there's lots you get used to but I absolutely love the little doggy and so anyway\nShe goes with me in the morning now when I take my daughter to school and was we were driving out of the driveway I looked up like I often do almost always do and looked at the sky and this guy was beautiful to where it was really beautiful and so as we said oh look how pretty and then we just kept driving\nAnd then I noticed a little further down the road that me I had actually taken a picture of the of the sky because it was so pretty today and um\nAnd I just think that's wonderful and those are the kinds of things that make you happy really small little incidental things exactly elective Lee that you can do other outdoor bay yes like have compassion\nFor all living things included in that for me anyway um but in this article and pay legal magazine that the latest issue of paleo magazine which of course is one of our sponsors\nUm and I've always about their magazine long before we ever got involved with them but ah there's an article in here that says and that changes\nEverything well I didn't um\nI didn't even know what song I was going to end up listening to\nA today on my way in oftentimes I'll pick one or two sons and I'll play 'em over and over again if I feel like or I'll play all different ones but right this morning I went through my library and I found the song nothing more which I'm going to play here in a minute but\nI wanted to read this to you guys first I'm Out of the paleo magazine and and that changes everything by Kathy Gilbert it says this when\nWe walk on a beach or hiking the mountains or sit beside all like we are changed by beauty duty is one of the most powerful\nChange agents that there is it transforms the edges of our souls and makes them less rigid\nSofter amplifies our sense of awe and wonder it fills us with light\nAnd that changes us and when we gather ah with good friends which I'm going to be doing this weekend um my daughter's coming into town tonight and I'm so happy about it and so when we gather with good friends we are changed by the power of vulnerability vulnerability intimacy opens us up and allows us to exchange\nParts of ourselves when someone trust us with the deepest parts of themselves we Are Forever altered\nOr a measure of courage and grace and compassion is woven into our souls and that changes us when we keep a promise or continue to honor\nOur commitment year after year uh even if not so perfect here we are changed by law we become focused less on our own desires and more on other soles we care about deeply and that changes that I'm almost done\nAnd when we look at art ...\nExcuse me when we look at art or read a poem or listen to music or make something with our hands we are changed by creativity however small something inside us changes the more attention we get to those moments the greater the chance they have to leave a mark on us whether we are observing the creative process or engaging in ourselves\nA it can't stir or something in the deepest parts of our souls and that changes us and so I listen to the song alternative are altered by alternate routes uh called nothing more and the song was originally produced for the purposes of rallying support\nFor Newtown kindness a nonprofit organization dedicated to encouraging acts of kindness and kindness\nAnd I want to play it for everyone now and we'll be
