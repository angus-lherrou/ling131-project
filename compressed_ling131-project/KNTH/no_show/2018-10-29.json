two weeks something a primary care doctor to getting treatment by specialists Bernie Sanders want the Canadian health care system is eat that Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to envision care free drugs\nAnd um and and and and free vision care and and um you know of course he he had the bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for whom want to become president\nAnd of course he never talked about what it would cost and how it would be paid for but it's Charles ... center said thirty two trillion dollars over ten years all private coverage\nUnder his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would lose their coverage immediately and we would all be\nLike people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under Medicare system\nThe waiting list or care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSally how would why why does a a Medicare for all seem to test so well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single parents being around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary\nFor the Democratic presidential nomination he brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all\nSo you know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again that you know who wouldn't want something that's free but as I say he never talked about how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course is I'm a new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\n... member of a democratic socialist with America\nShe is going around with Bernie telling candidate you know promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in this midterm election on November six\nAre these candidates who are running to the left that Ben Jealous for governor of Maryland this I'm Andrew Gillum who is running against um [noise] the scientist for the governorship in Florida\nHow do these people do to the American people are they finally understanding by people like you and me tell educating them on how terrible it would be what the cost to be their tax burden\nAnd you know in the latest poll a study out of the American association of medical colleges\nThey're predicting a shortage of a hundred and Twenty one thousand doctors\nBy twenty thirty because so many dogs that tremendous sixteen percent increase so many dogs you know quick medicine under Obamacare but the thought of being under a single payer system where Bernie says they would be paid forty percent below\nWhat they're paid now um because they their salaries their payments would be tied to Medicare but this will encourage more doctors to quit and the best and brightest young people not to go into medicine\nSally talk to me about a pre existing conditions I thought it was an assault on the on the insurance model to force insurance carriers to take people with preexisting illnesses now hearing Republican say hey hey Democrats don't say that we're going to take away preexisting conditions because we're not I'm confused\nWell I Know it's very confusing and of course that's all goes back to the fact that when Trump with running as president and the Republicans were running in the twenty sixteen presidential they promised that they would repeal and replace Obamacare unfortunately you know by the early fall at twenty Seventeen they hadn't been able to do it and it wasn't done\nUm we're seeing some very good things being done through the administration secretary Alex aides are you know expanding I'm short term a limited to ration plant
