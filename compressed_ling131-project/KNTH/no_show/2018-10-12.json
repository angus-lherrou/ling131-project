Democrats [noise]\nUm so it seems to really becoming more and more difficult to get Republican majority in Congress and even a solid majority when you have so many people think representative who aren't even citizens of our control\nIts citizens they shouldn't be voting that's one so there are since this is the census goes out that takes account of the people and that kind of have congressional districts are drawn up\nSomewhat there's a lot of gerrymandering and things that go around but remember you have to be a citizen to vote if not your fraudulently\nVoting so I'm ... it's not people who who are here are who are not citizens that are are are are voting in causing the Democrats to win I'm now I think that what you're getting at though the bigger issue is the immigration issue\nA front and center in California you see this is why like taking the calls from all across the country than is because you get a call from Julie she's in Santa Monica California and\nClearly a feels a little bit deflated because a U.S you know significant demographic changes coming even though people may not be citizens yet um and uh and California is one of the bluer states as a country but Republicans do win in congressional races there\nBut just that it is I I just want to tell people ah don't worry about the fraud right now with the election lawyers for the political parties do that they are\nUm especially the close races\nGet out there and vote to get out there and get your fridge to vote say out of that is what's important\nYeah that's really what I was going to say do during I mean look the census is not perfect to the voter fraud issue is not perfect but I Will tell you this on both of those counts I think they are the best in the world so could there be improvement yes there absolutely good and they're constantly working on it but\nThat really is the party apparatus job to focus on that as citizens you should be etiquette educating your friends and family getting out to vote and then yes ah keeping an eye on those to process these are the door and if you look around the world I think you should be privileged to be a citizen of the United states and have an opportunity to participate in this process\nYeah let's go back to the phones Chris in Nevada on line five Chris welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nHigh I think that one in ... where a Republican ... law and be a Democrat then when I what I've seen the Democrats solo and when that doesn't work they didn't do low or\nYeah I mean that's the more recent I think it's fair to say is that a civility even toss out the window [noise] um and uh and you heard from Hillary Clinton it there it will only be restored in her words if if the Democrats take\nThe house for the Senate or both
