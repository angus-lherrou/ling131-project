because they want to end the pattern of pain right when I was the reason that you would divorce was that commitment to the pattern of pain\nBut lots of people carry that pattern of pain forward yeah and it comes with the colleges do yeah and it comes to the cause of this beautiful opportunity to do self work right and like your divorce is causing you that much agony about your partner that much

motivator\nYeah in divorce often times people an agonizing pain there like I don't need any help because it's the other person's fault instead of being able to say like garlic I'm In pain and I need
