{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "Sure well you know first of all I guess maybe at least as I see myself one of my most important things is that I'm the father of seven children and the ah the husband of one [laughter] and uh\nWith my family life is important to me and the poverty line is politics is because like anybody else I Want to see my children and Herod a world that is better or at least as good as the one I inherited and I I sometimes feel like we're not having the right direction to make that happen so\nI Want to be involved in those things I'm a rock red conservative I ran for Congress\nAgainst the entrenched political incumbent in the southern Virginia I served in a public school board and I see a lot of the shortcuts gains that liberals play and I got very interested in gauging and trying to uh stand up for freedom and liberty and the principles that we find that the constitution\nWell our constitution is what we veterans took an oath to support and defend so anything that has to do with keeping our constitution not just an existence but actually having government follow it makes a great deal of sense to me\nOh absolutely and so that's what scientists freedom is about it was founded by Malcolm wallet with US Senator conservative Wyoming\nHe served three terms in the U.S Senate when he retired he founded frontiers of freedom because he wanted to continue to advocate for a constitutional solutions limited government freedom and opportunity and peace or strike\nWell that's what it would take to keep us as a constitutional republic and certainly in my lifetime I'm Seventy seven I've seen an awful lot of movement away from the constitutional republic we were starting to form so yeah I Know a lot of people that are upset with what they see but they don't know what to do about it\nIs I'm taking the frontiers of freedom is there some place they can plug into action we take some action am I right\nAbsolutely our website is very easy it's F F dot O. R. G. F. F. dot org like French is freedom you know F F ... ss or anything like that but fast and a bad as they are based on issues that are working on issues recover you can sign up there for our newsletter we don't sell your name on the night that\nWe won't sell you a spam either we typically\nOnly send out occasionally emails only the only thing it's an important issue otherwise you can come to the website\nWhen it suits you but bottom line is the idea of liberty it's a a\nIt's a fulltime Endeavour you know they say the price of liberty is internal vigilance I Would argue that that in more modern that an accurate so you can't just be a passes spectator you have to be a participant gotta enter the game on the field and that's hopefully what we can help people do and we try to get information that's helpful and we try to fight on their behalf\nAnd all the Congress and before even the court sometimes and and most definitely before the administrative agencies\nWill we absolutely have to do that is a little bit like if you need a car and I gave you an brand new car which actually the six months later and you told me was running terribly and asked her why have you and you're putting the oil well no I Do have to do well no\nIf you have something valuable like our freedom like our constitution republic you have to take care of it not somebody else\nAnd I get that involvement of citizens that is for our country is lacking\nAnd yeah and I think that the more we are involved the more accountable we can hold government we will see government against the fan to our well\nPriced too often I feel like everyone expects us to bend to it but as we get more involved as we don't just get involved at election time that's important time to be in [noise]\nBut I Would argue we should also be involved in between elections you know that's the beauty of the republic as that is designed to be responsive to our views and I think too few of us are involved\nI think there's a lot more Americans would agree with that and always participate and so we need to get those folks activated involves so that can ... return to Washington\nYes sir this is going to go on the front lines of freedom we're discussing frontiers of freedom was George lander George\nI hear a lot from people that they are frustrated with they don't know what to do you have that kind of a citizen contacted you through your website or whatever what kind of advice what kinds of things would you have them do or encourage them to do or give them resources to do\nAbsolutely well normally when I speak to groups and what my call to action is often I asked them to contact their congressmen and express their opinion you could write him a letter you can call 'em that let them know what you stand and I think\nThat can have a real impact we saw that in the most recent a judicial nomination hearing is that there were you know some ... some who got a message loud and clear that they need to stand up and they did\nAnd and so I think that it's a very valuable to make sure they understand how we feel like you know politely I'm not saying that you call it a shot at them and say if you know but I think we can also this is an important issue to me and ... the ... the ... that she should bothers me\nIn fact it matters so much that how you do on this particular issue will determine whether or not I can support you in the future you know so we're not to threaten them and you know but you can say that they've got the message they heard that a guy like okay I got it you know and the staff person takes that call\nThey totally get what you just said that um I think it's more effective than they were so kind of get on the phone and yell at them and tell them they're worthless bombs in so far as I get them a very very\nClear message of what you want them to do on a particular bill\nAnd or a particular vote and then tell them how much it matters to you\nI agree with you one of the things that most politicians you can't do is read minds so if they're your representative how do they know what you'd like them to do if you don't tell them and I that's the way to communicate is civil eat mostly respectful and it was\nYeah and that doesn't mean wishy washy no not at all suggesting I just sang\nAnd I think that they'll get more attention if they kind of color ranting and raving skin and yelling and even if they just found out and say that was a crazy person and they ignore you so you want to give them a thoughtful reason why you feel that way and then make sure that they understand that this is important issues you\nMight just letting them know that this is going to impact how you get your yeah that's an implied threat but it's done in a way that not I'll drive from off of your you know that guy you know what I mean and um I Do think that the reason why being very clear at them as important is because\nThe squeaky wheel and politics will get the you know get the grief most of the time\nAnd then there might be a few very principled members of Congress who will vote right if you do not call them\nBut the truth most of them were swayed by an officer opinion on the left and the crazies in the world are in fact calling up and trying to persuade them so\nWe have to be equally committed and make sure that they understand that we are out there to it can only do it makes it look like we don't care\nAnd then I was like wow I guess they don't care I guess I'll just go with a you know and that's dangerous for us because the odds are not interested in constitutional up that she'll be limited government they're not interested in following the rules of war they look at government as a as something that can provide them with the goodies they light\nAs opposed to apartment this could protect their rights and provide them out there and a level playing field and freedom and opportunity with today then you have to do something what\nYou said we have to make sure that you have to take out our ground and than forcefully and when we do I think we can look up\nI couldn't agree more and goes contacts have to be regular once a month or whatever which means you have to pay attention so you know what you're calling them about\nBut a respectful regular communication will you have to retention I Know what I've seen it happen and I share George that's awesome one more time George tell us how people can contact plug into frontiers of freedom\nSure they can follow us at S. S. dot ORG and they can um me on the lander F. F. L. A. N. D. R. I. E. H. with the G for George in front of the G land dress\nAnd if you forget that send it to me do any of them I just read a book I'm all for to George George thank you for joining us today thank you for your concern for our nation thank you for frontiers of freedom I think ... winds in frontiers are brothers probably call your friend\nAbsolutely likewise\nNo sign for us to talk to report this is when

re hydrate with water finally put a big smile on your ... to be an American face some of your thoughts about email\nAnd then we'll discuss last week's ... football games were on the one\nAnd of course we'll conclude with our weekly mailbag military history under under America report\nGroups I welcome your comments or questions contact me through front lines of freedom dot com [noise]\nNow it's time to discuss ... book\nIt's really a conclusion it's called blind man's rage skip this is more than a single book it's a it's sort of a conclusion of a series isn't it\nThis is the conclusion book four of the series is a military adventure series apocalyptic in nature set in the United states primarily in Michigan where I live but yeah it's the conclusion it's taken me about\nEight years to write all these you start an eight years ago with ... ... one right yeah we'll get one the God virus\nYeah that's a good book I even read it [laughter] well I used very small words I had you in mind Danny truth of I Believe you well of course I'm a Marine I don't know a lot of large words anyways I'll always said I modeled ... but I Am working on my bicycle on the good good I'm not I don't remember oh okay\nSo to talk us through the flow of four books sure they about yeah the first book\nThat God virus basically it starts out in Wisconsin and there is a terrorist attack on the U.S power grid\nAll the power goes down for all the U.S of course the U.S retaliate against China and Russia and so by the time everything is done when all the furs done flying\nAlmost the entire world is with\nOut power and it's about basically the aftermath of an attack like that we're going back in time a hundred and fifty years people weren't equipped\nFor that so a lot of people end up just dying off simply because they can't live in an environment like that and it's about man named Dan who just happens to be a Marine Corps veteran probably yeah sergeant you know\nAnd uh his son who would you have to travel from northwest Wisconsin all the way over to northern Michigan to get back to his home town where he was raised by his uncle Rodney who turns out to be the commanding general\nOf an organization called the shadow militia and the shadow of militia is book to\nA hot and then I suspect the shadow militias a bunch of patriots\nIt is a bunch of patriots you know we all know about militias you know and they're quite vilified in the media has these days but the militia basically as everyone who can bear arms that you know the\nPrinciple of our constitution yeah sounded on the fact the militia is the people\nWell the shadow militia fictional obviously is based on the the premise that no one knows the shuttle militia exist they are a shadow organization of the regular militia not even the regular militia knows that they exist\nAnd so that keeps them out of the limelight they were formed primarily for a situation such as this\nWhere America was in dire need where they needed help where they needed someone to step up and read a ... a constitutional government and that's what the shadow Malaysia is all about and uncle Rodney you know a general Rodney T branch is the commanding general of that army\nThat is one very real possible scenario I mean the fact that our power grids are so vulnerable not just ours wherever yeah there is nothing unbelievable about that scenario\nAnd it's also awfully reasonable if they're a bunch of people who is enough foresight to be trying to prepare for this and we really need them to be people who want to our constitution republic ... and it sounds like that's substantial militia\nYeah you know exactly there's no shortage of people who just want power yes you know for their their own agenda but someone who wants to reestablish constitutional government and then step away by all out and go on with their lives I mean that's that's in the along the bane of\nGeorge Washington it is indeed this girl going to go on front lines of freedom we're discussing ... book wind man's rage okay that's two of the four west number three\nNumber three the third book is called the terrorists in tide\nAnd Michigan is kind of special over near Detroit there's a city called Dearborn there is here born is one of the largest concentrations of Islamic communities outside of the Mid East I Believe it is the largest I wouldn't surprise me at all by now\nBut you know basically what happens in this book is there is an extremist leader takes over in the aftermath of this a terrible debacle and he raises an army and Islamic army\nTo conquer all of the Midwest and he heads over toward Grand Rapids Kalamazoo and then on up north towards on you know it's to him general Rodney T branch the commanding general of the shadows militia\nWho is a little more than this guy can conquer and so that's what this book is about its uncle Rodney the shadow of militia against the Syrian Army\nAnd the service in army I presume is to establish an Islamic state caliphate correct yeah okay well that's not beyond the realm of realism that either so that must be an interesting book I guess you got to buy the book and read it to find out who wins\nWell yes you do I can't ah well the good guys always about what I see I got really good why Israel every\nBook I've ever had rather yours [laughter] you got how many books on a fourteen or something or twelve twelve okay\nMaybe I'm leaving it too far forward in the foxhole okay and the last one what you just finished\nThe last one is called the blind man's rage and uh that's where uncle Rodney the shadow of militia has to take on the instigate or of all of this the power behind the scenes his name is Jared Thompson AK aid the blind man and he's the one who attacked the power grid\nAnd took everything down so that he could insert himself as the leader of the United states of America and so it's the final clash\nBetween the blind man and the shadow militia well\nThat there is somebody behind the scenes and that person is particularly powerful and the person has a pretty good plan\nAnd the means to make it happen that's all realistic and indeed\nThere was about two hundred countries in our world today about about Seventy five percent of them are ruled by somebody like that that is right there called desperate [laughter] that's right so uh to say that's that's very realistic hopefully it'll never happen but it's really appropriate\nOkay\nAnd your book born and raised rage is for books together in one cover so well\nNo the blind man's rage is a separate book I'm now getting ready to release all four books under one covered\nThat's what I was getting to okay and what does it does for put together called\nIt's called the God virus series a guard cyber series how can people get a copy you can get a copy of any of my books just by going to Amazon dot com search on skipped Corey Elena it'll pop right up there\nWe're going to give away a copy of the book to at the end of the show folks but I've read a significant number of skips books and I think you'll find them hard to put down their fun\nA little scary sometimes [laughter] but it's nice to know that the good guys always when skip what's in\nThe future of your in your books got anything else in your mind do you try to yeah I Do\nI think we can safely say it's not going to be a harlequin romance because if I ever wrote a romance probably most of the characters would die hard it is but what I'm thinking about now is uh I'm thinking of a devotional book called concealed carry for Christians\nWell I certainly think Christians should carry concealed and I'd rather have only Christians current consumed by choice\nSkip thank you that was fun it's nice to know that you do something besides cohost man hunt and can and door stuff this is fun I Can't wait till your next book is done\nAll right well thank you very much Carl\nI'm going to give them next time I'll shoot the ball with

going to take over health care\nUnder any scenario and I don't think our companies are countries that are going to go to like a single payer or government run system\nBut even if we did go to something like that there's plenty of opportunity in this industry for professionals like us to get into an add value to companies because companies are always going to compete for talent in this

I just wanted to say if a erratic circuit doctor get into that sir\n[noise] well very good thank you very much for your call a dog you want to take their own good dog\nSure um yeah I think so I think

evidence of sauce for for those young though she went on movement um and also you know we'll guarding the softening up for what's coming um yeah there there does seem to be quite a bit of um\nA speculation as to what might exactly becoming um uh there's there's a wider way\nOf of possibilities of but none of those really know the timing exactly and so um we try to limit ourselves on what what radical tonight total when we're going over a cue stuff uh to what we can actually point to and investigate\nAnd uh so we're we're pretty focused on the table that can be proven a because there's so much that's been speculative and too quickly you know unproductive\nOr I think that as long as we just stay on target ... are trying to trying to find out the truth of the matter I think we're probably okay so that would be my feedback what do you think rabbits\n[laughter] yeah I think that's right I think that what's going to be happening is we're going to start seeing\nThe arrest some of these people that we know they engaged in corruption\nOr we're going to have the size of a warrant for Carter Page declassified and we're going to find out exactly how the Steele dossier was utilized

it a few within my bones that\nWe're um\nWe're how's that song ... from a bedroom drugs ... and up to make our systems blow\nWell yeah yeah I'm feeling it are you feeling is\nI think we're winning and I think it's it's not just what's happening in America is what's happening worldwide news got out and also narrow and Brazil\nYou're seeing this reaction against Merkel in the open borders um agenda so I think that we're seeing really worldwide people kind of waking up to the\nThe agenda that the global S.\nSo I think that's happening I think you're seeing a rejection of political correctness there was just a study that came out from Harvard let's say eighty five to Ninety percent of Americans\nA bowler political correct yes actually only eight percent of Americans are what you would call a progressive activists\nSo I think that's pretty pretty promising\nBut we're also winning I Would say that um ... if you define winning as people coming together and being a common purpose\nAnd having an interest in truth and justice and why the things that have been done wrong\nI'm of bringing people or to justice been holding onto an equal standard with all of the others in the country I think that's a win that I think we're winning that I think what happened recently if we looked at the justice Cavanaugh\nA debacle it was intended to take the man down then goes a word for it they called it working\nWell he was going to be bored and as soon as a political operation launched it the last second by totally made up situation to make the guy looked back so much so could his tail between his legs and run away and cabinet didn't have the metal the statistic there and take it\nAnd basically stand up against it quite a quite a majestic moment as far as humanity is concerned because you know what sitting in the balance is the is the motion that you're innocent until proven guilty\nAnd here you had a woman who couldn't remember the day this place location chicken or member you know who is Dale who wasn't there how many were there and the rumor I'm and once she couldn't remember key patch\nAnd all of the fact that you couldn't remember changed over time and she went to the Clinton of course violated a polygraph experts quote unquote but that\nThey backed up the story which was offering out there and yet there was a big disconnect between the number of questions asked was she's will courted many many questions have so many issues exhausted she said yet the the agent involved but the one that ... we gave them\nThe bogus out that there were only two ...\nYeah then all of that that\nConstruction that evil construction of a lie a political agenda why um it didn't win the day one day\n... fitness one day I think that's how we're doing outside of the about the future I think that together as long as we stop looking at the things that divide as you start looking at what they might we have so much more in common\nI mean I can give blood ... anybody on earth and they all survived all fathers won't like what topics not what the no one cares what your skin color you know why\nI don't think anybody that has any position of interest in this movement as a general rule as any concern over race or gender or any of that other you know fictitious construction called gender politics\nBut some of the treasury ... notch could maybe\n... you know I'll tell you what that we'll be and this is the truth of the matter it's about the resurgence and the acceptance of God back in the public square that's what this is Bob\n... good and evil you know China and white it's good and evil right and wrong and and that's what it is that right actually what do you make of the walk away movement\n[noise] [noise] I think the walk away movement is very interesting and I think it's indicative of the geopolitical shifts that are happening we're seeing the younger generation and kind of reject the political correctness and they're kind of questioning\nThe narrative here and they can see them by us I think they can see also the unfairness of the you know double standards that the media has for the less they can use it and they understand it that you have this walk away from them then that is growing\n'em and I think that's just goes to show you even more that this is just what's\nHappening is that the way I Do get really high\nEven within the last thing I think there's a kind of a catalyst for this event Joe Scarborough from and then NBC morning show\nOn and on October third he ripped into its fellow media a patriots or they're over biased against Brett Kavanaugh says the media coverage of this has been so one sided it's been so biased\nPresumption from the beginning has been that every single allegation made against the judge was true\nEven Joe Scarborough pointed that out\n[laughter] so do you think it's because of the fact that they have been so desperate to fight President Trump life overplay their hand and it's become blatantly obvious to even you know your base like citizen out they\nWhich almost as though they were coddling delinquent who just couldn't help themselves and now they have causal dumb enough yeah\nYeah that's a path to have that they're out in the you know look at how the media is out there cheerleading of violence against conservative um and then you've got Hillary Clinton that just came out and said\nOh well you know we we shouldn't be several to our political opponents until we're in power again [noise]\nWe'll just pass a thrill\nDrivers up through him since the last time was on the bridge into my

pleasure and doing a little Facebook Live on ten cruises a Facebook page which would make sense you can go to a take a look at that it was filled with a with the\nCharm and authenticity [laughter] like when one point the images kind of went sideways you had to mess with that for a little bit but it was a it was always straight shooting from dead we talked about a\nA number of things going on in

messed me up here in Texas\nEverybody listening I'm a huge he would affiliates through the great state of Texas need\nTo make sure that I'm right about that it's not about me but it's about our state it's about our country and that means that if if that I think the blue wave is already dissipating\nBut is there a Democrat enthusiasm in taxes are Democrat enthusiasm all over the country in the first opportunity to Democrats have to interrupt the Trump agenda is the most conservative governance we've had since Reagan you bet there's Democrat energy\nBut the good news is there is Republican energy and it is freshly motivated the Kavanaugh hearings absolutely had an effect it\nUs enthusiastic about the way we acted I I mean when when all of a sudden conservatives on their list of heroes list Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins\nYou know everyone has been made better there has been in a conservative fine infusion and Lindsey Graham I I I Can't knock love the guy\nHe's dead wrong and immigration maybe we should check back maybe you got better on that too but on a whole lot of other things especially a war on terror national defense national security he's he's inspiring way correct and wonderful Lindsey Graham ah is it has been a joy to behold\nFor these last few weeks since that moment of magnificent righteous indignation\nThere in the Senate Judiciary committee what are you just gave it to a Democrat America for what they've done gave it to his Democratic colleagues for what they've done absolutely great and then Susan Collins a ... a wonderful woman\nOr a New England Republican meaning Swiss cheese conservatism right unless they we don't we don't do Republicans in New England the way we do Republicans in taxes or\nOr or or Mississippi or Utah right it's a New England Republican we used to have Democrats in Texas who are more conservative than some New England Republicans but as I said I'd rather have an are by somebody's\nName and the state of Maine then somebody in the state of Maine in the Senate with a D by their name so I've never sat at home Drummond my fingers on the table going oh Susan Valentine never lamented that you take what you can get\nAnd all we got from Susan Collins is magnificent clarity at hearings two principal and the vote that got us justice Brett Kavanaugh I Will be for ever grateful and meanwhile she better have food tasters\nAnd I am not kidding I mean they're they're\nThey're mysterious packages being center her home Lindsey Graham is being being spat on everybody's being dogged and screamed at an airport and I know it's a long walk from being screened at an airport to being shot\nBut today's violent left is something that cannot be ignored the unhinged laughed exists and I've\nI've just flat got to tell you if you are in the Senate and you were a yes vote on Kavanaugh a you better but I think our security is a very good idea\nAnd I am not kidding\n[noise] um here's an example of a of of of someone who was getting a little I guess\nThis is the Al Smith memorial foundation charity dinner in New York\nAnd uh a ton of money gets raised mostly for children's charities it's absolutely great and it tends to have a political keynote speaker engaging in moments that are not so dry and political right last year it was for example house Speaker Paul Ryan\nAnd this year they secured a keynote speaker who is certainly attracted some attention of late and that would be soon to be former UN ambassador Nikki Haley\nSo think about it okay Nikki Haley is your keynote speaker in the first time and she had last evening was about the selection process that led to her\nSeries about like Paul Ryan he's a boy scout and that's why I don't remember where I Am [noise]\nHere you want to buy things again right\nNow that he wanted an Indian woman\nOn the other day and [noise]\n\nHe okay [laughter]\nTime up of\nA brief worried about Nikki Haley I just love her\nOr she will you know when I make my list of my favorite un ambassadors ever which I guess I'll do if I ever had some time I buy and\nUh you know John Bolton on that list probably at the top of that was a ... or her and she's she's just great but as governor of South Carolina great I think one of the things I really like about her especially in this era where we are just poisoned by the\nThe ... of of Max Boot and a new annoying book from Ben Sasse and\nYou know and and God Bless Jeff Flake out a wish anybody ill I I Want everybody to just just go in there if you're going into private life just go do that and go do whatever you want to do\nAnd just just leave me alone with his hand wringing self lower the navel gazing you know conservatism is bad under drugs drugs the anti Christ just just take that and and walk down appear All
