I'm thirty one Eighteen were to visit [noise]\nAndme Milo Jamie ... your ... he led Mike Dennis ... Michael ... runs Samuels hand Larry the voices of am ten Seventy V. S.\n[noise]\nThis is the same if we take phone calls and we've got great cause all on the midterm election\nGoing to get right to him but I wanted to address the too close Senate race is right now\nOr in the country eleven days after the midterms and we're going to go right to your phone calls those are in Arizona and Nevada let's start in Arizona than a this is an open seat because of uh the the passing of Senator John McCain tell us about are the two candidates they're both both members of Congress\nNaturally Martha McSally versus cures in cinema during I on I'll be honest with you I think this is going to come down to one issue in the state of ... of Arizona's immigration and border security there is a very big divergence between the two candidates I'm arsenic Sally as closely aligned with President Trump on his efforts to secure the border and then work on and overall solution\nA here says cinema just quite frankly is not and I think that has been the driving force of\nOf really having the numbers move Martha ... way a matter of a month ago it looked like a two three four point advantage for years in cinema\nA now it looks like Martha McSally ended up by about a point or two a day early numbers there as far as registration sure do look like they're favoring or a but again during go back globally this is one of the two Republican seats the Democrats absolutely have to have if they were to take majority\nYeah I mean so again this is these are important races and they are down there within the margin of error\nEither candidate can win a but there's some momentum going behind the Republicans right now or take a listen this is just interesting the Democratic candidate congressman a cinema or she said this in a radio show this is coming back to honor a bit by thirty three\nBy more me as an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there and out and you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban now that I'm Sorry that's personal decision and I you know\n[noise] I mean I don't know why she said something like that find I don't care if you're going to fight for the Taliban but as a member of Congress I and then she says this about her own state by thirty for speaking to the very liberal this year that routes they should just a couple of months ago\nAnd they have signed a laboratory and democracy and and my hair at high school\nAh [noise]\nI had Lyme headline hey yeah right ... hey\nYou know that's not funny if you're running for your your so to be sitting in your state where you've got to issue serious\nStuff like that just to please a crowd I'm so again that is coming back um and I know that those those are bikes are being used\nAs a speeches are being used or to remind people that just to these people are just so many times and the Senate candidates they try to change who they are less finally let's get to the van and then it gets these phone calls the Vatican Dean Heller is a Republican incumbents are facing a challenge from a Democrat Rosen or what does it look like they're\nYou know Jacky Rosen a congresswoman or from Nevada again this was one of those are the stage the Democrats are really focused on early on they thought and they had a great job to flip this each US Senator Heller numbers were down a little bit\nA door and I think President Trump is actually played a big role in this state as well as\nA turning out for Dean Heller are the numbers have turned around and it looks like he's got about a two point lead there again a lot of national dollars are going to flow into this stage door and I think Dean Heller in a better position than Jacky Rosen is again it's ... it's a state that Democrats have to have if they have the majority so if you're in Nevada you're going to be inundated with ads over these last eleven days\nOkay we've got lots of calls [noise] try to keep your comments as short as possible so we can get to all of them let's start with Joe and North Carolina on line one Joe welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nI mean part of North Carolina [noise] I mean asking or as you know you see it in a year or two to ... say they still would have a democratic stove where they're Democrats or at least [noise] after the Kavanaugh saying they just can't vote Democrat [noise]\nYou know that is an interesting point right there I think that I Want to get as many calls as possible but I think we cannot forget the effect that Kavanaugh a behavior by the Democrats\nReally is what started this Republican beginning of the I I wouldn't say at a red wave yet but a comeback for Republicans not just in the Senate especially the city but also potentially in the house as well which we can get to it later show because there's a lot to talk about there as well focusing on the Senate today\nEleven days out back to the phones we go but I Do for Kavanaugh it was it was the beginning of this Republican kinda ... resurgence and uh the mid term elections or along with President Trump hitting the campaign trail a good a ... doing what he does best surely and Michigan on line to surely welcome to Jason Kidd alive\nI carry a couple of minutes or ... states going to be at the soccer and I think that could be Michigan ... and stuff against Debbie Stabenow three weeks ago he was appointed found ... in some competitive various things even or\nHe is a rock star if you have any ...\nThe one saying this again check on the website and definitely I I think what people are ready to sell it to about ... to vote for him [noise] so we we need to ... with our friends and neighbors and make them aware he is a wonderful ...\nThis summer and a lot of military experience rights and and again was twenty points down just six weeks ago is surging right now and Michigan State that President Trump did carry\nI I agree with surely I think this could be a shocker was on my list with Bob Menendez remember Donald Trump to Michigan Debbie Stabenow I should be able to win that state but John James has run a terrific a campaign look I won't be surprised at all to wake up and twelve days and find out that John James is never going to play\nA stab at all or even in is losing for Democrats would just be historic for Republicans I Will put it that way those would be one of those two soccer's I think um maybe maybe both of the people he could have too shocking states unless you go and Billy in New Jersey on line three are really well for the J suck you alive\n... thank you guys follow the market LA\nHere and like all the time um yeah I hear you\nOn TALK of carrying out I mean\nPrice shocks when ice skate wise [noise] um like when it came on the ballot charity care about what ... can candidate\nAnd a lot [noise] and I think you know that your hands yeah when we had a ... that ran on the farm out China in New Jersey into its sanctuaries gate and rage and actually why\nChristine credits that there is a cook laced with Kevin stops are out there but it's not going out and I\nI mean I think so and they see Billy that's fine but you do have this ah to give you some hope I get you I've lived in states and cities where\nThere are no Republican options no conservative options before\nA and a and it's disappointing but you've got a statewide race or that is very serious or was this a surging candidate against Bob Menendez let's mentioned that one more time than just quickly for people\nYou know you don't have that situation right now Bob you can use running a terrific campaign in New Jersey there is traction there so look it's not an opportunity where you can complain about who's on the ballot in this case you got a candidate that are right in the midst of it too or\nAfter Nick dot com Internet media start up advisor and founding member of the New York uh angels John currently advocates for truthful product labeling and as a full time parents have two young beautiful daughters they were so cute in the documentary I just I Love uh I don't know which one what are the names of your daughters John\nA to B is Fifteen though oh willows twelve\nWow well the one that was sitting in the little a swing and what you guys were talking about truth and secrecy that's right\nYeah it was so cute well you know so many so many people are so uninformed at including me and really how how far\nHow far in deep this problem really goes until I watched a documentary stink I finished yet to last night so let me ask you this\nAh let me say this first how sorry I Am about what happened to Heather uh your wife that died in two thousand nine or you know and thank you so much for directing this film because it truly is absolutely incredible it really is\nSick you um You're welcome and you know you say that your documentary as a love story and a crime drama can we talk about what sparked you to do this and the first place\n[noise] yeah I mean basically you know for people who haven't seen it I I bought my daughter her pajamas a and\nThey had a weird smell and so I wanted to find out if they were safe so I called the company and they gave me the run around and so the documentary as you mentioned was basically trying to find out what makes these pajamas stink mhm and through that process I discovered um\nA whole new world was unfamiliar with ... and it's got all at once you know you can know yeah um you know it's just going back you know just basic question the company should answer\nAnd I think that the you know the lack of transparency in the industry has just given people a false sense of security yeah and so to answer your question for my story you know I'm a single father so it's my job to keep my kids every parent yeah and I um\n[noise] you know to that that was my inspiration er I I had to do it because that's my job and then I hopefully you know other people when they see it will understand some of these issues that they may not have thought about but you know I think once you once you know it's kind of gives you a different perspective where you're looking at the auto a to a different lens\n... it was so brilliant it was the way you incorporate a different things like being on the phone with a consumer product Safety Commission\nAnd then you know because you asked you know what are they the ones that would regulate children's pajamas and they answered yes and the ... the astounding thing is that it's absolutely unbelievable that these companies can basically do whatever they want right\nUp to the throat and the thing is the worst part is the companies aren't breaking the law the problem is the law is broke\nThe law yet you know and\nSo if you can do is kind of ridiculous but let's take the the FDA the they they're supposed to regulate personal care products\nBut if you call them and ask them for a list of ingredients that they don't have them because if it's all on they're not allowed to ask\nThe so you wonder how can you regulated product if I don't know what the ingredients are allowed to ask for ... yeah well the answer is you can't and so you know the thing is I think that when you walk into a store and you see all these pretty packages and these grants that go back a hundred years I think we often confused brand recognition with trust\nYeah and you know a lot of people wouldn't buy a product they haven't heard of but they have much better and\nWhat you know you ... you made me think I Apologize for the interruption but I think this is so important in the documentary you are covered what pepsico and Coca Cola did when they took out when they were basically um\nYou know a called out on having Carmel coloring which is a known carcinogens as far as cancer causing and it was it proposition sixty five is that it where they were they would have been mandated or be or had the mandate what actually within the product they change the label they change the product rather than\nHave to put on the label that it causes cancer\n[noise] that's right and sadly a lot of companies don't really they're not very proactive about using more helpful ingredients into their publicly shaped\nOr or it's going to damage to the good will of their brand and that was good because what happened when coke and that's why my thing is like I I'm not a I'm a I'm a capital you know it's ... but there has to be transparent it's sort of this tentative of capitalism buyer and seller up that have access to the same information\nAbsolutely make good decisions but we've created this thing work companies as convinced a Congress that it's in their best interest to keep these ingredients secret mhm 'cause if if they do their competitors will know well I'll tell you what that all of the competitors know directly within her products because the technology to reverse engineer these bugs or forty years old\nSo the ... the only ones that don't order in the products were by far the people who buy them and the agency that regulates yes just absurd\nWell I think one of the most disturbing a disturbing industries is the fragrance industry oh my gosh\nUh you know I mean it's crazy what is in some of those fragments says and what I a multibillion dollar business business uh it is so you know in the documentary you talk about over eighty thousand chemicals that are circulating\nThrough Congress to us such as a state late found in fragments his cosmetics pesticides plastics cleaning supplies and clothing and that they are um ... disrupting chemicals or ABC's\nHow do these daylights harm the body and harm the environment\nWhile I think in general was you know obviously was ET sees their disruptive to your under control them\nAnd you know especially you know my concern I have two young girls very well and it's and developing body for things that can impact\nUm or lead to future health concerns um any Caesar or unique or a little different you know there's there's there's the expression the dos makes the poison it and sometimes that's true but with the seeds or it's a little different are they called like the dose response is inverted\nMeaning that it could be worse to add a little bit of exposure over a long period of time that a large exposure at once\nAnd that's why a lot of these companies say well there was a carcinogen or there's a dollar but it's only a little bit\nBut but I think that that adds up and obviously there's a cumulative effect going on but I I think we've gotta walk side of the fact that some of the things that we do that we we take for granted or just absurd\nMhm I'm like why would you why would you spray perfume on a plate to clean it you know every center you know dish washing liquid there's such a toilet paper mhm centered everything and it's just like to think about it it's crazy yeah\nBut we're everyone who doesn't want something that smells good right but the thing is like what what do you make the smell with well yeah and that's why I think that if companies to disclose everything they'd make better choices they sold and then the consumers could make better choices about what they bought\nAbsolutely and I have to say I'm going to speak for most women here I Would say that Ninety five percent of women are on the top of a dish washing liquid to see what it is well smells like before they purchased that and we were talking actually about dawn dish washing liquid last week because I had a hornet's nest egg them at my house John\nAnd I'm a autumn calmly who's a regular on the show recommended that I use dawn dish washing liquid which I you probably already know this is well that they use it to kill fleas on kittens a lotta times it's supposed to be really safe\nBut if it kills fleas and it kills hornets what is it doing to our environment and you're putting it on your dishes right and you're putting it on your dishes right and and I mean it's just it's kinda crazy yeah\nWhat are ... and I think you can look across most product categories\nDown I think people get caught up in the product creatures and that's by design and then they lose track of what chemicals are used to achieve that future for example\nUm if you're buying your pajamas and they say they're ... great you know who wants her to the burn up right but if I if I said well actually yes they're fleeing resistant but you should\nThat's the company or the flame resistant because we've sprayed it with a chemical that makes it flame retardant and it might cause cancer or the material itself in early ...\nThose are two very different thing most people don't know to ask that question but given the choice not to be facetious would you rather have you know ... with or without carcinogens if you asked that question about anything obviously everyone's sick without curses but you're not able to ask that question and they don't want to tell you the answer\nYeah it's it's really crazy and again you know I honor you for ... for doing for directing the film I it it truly is astounding the information that you've put out to the to the world and thank you so much for doing it we've got to go to a break and come back again we'll talk some more about it because I think there's so much to talk about\nAll right sounds good to say one less thing of course they will be on Netflix starting November\nFirst set is awesome news awesome oh my gosh well I Can't wait so so good to have you on the show thank you so much like British is what we\nDo a jet that John wheel in a a\nAnd we've got a great show continuing on here Dr Johnny boat is Stephanie tubes and Kathy ... stay tuned everyone you are listening to one life radio

thirty eight out the window and you know when we as women walk down the aisles I we just assume I think we all assume consumer protections\nThat when we buy something off the shelf and a lot of us by really expensive products because we think they're better write a there's a really expensive brand that way if you don't buy it from nurture but it shipped directly to your house it will say\nToxic all over the box and because it's\nIt's you know the ... bill that you talked about earlier so it's it's incredibly discouraging as a consumer at a parrot and as a woman that the products that you are purchasing just day to day you know doing your grocery run a target or whatever it is right\nYou have to be so careful that ... you know you I'm going to give you a shout out for working with duty counter beauty counter is a great company\nThe honest brand is a good ... I was in tree house the other day um that's where I got a great I go there to get my pain now and I have to tell you firsthand it's so funny so I repainted my entrance way like I Do every couple of years okay and the paint was already in the bar and it was purchased probably ten years ago\nAnd then I went to a tree house for the new paint it's paying\nFor my daughters that much Taylor softer more calming pink yeah anyway it was funny because she her room is adjacent to mine\nAnd we we painted her whole room there was absolutely no stink no pun intended absolutely no saying no headache but in the front entrance way just a small area that he ... the guy mark up painted the entrance way I had a headache almost immediately and permeated my whole\nThen I have high ceilings have have a pretty big on living room kitchen like combo\nAnd the feelings are like twenty eight feet high I couldn't even be in that part of the house just from the front entrance way being painted made me absolutely sick yeah gave me a headache and you know if you don't think it matters it it it does and I would encourage you if you are going to do any painting and they're not paying for this by the way\nA tree house is a great place to go to get a lot of organic products and organic paint\nAnd also there was a new we're talking about cleaning how many women clean every single day we're we're inundated with these chemicals and all of our cleaning products\nThere's a new company called supernatural if you go to supernatural dot com or Suzie I don't know her last name that she just she's the one that came up with um ... she just launched this new company of all these essential oil cleaning products that are\nBeautiful and safe and smell wonderful and I encourage you to check it out\nI think that's a great point because I think one of the things that you mentioned this earlier we all want to smell good we could smell good doesn't mean we have to use a synthetic fragrance or an unsafe thing it just takes it just takes a little more education and a little harder work right now and hopefully that work on the front end is going to translate to safer products on the back\nWell and you know what do you think I did the first thing I did when I saw those four bottles it's a system so it's good for the environment to four bottles with essential oil mixed with water and then a like a back up a starter\nSupport the essential oil in and then you're distilled water and you've got four new things without going to get four new containers of products yeah the first thing I did was an screw the cap and smell it yeah yeah and they were fabulous that's either way so\nAnyway a great talking about this so much more to talk about we got Dr Johnny vote and coming up in ...

now murdered journalist and on like what's going on why\nWhy are we responding why do we respond\nWell to answer that as if we don't respond you leave it to your opponents and with the media and that's what makes President Trump so terrific for a lot of us he doesn't let them get away with it\nHe said what would I listen to President Obama again I realized how upset I was when he was around and you know a lot of we couldn't respond he's got the bully pulpit now we have the\n... this is what changed looks like yeah that's what changed looks like great let's go to Jeffrey in Clearwater, Florida you're on with mark\nHey Mark I'm you've got a great job I'm really enjoying the show a lesson I I I'm\nI'm back from the old school I'm sure so\nAnd I have a I work a lot of the shows that are a yeah I'm In a reputable stations not to drive by media and I have never in my life thing any thing like what all been going on with people with a Democrat and I was always taught to think that Democrats\nWere out for the poor people to help the poor people and all that\nBut um I and I voted for President Obama twice well uh\nI'm Sorry I did that but I Love President Trump\nA I changed from Democrat to Republican I've heard that a lot of people have done that and we need I I Know President Trump is going to win because I Believe that got his hand on that now than it is a strong man he is a ... and ... man\nHe knows what to do he wants to do the right thing and they love this country and that's what we make right now if we don't have somebody like um what kind of lose our country and I don't understand how it hurt an immigrant\nOr you know I I don't mind people come and his country doing the right way and and I believe that the only reason that the Democrats want this to happen it's so they can get all the phone and put the Republicans out\nUh so I don't know I had a nightmare about ... what is it Seventeen thousand now that are the caravan common one what's President Trump what kept me when when they finally get here when with all those people I mean we don't get wrong for everybody\nNo ... in town yeah absolute\n... thanks by the way for switching over I was gonna say you have a lot of redemption to do but the voting for Obama twice but you made it up thanks few recall when he can do and he's doing he's going to bring the or the army or whoever the soldiers to the border you can't let these people in cars they immediately or a consider for asylum there's an invasion of her country\nThis is absolute insanity and the ... no matter what he does that going to get him that's what this was all about the caravan it was the the bombs everything's always about to get the president [noise]\nBy the way it's an issue that you care about more than any other one that's hitting the pocket books of American families hard they outrageous cost of prescription drugs in a recent poll conducted by Franklin's he got an earful\nWords like greed gouging and unfair kept coming up and there were lots of questions why does the cost of drugs keep skyrocket why up the cost of the top ten medications increased over a hundred percent\nWhat is the whole world's a whole system fuel rig there's an answer the big drug makers spend a lotta money lobbying to protect their profits over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be exact\nWe want solutions to prescription drug affordability it's time to hold drug makers accountable and put patients have a head of profits\nThey have their lobbyist and there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories and our votes it's time to end that monopoly and stop them from overcharging the American people each time once and for all to put patients ahead of profits citizens for truth and drug prices\nAcross America so Larry Elder show\nWant to say something about relief factor you know eighty percent of the people who've tried the relief factor quick start by it again it would not happen

from Florida I have my own business\nRequires a lot of muscle work I've always been concerned about painkillers messing up my liver when I heard about relief factor I decided to give it a try because it's natural now I'm able to get through my day with minimal pain versus before\nWhen I had to be almost in tears coming home and I couldn't do anything but lay down and wait for the pain to subside my pain used to take control of my life but now I Am in control\nWhy don't you try the three week quick start Nineteen dollars in Ninety five cents that works out to Ninety five cents a day for pain relief lets a cup of coffee a day just going to release factor dot com relief factor dot com that's relief factor dot com\nAm Seventy\nThe answer but almost gum and brought to you by values media now here's the cave is going to go\nOne more thing about the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process before moving on to other subjects the left will not move on\nWashington Post carried a front page story on Sunday about how the left will now campaign for Kavanaugh is impeachment they have to keep the anger momentum going at least through the election next month it isn't just about him it's about cleaning the power so that can advance their liberal social agenda through the courts\nThat's what it has always been about conservatives are accused of causing divisions because we stand against what they're doing and want to do why are they the divisive once we're trying to buck tradition not to mention morality and biblical truth that they believed in such things\nFundraising letters have gone

said Larry Elder [noise]\nPain free relief factor dot com studios [noise]\nFilling in for Dennis on Monday of eight years me say this I'm In trouble right doesn't like some years ago in large show\nMark ... I've done a lot of this over the years including at our former station\nAnd it's always a privilege to keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next to my Web page\nI like to some music you know he was he say I'm from Brooklyn now in LA and one of the songs I Love that\nBecause of defines me\nCheck my Web page out mark has to show dot com where you can email me\nFollowing me on Facebook or Twitter and Sean wants me to tell you out there why I'm not a Dodger fan\nIn a second so you can get in touch me mark I start at AOL dot com and check on my website and see where a filling besides the Larry or Dennis stuff like\nThat so the Dodgers and playing Washington I write\nAnd I and I always root against\nI'm originally from Brooklyn and they left me and when people here that they go\nWith you left Brooklyn too and I [laughter]\nI was a little kid but they did do that to us All right we're taking your calls at a eighty eight nine seven once agents for those are just joining us\nThe first hour we were talking about the bombs and the uh the accused and we didn't mention his name that's important so they don't get that kind of publicity if that's what they're seeking\nBut after we did that and said that how outraged that was an we acknowledge that we got into the idea that the press obviously wants to blame President Trump\nFor everything and anything everything is his fault that goes wrong and everything that goes right President Obama as you heard we'd like to take credit we we played a clip of in a minute or two of them in the last hour and it was hard for me to take\nBecause I forgot what he did all the time which is he would set up a straw dummies and then tear down like you said in the clip we have that to you know we want to rip babies a wave of that from the arms of immigrants no they're illegal immigrants and we don't want to risk babies away was your policy by the way Mr former president\nYou know we didn't change that policy needs to be changed obviously but it was your policy in the first place\nAnd we don't want to rip babies away in fact the real answer is don't come here in the first place if you're going to come illegally come here legally and there'll be no issue and who knows who setting up this caravan who's paying for all of it how they're getting here I've heard all kinds of rumors but the fact is\nHe's got to stop them it's an invasion you can't allow this to happen so we followed by others but again he can't do anything right and of course the things he says are the reasons that the suspect in custody did what he did it because of President Trump\nBut then we evolved into the point\nThat you know why they hate them so much among other reasons because he's the first Republican that I can remember in years who standing up to their nonsense who's willing to call it like it is\nIt's reasonable to ask as I mentioned last hour whether Hillary should be indicted for what she did she committed crimes and when I was sympathetic to her eye on another station another network people get annoyed with me because I said if they agreed to leave the scene forever maybe we could agree not to indict Hillary and people said\nShe's not above the law that's reasonable argument that's what they said lock her up that is not violent so it was just following the rules and principles that we all in this country are subject to the laws of the country what is so radical about that yeah but but yet when President Trump says it is absolutely outrageous\nAnd what else I Can't even remember what else they pick on him for what was the other issues besides lock her up that they say Trump keeps inciting the audience when I think of it I'll let you know\nBut whenever he says it's it's ... it's just terrible right all the press because the press the fake pressing a fake press do you mean\nThe people the enemy the people if they're not going to do objective journalism 'cause they have tremendous power\nAnd you know if they can if you ... ... people can't get the news and an object away I never knew when I was growing up what the politics was of the journalists who are reporting it that's not true that there are gender so clear he's right to call them out on it I think this is insanity\nWhen when the Obama could be outraged infuriate the rest of us and say things like you'll keep your doctor and you keep your health care and uh you know we're we're ... we we care about race people on our side and we judge people by the color of\nTheir skin numbered don't illegals all\nI've often said give me nine black women on the Supreme Court court conservative and I'm happy camper\nWhere the guy that always the race and gender and uh you know sexual orientation we don't talk that way we see individuals much more than a dentist and Larry always talk about we see people as people you are the guys that do this kind of stuff [noise] all\nRight let me know what you think and we'll take your calls at eight eight nine seven one stage and I hear I have an article Sean just gave me journalists accuse Trump of inciting violence against the press I mean I I I don't even want to read the article now because it's\nToo upsetting you guys have created this in the media because you haven't been fair let me know what you think well let's go to um I think we're going to go and guess is\nIs it angers I don't see the name out Alan ... there's a town called I stuck to Syria though oh You're welcome to the uh welcome to the ... show\nHow are you there okay we'll put out on hold and\nOkay and let's go to George in Hollywood, California Georgia Iran was mark\n[noise] yes [noise] Well Mark you know as a retired or a mental health professional I just have to say that the U.S one time media has finally revealed itself and it's ... years coats\nAnd I'm at this point uh the media and uh this a bomber individual both have some very prominent features of paranoid schizophrenia\nAnd I'd start with these uh a media nuts are saying oh that Trump is responsible for all of this a bomber stuff and he's responsible for the bomb well you know that's not only mind\nReading but it's thought insertion they believe that Trump has inserted\nThought into the bombers mind for him to go do it\nAnd the bomber of course well uh you know it's Fox Broadcasting and he's having a conversation with Trump through with television or maybe he looks out a picture of him in the paper the worst show I get the water or tell me what hardware store do I get the pipe that what about this other stuff\nWell the reality is is it individuals\nAre responsible for their own behavior and speech just moves air and people their motivations belong to them\nWhat they do is their responsibility\nAnd speech is protected for the president just as it is for everybody else\nAnd just like we've been talking we didn't blame a Bernie Sanders for what that guy uh with that a phony a you know Chinese a K rifle did in nearly killing Steve a school lease and um [noise]\nThe other people that were out there with the\nBaseball but the thing of it is is that um you know moving air with speech is one thing but behavior move physical objects and those things can either be helpful like somebody building a building\nOr making sandwiches are cooking a meal for someone can be harmful\nCatch you let me know what you think eight eight

we'll follow it a little bit more of a does say Kroger shooting suspect tried to enter a\nBlack church before killing to look very courageous out their their ... their ... none of us are denying that\nWhat we have a problem with his whole group of people are accused of that like you know Republicans are evil and we're racist or homophobic that's the problem we there we know there are nuts like the the guys up the pipe bombs we understand that but we all don't get guilty of that\nBecause of it we we don't take responsibility for\nPresident Trump hasn't done anything outrage look he's not perfect package he doesn't always say what I wanted to say but he's standing up to the other side which hasn't happened before and that's why you have the reporters are filling out that the a document with two hundred people signed onto they can't take it because they're holier than thou and by the way they're on the left\nThey're always on the left\nBreaking ATF news just recently the U.S
