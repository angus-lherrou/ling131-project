I Can't say that a\nCause of satisfaction with it\nSo I\nYeah I explain that to a similar audience just because they may be surprised if you just said that people were would be dissatisfied with tax cuts\nOr tax increase to ... states\nFocus again on the rights that was one of the focus it I can explain this to justify it ... this is how you get into these issues that are affected is why I appreciate these phone calls\nWas affecting races that we may not all DC is just national issues or maybe one of the tax cuts were coming through there was this idea that the blue states where the ... you had much heavier property taxes\nAnd you were able to you but you know you write that also you're no longer able to do that to to the the numbers you were able to do it doesn't affect people and a lot of the I'd say more moderate states or red states but in the blue as the blue states are these state these huge state bureaucracies\nWould tax we have these massive tax is the day that they would expect people to be able to kind of see it get have it from the ... through their federal taxes but you talked about how this will impact specifically this New York congressional races\nAnd I looked at it just real real clear politics of the toss ups just a New York New Jersey and I I'm counting up there for their uh right down the costs of category that's that are critical to\nHow the house of representatives ultimately whether it remains Republican or not um and then if you look at leading one way or the other or you can add another uh three are actually other five\nSeats in New York and New Jersey that are up just in the house of representatives so I Do believe it's important that we get updates on especially as we will continue to talk politics as we move into\nA ... or just eight days away that everything is not about a national issue or the big kind of got a big picture issues that that's\nPolitics is local to an extent as well as it sometimes you see that even more so I'm Out out in the congressional race in a house race the specific region and it may not get as much pickup nationally as\nThe big issues about you know economy but what are the sub issues on that or tax cuts for what are the sub issues are under that and how it affects how people uh will vote and now you've also got the you know they like this issue of the caravan\nThere are people talking about this all over the country I mean we're talking about it to all of all of us they now that includes people who are calling for you know upstate New York\nUm and people were calling on our southern border and everybody else in between you know from from it so so those who were directly affected in a sense by the individuals who would be making it across\nAnd then the whole country how it's affected as well take this on our department of homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen updating on and I want to remind people there's been an increase now and the amount of troops authorized from eight hundred to five thousand\nOr ... that will be along the border preparing for this\nAs are still the hope is to work with Mexico or to prevent a ... there's a massive wave of individuals are from coming to our border and then having to be process take a list\nOf ... or ... certainly fall on all\nThe way I have\nA ... ... ... ... and ... and uh like for territorial ... or early ... there are any is [noise] we'll go for\nThe idea that again gets the issue a hairy ultimately it does the United states implement the law that like Mexico should be as well\nOr if you are someone actually that is if you were actually someone who who should who is making a legitimate asylum claim you're supposed to make that claim the first place you're safe\nFirst place basically outside your home country so long as you're safe there what we're seeing is oftentimes in this case as people say that the Mexican government as it said stay here would provide support you have these specific\nParts of these groups that will show up in the Mexico City or other cities they say no we don't want to stay in Mexico we're not going to stay here so even though\nShe was trying to implement that it's also up to us to fully implement that which means rejecting claims right off the bat even if they are would be otherwise legitimate so it's just too tough situations\nIt and it is wise he got laws it's it's been an issue is that uh we we allow some wiggle room because you are you you could be then it would be rejecting claims it otherwise could be legitimate but for the fact that people are using those claims to only come to the country of their choice\nAbsolutely have to face on international law in international convention individuals who have legitimate asylum requests other words they claim refugee status but you're supposed to claim that status in the first safe countries they enter\nNo did yeah I've heard that some ... ... ... I Need we need it you know what you and I need to like do it or you or you do a book since you're the one with all the knowledge but\nBut ah yeah I mean the canned pumpkin helped take time and they love it yeah and they do so I'm going to get some canned pumpkin when I get home yeah organic yeah of course of course and then uh yeah so my daughter from was here over the weekend and I had my other dog was just like\nThis weekend we went to the veggie fair we went to the gluten free expo we had a blast we really is and there were so many bees at the veggie fast it was crazy I was joking because if it was anywhere else but you know we're all these begins we're the only\nThing I Do now everybody's\nLike\nNature we love anyone anywhere else that base Mac and they've been killing 'em but um yeah I was assigned to like gently swat\nThem out of my day [laughter] not bother me not going to think\nWhat one of them had some of my Irish here yeah it took a little I was a pain in the right place to be ...
