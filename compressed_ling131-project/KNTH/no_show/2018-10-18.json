answer [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nOh right yes I like the music run a little bit law have great song from hot chocolate love that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done this far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues in policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he city on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in the land then fine I'm okay with that but then we attributed powers it does not have a forty does not half\nWere granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the person up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans\nAre going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like them and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him think about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left or the right can we agree on something and let let's break this down\nA woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes should a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we can go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to use those honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism is the bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we half past\nHave been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sad thing is\nMost of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the lead to supposed to be team black right I began this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way\nI support a person's right to self defense and what is sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is sad or we've seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not to take this Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen them come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative doesn't\n\nPut out a an amendment to open carrying though he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile by people\nAnd Republicans desert Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profiled black people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yeah blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats\n\nAnd Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\n\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney\nWho basically\nSupported Obamacare lite\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be worst accepting things we don't want or don't believe do I have any liberal pardon me do I have any\nDemocrat black men out there who think that the government should have a right to profile black man how many Republicans do I have out there how many liberty minded the limited by the guy's going to say oh no man\nEveryone has a right\nTo be safe and secure in their persons in effect but that's where we're lacking dude dude they're just going to do yeah I did alright forget that's my like a throwback kind of deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a focus on liberty because we have our vision has become myopic because of this left right fight\nGuys let's support let's get on one page and say we can support and respect liberty for each other\nLet's use that liberty one of God's greatest gifts to man and he's given us a lot but one of the greatest God's greatest gifts\nLiberty\nThe right to make own decision you're listening to file chapter that is a

in in the sense that there's a level of sanity\nThat he displays in other words you you may disagree with them and all kinds of stuff but there is a kind of fundamental soundness to uh to the way he

was a agreeing with that and saying that there's something here his leadership of the I think it really scares people because they're used to having these kind of you know politically correct robots

punishment for crime or of the party show have been duly convicted\nK\nArticle says that the thirteenth man was used\n\nAgainst black people many of whom were falsely accused of crime falsely convicted of crimes\n\nAnd then they were used especially in the southern states tens of thousands of people quote overwhelmingly black where at least by the state the plantation owners privately owned railroad yards coal mines enroll building chain gangs and made to work\nUnder the whip from dusk to dawn often as punishment for petty crimes such as bankruptcy or theft\n\nAnd then the peace quote say professor who teaches at University of Hawaii who studied the convicts leasing system extensively quote the thirteenth amendments exception clause allowed to convict leasing system to flourish and grow\nThousands lost their lives in the process and it was hugely profitable for state governments it was also an important part of the establishment of the Jim Crow\nSegregation is system it served as a blueprint for the harsh redistribution of imprisonment that became tragically the dominant form of American incarceration all the way to twenty first century quote unquote so that's what he was talking about what people in the left however\nBelieve is that the thirteenth amendment or is what is causing so many people to be put behind bars they're always looking for some sort of scapegoat the prison industrial complex what does heal recall if the school to jail pipeline when in fact people behind bars are there because they committed crimes\nYou can make an argument if you want that the war on drugs has caused a lot of people are going to jail or otherwise would not be in jail but that you're talking about maybe Fifteen Percent of the people are in state and

negroes\nListen let's move on to talk about or somebody else a about Steve Harvey and I want to give ... to mark a Steve Harvey winter Trump Tower is taking a lot of backlash for meeting with the president in a life where do you make of this controversy you know\nI Love the apartment I respect for Steve Harvey and I think his intentions were act this is mark from audio ... or ... or appropriate rather but but my disagreement is the way in which he being you lose by folks like Donald Trump again hidden such as if they have a seat at the table\nBut when you're at the table you should have experts at the table you know people who can challenge the president at the table I don't catch themes that if if I'm Steve Harvey I'm bringing Michelle Alexander I'm bringing Cornell West I'm\nBringing a mighty Perry I'm bringing a big law I'm bringing Michael Eric Dyson outright and some folks with me ... hours and president and informed the conversation otherwise you know what you're saying oh my God 'cause that were real quick because all it is because they can't bring up comedians and actors\nAnd athletes to represent like ... is is the meaning it's disrespectful and it's ... and the thing they bring some people that there was some expertise Donald Trump they'll just for people to entertain\nSo you were so you're at the meeting you heard sorry but I don't understand how anything I say what part of that question but I I\nAm less and less Steve Harvey turned into a policy analyst in in my heart and St meaning it doesn't matter what I was I was like market at all the

is these words that Iraqi soldiers have been using a terrorist that Mars used more from our hill it's used they're perceived to be slurs within the black community given the way in the context in

say anything but it's insulting\nMichael ... says no man should be called ... called the woman horse race is okay for a black person to call another black person is conservative a mediocre negro or a

don't care if you're on the right the left or the center no man should call a woman a horse face especially the president of the United states\nSenator Cruz also deeply deeply offended no man to call a woman a horse race no woman should verbally intimidated middle aged white survivors should they which is what somebody was accused of I Would need a broader or I Need to keep bringing that up\nOh look around the world and the fact that our president is engaging in a Twitter war with a porn star of someone who ... denied having any knowledge of uh having been paid off by his personal lawyer\nUm
