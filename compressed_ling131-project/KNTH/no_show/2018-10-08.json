E. triple late nights every once every two or three but first the bombshell New York times story Trump engage in suspect tax games as he ... richest from his father\nAnd a few minutes we're going to talk to an expert\nIntact with estate planning to find out whether or not the president and his family engaged in law ...\nAnd tax avoidance schemes or did they do something illegal let me read you part of the articles of very very long article some of us would probably prefer to wait for the movie\nThe contrary to Trump's assertion that he received one million dollars from his dad and turned it into a ten billion dollar fortune it says that he received in today's dollars at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\n... much of it through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen nineties into for [noise] participated in dubious tax schemes during the Nineteen nineties including quote instances of outright fraud\n\nThat greatly increased the fortune they receive from his parents investigation by the New York times has found that we're going to ask my expert did the Trump family engage in quote outright\nFraud [noise]\nSaid that much of the money came to Trump quote because he helped his parents have dodged taxes she and her siblings set up sham corporation disguise millions of dollars and gifts\nRecords indicate that Mr Trump help his father taken proper tax deductions worth millions help formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings\nThe article said quote the maneuvers met with little resistance from the IRS calls but what does that mean met with little resistance you mean it was lawful you mean the Irish didn't care I mean the IRS didn't challenge it what are you saying\nSays that Fred and Mary Trump from parents transferred\nOver one billion dollars in well to their children which could produce a tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate than imposed on gifted in inheritance is but the Trump paid\nOnly about fifty two point two million or about five percent of that\n\nQuote according to a tax experts it is unlikely that Mr Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes because the X. happened too long ago and are passed a statute of limitations\nThere is no time limit however on civil fines for tax fraud I'm going to find out from our expert whether or not the president should be worried about a civil fines for quote tax fraud quote unquote\nNow what is this based upon\nTime says the findings are based on interviews with Trump's former employees and advisors and more than a hundred thousand pages of documents describing the inner workings and the men's profitability of his empire they include documents from public sources mortgages and indeed probate records financial disclosure reports\nInvestigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records bank statements financial audit accounting lectures cash disbursement reports invoices cancelled checks\nQuote most notably the documents include more than two hundred returned from Fred Trump his company's in various Trump partnerships interests\nWhile the record do not include the president's personal tax returns and reveal a little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad dozens of corporate partnerships and tax returns offered the first public accounting of the income he receive for decades from various family enterprises\nSays Fred was a relentless in front of creative ways to channel money to his children that Trump when he was four years old with already earning two hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars from his dad quote the most overt fraud was\nAll county building supply and maintenance\nThat the company formed by the Trump family in Nineteen Ninety two cars in New York Times all counties ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for ... for Fred Trump buildings\nBy everything from boilers the cleaning supplies it did no such thing records an interview show instead all county siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump's him empire by simply marking their purchases already made by his employees\nThose millions effectively untaxed gifts then slowed to all counties owners Donald Trump his siblings and a cousin Fred Venus the padded all county receipts to justify bigger ... increases for thousands of tennis\n[noise] again I Will ask my expert in just a few minutes did\nDoes any of this amount to something illegal doesn't amount to fraud I'm holding in my baby brown libertarian fingers in article from force magazine data July eight year of our lord twenty fourteen headline how the one billion dollar Kennedy family fortune defies death\nAnd taxes\nQuote protected by a labyrinth of trust as well as tax credits that would make jokes at the Kennedy proud that can be fortune now spans approximately thirty family members including the surname Shriver offered and Smith\nThe bulk of the family's wealth is held in trust which range in value from tens of thousands too much at twenty five million nearly all are managed by Joseph keep Kennedy enterprises located in New York City the trust also protect the family exit from another set of prime fingers uncle Sam's\nBy holding assets in so called dynasty dynasty trust which are past ... air to air for decades if not longer the Kennedy family is largely insulated from the estate tax\nHandled correctly a dynasty trust could potentially maintain and on taxable fortune indefinitely the oldest Kennedy trust on record dates back to Nineteen thirty six\nAnd then they talk about the sale of the family's most valuable asset the iconic merchant my merchandise marching in Chicago\nOnce thought to be the largest building in the world and thanks to a carefully crafted deal the Kennedy family differ or possibly voted completely capital gains tax on nearly half the value of the sale\nThe secret sauce however is accepting partnership units in lieu of cash to first capital gains tax\nIf the partnership units are placed in trust capital gains taxes could potentially be deferred for ever into quote\nWhen one of the Kennedy family members who and handles this trust was contacted Christopher Kennedy said and I'm quoting we are a very public family with a very private investment philosophy ... wonder how many reporters the New York times ever put on the\nKennedy family and how they have their money in these so called generation skipping trust to defer taxes indefinitely if not\nForever\n[noise] we'll put another one up on Larry on the dot com called Joseph Kennedy and generations skipping trust in this article written by a truck from the state lawyer about what the Kennedy family has done\nAnd how they ah\nGot the attention of Congress for it says that Congress a became aware of these so called generation skipping trust and try to do something about it but whatever they did critic other loopholes that other tax lawyers are driving Arnold Schwarzenegger's\nHummer through did the president\nOr his father engage in illegal\nTax fraud or did they simply hire very shrewd people to minimize their tax liability the wave virtually everybody does including John Kerry who say five hundred thousand dollars from his yacht by arguing that he's more and get in Rhode Island even though he\nReally half of the Massachusetts because Rhode Island doesn't have the same amount of taxes did\nThe president or his father engage in anything illegal or talk to an expert about that when I come back also [noise] the vote on Brett Kavanaugh maybe this week and the FBI report could come out any moment now I Am Larry Elder do not lead\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I make sure I'm suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars of the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be or the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return was four hundred and twenty thousand dollars might not say four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left\nThat would be the value of the gift now a decade later there's been improvements\nAll around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell my children sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they\nKeep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got ... times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain the leverage of real estate so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was one it was given\nReal charge recharge is my guest season attacking estate planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nBut well the one that I really found to be a very serious as there's there's a there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape or you know just ... drowning in debt\nThat apparently his father a sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of ships\nFreedom and put you on hold for for ... for for this we're gonna pick met on the other side I remember when that happened some some guy went in there and bought three point five million dollars worth of chips\nGiving essentially the casino amount of money in cash and didn't cash the chips that basically gave Donald Trump a three point five million dollar loan from his dad as far as I can recall we'll find out what the problem

thing is those trusts were created before much of the tax laws that Fred and Mary trust marry a Trump were subject to\nA were passed so for example the Kennedys die before the uh Nineteen eighty

Joe Kennedy was not exactly the cleanest a a living person alive and I'm sure that there are\nThere were problems or ways that he skirted the tax laws um I just don't know\nNow the article the New

jeopardy\nWell I mean the IRS has been scrutinizing the Trump family for many decades I I just I just can't imagine that suddenly they're going to say oh look what we found\nAnd now they're civil

Wharton School and hand but both he and I were actually at the undergraduate school but he I Believe graduated in Nineteen sixty seven sixty eight and I didn't start there until the fall of sixty nine so we didn't we were not contemporary ...\nWhen you read the New York times article did anything occur to you they gave you an idea of what to do or what not to do it did anything pop up when you say wow I never thought of that or it boy that's a bad idea\nNo I mean the the article does talk about the most important part of their\nA movement of wealth downstream wants to do things to be value the gifts because our gift in a state taxes are what we used to call in Latin class at the lower them they're based upon the value at the date of death or in the days get it on a date of the\nGift and so there are techniques which are used to diminish the value of the of the gifts so for example\nIf I were to give you a twenty percent uh ownership of my house just to be for me to Larry Elder over twenty percent interest\nBut instead I ... that that's one value twenty percent of whatever the value is because in California we have the ability to pursue to sell the property if you worry partial owner fractional interest on the other hand if I put it into a partnership or limited liability company the whole property\nAnd in that in the uh organizing documented says nobody can partition this and reduce the only person who can make decisions about the property\nThen you have in your twenty percent you cannot sell it\nAnd you cannot a manager so I have the management control and I have the ownership control and that diminishes your twenty percent so if you went out and tried to show your twenty percent interest in our partnership\nIt would be far less than twenty percent of the underlying real property so I just diminished the value that has been accepted by the IRS and the courts and the only thing that the IRS argues with practitioners like me is what is the discount that is allowed\nVery commonly it's twenty or thirty percent that's a kind of a safe harbor these days\nWhere we have just one minute left of the Washington Post I'm Karen ... ah she's a reporter with them

with how Frank and lost his job in the Senate side\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr Clinton ... back in Nineteen Ninety two let's revisit\nThe government has a character problem but I take it that you're a loaded up and has no Caroline I'm In Colorado is that it owns well let me do is to not denied that he is engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he was talked about the draft and to some people it's a character brother Bill Clinton's\nPasses character test throughout his life and throughout this campaign and he's two senators commitments to real fights and what he's been doing this campaign is focused on his pointing to the American people on the jobs in the education that's what the American people care about they want to move into the future they don't want to be diverted by side issues that are not going to let the Republican attack machine divert\nThat was then and this is now\nAnd a number of other Democrats should have the same type of for it they look the president is her family like question every single time the president is taking the side of the man against women users that's not true isn't that\nAn amazingly annoying when we go back again Nineteen Ninety two George putting up a list\nOf names and says I can send your facts with names addresses phone numbers of us who unit affair with\nThis is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him without an allegation that the bill Clinton had an affair\n[noise] it wouldn't make a truce it is completely\nIf he went on the radio\nAnd said that Bill Clinton is the father of illegitimate black child he wouldn't be laughed at ... I think you're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] you never know you\nKnow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again\nWhat is a reporter doing working a democratic politics\nYou're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] in other words that we can\nSo you were threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\nMaybe don't want to say a matter of you will be embarrassing for the national or people will think nobody will believe you\nThis is again George Clinton was Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton or a Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people will think is competing\nWith the alternative is you don't do it cause any some temporary and people who tomorrow I'm going to matter and you have a campaign that understands and a difficult time [noise]\nAnd did something right [noise] um\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence for corroborate the other individual stories and there's been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talk about the Brett Kavanaugh that they know\nAnd they're confident that these things didn't have a final question what is the president right\nJulie sweating it gives the one who claim she observed Kevin are participating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she says she herself as he was victimized but can't say whether or not a Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened was as comfortable telling us what happened to me\nIs probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen to any human day my body was violated [noise]\nMy soul is broken a I was not able to have somebody stop when I said no stop [noise] you ... I felt like somebody took me and basically said you're worthless there's\nNothing to us you are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes\nTorn from different rock show um I was touched everywhere\nAh I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assaulted a woman it was horrible I had no way to fend them off\nYou know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people with ... [noise] I cannot specifically say\nThat he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before this happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw\nMark judge there and they were hanging about the area where I started to feel disoriented and we're the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing I can share them laughing and laughing\nVery hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody says something because if Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world that he should get scot free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court he just I\nThink ... if he does I there's no justice for all\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door\nOr ... or the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yes\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause and girls to become an ... an disoriented so\nThey could then be gang raped and inside rumor bedroom by train as numerous boys I have a fair recollection of seen boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room these boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh what\nDid she say for you to say well and so what happened and he happened to me I didn't put two and two together\nBut I Would see boys standing outside of the rooms congregated together sort of like an outlet and I didn't know what was occurring out that I Would see them laughing a lot of laughing I'm standing in line outside or an online but definitely huddled by doors and I didn't understand\nWhat it could possibly be and and your declaration you describe Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge\nStanding outside seen them stand outside the door yes with other boys singers think yes thing that in hindsight you think he was involved in his behavior I Would say yeah I I it's just too coincidental\nNow here's what NBC's Kate Snow said about the things that putting it fit on camera there were different from her written statement\nWhat we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story\nOur reporting we want to be very transparent\nBecause these are very serious allegations Kavanaugh has called Julie sweating story nonsense and as far as the president today questioned her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her claim there\nAre things that she told us on camera that differ from her written statement that we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who remembers intending parties with two is sweating again Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so far we've not found any one whole numbers that she's also unclear\nAbout when she first decided\nOn NBC's this week called me up and he asked me about the monopoly is whether he had been found to have live and I said Sam how could you leave this going on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know he's a multi millionaire he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a stepping off ... under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell I had a very good memory the memory you know the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was\nI have no specific regular recollection means I remember something I Can't remember now on the front of the rhubarb justice so no he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to live under those\nWere given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nBut it's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you\nWrote a book called the war room which became a documentary where in that book he admitted to working with Hillary Clinton to address false\nAllegations by your accusers but Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented in ironically Laurie in today's world from the left has judges who are out of control denying an allegation\nIs enough to say that you think someone in fact the correct It's got to lawsuits right now because he denied that he sexually harassed or any women\nHe's probably left his judgment allowed to go for ... forward in time to change and we now are and what could affect the civil war between left and right and the judges are furthering the civil war\nMary claiming as the founder judicial watching freedom watch Larry I was having a conversation the other day with a buddy of mine is about my age\nAnd he said he told a friend of yours about George Stephanopoulos role in the mining these women she ... the the friend as it is also a middle aged unaware that Stephanopoulos even worked for Bill Clinton let alone that he was involved\nIn orchestrating the the strategy that was later on called the nuts for slot strategy unaware of it so if this guy's a middle aged guys on wherever the mansion with people in their forties thirties twenties\nThink of George Stephanopoulos they have no idea he was involved no connection whatsoever\nNo they don't and I might add Jennifer Flowers actually brought a lawsuit against Stephanopoulos

Bill Clinton with her admitting to at a fair and that got a lot of news for ...\n... is it true you speak French Italian and Spanish\nAs the parts of the time fluently I can get finance [laughter]
