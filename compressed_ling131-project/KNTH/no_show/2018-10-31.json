S. practical use of the show which was that on\nOn our guys disgusted that we want to get some more calls is it what we have these unbelievably over the last year where it's touched them welcome civic group because the British based on immigration out by\nWhat race you are but nationality you are or wherever else he taught but second one is most important is that people outside the U. S. though our laws better than we do they know how to manipulate it\nYeah there are so many loopholes and inconsistencies and our laws\nAnd I think the average American the caller's right we do not understand it people that are trying to get here they understand it very very well but there is no real definitive statute that deals with what we're talking about today and they're certainly not a not a Supreme Court president\nAnd that's why I think what the president is doing will force our hand as a population to actually deal with this and to come up with something that they can be articulated and that is understood by everybody\nIt smells a call illustrates the necessity of reforming\nThe U.S immigration system so I think President Trump is why or to suggest change change is necessary in part because many foreign nationals fully understand the loophole already exist in us\nLaw heroin color from Austin, Texas on line to Carol welcome to Jason show live\nMy point I think I really I I totally agree that that's happening as to began at ... I'm Sorry [noise] understand why Trump when I order like now I like like I say under\nThose kind of ... and\nHow he wants to govern he has said that but sometimes it's the only option [noise] um you you could do this is a short term if if you ... it's\nA it is ultimately decided he has the authority to do this this will be a stopgap it does not guarantee the future presidents\nWill not do an executive order but you could start the process to do legislative reform and then ultimately um I get this before the U.S Supreme Court even even if it leaves constitutional reform as well or or or\nIf the Supreme Court decided this has to be admitted\nTo be more clear if I Do I think you could definitely be a [noise] a statutory I Do but I just said you're concerned about what the executive order but sometimes you got to\nDo what you can [noise] and it's kind of stopgap measures when you've got a problem hoping that you get to the long term solution which executive orders or not this this is not a president\nWho wants to govern by executive order a but but also is or if he's got the power to do face there's not a reason not to utilize that power in the meantime\nWhile continuing to work on more\nPermanent solutions that are giving outfit forgetting today this is all we have let's try to take these final a true cause of the day G. T. Connecticut on line five and a genius IQ alive [noise]\nYeah thank you I have a statement of fact I have a question for all the listeners my statement of factors that there is a political part of the Democrats or lawlessness illegal immigration or the or the jail either Republicans or laws now the question I have are all the listeners is\nAnd ... oil or can that can happen you can have a dial oil my saying it right why my my ... yeah it was what I Do that a CBD Oil um sold and drops supplements and added to food is counted for is a I've never heard before before I keep calling a powers\nHave you ever again so I'm not\nI'm not misspelling ... I'm not mispronouncing it a G. I. T. A. akita\nI keep calling it without the high end the judge didn't really you know I've never heard the word um anyway okay so all I can think of is a well never mind okay so much for being veterans\nComes from animal studies but there's some promising human research to one small study found that people with social anxiety experienced fewer symptoms including cognitive impairment\nAnd a negative self talk or when they took a CBD supplements so before speaking in public and research also shows that CBD increases um\nYou would know this and then ah demean might undermine there you go and that divide a feel good brain chemical or it may also influenced the release of neuro transmitters that control moods and behavior\nI guess that's what I'm experiencing an change blood flow to the brain regions link to fear and anxiety so you know should be a really good show\nAnd you know it's interesting as well I guess we'll just it's like a PSA consider this a public service announcement if if you as a little anybody in the listening audience has any sort of a fear squeamish thing around talking about how or\nCannabinoids or CBD the best time you just get over it because this is really the medicine of the future we'll little really wrap our arms around\nWe're not talking about marijuana here we're talking about him which is practically same plant but different kind of a complicated discussion but when you understand that we have a system called the ... system which is just like our cardiovascular system in our lives the sun and very ...\nAnd we need and do ... in our body or body actually makes them um and if we don't have enough of them just like any of the other things you mentioned hormones are old transmitters we aren't wow so we've been getting some of these things and plants without really knowing it\nFor a while but now because science is advanced weaken\nFiremen and made us absolutely sick as a nation absolutely um that yet\nBut you know I think we can credit big pharma a little bit for what's hopefully about to be an opening of the floodgates of understanding because they have a patent pending on\nCBD Oil for childhood epilepsy and so that alone should help everybody just hopefully take a deep breath and say okay you know what why don't we embrace what is in our plan right and in nature to help us with our wellness instead of\n... in fact I mean a lot of the drugs out there were once a plant that came from red use rice I Know why he is a very heavy oil is actually the very same type of\nThing it can rise from a plant where you ... ... and a supplement form just uh I think in the ... magazine or that they're selling this that read these rice is this I didn't I was like what is this I've never seen that you just answered the question yeah interesting yeah ... ... a\nComponent called ... which are\nYou know companies can't make claims around them on a ... but that's basically what the patents that and ... I Hope for cholesterol and long story short what we have in our plant world and how we move our body and how we take care of herself\nThere's plenty out there to keep us while mhm and so just embrace the story around ... and the other hemp isn't the only thing by the way that has ... and so I really think that's going to be the next big story\nYeah well I Believe olive leaf extract or olive leaf does an oregano right a lot of these things that have the same type up that they have could have a Dial M pepper\nOil or you go Rosemary there's a few things and\nIf we get so sideways I mean what has happened to be in the to get so far removed yeah and\nAnd Jill is making a little a mining the pay for it yeah she's running mining yeah money money money I absolutely and you know that that the very root of it and I feel that someone is known about CBD Oil could have a dial for a very long time and just you know big farmers but making too much money for so long they didn't they want it to be kept a very good secret\nBut I have to tell you I'm I you know I took it this morning and I take it every morning but this morning I took maybe a little more maybe I Need a little more with the uh when I'm under such a heavy stress load but I feel amazing like I really feel amazing my mind is clear I even came up with a billion dollar idea like thirty minutes ago and I kid you not\nThis is where you know I'm not going to trade my own own own or with the world no no I'm not saying anything to anyone but I came up with a brilliant idea and I can't wait to show the world ... now it's got nothing to do with the but it it I don't think that we talk about on the air a lot but ah\nYou know we have an amazing ... now when our sweaty potty already did that and I and by the way that well that I take as a temp which is one of our sponsors or the HMO company um and you get twenty percent off first order if you put use the code O L R which stands for one life radio\nSo um okay so I have this more ... oh gosh there's\nSo much to talk about today okay let me ask you this have you ever heard of a climate ... do you know what that is no okay so this is the newest thing diamonds you know what a climate ... like they're\nNever heard of it keeps changing the temperature and the you know for me I never touch it started out it brings a foul\nYou know what it is a diamond you know what a climate of it before okay so a climate ... is someone who's diet up as a primary goal is to reverse climate change so they they they eat foods that are only good for the earth wow that'd be\nAwesome I mean right you got time for that and you want to go that far into the rabbit hole then more power to ya\nIt's crazy it says adopting a more plant based that reduces the relative risk of coronary heart disease\nCalled ... rectal cancer and type two diabetes by twenty to forty percent a livestock farming produces from twenty to fifty percent of all manmade greenhouse gases\nAnd you can reduce your footprint your carbon footprint up by a quarter by cutting down on red meat such as beef and land and we actually have the author of the book\nHook today a history and science of our two point five million year obsession with me I Can't wait to talk about her book it was fascinating\nScience how it all began when we were like little microorganisms and evolved over millions and millions of years ... really cool stuff but oh gosh the moral question okay I'm running on time okay everybody quick so my daughter rescued a dog this morning a little bit ball he had id on even had a home\nHome again uh you know microchips and so\nShe said mom what do I do and I said you got to find it find its owner of course to make a long story short here's what happened if the dog belong to a homeless person\nAnd it was adopted from an animal shelter in Norman last week to a homeless person I say\nAwesome I say what an incredible match a lot of people would disagree with me and say oh it needs a really good home but a good home is a home where someone really loves you and when someone is homeless you know and I'm sitting here preaching instead of getting your feeling so I'll stop talking what do you think Joe\nGreat I don't have an issue with it may not have an right\nI don't know how to read it I I started thinking to deepen will how are they feeding and they're feeding themselves but you know what if that keeps that person mentally well right is there some literature to show that this dog upkeep that person homeless person mentally well\nThen on the mall or a woman in his dog or her dog [laughter]\nIt's just it's a match made in heaven and if you're homeless there should be SF right there and they love it I Love it I\nUm that's the story so\nWe're going to go to break without going to find the owner we've already I question that had a problem with more questions and many many got locks from his own your own or no down my heart Brian and I said it was registered to without a homeless shelter right oh yeah\nSo maybe they know the man or woman owner and they could help yeah we know yeah Bobby ... from time to time we do well and the moral\nTo that story as you've got to help their neighbors and you got to help homeless dog stand people so everyone and got a great show coming up we've got ...\n... she is the author of the book need hook and David ASL is coming up

anyone talk about it or think about it but it's kind of like an old fashioned principle and in some way you know related to what we're talking about because it's that you know the\nThe person that holds the the the purse strings controls the relationship and I don't think that any person be man or woman should ever be in a relationship like that would you agree\nOh it's so on and healthy and
