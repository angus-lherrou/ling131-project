call us a call now one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten you still have time to get on the broadcast today one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to let me go to west Smith\nWho was a again a kernel of the chapel and in the U.S army a show or when you talk to a number of times about the situation turkey as we update of people are past approaches\nA situation but I wanted to get your thoughts on his release you know as a minister seeing him Neal and prejudice just your reaction to the that twenty four hours of of a release a from a what was ultimately house arrest in Turkey after a year and a half a prison or more than a year and a half or prisons\nAnd uh you know stopping over in Germany at the military base and landing at joint base Andrews which you are based in and then um and then being in the oval office with the president said a prayer for the president\nYeah pastor Brunson is uh his spiritual and personal integrity a was really on display and not in a break and there's just way on his part but when he prayed for the president and then just this whole demeanor his attitude\nHe very quickly said that he forgave his captors and the officials in Turkey who not only arrested in under false pretenses but they miss treated him part of the time he was there and just say that he forgave them immediately was a\nPowerful powerful witness that in addition to him praying for the president in the oval office it shows the the the real a character of the man himself\nYeah I wanted to make sure you all had a chance to hear from everybody in our team who had been working on this comedy though this to the radio broadcast or to get west west his comment on that and we pastor Brunson but coming back or to be on the air with us lived to borrow\nA Jay Sekulow alive let's get right to the phones a lot of calls coming in our politics Michael's called to that because Michael is when it was one of those folks so I said you know are you actually getting involved with the campaign he at the headquarters you volunteer and Michael uh you're doing just that give us an update\n[noise] uh I just want to let you see them you know that um [noise] you know Dean Heller a as a as a last friday he was a ...\nYou know I had not that much but he was still ahead [noise] and there's a lot of young [noise] ah people out there are young Republicans getting out there and and you know getting a a report out on the street or to get out and vote but I just wanted to let let everybody know that it's not just us old guys anymore\nThat is a young people that are that are out there now\nYou know I Will tell you as soon as worked on a number of campaigns young people play a very important role in that grassroots efforts of the campaigns are\nNot taking away from any of our anybody older but you know knock it on a road doors or it takes a lot of time energy if you're out in Nevada and the heat or you could imagine or in other places where it could be cold [noise]\nUm is somewhere in between uh you know a hills I listen to they they they fire up campaigns young people and it is important uh that you see that kind of enthusiasm around the candidate is on everything grass grab but grassroots plays a very important role in mid term elections and saying that race in Nevada is key\nYeah the Nevada race Jordan as we talked about that is one of the races the Democrats absolutely have to win and if they want to be the majority in the United States Senate and that race like many of the others are has moved decidedly and Dean Heller direction I think if you look back a couple of months ago I think you would have probably prefer to be Jacky Rosen in that race I think right now you prefer to be\nA Dean Heller and it's followed the national trend that we've seen but er during the common I Would make about that races the Democrats and don't win that seat they won't be in the majority in the United States Senate that's out of it all it is\nYeah I mean let me let me go to west or west you you you know your thoughts just as the it seems like the mood has changed\nYes one of that is the president is back on the campaign trail and doing what he does best\nWhich is a those rallies and they are are now happening you know almost every day or or or even sometimes too and one day and it will continue to ramp up we've heard from uh the the uh White House are and so you made clear the president will continue to be on the road even you know today's surveying the damage it for what he's doing his job as commander in chief is with pastor Brunson on\nA Saturday but his back at a campaign rally or you know that's\nA following that showed me he is he is out there um it does seem like there's been just a shift I I I and I I don't just say that because I'm a conservative it just it just seems like with the Kavanaugh what happened there everything's just started changing going or the opposite direction for Democrats who were on the ticket least electorally\nAbsolutely they were producing a blue wave and I think many people you know or believe that I certainly was concerned you out there that they may not be right but here's the thing you're in the American people by and large or a decent in kind people\nAnd the political climate has changed and it's been so ugly you mentioned kept uh you know justice Kevin all that happened to him look at recent statements by Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton\nAnd Elizabeth Warren are that are really mean spirited kinds of things and I think the American people are turned off on that and when they see these kinds of things going on not only does it energized the GOP based to get out and vote which needs to happen but\nIt moves independent voters also in the name of decency and kindness which is a value of most Americans it moves them also to vote for the Republican candidates that the Democrats really a snake or living when they ought to be running because of their own miscalculations\nTheir new wearing the values and the concerns I Believe that the average American a middle America in southern America and I think it's going to come back to to buy them and the midterm elections is a real possibility of that but to answer your question is the political climate and the ugliness that is on the one hand turning off American people\nOn the other hand energizing them in the midterms to go out and vote\nYeah let's go to Joe in New York on line one Jonah welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nYour guys' first of all the bad ... gradually says I don't really great work best a bright sunny and warm start on the entire nation to have that at an ... an hour back to the point that the elections or you know\nWe have a we were we when we were shocked and surprised er into thousands sixteen and that's before\nAll the enormous accomplishments that the president of having these last two years so why shouldn't we expect shocking surprise again further\nOr you know there's about three days twenty five or whatever days between now on that seemed like a lot of time but the way this president ... wins a lot of time it's it's ... ... ... ... saw their accomplishments\nActually right I think you're right I mean I think that listen or the the one difference between now twenty six to use it does the president is out on the campaign trail\nIn many Democrats are saying you know it's a referendum on him um he is not actually on the ballot turnout will be much lower it always is a mid term elections are but I Do think that or it could you know and it should be higher for Republicans than predicted\nI can just freshly might might floors and let them in and out and if it's raining this little ... yeah so yeah yeah but I had a blind eye to that but yet they made me think for the last night with a thunder and lightning and it was like raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens and like them from the movie oh my gosh it's so Mick got like right up almost on top of my head I\nGet to know what does it matter where the next thing I Know that of course he was he was already out there then some of the cats came and then he came and it was like it was just going from the movie yeah yeah I had a kid\nIn my bed I had my Afghan Hound I mean she's trying to like knock on my face that cat on my leg I it was it was a disaster yeah\nWhere's that movie is the sound of music and the famous scene in what's the name of the song a these are a few of my favorite things yeah Mm yeah when everybody and she said that and sings it with all the cabinet is under storming yes they are I\nTell myself you know despite the lack of sleep is all my my favorite little people and critters woman on me it's not a bad thing about it you know\nNo I Love it [laughter] I Love it and we wish we slept like bugs in a row added after everybody got settled and make decided he was you know not going to put his button our faith um and he turned around he's he's such a such a big moose sometimes you know he doesn't even way that much really at the end of the days of I don't know like forty pounds\nBut he's a he's a lug yeah my dad and he's so funny she's like six\nShe's six feet tall and she has on her back legs so it's like how Florida Man in the\nBed with me like I have\nTo tell you something off the air that they want Bennett was telling us when we recorded the pot and house after the broadcast about robotic sex and some of the stuff that people do I was like so grossed out I was so grossed out can't even tell you but ah I wanted\nTo uh what was I got a lot of things I Want to talk about I Want to talk about that great game last night between the Kansas City chiefs and the uh New England patriots anybody else later why yeah know watches football like I like when you yeah and and ... and ... and but what a great game who came down to like\nRight down to the wire man and Tom Brady you know and I have to say they all did a great job\nI'm a the Kansas City has been kicking butt yeah well they have them and they were and and yeah and they they was forty to forty three and I have to say I think that new in New England was lucky to pull off the win because it was good they they had him beat several times just a fascinating game to watch I mean\nI think just in the third quarter over thirty points were scored and that you know each of the quarterbacks a you know through for over three and I\nAm I'm looking at them and\nI Know none of it means anything to me that you know so I I appreciate the excitement yeah I I thought when Ryan talks to me because he'll like really talk to me and I'm I'm literally I only go surface level or yeah\nI Know where they like or love al Michaels like I Do I've got such a crush on that man who he's a commentator he's a commentator with ... worked has been on the air for years years and years and years\nAbsolutely loved I just love him I Do I Love his voice I Love his commentator only commentator millions Joe Buck okay job occasion yeah he's a good one too he's really on I could like know by name okay so I don't know who's playing tonight but I'll be watching\nWrestling with whether the way it it got the forty niners and the Packers oh I got ... yeah but I'm the ball yeah when I hear football playing in the background I think it's just reminds me of being little and my dad watching the game yeah yeah like curling up on the couch when I\nGet really my blood pressure just goes up and watching last night that game was very exciting it really was and um and the bills almost one yesterday on the uh the cowboys beat the hell out of who who were they playing I didn't want jaguars jaguars yeah\nSo a great day for football yeah Bob what do you have to bring this up one of our listeners a son and a this article that Trump Administration seeks public\nComments on marijuana re classification um what do you girls think about this anybody want to comment before I Do so what are they even says the\nFederal government wants your input on whether marijuana should be re classified under global drug treaties to which the U.S as a party specifically the EU us food and Drug Administration that's the FDA is asking for public\nComments about the abuse potential actual abuse medical usefulness trafficking and the impacts of scheduling changes aren't available\nAvailability\nFor medical use of cannabis and several other substances now under international review of course that includes CBD Oil which I'm it's legal in the fifty all fifty states but it's not federally legal right yeah right you know and I would have been reading\nAn article as far as classes changing the classification goes there was talking about the impact of youth um particularly like you know I'm Seventeen early twenties people being put in jail for using and how it\nHow it completely redirect their lives highlight is horrible you know ... experience or the exposure to other things that they're in jail with\nAnd without detrimental it has to their life and you know with that is that crime really were fat life\nNow and and not and it's absolutely baloney drowning it's bold and you know what\nI Can't even spell the word but you know what I'm Talking about it's ridiculous these people are present for marijuana and I have to ask okay and they asked about it you know uh it's abused potential alcohol is legal right does anybody abuse that\nShopping what about sex marijuana is a plant that came from the earth was given to us by Mother Nature and God depending upon what your belief system is and it's ridiculous and they're trying to do the same thing to crate him and Washington DC a marijuana is legal in Washington DC did you know that\nNo yeah what do you think this article that I was\nReading it was showing the parallel between two different inmates in one of them with a guy who was in his fifties\nAnd he was just basically revolving in and out of jail as a constant alcoholic but then it was showcasing these other people who are like Twenty one who had\nLike a joint on them and now they're in jail so ... you know like they're actually doing hard time for this joint evil guy is like you know this one person is just in and out and I'm thinking oh you know he's the one with the problem you know realistically speaking\nWith so many there's so many alcoholics I Do believe this set\nThat we should have a set of power if we do ever legalize marijuana in this country which I think should happen immediately I really do offer so many different reasons medical use you know recreational whatever you don't see people get aggressive when they're stoned try you know and I do I think it should be driving and smoking now I think if you're going to smoke you should stay at home or get a you\nKnow a driver that's not under the influence of alcohol I Do think Twenty one though maybe shouldn't be the legal age twenty two but if you caught\nGet caught with with it under the age of Twenty one I'm that you just get like a warning or something like that and he has or yeah\nOr maybe make it or maybe have a a type of marijuana that maybe doesn't have as much THC because it does really damage your brain and tell us fully developed at the age of twenty two so yeah I Want you to the age that they determine twenty two to twenty three is when they say that the brain is fully developed\nSome people even say twenty five but you know\nYou're going to kill a few brain cells I mean I was drinking beer when I was sixteen okay I like\nI\nKnow that was all like we could get our hands on his beard that's why I drank it that's why you know what you experiment when you're a kid I I'm honestly yellow I but I think we've got a few at the constitution was written with a feather okay let's just keep that all in mind like Joe Rogan says\nAll right every one we've got a great show coming up I've got doctor Dr Mehra Karp\nHow she is the author of the internationally best selling book the passionate light creating vitality

more of these nutrient dense marshals had been found to feel significantly calmer happier and more energetic than those who eat less produce\nRight and and there's there's two reasons for that one has to do with you know physically the healthier from a micro nutrients and those are the the second part of that is that the research shows that the fruits and vegetables actually\nHelp us produce more baritone and which is transmitted the brain chemical that brings about calmness and a better mood and better\nSleep mhm and that's what\nI'm Prozac is meant to increase serotonin and our brain we\nYou

you just answered my next question which was just let her some tips you might have about how to modify one die in anything else you want to add to that\nWell I think you know people\nReally scared when it comes to modify their diets they're addicted to the the bad food so I think the ... that would be an end\nRather than try to track in at first so if you're eating more fruits and vegetables after a while you're not going to want to eat as many ... because for the vegetables are failing and they then surely develop a taste for them and everything and it was kind of take take they\nMhm
