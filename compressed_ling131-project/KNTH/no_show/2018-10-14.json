{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "System is and you're making the point really clearly been a lot of people don't understand and I think he was made more terrorism I understood and I've read your book\nThat the VA system is designed for veterans who preached veterans better than they can be treated elsewhere yes there are problems are there are a problem facilities but those are the exception of there being dealt with now the new leadership in the VA is dealing with them and\nYou're suggesting very clearly that veterans receive better medical care from a BA so really then from a private facility just because they understand who he she use and how to treat them as a whole person not just as a person with a particular physical issue there was a moment like that you write\nYes and also that veteran then PA has homeless programs I mean the really livers what the private sector to happen it's not designed to deliver which it's really kind of hold out and that doesn't just mean treating your diabetes or treating your chitchat St Louis\nHelping you with work and it was helping you on campus readjusting to civilian life after you come back from Iraq yet a campus veteran counter they set up in means homeless programs I mean I spent gauge gathering\nThe street so that he a social worker looking for how much better and I've gotten really good at figuring out which alley people sleeping and which alley they always say when and how many health care system\nAre going out there looking for homeless veterans\nVA helps veterans with legal problems church veterans outreach programs I it's kind of stunning I Wish I were a veteran 'cause I'm never going to get the kind of care that veterans get and I have like the bats health insurance there is it correct It's just not available\nAnd what we need to do is protect that I personally think every veteran regard because as you know so wow eligibility is limited to veterans somehow to service connected disability and or are poor\nI personally think or twenty million veterans should be allowed into the VA and I don't know the cost that much more because most of those veterans go with the editor healthier and wealthier and so they're healthier and no instead what we're now doing his outsourcing more care\nBetween two dozen fourteen into taboo Seventeen the budget for outsource carrying the private sector private sector that studies show that had to take care of veterans has increased by forty nine percent and the NBA budget has increased by nine percent\nI mean that ain't gonna get you more staff less burnout better care that's going to get even worse care\nAnd increase the calls her privatization and I think that you know for veterans that would be disastrous\nI understand what you're saying and I do not disagree however I think that a substantial portion of the outsource she has to do with people that are too far away from a facility\nTo get timely care I personally Caesar's benefit to allowing somebody if they are a hundred or more miles away from the ... going to somebody more local but that doesn't change the fact that the VA is going to understand you better which is why I think veterans given a choice I Would rather go to a VA facility because they are going to\nDo with people who understand their situation\nAbsolutely and I think the one thing I worry about is that\nWhere there are problems with veterans getting to care\nUsually it's rural areas and they're unfortunately aren't necessarily private facility wedding cakes and I mean in America\nAnd the next ten years working in the seven hundred ... hospitals clothes in the past few years eighty two of clothes so they aren't necessarily places for people to go I mean fifty five percent of American counties all of them are all have know psychiatry psychologist or social worker\nNow the VA can help with that because it has tele medicine and they can tell medicine is actually it's one of the leaders globally into medicine\nSo I think yes absolutely if somebody can't get access to cure the VA always done that that people go into the community but what I worry about is that it's really huge influx of veterans if you keep sending more and more veterans\nOut to private sector care you're going to overwhelm an already stretched private sector system particularly primary in mental health care\nAnd I don't necessarily think and I can veterans may not get care and I don't think and a lot of cases the carrots there for them to get so\nI think this has been well thought out I don't think a lot of people in Congress cat sadly even many of the positions who tend to be medical specialists under ... health care and the broad needs of veterans and the broader powers and are brought our health care system\nI think you are right this is going to get on the front lines of freedom we're discussing our vi healthcare system which was important to them much wrap up a little bit what she points would you like our listeners to take away from our conversation what key issues would you like to remember\nYes there are problems with the Wii ha but there's also a lot of great things and let's keep a balanced view here I think that people need to really contact their Congress people\nAbout the mission acted out some of the things that are going on I have no idea what's going to happen after the election who's going to be there but I think people need to stop\nThat VA I mean you don't solve a problem by hammering if people you solve a problem by constructively come hiking and I think the blame chain game is really not a good idea I think also that you know people have to be active\nAnd they have to recognize that this is actually a national treasure invested Seventy years worth of billions\nAnd billions of dollars and you don't improve something by sharing it can use to by strengthening it and giving it the funding and staffing it needs and addressing the problems which are actually often about micro management central invasion and so forth and that that's not to get solved by\nPrivatizing the system\nAnd I just really think that we always thank veterans for their service I've been really on by the people who work at the da to veterans third of them are veterans and I think we need to protect them and thanked them for their services that they could be working somewhere else\nAnd earning a whole lot more because of the actual isn't allowed to offer market rate salaries which by the way it should change so we need to really value\nVeteran by value is health care system that's designed to deal with it they're very specific problems which are very specific\n... by the way your book wounds of war I think is one every veteran probably every citizen should on how can the copies like Amazon and places like that\nWell they can get it from Amazon and they can get it from their local bookstore I Love the independent bookstore is if you go and

military to tend to assume just gatherings his favorite toys before fleeing the wildfire with his family\nEleven year old Gavin Zeke do something simple but extraordinary during a mandatory evacuation or Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton the summer he helped his neighbor's\nCampaign to experience a series of wildfires because of the proximity to fire the bass issued a mandatory evacuation\nQuote I remember being patriotic we have several residents who didn't know where to go or what to do so John Lopez who is the maintenance manager of the housing group\nDuring an evacuation of this nature most would cling to their family members patch or a few precious possessions are gathering however alerted who's neighbors to the danger opposing the algae community which is only priority\nGroup I was a vacuum and a lot of residents during the fire and it was to be by several residents a young man was knocking on doors and helping scrap children in their seats Lopez\nWhile he was shaken scared he was still helping his friends you know there are families making are safe\nLopez's across the street from gathering as family\nAnd when I'm running around the neighborhood knocking on his neighbors' doors and loaded up his family's car as well as the sisters neighbors are gathering their belongings so they can be evacuated safely you haven't selfless actions July six demonstrated that he was willing to put his own fears aside to help him\nOf course as a result he was presented a certificate appreciation from the capital the fire department on October second\nQuote this day and age we can expect teenagers and young kids to preserve life because his parents we feel it's our job says Lopez I was amazed at the fact that he took charge and decided to help people and save lives you can't put it into words\nYou haven't proved to be an amazing young man and I feel blessed to know you made this positive about our lives it goes without being said these are local hero to stand tall Gavin Zeke rent was a freedom and all of our nation's patriots salute you conclude the first hour the show\nWill start to suck in our discussion war animals but also Robin Hood and then that hazel rejoined us to

reasons than Jay oh by the military for murder killing the enemy and gone [noise] that sounds crazy if you find this is ... ... United Patriots federal [noise]\nThere's we ever use our first we're going to talk about ... animals with Robin hunting contributor met hazel discuss warriors and more of us weeks ago she got to be football games of course we'll conclude was our weekly mailbag military history that are under America report\nGroups are welcome your comments or questions contact me for much freedom ...\nNow it's time to discuss the unsung heroes of World War two more animals we'll talk with author Robin Hood in case you fought only dogs were war animals like idea you're about to find out you were wrong like I was ... I wanted to bring them Robert\nDowney thank you so much for me I'm very excited to hear\nWhat I Love the book Robin share some of your background from where did your love of animals and your research come from\nI grew up with dogs and everything as a kid we had always seem to have one so I got to love of animals my whole life and I really also love never owned a horse horses all they carried a special place in my heart\nAnd to find these wonderful animals it has just been a fabulous fabulous Jeremy my first book was on ...\nThe great Korean War horse that served with the marine corps and the Korea when I discovered her story and did her book I was actually able to get a medal for Iraq what's called the deck and metal turns out that for that tore across for animals it's the greatest metal an animal can receive for a gallon trained bravery\nAnd so when I was discovering and doing the history and everything about metal I discovered all of these phenomenal animals that received the medal in World War two\nAnd I just fell in love with their stories I really just hunker down and there's over Seventy animals in the book and to get their histories and stories and everything it was really quite fascinating and wonderful journey for me to\nLearn so much great stuff that I had forgotten or never knew about from World war two\n... ... you don't know what you don't know [laughter]\n\nThat's so true and you know what this down that may were truly was not only were the war birds the kitchens so her role like there's no way to account for the number of lives these animals said let their heroes yet but I guarantee you and I'm sure you can attest to any you'll never think of a pension as a rat with wings again\nAfter writing a book [laughter] but from what\nI what I found fascinating with World War two was that we didn't have a warrant dog program at that time and so people actually donated their personal to the war cause after Pearl Harbor was bombed and that just stunned me ah they're better patriots than I because\nWhen skip World War two and go right to World War three if you try to take my ... state of war [laughter]\nSo it's just truly blew me away to see the patriotism and the people just stepping up to the plate donating their dogs to the cause and it was just an amazing piece of history just as a truly unique time\nWill your point and also we didn't have anything like that and it was this World War two start we should've coming out of it but it was incredible because that's the story itself how our nation military suddenly realize their new dogs and deploying\nAbsolutely absolutely and then when you think that a poodle breed are named Arlene Earl anger who was very big and the dog world with the Westminster dog show on American kennel club and everything she got together after Pearl Harbor together with her friends and said the dogs need to be a part of this and they started dogs for defense\nAnd dogs for defense did the national cry for people to donate their pets and they set up with the army they had to convince the army that this was a good idea\nAnd so they trained dogs that started standing at different ammunitions plants and airports and factories because they were afraid of sabotage after Pearl Harbor was bombed you know and and guarding the coastline and stuff\nAnd so they recruited forty thousand dogs were donated now not all of them made the cut of course you know somewhere to old some are not the right breed some might have been sickly or didn't have the right temperament twenty thousand still went through the initial training and tell over ten thousand four hundred actually served\nIn either the army or the coast guard a guarding our\nCoastlines and everything and then the marine corps had their own award dog program or the Doberman Pincher club they teamed up with a Doberman Pincher club but they too got German shepherds and Belgian shepherds to act as messenger dogs and stuff and the Pacific and it's just a fascinating piece of history that really truly is\nIt is you do this is really going to go on for almost a freedom we're discussing war animals with author Robin Robin we're talking dogs but there's at least a cat and some teams are here to make the rest of the story\nYes absolutely well the pensions they of course where the carrier pigeon the fate would be taken on air there would be at least one or two\nCarrier pigeon homing pigeons on the airplanes that the bombers and everything these birds were amazing they would be dropped from planes that would be dropped behind enemy lines hoping that somebody in the French Resistance to find them\nAnd you know answer some questions and then release the bird to fly back with information about how the war was going are very most famous bird was a bird named GI Joe\nAnd GI Joe is the only animal back in World War two only American animal that received this deck and metal Victoria Cross for animals and what GI Joe did what he flew\nTwenty miles and twenty minutes and stop the planes from taking off on the tarmac\nThe British were trying to take over this town called Colby Vecchia in Italy that the Germans had occupied\nAnd they were having a tough time so bombing mission had been set up but the Germans gave up the town about ten thirty in the morning and the bombing mission was set for eleven ten well the Brits had no communication back to headquarters to tell them that they indeed had taken over the town stop and then this year\nSo all they had was she I tell\nAnd they strap a message on GI Joes lag and release them and thankfully he got through and time twenty miles and twenty minutes and stop the plane and it saved over a hundred British soldiers lives that had just taken over the town\nAnd so you know there is amazing stories like that was so many different birds being and planes that crashed in the ocean and being able to get their messages back to tell the headquarters where the plane had gone down our\nNews from Normandy you know uh the Duke of Normandy was the first bird back from the frontlines of Normandy back to Great Britain to a report on how well the attack on it and the landing with and so many great stories of how these birds would\nBe shot and have their leg dangling and still make it through the mission to get the message is through and\nThey were shot out they had snipers trained for them they had to dodge falcons that we're trying to attack them and still had to fly through the battle you know just the the mortars and battles and stuff and it looks phenomenal how they were able to persevere and over thirty two of them received this prestigious metal back in World War two\nTo most of us don't realize how by our standards to the primitive communication was back then we were ... I use radar that's like radios wouldn't go that far they worked for the work that easy to maintain\nAnd that's why this was the dependable foremost communication which Seattle kinds of lives so amazing understatement yeah\nYeah it truly is and you know and the jungles of bogus Advil and the Pacific islands walkie talkies that they had wouldn't work than any other lines of communication that'd be cut by the Japanese and so they had messenger dogs that's the only way that they could get a lot of times the message through is using these dogs\nTo take a message back from the front line back to the combat headquarters you're\nRobin how can listen to get a copy of war animals I presume it's available on line and Amazon short hair is\nThey can go to Amazon Barnes and noble books the

high quality products honest value consistency you can trust\nHome based products cover all your pantry essential from tissue paper to reusable containers offering you quality you expect and savings you deserve\nSo that's something that is transferable to the civilian world\nThough not only aggressive sense right\nYeah I think it's important for civilians to recognize the level of commitment and the level in the intensity and sometimes violence that the military has\nBut they need to also understand that we are just people just like they are we're not different kinds of people we're just dedicated ourselves to a life of protecting the country and to do that you have to be willing not only to sacrifice physically but also to be prepared\nTo be very violent and that takes a toll on people you see all the pie TST coming back from the latest wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\nAnd I think there are people in our society they think that we love the violence and we're out there just to kill people and stuff that is the farthest thing from the truth I mean we come back damage from what we have to go through and what we have to do and I think it's so important to realize that war especially close combat takes a toll on everyone involved we talked about the difference between men and women last week\nI think one of the key things about men for better or for worse is that we were able to sort of compartmentalize things yes and in the middle of a battle your body gets shot you do not have time degree not even a second you know the guy that pick him off got his crosshairs right on you so what are you going to do to get out of this position and make things right\nAnd you know it might be weeks or even months later for that comes back into your mind and all of a sudden you find yourself breathing so there's there's an intense emotional toll that it takes on a person to be in combat but that's always got to be later it can't be in the moment\nAnd that's all part of the nature of the warrior right there's a lot more to discuss about this and folks are good at having Matt back on regularly as we pursue the definition of the idea of a warrior\nMatt thank you for

mean it was just\nThe most appropriate um logical ah\nMost straightforward thing I could possibly have come up with it was just it was exactly what we need to do and I'm so at that point I just started working on this idea for the next twenty four hours or so as I'm driving down the freeway and um\nAnd what we came up with a that the Christian Community churches in uh in every community would come together on\nThe force Sundays prior to election day\nThat would be October fourteenth which is tomorrow or October twenty first twenty eighth November fourth and we would get together for a period of time as the children of God\nIn imploring our heavenly father to hear our prayer all of this wrapped around the context of a second chronicles seven foot chain which says if my people who are called by my name\nWell humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I Will hear from having forgive their sin inhale their land and\nSo if we got together and prayed that\nIn an ... way repenting of arson because we know that judgment starts first with the church\nAnd that the problems with our country really are not the problems with the Democrats the problems of of centers in general and I'm not saying all Democrats are are are an saved I Am saying we're all sinners however\nBut the bottom line is the un regenerate and do\nWhat they do they you know they why kill and destroy that that ... agenda and if you're not in God's kingdom you were in his kingdom so it's not they are the enemy our enemy is spiritual our enemy\nIs the rulers and the forces in the heavenly places that's where the battle is engaged\nThe problem with America is not what the enemy has done the enemy has always been fighting against Scott the problem in America is the church that we have sat back and let this happen on our watch that we did we did not\nCry out to God and cry out against the bombing nations and the things that have unfolding in this country for the last number of decades but blame is that our feet we need to come before the lord and say God forgive us\nFor what we've done or for what we haven't done it was the case may be\nAt the church would come to God and cry out in that manner I'm convinced he would Harris and I'll tell you something on a lot of people have been doing that a lot of people for a long time have been doing that and I believe that God is answering those prayers and I don't know what this movement will ultimately a\nWind up accomplishing that's not my department I'm doing what God told me to do\nAnd we're going to see what he does with it\nI Am the Bible says that ah [noise]\nWhat you so that you will also read I'm Out there sewing seat right now but we know that the harvest as the Lord's God is the one who causes it to grow ten fifty or a hundred fold I'm praying for a hundred thousand fold here\nSo we made for those for Sundays we pray\nSecond chronicle seven fourteen but we also pray for our government we pray for our schools our communities are elected leaders are law enforcement and military we pray for racial reconciliation we pray for reconciliation between law enforcement and the public that they serve\nWe pray for all these things in our society that we have such difficulties with today and we ask God if he would intercede on our behalf because you know something\nGod is our father and he delights in giving his children good things and he wants the things that we're talking about right now even more than we do so why would he not answer\nWhy would he turned us down if we came before him with the with the right\nHeart than he is going to hear our prayer [noise] so I Am I'm stoked about this you may be able to tell but I got his [noise] he's\nGiven me this mission and others have taken this nation as well and I am so excited about what's happening I mean is this just started like a week or two my website it's been up for\nNine days that's it I mean if you want to do something like this you'd need to start six months in advance but that's not one guy gave it to me he gave it to me two weeks ago and so here we are on the cusp of this first a Sunday and we already have\nA gatherings going down in eight states that I Know of I heard that there are people who are going to be\nAt the flagpole in front of city hall in Las Vegas tomorrow afternoon\nIn the underbelly of obese as it were I Am so\nTo what to God for what he is doing here [noise] so at the end\nThe end of the fourth meeting than it changes from meet you at the polls is on the flagpole to meet you at the polls for election day\nWhere we all go on November the six to cast her ballot ballot and these elections to vote for godly and righteous men and women who will help to turn this country around and I I just know what's gonna happen I Know what's gonna happen but you know what God\nDoes not move\nUntil the papal pray it through\nJesus said\nPraise the lord of the harvest that God would send workers out into the harvest\nJesus you know there was a harvest you said he said the feels are white to harvest\nBut he told us to pray that God would send workers out to gather that harvest God can do it on his own but he chooses to use the body of Christ Christ is the head but we're the ones who do the work\nAnd we're the ones who have to pray it through and so that's what I Am doing and many many others around this country right now and I am so\nThankful that God open the door to be on your program tonight that very night before this first Sunday because I Know that they're going to be people out there in their communities in front of their flight city hall or their county courthouse or their state capital and they were standing in front of that flagpole\nWho not caring what anybody thinks it just happens to be walking around and they are going to stand there and they pray and they're going to lift this country up to our heavenly father and they are going to make a difference\nAnd thank you John for allowing this\nBug and play any part in it at all however small I'm happy to do it you know I heard something very interesting I'm going to see if I can remember it

I don't right now because a number one ah\nThe media has picked up on this nobody knows what's going on except the people who are involved with it people who listen to shows like yours so uh so no it's uh right now we're totally under the radar went out on the radar\nSo uh so I don't anticipate there is any any situation a mall a but it like I say we are fighting a a as a spiritual battle and yes\nUh I mean I've I've come under some attack over the last couple of weeks in in terms of some of the things that I've been working on\nA loose and that has been a you know and that's been putting together the Montgomery County a meeting or\nA as experienced the same sort of thing and and these are things that we expect we know what's coming uh and and uh we're going to deal with it because greater is he that is in us than he was in the world so I'm not concerned about that [noise]\nAre we going to have problems at the meetings eventually get probably a somebody will but you know what Jesus said in this world you're going to have a hardship you're going to suffer\nAnd you're going to be persecuted for my namesake and if that happens well then you thank God for that he Bruce eleven\nTeaches us in the hall of faith\nAll those myth that uh the writer of Hebrew talks about who lived righteous lives talked about people who\nSuffered unbearably and yet they reach Joyce and that because of they were going to get a better resurrection for it so yeah we're going to suffer ... what you know that's a that's that's that's what we're called the Jesus is our example so I'm not worried about that either\nUm but I Will say this is kind of interesting we'll deal with your if you are having you're meeting at a county courthouse\nOr a city all generally speaking there was a police station right there so uh\nYou know when I went there tonight I talked to the guy in the ... the officer there I mean I hear in your building right in front there will be doing this tomorrow so so that's the locations or you know are well suited for what we're doing um\nYou know and the other thing is it was interesting is it a a I'm not leading this Tom ball thing that's a we have somebody else says that tomorrow or the one I'm leaving tomorrow is in spring Texas which is just down the road next community down\nAnd uh we're doing hours a day a courthouse or in the spring area and one of the er er the primary a justice and that a court house as a good friend of mine and I and also a believer and when ... when I told about this he says I Kurt God this is\nThe most amazing email or have received a long time he says please pray for me that I Would make righteous decisions and glorify God and my courtroom\n[noise] what ah [noise]\nIf we had more people like that and and I believe firmly that Brett Kavanaugh's cut out of that exact same old bad as what he wants his life to reflect as well\nAnd I think that I think that this whole Kavanaugh thing is it is definitely the hand of God\nAnd and as as angry as I got without righteous anger when I heard that accuser come up against him\nA Raphael Cruz says that video on my website he says Satan always overplays his hand and that's exactly what they did in the confirmation hearing\nIn fact I saw a headline on that just a couple of days ago that the Democrats of overplay their hand they use that exact same phrase because it has turned the church on fire I'm not the only one out there and there is such a pent up energy in our church and in our country\nOn behalf of ... a righteous people\nAgainst the enemy and the destruction and everything that's been going on\nA I think this election's going to be pretty amazing I think it's going to take a lot of people by surprise just like it did two years ago a back to Christians have to get out and vote because you know as well as either John there's no way you're going to convince a Democrat there\nIs no way you're I mean you might convince an independent but it's going to take you know a month or two we don't have a month or two people are so polarized today there is no dragon people back across that line without a lot of work a lot of education\nThe only way that we're going to prevail in this coming election for righteousness is if the people in the church is get up off their butt and go out and vote\nBecause I'm telling you something there are tens of millions who have not and that has been a real problem\nBut if they will get out of the Pew and go vote on November the six we will carry this election and we will carry it handily and we will get people that are in office they're going to turn things around for us\nTo assert ... thanks so much for your time thanks for coming on the program and our director brought to go to go pray dot org and you've got everything there on the Web to go quick store guard you're meeting ideas\nAnd the you know the quickest way to get disorganized do is to be in whatever area people who are listening now or soon and I'm ... and more to do with the the weakest of the fastest way to do with views because as midterm things coming up quick so some of the best way to get it on top of that will pay\nYou can't do anything tomorrow\nIn oil and organizing suggest get as many friends as you can and show up at your flagpole and you vote and what you're doing is you were conflict creating the ground\nOf that court house or that city hall for the meetings that are going to come you were you were dedicating neck that ground to Christ and your proclaiming him king and you are proclaiming him\nIn control over that that area and that territory in your community than in this coming week\nYou start getting the word out to your ear churches here pastors your friends your network here Facebook whatever and you get those people lined up so that when they return the following Sunday on October the twenty first then\nThen you've got to a group of people and one thing I didn't mention that's part of this thing is very important is that every one is to bring a low for the fish to every meeting a low for the fish is to people who have not been to a meeting yet and are not members of your church\nSo every time you show up you're bringing to friends with you so by the time the fourth Sunday rolls around you should have a a a number of people collected there together and and and John again I just thank you so much for this opportunity and I look forward to seeing what God is going to do in our country and I and I thank\nYour listeners who are are standing with us on this end up please send me an email or

indeed Michael ... into the Atlantic last night roaring through Virginia I think down in Virginia Beach north Hampton Roads area it's a lot of power lines are down et cetera I'll keep you posted on that\nI'm pleased to welcome the guy would be in charge in Ohio or disaster to happen next year for the next four years Mike DeWine he's the attorney general in Ohio right now he's running for governor in one of the most closely watched races in the United states or a senator now attorney general DeWine welcome back to the euro ... great to have you\nHere it's great to be back with you and your listeners thank you very much\nOne of the things I think when we watch Michael come ashore governor a jar general DeWine is\nWe listen to candidates and we think to ourselves are they are they able to handle the crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speaker Richard Cordray your your opponent had been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's been a lawyer or how about you [laughter]\nWell you know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting thing or if you compare Cordray and Mike DeWine is both a were attorney generals and ah you know I beat him eight years ago close race but I but I Am but what we inherited\nA was a real mess they charge Ohio runs the state crime lab and what do we took office of court right left us was if there was a rape or serious crime that occur in Ohio the unknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab\nA it was just sat there if you believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without him by overlooking that that's how far back that they had and a quarter\nThat is a mess and so we fixed it uh we turned cases around now a twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did today ah he left office and uh you know our average times about three weeks but we can turn this around very very quickly and another thing that he didn't fare\nCordray and what we've done now he left um they were they were all rape kits sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that have this problem\nOr he didn't do anything about it when I became attorney general we we started hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to the police say\nBring it to us we want to get this evidence are tested and uh we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these were all court cases old cases ah some there's some Fifteen Years old and we've got hit or matches and thirty six percent so we've gone back\nYou know him better than a third and told the the local police who then in\nTurn told the victim hey we got your raping or we got your rapists and or in Cuyahoga County alone in Cleveland where we had a large large number of them are they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people rape wow as a result of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem\nYou go after it a quarter I just just sat there and didn't uh you don't do anything and don't forget a courses time ah heading up Obama's of consumer group out in Washington if you if you recall\nUh we we saw for example uh because of overregulation we ... we saw\nThe number of our community banks or go down significantly in Ohio and I'm sure that occurred in in other states as well just because of the over over regulation a quarter a and others had in place\nNow I got to ask you a general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is doing well in this recovery I mean we've got I Know north eastern oil pretty darn well I Know\nMore it's done is cooking I Know that that's come country as well I've been mounting in Trumbull county not to be what county but even in Cuyahoga County it's cooking why in the world would we turn the state over to the left the bill laugh I mean what in the world well the people they think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well in Ohio a we do not want to go back to where we were eight years ago ... years ago when court or a I'm\nA ... was was attorney general and a ... ... you know he was the attorney general the state of Ohio we had had lost a\nClose to four hundred thousand jobs ah and you know we just were not moving a or unemployment rate was high and the in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership uh we've kept taxes down cut taxes uh we've seen the economy move forward and so\nYou know what I Want to do my running mate John Hughes did we want to take a while to the next level ah we've come a long long way we do not want to go back\nUh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we got an opiate problem that we we have to get in front of and now instead of a you know\nPeople are not being able to find jobs and not economy not moving for our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who are able to pass a drug test so\nWe're really focusing on who is is two things uh one is tackling a\nDrug problem we have a twelve point action plan that\nMakes makes real sense it's realistic\nUh some of the things I'm already shirt have already started to do as attorney general but there are things I Can't do until\nTill I I'm governor I mean one of the things that we want to we think is very important as education and prevention for young young kids in regard to drugs or you know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney and I can tell you that I don't know in five years or ten years if we'll have an opiate problem but a ... there's always some drug problem\nAnd so we want to prepare young people starting as early as kindergarten through twelfth southern age appropriate every year every year something that's been proven to to actually work\nUh we will implement that\nAnd it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're we really want to do a is double doubt on President\nTrump's opportunities homes ah we're have opportunities zones and Ohio oh this will mirror the tax cuts uh and and the job act\nThat the president and Congress put through a we will make it so that uh\nSomebody looks at the state of Ohio and I said well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital gains I Want to take it take it to Ohio or put it\nDo this in our most problematic areas and you know we we believe that a given that tax break I was going to get a lot of money invested in Ohio we hope from a you know all over the country\nAnd I'll tell you how ... you know if you take that up the young
