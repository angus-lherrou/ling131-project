... or ... option he\nAlready has it so so there's only a majority vote necessary those super majorities anymore I mean I uh I I went on to get into a long debate on this had happened was a Judge Gorsuch is causes that here he was he would have not been confirmed a without this occurred so so you only need fifty one votes\nAnd really out of the senators you just see fifty because the vice president can vote and and the time or or he could be that fifty first vote so\nUm we're already there there is a super majority necessary I Want that just clear every body\nIs you need a a a just a a normal majority vote\nAnd the vice president can be the ... so are you but it's just the way that the city of works right now the patches together for the\nPeople talking about I don't like doing it by the way and like the sexist way we're we're cascade college like just because they're women they're going to vote this way if they are two of I'd say they are the two most moderate members\nOf the U.S Senate who ... who are Republican\nUm and uh and Jeff Flake is kind of\nMoved over to that world over over time it's certainly towards his retirement so I we don't just talk about that because they're always you know the the casting the say vote ... it's because uh they have kind of cast themselves together in this situation and allowed it or to happen so that's why I think it\nIt wouldn't be weird to me than to see one of the vote one way and one of the other even though they ... they represent very different states Maine and Alaska\nYeah it would be strange Jordan they typically vote together in actually early in this nomination process they were pretty much the public comments that they thought they would be voting together along with a couple of the Democrats I Do think maybe it's changed a little bit now Jordan because it's\nA look I don't think that mansion and hike camp are going to deliver you the deciding vote so I actually don't think the vice presidents boats going to be needed here because\nLet's say you do get two of those three Republicans and you get to fifty votes and it becomes clear that Brett Kavanaugh's coming in it'd be confirmed I think at that point senator matching and send her to hike camp would probably vote yes especially center hiking if she's down ten points in North Dakota and more than sixty percent of North Dakota and support the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt's it's weird how the politics work but once you get to fifty I think you're actually going to get to fifty to fifty three\nAll right so I mean I get we're trying to explain it off for you when this vote occurs which we expect to early ... would be this week or so it'd be a Saturday vote which is interesting too because the American people's attention\nIs usually not as focused on on the news in Washington on weekends all of that has impacts of this people because they're worried about you know a who's watching it ... it with is watching it but but again very important to note Kelly in Wyoming on life five Kelly welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\n[noise] hello [noise] I ... I can I call I just want to say as somebody who at age ... and ... and and as active participant in politics\nAnd I don't find them I didn't find\nThat testimony as Ford credible at all and I I just I think that kind of well take a vote and I hope he does so that that senators will have to be on record as\nWell I think that that you know that's an important point Kelly and will be a political calculation uh to to make I mean this is going into a bit terms I think very quickly that we could go round the horse and I think we all agree there's a calculation they're off\nDo you have a vote forcing the senators to be on the record or even if Brett Kavanaugh goes down or so is it the loss of the states can be used positively uh for the Republican Party\nTo say see this is what happens now if it's Republicans doing it I mean it becomes a little bit more complicated right I mean so I think ... that is a political calculation\nThat Mitch McConnell along with the White House wanted to make it I think that's a change eke a potential to I don't think that you could say today on Tuesday that that or if it was going to be likely vote down ... that it occurs that sometimes you got to go for it uh but and you got to hold people speak\nTo the fire [noise] let me get right back to the folks that want to get through so many of these calls became people didn't hold on market brass got on like six this if you want to do want to go around the horn on bark walks the Jay Sekulow alive\nI um I thought I'm not a question of when I was on the first American Bar association a west drawings are supportive of a judge Kavanaugh\nThat fully but they wanted an FBI investigate and I think the president wrote a letter saying that so the actual a be a a physician is still qualify yeah so the it's\nA it's gotten a little burst here um but that being said we're kind of ... here we talked about these phases before we are past those phases now I mean we're we're past the really the the phase is the city has given us back to the FBI\nThe FBI will they be of this this is about judicial philosophy anymore that's you know about how you ... your conduct even as a judge on the bench\nThis is private life mostly focused on college years even high school years I mean Harry that the truth is a BA rating they did pull that stuck on Brett Kavanaugh to try it didn't even make a lot of news 'cause that what was breaking were so salacious or the FBI they said five will do and I've got a background check\nIf the American bar association has any confidence it has confidence with respect to a judge Kavanaugh's qualification his educational background\nHis temperament on the bench\nA and he passed a battle analysis with flying colors\nThe ab a has no power to investigate Russia arches with respect to what judge Kavanaugh did when he was a teenager\nWhether or not he engaged in drinking or whatever so the A. B. A. and lacks credibility with respect to the allegations which have recently a surface\nLet's try to get a these titled to cause a pattern for the on line three a good question or you're on the air\n[noise] enjoyed living for taking my call we're quick you know you're on time or my question is in the public or does the public has a right to see the three oh two is on the new investigation\nAbsolutely not um there may be summaries issued a that are made public we don't know I mean that would just be again that kind of stuck his but no river and it's real to issue a most of the a lot of those could tell you the information\nWas talking about a he has a a a a grand son with autism and then a friend of his um that graduated from college with him has um\nHas one autistic grandson and then another person that family has an autistic son all three of them boys by the way\nAnd we were just talking about it because I had just gotten my copies in the mail of a how to end the autism epidemic by JD handling and I gave him one because I really want people to get educated on this subject and at least open their mind\nOr to what's out there the research and the information that's out there um so we can all have better lives but he was saying about his grandson I Believe it was his grandson or is it was it's a lifelong tragedy it's not just you see this little kid you think about autism and all child it's difficult\nThose children grow up to be adults okay and this kid this boy is twenty four twenty four years old he's extremely violent\nOkay nobody can handle him really he's physically bag and and it's just a life long tragedy institutionalize no no he's with the family\nAnd so and not to mention the financial burden you know trying to care for an adult right ... you know that that needs a twenty four hour care basically I mean the toll that it takes on family I it just destroys families it does and if it's something that is preventable we all need to know absolutely and so um for a lot of different reasons but\nI just uh the one thing that he said he's you know because he doesn't really believe at least not now he's you know he doesn't believe that vaccines are the cause of it\nBut he has an admittedly hasn't read anything about it is right right right and so that's that's really the key to it here but he said the one thing that they all do have in common is all of them eat really poorly they don't eat well\nAnd it's not because they're poor they just don't eat well right and a lotta people don't they don't think about what they're putting in their mouth I think they're starting to more so now than ever but and that's our job to educate them right\nWell I just I Am I you know I'm not I'm not a doctor right but I Do have passion for truth and I'm I I think because I grew up battalion my father had such passion for the food that he put on the table and he was he was a really way ahead of his time I have to say you know he was super cool well\nBut even when we were growing up food was more nutritional so we didn't have to be even a conscience about\nWhat my parents had their own garden yeah you know they have their own garden and we ate a lot of pasta and salad we did a lot of ... ... and Italian bread right and um\nBut even the talent and bread when we were little was different than what you're eating now it's a whole different exactly\nYeah and like I said we didn't need a lot of meat we didn't eat a lot of dairy I remember my brothers because they were big body builders they were all into you know all that stuff and the karate and all that stuff they drink a lot of milk but I never really drink milk when I was I didn't drink much milk when I was a kid right so but uh\nYeah it's interesting and I do think it's all connected and so we're going to talk with Marilyn wedge\nAbout that and with you the danger of the hook up culture\nWow this is a hot topic right now which is a hot topic and you know with everything going on a you know in Washington object to talk about yeah what are your girls what are you young girls have to say about what's going on in Washington\nOh\nKevin on here I Am tired of hearing the I'm tired of hearing about it to really tricky young but you already yeah I'm kind of not really in the political I like I just don't yeah I don't know I don't really care yeah\nI mean I Do to an extent right but I don't like to speak about it I don't think it should follow me everywhere I go it's just annoying to me background noise everyone's really angry\nYeah I read the whole country is just so angry and there are so well I saw it coming in on CNN around against the blue and it's like good God Almighty I imagine yeah um you know can't we just meet somewhere in the middle\nAnd you know my my comment is if I was a jerk I thought it was a juror on a trial I'm not even allowed to talk about it to all the evidence is presented right two three four five six week right and I think that's the problem with social media is we run our people read one article or they see one\nPiece they draw the conclusion they get heated about it they get passionate about it we don't know mhm we don't know yeah the way the reason the court system is set up the way it is is because\nIt's easy to flip flop it's easy to hear one piece of evidence draw a conclusion here another ... different conclusion and it's confused\nWell I can say this there's too much of that going on or it everyone on the show I don't know about you diamond 'cause we've never discuss it but every other one of us as he has either been date raped or drugs or um or you know all those things that these guys do in the Greek life you know and these fraternities\nIt's it's ridiculous it's like grow up you're in college for God's sake but most people go to college to drink and fool around anyway right and and sending high school well yeah it\nHas become now that's what part of our talk about it is we people don't grow up till after college if they do grow up and so yeah I'm ... and it's not it's a destructive culture mhm\nSo yeah it is and um anyway I wanted to say something but I Will refrain\n[laughter] I was going to talk about our leadership in this country and how well you know\nAnd but it does start any leader every leader every leader what interests what what point is that gonna stop to like ... I guess I've had this I've had this argument with with friends of mine about John Kennedy look what he did look what Bill Clinton did all these other ones so you know it in there\nAnd what's interesting is I think the statistic is fifty percent or more of all of those senators and yeah has paid somebody off for sexual a\nHarassed yeah awesome allegations great\nAbout what a yeah to be a ... yeah well it needs to change [laughter]\nBut we'll talk about it later we're going to go to a break every one we've got Marilyn wedge coming up uh she is amazing you're not going to want to miss

done over your career so uh we were talking kind of about about practicing better mindfulness well with our children are and I wanted to ask you specifically how mindfulness meditation help those with emotional disorders\nWell it it it there are several ways and I kind of just flew to blog on that um\nGives kids the habit of focusing on the present moment\nAnd the lord and distractions so that's just really a good habit to have like in the classroom I'm to be able to focus on what the teacher saying rather than what what their neighbor my what joke there but like with you um so it also helps them with\nA social anxiety mhm how Sam\nBeing with themselves and um and and be calm and not distracted um\nIf it creates good habits for the future of ... when when they have life's challenges they will go a kids can climb peacefulness by taking a few minutes to focus on the grass and meditate\nAnd you know this whole idea about the block here about when um parents told me that in my school district and then I I learned in a school districts across the country mindfulness is being taught in the classroom\nI just I just saw something on that where they're using it instead of disciplinary action they're sending them to a room to meditate right\nYes exactly and and the girls who who are the discipline to hold them so it it promotes patients not to focus on your grass and not thinking but just being the moment\nI'm taking a moment to be calm\nIt promotes a patients it's promote a quiet and I mentioned briefly there is an example in one of my books I'm overloading year old boy who was hyperactive I mean just moved around my office at lightning speed and I asked him um argue ever calm\nAnd I said well what I'm sleeping and laugh and then he he told me about this Youtube video that he discovered and when we brought up on my computer and it was just the sound of ways\nAnd so he had discovered his own mindfulness meditation he closes ours and sit still\nAnd listen to the sound waves right and we did that in my office and it was amazing he he went ... hyperactive bouncy border to very quiet meditative and didn't move and and it didn't make a sound\nYes you know and I I think that's so important and I I I I think this uh\nOur education system needs a lot of work my daughters I was fortunate enough to send them to Montessori school and the difference between

to malign women like Jennifer Flowers was called a saloon singer Paula Jones drag hundred dollar through a trailer park no telling what you're going to get [noise]\n\nWe need a broad way too much as she was raped by Bill Clinton and two weeks after the ...\nWas written by Hillary\nWe're going to talk to Barry claiming about the role that Mr Clinton up let's play because\nOf the sanctimonious way he interviewed Sarah Sanders and service members have big race not to bring up his behavior during the Clinton years\nLet's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations to determine his entire\nFeature seen though that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly is accused when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one Brett Kavanaugh has accused the president consistently every single time takes the side of the man you\nKnow it's interesting that you say that it's not a lot of Democrats that like to ignore Keith Ellison Cory Booker they love to fight and champion women until they disagree with how Frank and lost his job in the sense that\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr Clinton up ... back in Nineteen Ninety two let's revisit\nThe government has a character problem but I take it that you're allowed to play and has no Carolina Colorado is that it's only well let me do is to not denied that he is engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he was talked about the draft into some people's character brother bill\nClinton's passes character tests throughout his life and throughout this campaign and he's two senators to Mr we'll fights and what he's been doing this campaign is focused on pointing to the American people on the jobs in the education that's what the American people care about they want to move into the future they don't want to be diverted by side issues that are not going to lead Republican attack machine divert\n[noise] that was then and this is now\nAnd a number of other Democrats should have the same type of sprint they look the president is the real question every single time the president is taking the side of the man against women is accuser that's not true\nIsn't that an amazingly annoying when we go back again Nineteen Ninety two George putting up a list of names and just I can send you a fax with names addresses phone numbers of of you in a fair with this is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that a Bill Clinton had an affair\nIt wouldn't make a truce it is completely [noise]\nIf he went on the radio\nAnd said that Bill Clinton is the father of illegitimate black child he wouldn't be laughed at people would think you're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] in other words you\nKnow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what is a reporter doing working a democratic politics\nYou're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] you never work again\nSo you were threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\nMaybe don't want to say a matter of you will be embarrassing for the national people will think nobody will believe you\nThis is again George went novelist Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people will think is competing\nWith the alternative is you don't do it cause any some temporary pain with people who tomorrow I'm going to matter and you have a campaign that understands that are in a difficult time [noise] and did something right\n\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence ... the other individual stories and there has been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talk about the brake having all that they know\nAnd they're confident that these things that happened final question what is the person who All right\nJulie sweating it gives the one who claim she observed a cabin up participating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she says she herself so she was victimized but can't say whether or not Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened is you're comfortable telling us\nWhat happened to me is probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen to any human being my body was violated\nMy soul is broken a I was not able to have somebody stop when I said no stop [noise] you ... I felt like somebody took me\nAnd basically said you're worthless there's\nNothing to us you are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes torn\nFrom different rock shows um I was touched everywhere\nUh I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assaulted a woman it was horrible I had no way to fend them off\nYou know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people was ... I\nCannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before this happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw mark judge there and they were hanging about the area where\nI started to feel disoriented and we're the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing I can share them laughing and laughing\nAnd very hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody said something because if Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world that he should get scot free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court he just I\nJust think of all to me if he does I there's no justice in the world\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door\nOr ... or the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yes\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause and girls to become an ... an disoriented\nSo they could then be gang raped genocide rumor bedroom by train as numerous boys I have a fair recollection of seen boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room these boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh what\nDid she say for you to say well it's so what happened and he happened to me I didn't put two and two together\nBut I Would see boys standing outside of the rooms congregated together sort of like a gauntlet and I didn't know what was occurring out that I Would see them laughing a lot of laughing I'm standing in line outside or on the line but definitely huddled by Doris and I didn't understand\nWhat it could possibly be and and your declaration you describe\nBrett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge standing outside seen them stand outside the door yes with other voice senior suggesting that in hindsight yeah you think he was involved in this behavior\nI Would say yeah I I it's just too coincidental\nNow here's what NBC's Kate Snow said about the things that's what makes it on camera there were different from her written statement\nWhat we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story our reporting we want to be very transparent the kinds of things are very serious allegations Kavanaugh has\nCalled Julie sweating story nonsense and as far as the president today questioned her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her claim there are things that she told us on camera\nThat differ from her written statement well we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who remembers pending parties with two is sweating again Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so far we've not found any one whole numbers that she's also unclear about when she first decided\nOh hey well as just Tuesday we have a whole week we come back Mary claiming what role did George ... numbers play him aligning shooters of Bill Clinton and how very effective Modi is right now I'm going to be town\nHall [noise]\nOr not telling the truth and at that time Sam Donaldson who was his co host\nOn NBC's this week called me up and he asked me about the monopoly is whether he had been found to have lied and I said Sam how could you leave this guy on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know he's a multi millionaire gliding hide ABC\nAnd now he feels for the amount that take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a stepping off a cliff under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell I had a very good memory\nThe memory you know the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was I have no specific regular recollection means I remember something I Can't remember now on the front of the ... justice so no he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to rely on those\nWere given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported room and re no because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary\nIn that book he admitted to working with a record for him to address\nBark alligator by your accusers but Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented now ironically where are you know today's world with some of the ... judges who are out of control\nDenying an allegation is enough to say that you think someone is that correct It's got to lawsuits right now because he denied that he sexually harassed or any women he's probably less destructive allowed to go for her
