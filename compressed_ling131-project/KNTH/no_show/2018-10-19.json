[noise] I mean of course lord they legal perspective\nBut we can't ... of this overshadow the strategic dimension pure ... alliance with so you're right there between Americans\nIn Israel right\nNow I Know this look I think it was an extrajudicial killing here that means that was not authorized by a court of law and actually it has to be taken\nBut I understand believe me that's what I've been saying for the last fifty five minutes that we do not\nWe kept Ron all of our alliances on this uh as if that there's not going to be consequences for that happening I think it would be significant consequences you can't approve the behavior and if the crown prince was involved they'll have to be held accountable\nBut uh this is a this is an awful situation I think when you look at it we have to look at it through the geopolitical once again nine dimensional you're west I mean that's what you have to do\nThat so there you don't ever want to sacrifice you know the strategic interest of the United states which have been you know goes interests have been a part of that region for decades or\nNational security or our intelligence intelligence gathering in order you know to to take a stand against this awful thing that apparently has happened there are multiple options that the United states has to take a strong stand or about this killing\nAnd even punish the people involved\nWithout sacrificing our national security interest I think the president and the secretary of state or setting the right tone on there you know wearing the clamor of the crowds on both sides of this shit er and er I applaud him for that because I think they realize more than anyone exactly what is at stake\nAnd that we have to make a statement but on the other hand we have to protect the vital interests of our own country\nSteve calling from Atlanta Georgia in line to Steve go ahead you're on the air\nPersonality now I Want to get a special like so many things that are my question is is\nOne of those individuals sanctions under the images the act that can be devastating not allowed to Coney nods you be the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd the heir apparent to the throne but you can't travel in the United states that would be a pretty big one so I think it's it's a diplomatic response and that sets a but again the evidence has to be shown to establish that but that's I think I think that's where this is the focus of this was going to be fair\nYeah and look again Saudi Arabia needs the United states more than we need them even outside the military brown which is where we focus Jay ... not only the Magnitsky Act but forty five billion dollars in trade between the United states and Saudi Arabia access to the U. S. banking system without which you really cannot participate in the world economic markets gay so look\nI'm you know I I think the question behind the question is if the determination is that the crown prince cannot be the next leader of Saudi Arabia how would the United states facilitate that are looking at the United states that uh we're we're not going to recognize the crown prince or that wall fracture our alliance guess what would happen he\nWould not be the next king of Saudi Arabia the U.S has that much in the ass\nLinda on Facebook as a good question what would the world look like without a strong relationship between the Americans and the Saudis are this will not be helpful for our relationship but it'll be difficult for the whole relationship or in the whole region\nI gave you the history or the United states has had a history going back with Saudi Arabia since Nineteen thirty three that's one official ties began and it's continued until today\nAre so I look at this colonels rather than say you've got to keep all of that in mind as you talk about whether it's sanctions or individual sanctions or will actually move forward here all of that has to be kept in mind\nYes or all of that has to be taken into account and the congressional act allows financial sanctions against you know the people involved in this as well as forbidding yesterday or the United states you know the thing that that we also don't want to sacrifice and it's just been in the last few years\nThat Saudi Arabia has allied itself with us and our support of Israel yes and in taking a stand against the the the Hamas and Hezbollah and all that ISIS or\nAn ice if they are our allies and this and so we can't willy nilly sacrifice that relationship but we do have multiple options and I think fans right we have enough influence that can do as a pragmatic Matt\nA solid his rain for a while or if he will not sacrifice his own national security or his reputation in order to defend this ... and that's probably a bargain where this is going to end up the crown prince is going to have to go\nWell let me give me a for instance so are you talking about Hamas uh west just girls which is much let me get a picture for those on Facebook this is what happened yesterday\nOr two a apartment a university about from Hamas uh destroyed it as you see a there were three kids inside a parent they are I'm In a trauma unit basically for a post traumatic stress\nDisorder or or worse um they they were inside mother and child were uh three children were inside one was an infant so these are bad actors in this region and and Saudi Arabia while they been helpful on these issues\nAre so that's why you've got to balance all this but they don't get a pass on doing this but it would also I don't think there's any question than you mentioned this in our ... between our our studios [noise] it would embolden our lives in Iran is the one that's winning today on this\nThere there there's three factors at play here that are really top line from Asia and they're all eyes one is Iran if you lose the alliance between the United states and Saudi Arabia you haven't embolden and strengthen her on the second is ISIS or Islamic\nAh terrorism Jay if you if you don't have an alliance like this one and others in the region or that that it really strengthen and the third one is Israel I mean you mentioned that that example right there at the Israelis going to defend itself and if if the United states is going to help Israel or defend yourself you have to have regents\nWell you know my ... my my my trunk is a mess I've got tons of books and magazines and show notes and copy cops and cameras wedding she found it but anyway so we are on the on the cover of ... of cosmopolitan it says birth control crisis if you're not looking to get pregnant you must read this\nSo I opened it up and I didn't even know that some of this was going on\nI really didn't but it's scary to be a woman in today's world I think and I network and well don't worry about myself so much and kept your is over there making faces right now she's holding back\nOn but it is because we you know we think it's scary it's scary to be a woman it is for me and my time to be a woman better than it's ever been because we finally are standing up for ourselves but as a victim\nOf a violence many many times starting with the time I was sixteen years old when I was nearly raped everybody that listens to the show regularly knows the story okay then I bought was almost was raped one night coming home\nFrom piece of a trial someone followed me I've been almost rapes coming home from a a from being out dancing and staying at a resort a\nI mean I could go on and on and on and it just\nI just don't even know where to start but it's so it just upsets me so much to think that they want to take away birth control or make it hard for women to get birth control and I don't even believe in birth control really because of the side effects\nBut it's not anybody else's decision to take away your choice to control your body and whether or not you want to have a baby and I said this to a friend of mine the other day I guess I Am being on a series see I told you got me started I said this to a friend of mine if men were the ones\nThat were getting raped or or or having a on consensual sex OK I'm\nThey and they were the ones that had to birth a baby I guarantee you you would see last change like that I mean like that they would change birth control would be legal or you would get you could you would be able you would be prosecuted for rape or we wouldn't have to have this me too movement\nAnd we're from brain legal and look what happened look what happened with the ... um whether wherever side you believe whatever you believe here's what I Believe where there's smoke there's fire stuff just isn't made up out of thin air not is in today's age and well for some people yes yes it is but I I\nHave to take the ... the middle road there and and do I think you should be beat up for something from Thirty years ago not necessarily but when you're when you want to be in the highest court in the land yes we have to look at every single aspect of your character but that's not what I what I really want to discuss what I Want to discuss is women's\nPersonal freedom to choose what they want to do with their bodies that doesn't mean that they want they'll go out and have an abortion but it does give them the choice that if they wanna have pre marital sex they can at least get on birth control pills and control their own destiny why should we take that away from women\nI I'm not saying we should\n... so it's just so upsetting what do you want to say you're a young girl [laughter]\nI say\nI it's wrong for um someone else to dictate your choices yeah ours well\nYou know and I I think the thing where we do I don't disagree about birth control would I disagree with is using abortion as a person\nI don't I don't believe in abortion either well here they they used\nTo that you know and that's the problem when the problem is nobody standing up per se for that life that's growing inside there when you decide to have sex and you end up pregnant\nI'm not talking about those my new percentage does in rape okay let's not even go there\nI'm just talking in general when you decide to have sex you decide to live with the consequences good or bad\nWell so many women are raped though and have sex against their will that you cannot take away their right to have an abortion if they want to if it's\nIf it's within or do you go there are those are such minute by minute they're not such a minute just sent to age abortion that matter in the ... and so and so we have an argument based on you can't\nBuild an argument around these women that would that would that would commit such a Horatio is a a a you know that's not the word I wanted to you it's just a\nOkay you cannot take that you if you want to say that then you take that same principle and you apply it\nTo a woman that would that would have a late term abortion very few women would do that and any I don't know any woman personally that would do that unless\nThe baby they were carrying had like a\nDoes he go virus that makes that had bigger than the body where the child is actually suffering in the womb and the ... and the pregnancy needs to be terminated your your your typical woman is not going to have an abortion we love children we were picked by God in the universe to have children but a man\nWho doesn't know what it's like I have this history a womb wrote a child and they're our body doors well you know ... I\nI don't believe anything at this point statistics from\nAny side I Know he was in that book is reality not how why you're taking their word for it then I'm just saying it's\nBecause it's right here in print 'em then I okay but let me ... complete my sentence okay these are things that are actually happening this isn't just propaganda this is actually rights that are being taken away from running and making it up again you know it's not okay I'm going to read it OK\nPlaces at risk women remain stranded only a handful of states still haven't expanded Medicaid coverage to use\nSammy plant family planning program to at least offer free contraceptive to cash strapped to citizens who don't qualify for Medicaid\nAnd you know let me just say I don't necessarily believe in giving anything away for free okay I'm very I'm conservative when it comes to that I don't believe in welfare and and if I Do it's a very short time because people do go through rough times in their life\nThings happen especially when you're young and you haven't prepared and saved enough money for things that just come up in life\nHaving said that um I don't I I\nI just think ah let's see where if you have to you have to understand like I'm reading this off the cuff to ... I wasn't prepared at all on the rise reports a pharmacist declining to dispense birth control because of personal belief\nOf crap is that in Thirteen states you know if you got a job as a professional and you're a pharmacist you have the you have the obligation as a professional to ... to fill that prescription for a person that is ridiculous and and you know do you agree uh I\nI don't know I don't know what the circumstances are who they are working for what they I mean I don't know\nIt says go Utah to state recently passed a bill that provides more low income women really very free birth control of the push came from a GOP politician who's also an empty um but this is like really crazy\nIt's just in this day and this day and age that we're still fighting about this do does I just it it bothers me that we as a people\nDon't understand that everyone has the right to do what ever they want with their own body not wearing gardening in life is living but who takes care of those lives after I born no one who can't no one that's right well that that's not a reason to kill it to her\nI okay I I agree it but the first term okay and you never grew up you didn't grow up in ... and the ghetto kept you know and it's true you know you don't know what it's like to to live in a neighborhood where there's drugs and violence\nAnd you get you even get raped by you're by you're your own father or your uncle or whoever and you get pregnant you think that child needs to carry that baby and not be taken immediately if they know there's been a rape\nTo a medical center on or an abortion clinic and and ... are given the ... the day after him and I guess that or get it out of their body\nHorrible right awful thing that happened and the miracle of life deserves to be sacred\nWell you know what another trauma it's that's their trauma miracle of life hasn't even happened in the first couple of days you know sorry\nHorrible awful trust\nKind of thing that happens and it's a minority of the percentage of abortions that are happening in this\nCountry you know why but you cannot take away a person's rights this country when you found it on I read on the way the rights of a person that's living inside of a person well you know what they are still a person you know what in the first in the first trimester before there's a heartbeat I disagree whereas a heart beat\n... almost within that first months where all organs are beginning to function in the first month\nAnd I'm not sure about that I'd have to I Am pretty interaction with the the heart and you can't pick up a heartbeat I don't think I don't think there's a heartbeat until like four weeks\nBut we're not even talking about four weeks we're talking about three or four days the next day after you know someone's been raped a woman should have the right to go into a clinic and get an abortion if that's what she wants to I wouldn't even call it an abortion at that point it's a cervical it's a well did they call that um\nOh my gosh what's the name of the the medical when you go in and you have a great idea and see exactly id and see which is to clean out your uterus so there's nothing in there anyway wow my ears the rat\nRace when I'm being honest\nAnd I'm putting it out there and so we got\nWe got an idea that it's good to it's good to discuss with you uh we've got a great show coming out today we've got Dr art Mark I'm going to be talking about you maybe less honest with others then you shouldn't be\nMaybe I should have just taking that advice before I just went live on and then of course kept watching how to intentionally generate happiness three simple to stay tuned everyone you are listening to one life radio\nYeah I Would agree I Would agree and you know um I can remember my dad saying that's when you when you speak what do you hope to accomplish you know and you're you're sitting down having a conversation with someone that you want to share something with them that maybe you know you don't necessarily agree with but it's ... it's all in how you present it right\nThere there's there's a great old saying that says you couch more flaws with honey than with vinegar there you go you know you can you can be perfectly honest and still be pleasant and constructive and and and be with people and and focus on how to do things better in the future\nYou know ... away from disagreement a lot in this society was\nThe unfortunate our soldiers was pleased to be a\nGood argument going on well earlier in the show because\nI think it's actually important for people to come out and say the things that they're thinking because it it's going to start thinking them just because you didn't hear him\nRight well you know or do you want to say something about honesty here about the conversation that we have\nWell no I think you and I have always been able to have those kinds of conversations yes do it with respect and love we know we're still going to be friends afterwards even though we may vehemently disagree ... other certain\nThings and and and and I think I think that's somewhat the kids did not get like we doubt about it right\nWell it's a very emotional subject for a lot of reasons I Can't wait for the midterm elections to be over with I've just I Am worn out from from just all the all the talk and just all the controversy out there but so honesty is really the best policy um\nI I Would say probably Ninety nine percent of the time of your life honesty is the best policy and that we should all strive to be a little bit more honest\nThan we think we should be not just because there's some ideal out there that that the that someone else is telling us it's the right thing to do but because actually a lot of our day to day interactions that are a lot of our relationships with other people will be better for doing that\nYeah I agree and I I I you know you can you can say things nicely again it's a practice you get used to being a certain way\nUm I don't think anybody likes it not even the person like you said you're happier to when you have um a you know more honesty in your conversations and in your relationships you don't ever have to be rude or negative or blunt\nYeah Oh absolutely and and and you know you learn a lot when you when you hear the truth ah you learn on you find out things about yourself that you could
