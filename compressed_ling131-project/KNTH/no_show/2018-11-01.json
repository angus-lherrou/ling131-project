Center for autism law and advocacy at the uh auto expect school she was educated at Harvard and Columbia University's Mary has worked in international public and private law she has written several law review and other articles on vaccine law and policy and is a co author\nOf vaccine epidemic and the H. P. V. vaccine on trial seeking justice\nFor generation for a generation betrayed uh she has testified to retain or expand vaccination exemptions and the ... in California West Virginia Maine New York and Vermont legislatures and as participated in several briefings for federal and state officials she has appeared in several documentaries as well and programs on vaccine issues\nSuch an honor to have you on the show ... welcome to one life radio\nYou so much like to be here\nIt's so great to talk to you I'm I've read the book and it's fascinating ah everything that's in it is just um incredible actually pretty shocking so the name of the book for all of you out there listening is the HP the vaccine on trial seeking justice for our generation betrayed so\nI just ask you why did you write the book and what are you trying to accomplish\nMy co authors and I wrote the book because we think that the bedrock of ethical Madison is informed consent and that people are not getting the full story about the age ... vaccine so we wrote the book to give\nTo side of the story that is not being told and what we hope is that people can really make an informed decision about whether or not to get this vaccine or give it to their kids\nMhm well you're not doctors or scientists oh isn't that a problem\n[laughter] I don't think so Bernadette um it's being recommended to all children everywhere and it's now even being recommended to adults up to age forty five one of the coauthors and I are lawyers that this is really a legal recommendation\nAh so I think everybody has to be looking at this issue and asking questions does this make sense does the science hold up to the recommendations work for everybody and that's what the book tries to do\nMhm well you know uh why do you think that your views are so contrary to nose of the global health establishment\n[noise] well I think that the global health establishment assumes that once the FDA the food and Drug Administration the Centers for Disease Control and the European medicines agency in the world Health Organization once they've signed off on it and endorse it I think most doctors I'm a believer in most parents believe it must be okay\nAnd what we were struck by is um because we do work in this area we were struck by the people who said by kid died for my kid\nUm became paralyzed or my kid developed um severe anxiety or my kid developed this pain syndrome and we were hearing these stories and we were meeting these families and we were finding out about these cases that were being filed for death in the injury compensation programs\nAnd so we dug deeper and we dug really deep into the clinical trial data and we find it shocking that um you know that these global medical agencies signed off on these clinical trials because if you really look carefully at the clinical trials you see that there were\nI'm One of the doctors who was involved in the clinical trials who's now quite outspoken about the horns says it the real risk of severe injuries one in five hundred\nYou know that may not sound like a lot but that's a lot\nIf it isn't ... you know ruins your life and ruins your family's life\nAbsolutely uh okay so you eat or why you say that the vaccine is on trial kind of vaccine be a defendant in a trial [laughter]\nThey say it's on trial is that we think it it we we focus on the clinical trials which should have shown that the vaccines were safe and they didn't they basically show that\nVaccines caused a lot of harm and it was math and we say they're on trial because right now there are lawsuits around the world there's one in California ... mark that I think we have to walk\nThere is a constitutional court cases in Colombia the Supreme Court in India litigating there's a class action in Japan there's a case in the European Union this vaccine is on trial around the world because it's causing severe harm and death young people\nWell I can only imagine the devastation after going through a wet cold and a and his family went through the last thing you would think of after going through something like that is to you know then engage in a lawsuit with a huge company like Mark and I'm I'm sure so many children that get injured don't want to go down that path but they really\nMust in order to to bring this uh bring light to what's really going on in this industry so you know how you say that a generation has been betrayed betrayed by whom and in what way\n[noise] well I think the trailer is by the all of the people that are endorsing the vaccine when it wasn't properly tested so we think that children have been betrayed by the manufacturers they've been betrayed by the international and national health regulators and they're being betrayed by the physicians\nUnknowingly usually but they're being betrayed by the physicians who were actively promoting this vaccine all of those people ... knew or should have known\nThat the risks here are very significant and they should have been warning about the risk or they should have just made a better product yeah it's\nHeartbreaking it really is um one more question then we got to have to go to break but you you you use the term uh so CBO in the book what does that mean [laughter]\nSo we we cleaned the term for the about which means of false placebo\nIt it seemed to need its own or they didn't do real science here they didn't have a vaccine against a neutral substance they tested it against an active since that has the same side effect profiles a vaccine\n... great stuff I Can't wait to have you back at\n... I Believe that uh uh either ... I think Ken is coming up next week as well in\nBergen I mean they are the other two authors and thank you so much for the opportunity to talk to your letters about this\nAbsolutely been my pleasure thank you so much a Mary thank you thank you write everyone thank you at the book is called the H. P. D. vaccine on trial seeking justice for a generation betrayed and my opinion if you're a parent it's a must read so we'll be right back we're going to break you're listening to one life radio [noise]\n\nHi I'm Bob Barker loses my rent venting before you buy cosmetics personal care or a household products you be sure they have not been tested on animals\nEverything from more cleaner the shampoos poured into animals ... down their throats\nThey suffer intense somebody even go by the price is never ride for products ... animals ... visit to the dog or listen to ruin the free company hm\nWellbeing journal is remarkable bi monthly publication is deemed by intelligent readers worldwide available in print more digital single issues for subscription focus is on living a happy healthy life and were venting or healing illnesses naturally\nPreventing or healing cancer arthritis cardiovascular conditions and digestive issues as well as nutritional solutions for often will help our regular subjects\nLearn more had wellbeing journal dot\nThis is only one that was a licensed professional counselor supervisor of been my career helping people with emotional problems but today I Want to talk to you about nutrition\nPeople ask me all the time when the tuition and weight loss advice and I always find muscle recommending Ravi can produce the food supplement called warrior bling bussing warrior I wasn't always that doesn't fit in fact\nI was very overweight as a child and as a counselor among emphasize the importance of the mind body connection or clean body helps with a clean mine today was some warrior when Ronald Reagan protein more information some warrior dot com and start living cleaned today Mm\nHi everyone is furniture that everyone knows that I'm a strong believer and the numerous health benefits of ... and CBD Oil as with any supplement I always do my research and my homework to find the highest quality product on the market\nThat's why I'm so happy to announce our partnership with the age some company founded by a group of the most experience and respected names and the CBD community age Tampa offers a line of innovative products that are all natural and tested for quality\nChoose from flavorful oils restored his body bomb and then the breath spray all and affordable prices\nAnd for every ... products sold the company makes a donation towards the fight against opioids and anti anxiety drug addiction and academic affecting millions of families across\nThe nation today H M products produce a sense of calm bite post workout information and the company gets back to our community what more can we asked for search online for a temp company and use the code O L R or twenty percent off your first order that's O.
