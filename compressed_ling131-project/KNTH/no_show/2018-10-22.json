right\nIf it's not right\nHolding in my baby brown libertarian fingers were going to put up on Larry Elder dot com and article from the national review August twenty three twenty sixteen the majority of minorities support voter ID laws\nDoesn't mean that the voter ID laws weren't racist right doesn't mean the art disproportionately negatively affect the people of color just means the people of color too stupid to realize\nAccording to Gallup Seventy seven percent of Americans Hispanics in Seventy seven percent of black support voter ID laws quote the figure is simply the same among white eighty one percent back voter ID laws into quote now regarding the effect negative effect on minorities\nLet me tell you where Mr know a very likely get this from it was a study bunch of researchers University of San Diego Michigan State Bucknell use two thousand six two thousand fourteen data from something called the cooperative congressional elections studies to study the effect of voter ID laws\nShe'd with a concluded quote the analysis shows that strict ID laws have they been originally negative effect on their turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries in general elections in difficult right\nSmoking gun Mary likes data and here's a study that shows the voter ID laws are in fact negatively affecting minority voters therefore Larry you must be wrong when you say that they're the institutional racism backed up people decry does not really exist in America\nExcept there was another study\nResearchers at Stanford Yale University of Pennsylvania look at the original study this is ... based on surveys that were quote extremely unreliable which skewed the results\nLooking at the broader research article in a publication called box which is not a right wing a publication to left wing publication quote looking at the broader research the empirical evidence has tended to find that voter ID laws have a small impact on elections\nData just does not support the conclusion quote specifically they found out that the data just do not support that conclusion\n\nThis thing on the other thing about this do you know anybody that doesn't have ID\nRaise your

laws rations why because they thought black people were just two incapable or stupid\nTo get id then at the end he asked why people do they know anybody that didn't have ID\nYou have an opinion voter ID laws they're usually pretty raping and [laughter] they're I think voter idealized their weight ever actually because um you say there was as far as it was a racist for sure it is\nSuppress

it works about ... phone data but let's see if they don't really know why is that they're just they're not aware that important I also think\nThere's a question of like black voting with them and how they how if you're a convicted felon like you're not allowed to do it and everything and when you look at some states like Florida that's a huge population and the and the like African American\nNow here and he's Harlem I act black people their thoughts on what you just heard you\nKnow how to black people feel about uh all these white people so\nUnderstanding because after all they they still
