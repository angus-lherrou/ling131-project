I Want to practice as well as\nEmphasized just a consistent time spent with God it's strengthened says for the difficulties or will you be able to handle it when it comes [noise]\nAh well you get the grace at that time [laughter] you know not pay for and ah sometimes it doesn't feel like enough to be honest with you sometimes it does it feel like enough and I'm working for that but the fact is that it did it was enough\nI just want to remind people pass the Bronx we kind of set of passing because of I think his experience in Turkey for so long but because of the refugee flow out of Syria\nAnd that he was in even in that original holding the daddy for tasted facility or there with his wife was a prisoners from ISIS\nYeah I mean this is these were a difficult situation right from the beginning uh and then he's a man you got to remember that yeah the ... the ISIS part of this year because turkey was dealing with this overflow of people out of Syria some who were ISIS fighters so again I didn't want people to to miss that it it passed readers' comments will go right back\nTo the phones and David in Washington state on line five David you're talking to the pastor Brunson\nHello pastor Brunson my name is David ... on the Jewish American ... nearly ... by a more radical Islamic ... when I was stationed at ride mind your day some with Truman ...\nUm especially considering my circumstances I mean to you and how that goes on bats that was true for you then although I can only imagine that enjoy then too I and many others that are no problem with it on social media including those that you it's great for a single day\nAnd followed you with a ... as much as possible [noise]\nYou know pastor I was thinking about that too I mean we we you know you don't even we don't even know the ... your heart we know the numbers of the reach that we are we not many millions or listening each day and all that but I think that the fact is is would would David just said that you literally had the world praying for you\nI Know you felt lonely at times and we do we talked about that I hear on air but the world praying for you um those friends made a huge difference in your life and and you release I Believe\nThat they they did and I as I said and I keep thinking again and again\nHow does that make any sense on a human level that so many people were praying for me that I think that God was doing this putting us on people's hearts\nAnd it's because there's a much greater purpose behind this than he is going to use these fares to bring harvest not only of turkey but in the countries around it so it's a very much a guy thing we don't feel worthy of all of this prayer by many I feel very humbled by it\nAnd are not at all or [noise] or but incredibly grateful for it\nLet me go right to the phones John Mark in North Carolina on line three John Mark welcome your talk of the pastor Brunson\nA thank you for having me on a answer Tammy in the sense of elation you stay out and feeling of freedom you it is when you're released and also whether they're a Bible verse looking back in hindsight that has come to mind about your released Senate and\nLet me and I just want to make a general\nThat's a great question let me I'm trying to get to some more questions you're below that's a great question I'm so you're at the trial that ... that the the really big night of the release of the day the release and you finally find out when the judge says time served what went through your head\nWell I can tell you the ten minutes before that we did not know that that was going to happen we didn't know if I had a bag packed to go back to prison and we didn't know if they were going to get me Fifteen Years or twenty or what and a week or maybe this will just the lead to another escalation\nPolitical escalation who knows\nWhen all come out or it's all about so when I heard time served a a ... it was almost unbelievable Noreen came up to me or near the front of the court and we just got down on the floor together we know together and we thank God uh NFL\nKind how awesome I saw the picture on Twitter or Facebook something\nYes yup and I'm so that was a that was really cool and then I went to a called the unfair advantage in New York City for PR stuff\nAnd the one hand what was that the the bird vantage unfair advantage run by Chris Winfield than he's known as a superconductor kind of like move house and there is\nA bunch of high profile people like ... actually but it could be on the show uh-huh uh first off um he's actually pushing me to Dr oz right now to be on ...\nOr you know yeah I think your um I I probably shouldn't say this publicly I'll hold back I don't want to be too honest I've been I've been a little too hot you're going to say yeah yeah you're really smart let me just say that your super super smart and so and so you'll bring the yo la you'll bring a lot to the table\nThank you and I I Would love to see you know I could actually get when you people now on the show I think it'd be great to a doctor should follow you on the show of course I Love that yeah so there's some amazing people that are there would be great well good ... you'd be going there to\nOh absolutely yeah anytime this the doors are open to know\nWell you know you know important animals are to me I and to most people really didn't listen to the show we all are big animal lovers here and I got more Davies on the line she is the I don't have a ... what did I what did I Do with you're saying look a moron yet you're the\nThe vice president I don't have it but I live by I think I Know what my memory I freak myself out she is a vice a vice president of communications for the SPCA\nI Love having run the show we're talking today about saying goodbye to a canine Fran with respect and love this is something that I've been through many times more I'd love to discuss it with you how you doing today\nYes doing well and thank you so much it's so wonderful to the on the show and talk about the important issues about are wonderful pets and nothing is more important than talking about respect for animals and nothing has heart or sometimes and talking about the respect that they really do deserve at the end of their life from us\nYeah it's true it is and I've been through it before you've been through it before uh you've been through before ... I'm guessing right over all several times\nAnd it is very very hard but you know a a dear old friend of mine told me the gave me this advice one time when my my dog Murphy a I had to put her to sleep this was several years ago and we call her ... a\nLittle ... I had her for Nineteen years I got her when I was in my early twenties someone gave it to me in Washington state when I Lived there I'm In Seattle anyway so little ... and she said to me and my friend said to me you know it's the right time when you can't do it fast enough would you agree with that\n... I mean that can be one way to know I think there are a lot of different ways to know when when is the right time when you're looking at the end of your pets like\nYeah it's difficult\nYeah it is in it so emotional it is I mean because you are so connected to these\nTo these um I think pets but they're not they're they're they're members of your family they really are you know\nMy my my my boy neck is getting so old and I you know I look at it I'm just kinda like you do like a an aging parents ... and say gee I Wonder how much longer they have her gosh it's so hard to watch them get old but deciding to end an animal's life is a real life moral drama so how\nDo we know when it is time to and uh pets life\nIt's going to be different for everyone but at the core of it is kind of the same I think one hard to say an easy way to put it because nothing is ever easy and just know when your pet is no longer able to take the joy out of things that they have always loved\nYou know whether that is their favorite food their favorite place to sweep 'em sometimes you'll know if you're a pet is just no longer cuddling with you\nAnd they're hiding 'em but it has to be so much more than that and I was involved\nIt's it you'll you won't feel it it may depend on how connected you are but\nIt's when you know that they can't do that they are not themselves and they're hurting yeah they're not hurting physically and emotionally right and and a lot of people can have a hard time making that decision that is why it's so important to to speak with family speak with your veterinarian\nI'm I Am the story I tell about speaking with a veterinarian I have faced a really hard decision of um having to you and I was one of my ...\nUm we decided that she was two elderly to try to perform surgery on cancer on a cancerous tumor that yeah ...\nAnd I wish the park broken about it and my veterinarian than I had we had we you know we should she took a look at her and she said you know I think this is the best for the call and let her be happy but as soon as she's not herself and as soon as you know it's time come let's have another conversation\nSo I was kind of on the fence and I called and and the wonderful that that that she is she shouldn't we talked about it and uh she even said well do you think that do you think that this has time to let her go now or would you like to take her home and have another day or two I don't recommend any longer just knowing where she is and I ...\nI I was so conflicted until that moment and tell she asked me that question right did you want to take her home for another couple of days and I realized I Would be selfish I said honestly\nIt's it's the hardest thing but but let's go ahead today and she said I think he made the right decision so sometimes it can be that consulting with your veterinarian right that if I don't think they are if they're if the bottom line if you're a pet is in pain if they're not themselves their elderly and you're a veterinarian and you have a conversation it's probably time\nWell you know I think of I'm thinking of a lot of different things right now I'm thinking about my one dog a Milly a wasn't a child that I found down in pleasant grove in the early years of pizza patrol and\nShe was bread every cycle we brought her home she got her healthy she was a beautiful wonderful amazing dog and she developed a cancerous tumor in her neck okay so we put her through chemotherapy I mean I just\nWe when we did everything that we could just shut down the cancer and knowing what I Know now I probably would have done things a little bit differently but\nYou know nonetheless she was like struggling to even breathe and so it got to a point where it's like it had to happen quickly but she wasn't emotionally ready she was inviting at when Dr Jimmy Norris came over and by the way if you do have to put down an animal I tell you Dr Jimmy Norris at ... animal clinic\nIs one of the most amazing veterinarians he is so awesome when it comes time to do that he is just absolutely incredible I Can't recommend him enough he doesn't even know what I'm Talking about um right now but he is an amazing veterinarian um but but ... this is almost like a very I was like a horror story if you will\nThat we went to put her down more on and I had given her like a valley in ahead of time because even when Dr Norris came through the front door she wasn't her typical south she was barking at him and she was real angry like get outta here I don't want you here it's almost like she knew what was going to happen [noise]\nLong story short her veins collapsed and so we couldn't even put a needle in her arm to put her down\nAnd we had to he had to go back and get more valley I'm calmer down at the veterinarian clinic and then we had injected into her chest\n... slowly in my arms and it was I still kind of have nightmares about it every once in a while but it is such an ... uh you know a a difficult thing to do and you never know how it's going to go with my point of telling their stories do you have to be prepared for anything yes\nIt's so true it yup that's that that story I'm fully electric but perfectly uh it it just it's they but our pets are friends or family they give us our our pets are our friends and family to clarify and as such they do deserve us\nBeing there to theater out to make the hard decisions when the towers right and that is what that is another way we can show them love\nYou know what you just brought up something I hate to interrupt you but this is so important and we have to go to break but I tell you a lot of people go oh I just can't be there I Can't be there to watch it go down I Can't be there to do that that is the biggest mistake you can ever make\nYou have to stay with him at the end in ... as difficult as it is when you leave that room you will feel absolutely amazing that you have completed the your love you\nCompleted your job you have completed that relationship with that animal that gave you ... see I'm gonna start your life of their lives right\nAnd they yes and they feel they feel your energy they feel how you feel at yeah and so it it's hard to know that and stay calm and I'm just to hold them hold them in comfort them can do that do the things that we've left yeah\nI'll tell you All right so so great to talk with you today about this more I thank you so much thank\nYou very much [noise] All right You're welcome and everyone stay tuned we've got a great show coming up Sean wells you're not going to want to miss that you're listening to one life radio\n[noise]\nDid you know there are three thousand kinds of snakes I suppose being shy pose no threat to humans but they still stand and killed even for federal us fashion and his piling snake teenage Lawrence novels snake drinking from a water trough\nShe succumbs to irrational fear and impulsively throws the longest of very animals had much moments before he writes and immediately I regretted it I thought how poultry how long do what I mean act\nI despise myself out of the voices of my of costs that human education and I wish he would come back my snake so he seemed

severe brain injury like me to benefit from a Trump company products\nAll my gosh thing yeah yeah yeah and restaurant food you have no idea like packaged like lasagna all that stuff us a lot of spaghetti sauce is catch up or just loaded with sugar and salt right\nMakes you keep eating yeah it sure does point it releases man you know you feel good like when you have and and you want more of a\nFriend it rise gift and catch all I Know you can't stop I Can't I Can't stop the sugar and swear and the crunch\nSo the question is now is sugar better than the sweeteners and we don't really know which one's worse I mean I think there's different effects that are happening\nBut what about okay hey I'm On a ... autumn calmly or last week we were talking and she said she was talking about making her apple pie or pumpkin pie or something\nHe says I use black strap molasses so I went and got song because it has a lot of iron in it and I know I put it in my ... um along with a little bit of Stevie Ott black strap molasses and I'm a teen the bit of sugar on top you know just to sprinkle on top with salt\nAnd then I use to ... and and uh and the recipe to swing now but I don't make them super super sweet but\nBlack sat strap molasses what about that\nAgain I think that's something that's more in its natural state and I like that idea versus\nThese these artificial sweeteners it's not just that it's artificial it that their height their called high intensity sweeteners\nThere like four hundred times one thousand times the sweetness of sugar ... and there's super potent that's why like literally milligram amounts equal Graham amounts of sugar and then they bulk them up the ... some without a respiratory tomato more equivalent in those two sugar\nBut there's super potent and that means it's having an effect like when you're when your body like on the time you're tasting sweetness your body's going into like certain modes like\nLike you know automatically like short cuts like hey what do we do okay we've got sweetness coming in so we need to ramp up insulin to do the need to change your gut bacteria\nBecause their sugar coming yeah and I really feel like your body thinks that right and then when it doesn't come then you can have that that crash because your influence high and you don't have the the sugar ... and now you have low blood glucose\nAnd you feel like I Need something sweet have you ever done like when I sometimes when I have like gum or you know some of these things of artificial sweeteners and I you know have a drink or whatever diet drink and then I'm like I really want more sweet now mhm\nYeah why is that because you're bottoming out in your body like hey we need sugar now\nAnd you know it's disturbing and I put a post on Facebook back I don't know about a year ago we got flagged for it as a matter of fact as I called out the FDA and regulate for putting aspartame in so many of their guns that are so to sell to children on and there's lots of studies out there that show the aspartame is directly linked to cancer tumors in my right\nBrain tumors right and actually aspartame I think is the worst of all in a ... for the very\nEnd kids

Bush being called a racist that's why I'm actually one is called George Herbert Walker Bush racist that's why they left\nCalls Donald Trump or racist who's gonna vote for it racist just random or racist\n\nNow it might be persuasive if they didn't do it all the time\n\nWhat did William clay and a member of the house say about Ronald Reagan when he was running Ronald Reagan got his racist precepts from mine cops are you kidding me\n\nJulian Bond the head of the ... in double ACP said that George W. Bush got his cabinet appointees from the Taliban wing of the Republican Party are you kidding me\n\nAnd then you have the admission mainly for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist so of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get some off the hook you know what I'm saying if\nAnybody playing the race card any white guys playing the race card more than Joe Biden\n\nYou said that a Mitt Romney did not want additional regulations on Wall street when Unchained Wall Street when they put you all back in chains\nThey don't want black people voting\n\nBut guess what these guys are all about man the Republicans don't want war of the class of people don't they don't want to black folks vote and look at what we're doing now\nAnd I have one more comment for ah for my friend from the Atlantic magazine\n... and this is a country where we make an exceedingly hard to vote we do that because a historically ... we have not ... that the country in the United states of America is not wanted black people or poor people to vote\n[noise] two thousand eight percentage of black people exceeded the percentage of white people voting for
