return to the United states um he has been released after this two year a horrible ordeal\nAnd I know it's been in the news a lot or a today but I always want to make sure people tune in and out of radio broadcasts that they know a director for justice represent the Bronx and saying we continue to do so there's a lot worse they're raised to be done\nUm as as we air right now he's not yet left turkey\nI'm a for somebody you hear the broadcast the different times that may have changed uh but uh but again a he has been free by the court or and or at least passed for a return ankle bracelet being taken off because there is under house arrest and er and ultimately will return to the United states\nMay or will likely stopped a ... at the military US military base of Germany I'm a which she could be on his way to as early as this evening I'm with his wife we are going to take more your phone calls or what a hundred and sixty four\nThirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four thirty what we've been ticket throughout the show so we do have some phone lines open for you right now if you want to talk to us on the air if you've got an e questions about this matter or about how helpful the White House has been members of Congress have been in fact let me play Senator Lindsey Graham\nAh who is on uh this uh uh on a TV this morning about\nA pastor Brunson he's played a key role listen to what he did on behalf a pastor process\nThat's been too long years is the key target cars or whatever about it directly as our relationship\nThe state and that is a great step for president Charles advised her to sit there and all over this [noise] satellite and tell us a scene that shows very hard for a long time [noise] when he gets home now feel better\nAnd I think again that is that everybody obviously you feel that way too is that you want to all to really see this a hundred percent completed\nAnd that is uh to me that's kind of leaving Turkish airspace you're at that military base or whether that's a jury is a U.S military base I stand these members of Congress like Lindsey Graham said they they played a key role even go as far as uh not just using their contacts to meet with\nThe president turkey but also to go right into the prisons to leave a pastor Brunson\nYeah far more than just issued a statement or giving a speech tournament several members of the house and Senate went over to turkey or to visit with a pastor Brunson also to visit with officials I mean you think about senator till assume senator she knew how to use their seats in the Senate Armed Services Committee or to raise this issue Jordan's so you\nKnow they they injected it into a conversation about defense programs that they cared an awful lot about and we're willing to take a human rights case like pastor Brunson into that debate and it really did put a leverage into the situation and again I Want to cast it in this lady was not and you know leverage that was looking to push turkey away in fact\nUh I think Senator Graham said it very well he wants a strong relationship with turkey wants turkey in the United states to have a positive relationship\nAnd he was very careful and directing communicating to his Turkish colleagues or that this this really is a pastor Brunson was going to be necessary for that relationship to be as healthy as he would like it to be so again\nA senator Lankford senator tell US Senator Shaheen senator grant and many others during the speed way more than ... speak out about this they made it a priority for them and they spent hours and hours and hours are working on the case\nOr let me go to Pam calling Oklahoma on line one actually supporting called the take right now Pam welcome to Jay sexual alive\nIs free choice and I think that's a better and I\nThink everybody an eye on that in the salon ... Kelly it's literally\nI just you know I think you heard what Senator Graham says they'll feel a whole lot better you continue to pray\nI said you know you do you prefer this family even after he's back to the United states because of the process how horrible a process this has been on for the family this is tough\nUm it takes a mental toll it takes a physical toll eyes health is a bit of the issue and that's why he was ultimately allowed house arrest was because of his house so it takes all the different kinds of physical mental emotional\nAnd psychological tolls or should continue to pray for the family obviously you could celebrate what is a tremendous victory in a great moment to see pastor Brunson are in prison because of his Christian faith and ultimately released today in Turkey you take a listen this is\nA shows the bipartisanship here than mentioned senator Jeanne Shaheen a Democrat a sitter she'd also smoke out this morning take a listen\nI Am a trail that really I applied for many people who have been involved in that park on the first of all the advocacy\nWife and their family they have credit call ... ... combat Russia [noise]\nIs that right after that first plane\nThat work at the White House apart in Congress [noise]\nThere has been so many people and the effort I guess ... years I Can't wait hold on American soil\nThat is again a shows that bipartisanship than right there a sitter or having senator Shaheen partnering with Lindsey Graham and senator till is centered life for a ... and ... and again because we all understand\nThe importance of uh see an American wrongfully imprisoned abroad or whether you know it's for but if it's for religious purposes of political purposes or especially the NATO ally they came to work together at a time of bipartisanship is extremely rare\nYeah during senator she and her staff were legitimately terrific on this when they work hand in hand with the White House she was a senator she and the White House are going to differ on a lot of different issues but on this one\nA day where lockstep she did humans work she went to turkey she engaged in Senate committees on behalf of him or her staff Jordan was regularly updating us about her work on the case and\nAnd look I I'm reminded of the apostle balls were the second Timothy where he talked about how he was suffering to the point of being chain like a criminal for the gospel buddy said God's word has not changed here's here's the analogy or\nA senator sheen you and I were not chain but we have an obligation to speak for those who are and on this one on the United states government senator sheen and others\nUh did just that alongside our members I I Can't uh I Can't be more grateful to each of them for what they did\nUm and you cry you it makes you cry the sound healing I woke up and I was like a raccoon you know when she was down I had a big black under my eyes from just laying there crying letting emotions out\nSo yeah about are really liberating\nIt is very cathartic very I just very very um nurturing is all I can tell I'm going to get some of those yummy blankets to young people are going to go back there and find out where they ordered um I I Love it you'll see when you see when you'll see 'em but you know we've got more Davies\nOn the line I Love having her on this show she is the vice president of communications at the SPCA that is this the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals of north Texas\nToday we're talking about vegan isn't and responsible pet ownership\nMore uh how're you doing today high great\nWell you know it's funny that you I didn't know we were talking about this but I was watching a ... a Joe Rogan uh last weekend I went on a I watch like three of his shows in a row he's so funny but one of one of his comedy bit\nIs about um tree huggers envy begins that feed that that don't see their cat meet any kind of meat or protein animal protein and how it's a kill them basically it's really really a devastating for their health right\nIt is actually yes there are several different types of animals that are are either carnivores or a bear on divorce and a specific to cats and dogs are veterans\nWould not advise you to switch them to a vegan diet oh no\nNo it's I mean there are some animals that are natural herbivores yeah and but for dogs and cats specifically it is against it that goes against their whole physiology to eat meat so dogs prefer neat but they're on divorce right though you know for example if your dog eat dog food and you might give them say your dog really likes\nUm you know a little bit of a carrot for a treat that's okay a cat's however are strict carnivores and they can have some serious health issues that come up if you do not give them the\nYeah Rodney heavy was on the show a couple of weeks ago he's got the the most popular Facebook I'm a site if you will want to\nSay it's planet planet pause I think is what it is a little pull it up here and just a second but\nYou know he was interestingly enough talking about the importance of course the importance of diet for all of us but he talked about feeding your um your dog blueberries and green beans and all these things as well as with the meat being like more of an omnivore diet like you're talking about\nSure yet dogs cats The Omnivore's oh gosh I had to pick any spring up he loves pasta and green beans\nOkay favorite foods asylum about well how about you know it was so that's a problem right what if it's you know ... we were just talking about the importance of diet with Stephanie I'm before we went live on the show today um do you want to share your story shorter distance important because I mean you know it all matters pets are part of the family to share your story\nYeah we were just talking about I have a a two and a half year old almost three year old who is still under twenty five pounds he he sits right at twenty four pounds but\nUm I finally took him to see a more whole you know take more holistic food approach and found that he was gluten intolerant dairy intolerant and he's not absorbing any nutrients and so that the acting his growth which was just talking about diet and what's appropriate for certain\nYou know these these are individuals or whatever it may can can seriously impact you know\nMhm but he wasn't gaining any way wasn't gaining weight and took him to shine pediatrics is that we used to I took him to Dr Brenda Texas functional Mattis okay yeah but\nTrying pediatric because as another just a pediatric group here in Dallas that's got a more holistic approach for folks\nThat are ... that are there ... I Wish I existed when my babies were real young but um but\nThe but the important thing I was bringing up ... with ... with seventies a son and this could you know transfer over to animals as well as a dairy yep and blue and those can be good for a pet for animals right\nWell it can depend on the pets um so I always use my example um I had a wonderful golden retriever who I'm I'm I'm so thankful that he lived to be Fifteen months of sound that he didn't get to live longer he's such a sweet boy he developed many allergies ah especially if he got older\nAnd I'm One of those allergies was a um he was allergic to wheat and great um so I had to make sure that his food so we had to have a dog though that was formulated for him so that he can get all the nutrients his body needed\nBut so that that he said that he wouldn't have that massive allergic reaction which was manifesting for him specifically as horrific skin issues mhm hotspots wall and skin just awful stuff that was very uncomfortable until we figure out what it was and then got a handle on it and got a gun to his diet changed and some other things so\nIt can ... it it can be really scary and it can it can be something as an amusing or close to getting mild mild as as as an allergy but allergies can be serious and deadly as we all know\nOh yeah and I mean yes and just like with us I mean if you're feeding your dog pasta like you said a couple of minutes ago make sure that it's really good pasta I don't even know about gluten free but definitely organic and free from ... in all the toxins that are in our food now and the Rodney ... a Facebook is a\nIt's a planet pause you are right and it talks about increasing longevity and our pets um and how to build the rubber dog I mean they\nThey cited dogs in um\n[noise] in the uh the a Youtube video that he did it was it's a fascinating video everyone should watch it\nWhat what's the name of it do you remember our legs you know I think it and I had to build a ... how to build the rubber dog that's what it is but he had fascinating information in there about the diet uh to to exercise and all the things that have wise to us too it's kind of funny you know uh there's so many similarities\nYes oh absolutely yeah and and I I haven't seen that and I'm looking forward to looking at us now uh because we want the best part has the there there are family members there are are are companions they help us when and I'll listen to us when no one else well uh it can be just as easy as taking care of ourselves as taking care of our pets\nIt's just very important to be aware and understanding that there are folks out there if if if they're out there who are looking for a pet that is the again there are pets out there\nMhm could inherit your living and lifestyle um and those would be rabbits pot bellied pigs ... I'm a guinea pigs some birds mice rats although I Will tell you right now my route for occasionally it does not but they love bananas [laughter] that's so funny [laughter] but uh\nBut no you're you're right about the uh the pasta too and and make sure that it's good quality food it must have been good quality pasta because that dog of mine named her followed them when I was five she lived to twenty\nWell I'm trying to remember in the ... and the video or the Youtube video with Rodney have IV and he talked about all the starch and the dog food and that's why we have so much obesity just like with humans with all the carbohydrates they're in they're consuming way too many carbohydrates\nIt's so important to get a call and good quality food and if you're concerned about anything absolutely speak to a stick to that a very unfair pet so that you can help figured I that's what happened was that we have to figure it out and it was it was the base and um for my dog he had several other allergies\nFor me but\nIt it isn't that hard to do something it's not as expensive as you think\nYeah I Know you can make your own dog food no no I have seven in a very busy life but I used to make\nDog food a big part of it I used to get chicken livers or you know maybe some beef and I would uh you know make it like and and a brown rice um I'm trying to think what else I Would put a little garlic in there and I'm a lot of people put in like carrots and\nYeah the mixed vegetables and I would make and it was and we had a you know a big region and so um it I made it in a big pot like once or twice a week depending upon ... cheaper oh my gosh it's way cheaper and it's fresh you know what I'm I I just want to start doing it again as it wasn't really that hard\nOn our um on our website\nBut more always a pleasure thank you so much for jumping on the air with us today always fun talking about our dogs\nAnd cats and rats [laughter] I\nSaid we've got a great show coming up you are listening to one live radio [noise]\n\n\nHi I'm Shirley there and with people for the ethical treatment of animals almost all the puppies for sale at your local mall or churned out by breeding facilities called puppy mills\nConstantly five minute drive down\nThey are impregnated continually until they can no longer produce the litter\nIf you choose a dog from the mall a dog it could have said from the pound will die\nContact Peter to learn how you can make a difference at seven five seven six two to P.

I mean I've ... of course I'm sure you could what I got up\nAt my home but like for for like a month right right you know so yeah okay so if I'm prepping for a month just the food alone yeah for one month what are some of the things that I Would put in my pantry or my safe for him\nYeah so I Would start with some dry goods things that are going to last like a good long while so you are going to want to do like pastas that are dry beans potatoes things that you can put in Dr Laura\nOkay a lot of good and what have you don't have any um if you have\nA life so I got a gas so if I'm lucky but yeah but what if you don't have a gas stove yet no electricity no water\nHow do you boil pasta don't you have to put stuff like not since the death and things like that and sustain you\nDried fruit yeah yeah so there's different ways I mean so you definitely want to have a storage that that as soon as that you don't have any kind of cooking so you ... you kind of want to do all based duly storage one that assumes that you can cook it when that assumes that you can't so\nUm if you can't cook then yeah you would want a bunch you would want some canned things so canned beans canned tomatoes canned tuna fish is really good oh yeah anything that would be like protein ... nuts and seeds with great\nUm anything you know that you can that's going to last a good long while can fruits and vegetables as well\nIn a ... a ... than that but I'm thinking of trying to think and so like protein powder ... protein when water that you can mix to make but then I guess you would throw the container out you'd have no way to wash it yeah yeah I'm saying worst case scenario you're you're taking all the way down the road which I think it's good I mean that's you know you kind of start\nDot com [noise] the other day I watched a documentary about a group of inner city kids who were on a high school basketball team and it opens up with the coach and the coach says he grew up without a father and he said these kids don't have fathers\nAnd he knows he's a father figure for these kids and it's called shot in the dark and I think it works on a couple of levels first of all shot in the dark means it's very unlikely that these kids are really going to be able to make it to the pros although many of them inspired to doing that\nThe other was because of the gun violence going on in Chicago during the documentary several of the people who were interviewed were shot a couple of them were killed\nSo far and away\nThe guiding theme throughout the documentary is if these boys had no right these boys had no fathers in the home these boys had no role model\n\nTanya we've talked about growing up without a father\nYou know they fear they now have no friends but it's\nThe way you know my dad and my mom separated and have a lot of mental energy in my home and also a marriage or family that I'm [laughter] now so he\nTalks about how you grow up without a father may I quote you somebody thank you\nI Know all the toll that took on me not having a father in the house the holding your heart when you don't have a male figure in the home in the ... you know it's like the\n\nBronco Obama June Fifteen two thousand eight Ford became president\nHe also said this\nHe was asked I Wonder how you came to think of yourself is black and why\nYou know\nFor those of you who are reacting to TI calling calling us Sambo and Snoop Dogg calling him Uncle Tom you might want to check out what rock Obama said when he was asked what do you call yourself what do you think of yourself as quote\nWhat part of my understanding of race is that it's more of a social construct than a biological reality and in that sense if you are perceived as African American than your African American now\n... that can mean a whole lot of things and one of the things I cured myself a fairly early on\nAnd I think the African American community has moved away from is the notion that there is one way to be black close quote apparently ... did not get the memo apparently snoop\nDogg Don limited terrorists set Meyer Corey sellers I guess they didn't get the minimal\nWhat car do you think Trump is as soon as the economy as a prop to win over black voters before the midterm\n[noise] I'm not sure he and using them as a prop per se but what Kanye West of done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who've gravitated in his\nIn his orbit which is just shower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but ... my issue with Kanye West is is quite simple um is that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool and Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about\nOur our issues that are that are central issues and many African American communities are very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depth\nTo um I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day he was talking about a spin programs and how we needed to have more than program that had to turn around and ask his colleague what ... me\nAnd so anyway what happens when it was as what happens when they grow don't read

people embarrassing himself\n[noise] wow\nWell [noise] same man Don limited says that Donald Trump is a racist\nSame guy who won just why there aren't more blacks and the Trump Administration anybody
