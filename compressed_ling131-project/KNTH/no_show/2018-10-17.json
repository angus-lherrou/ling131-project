the courage to stand up for my faith and ask prayed for\nParts Katie Chris kids but I still have that kind of ties how I react and LA there's full medical care for that\nTo help pay for day to get ready get ready for that time the strength and courage ourselves\nAndrew yes uh I I think that's a very important question and a side note is\nOne thing one when we my wife and I were held together for Thirteen Days were arrested at the same time and I have a seminary that Greece I ever stand the test to Matt and I've taught for many years I've preached and uh yet I saw that my wife\nWas stronger than I was during the Thirteen days\nAnd it came from\nA deep devotion she has that I should say consistent time with the lord every day for years she set time aside and she read the Bible and she just spent time in God's presence a parade\nAnd I was more sporadic I'd run faster than I'd slowed down but she was very consistent and uh it's not that she had been credible revelations every day but it was the uh over time the consistency and just feeding herself so that when\nThe crisis came and we're NFL together there are\nPeople in from ISIS the cells around us and we thought what's happening what's going to happen we had no idea so we're Thirteen Days cut off\nA together and and that are holding center and she was doing better than I was ... fan so I thought this is a mess it says she carries and I found a ... or I Want to practice as well as\nEmphasize just a consistent time spent with God it's strengthened says uh for the difficulties or will you be able to handle it when it comes\nA well you get the grace at that time [laughter] you know before and ah sometimes it doesn't feel like enough to be honest with you sometimes it doesn't feel like enough and I'm working for that but the fact is that it did it was enough\nI just want to remind people pass the Bronx it kind of citizen passing because I think his experience in Turkey for so long but because of the refugee flow out of Syria\nAnd the that he was in even in that original a holy ... dad ... facility or there with his wife with a prisoners from ISIS\nYeah I mean this is these were a difficult situation right from the beginning uh and then these are just a minute you got to remember that yeah the ... the ice is part of this because turkey was dealing with this overflow of people out of Syria some who were ISIS fighters so again I didn't want people to to miss that it it passed readers' comments were go right back\nTo the phones to David in Washington state online five David you're talking to the pastor Brunson\nHello pastor Brunson my name is David ... on the Jewish American airports were about ... really ... by a more radical Islamic ... when I was stationed at ride my ... some some with Truman ...\nUm especially considering my circumstances ended with you and how can you hold him acts that it's too early for you then although I can only imagine that things are way too many others that are in the parliament on social media including those that Jewish played a breach in ... bay\nOn solid you with a ... as much as possible\nYou know pastor I was thinking about that too I mean we we you know you don't even we don't even know the ... it's hard we know the numbers of the reach that we are we not many millions or listening each day and all that but I think that the fact is is what David just said that you literally had the world praying for you\nI Know you felt lonely at times and we do we talked about that I hear on air but the world praying for you um those friends made a huge difference in your life and and you release I Believe\nThat they they did and I as I said and I keep thinking again and again how does that make any sense on a human level that so many people were praying for me and I think that God was doing this putting us on people's hearts\nAnd that's because there's a much greater purpose behind this\nThan he is going to use the fares to bring harvest not only in Turkey but at the countries around it so this was a very much a God thing we don't feel worthy of all of this prayer by many I feel very humbled by it and are not at all or [laughter] ah but incredibly grateful for it\nLet me go right to the phones John Mark in North Carolina on line three job mark welcome you're talking to pastor Brunson\nA thank you for having me on a answer family in the sense of elation you fail and feeling of freedom you it is when you were released and also whether they're a Bible verse looking back in hindsight that has come to mind about your released in it and\nLet me and I just want to make a ... that's a great question let me I'm trying to get to some more questions you're ... that's a great question I'm so you're at the trial that ... that the ... really the night of the release or the day the release and you finally find out when the judge says time served what went through your head\nWell I can tell you the ten minutes before that we did not know that that was going to happen we didn't know if I had a bag packed to go back to prison and we didn't know if they were going to get me Fifteen Years or twenty or what and uh we thought maybe this will just the lead to another escalation\nPolitical escalation who knows\nWhen all come out or it's all come out so when I heard time served a a ... it was almost unbelievable ... came up to me or near the front of the court and we just got down on the floor together we know together and we thank God uh NFL\nReacted inside the courtroom I think most people are ran out to file their stories because they kept actually that day they kept most\nEveryone to keep up the ... you know the tissue to the ... the problem with the ... the role in the middle where you can't wait to bite us you get the rolling out a number of that old Marshall with an owl he will like look at it like yeah let me break your heart because it's\nFull of John ... uh you know it's got a core sugar we knew that corn syrup palm oil which is the cheapest right\nIn her I mean I don't even I guess it's in the center I'm like what would it be an ally but but I guess in the took the role of the fat animals wireless innocent\nRight but here's the thing I Want to focus on it's all the food dyes red number forty yellow number five blue number one ah and then there's some strawberry powder and their that's kind of interesting it's a very that's a very labyrinth ingredient probably as a flavoring yeah but\nIsn't it amazing that they use real flavoring strawberry powder but then they use all the guys yeah look a certain way you know I think that actually goes to\nFor me that's more of a showcase of how we manipulate food to appease the I tasted okay\n'cause I have strawberry flavoring in it and then why do we need to put red food calling it to make it look more red right more like a strawberry it's like a trick we're doing with our food to appease the guy instead of making food food does that make sense\nRight within the ... same thing and I'm reading it you know a red number forty yellow number five\nYellow number six blue number one and these are toxic pill to kids and their brains that really is everyone knows that um you're looking at me I'm going to\nOh I think it I mean you're ... I don't think everybody knows that and I think on a sliding scale there are kids that are more sensitive\nAnd whether the parents can act to their behavior after consuming something like that to the to what they just ate or not is really just a matter of mindfulness and I think because people are still saying that these things aren't harmful and that they don't change behavior\nWe're still fighting a battle that people should know this well\nThey should they should jolly rancher same thing you're favorite you're ... yeah OK twist lawyers and I'm going back there was a twist others even a Swedish Fish yeah no dish fish for the girls and young by those are good but again you know red dye number forty I'm you know just just\nRed dye number forty everywhere and so let me read common so does this is a little a little thing\nThat I printed out a couple of weeks ago when we were talking with say a lot he about the top ten food additives to avoid of course artificial sweeteners is number one on that list you'll you talk about that all the time when you're on the show high fructose corn syrup of course we talk about that much\nSodium ah gluten glutamate MSG we've talked about that many many times or you\nWant to elaborate on MSG because people I think forget how damaging it really is\nIt's an exciting talks and so basically if you eat the food that has MSG and tricks your brain into feeling happy while you're eating the food but you want to eat more of it\nAnd so it was actually naturally occurring and um some seaweeds and things like that but somehow they found out through the smart people in science that if you extract it and added to food\nIt excites them lights up your brain so that you feel like you're having a happy experience motivating your fake food but the problem is there are certain people with certain kinds of genetics or just\nBased on their toxic burden that that exploitation is problematic for them from a behavioral standpoint that word ... [laughter] yeah I Know it creates behavior issues yeah I can tell right away I'll tell my husband and he's even sensitive to it now\nWill go eat somewhere and I'll be like you know what there was something in that food they must have had MSG because I Will feel good and then it will be like a blood sugar crashed but I Know I didn't eat\nSomething that would have caused by like ... you can tell if you really start to pay attention to how you feel you can tell when you've had something that was a chemical that was ... loaded with chemical\nRight well on our children are little they got these little bodies and we're loading on with this let me read what I'm going to read here says about five common food dies\nOr or a ... a common food dyes a sunny show that artificial coloring which are found in soda fruit juices and salad dressings may contribute to behavior problems of course we know they're in candy they're targeted can't to children but may contribute to behavioral problems and children and lead to a significant reduction in IQ okay\nAnimal studies that link some food coloring say cancer\nOr watch out for these wants blue number one and number two these are all in these candies that I just got to get those you just get on every single one of them every one that I saw on the shelf I'm with the exception of a few natural brands which you pay a little more foreign but you know how expensive is it to fight cancer\nYou know or or behavior will of uh of uh problems and children and all the the the uh medications they want to put them on but let me continue here so blue one\nAnd I'm gonna get ahead of myself because I get so upset when I read about this\nI'm a animal studies have linked to us some food coloring cancer watch out for these wants blue number one and blue number two banned in Norway Finland and France may cause crime chromosomal or ... a chromosome ... am I saying that right why don't I haven't said that we're in a long time doesn't go like I'm saying it right okay but chromosomal a damaged\nFounded candy cereal soft drink sports drinks and pet food\nPet foods to okay red dye a band in Nineteen Ninety after eight years of debate from using many foods and ... are being used in many foods and cosmetics this die continues to be on the market until supplies run out\nHas been proven to call thyroid cancer chromosomal damage in laboratory animals\nThey also interfere with brain nerve transmission found in fruit cocktail\nMurphy no cherries cherry pie next ice cream candy bakery products and more yellow number six that's one of the ones that are we cited in every single one that I looked at that I've got pictures of my phone banned in Norway again and Sweden increases a number of kidney and adrenal gland tumors in laboratory animals may\nCause chromosomal damage found in American cheese macaroni and cheese candy and carpet hate carbonated beverages lemonade and more why we continue doing this and we know where's my thing on red dumb red dye number four\nForty but I mean I think it goes back to marketing I mean we're just we've just been so tricked by the ice to buy something that's pleasing to the eye instead of nutritious I mean we talk so much when I hear about reading your labels you're basically eating paint\nThat and he has no pain it's\n... it's been shown to harm your health especially with repeated consumption and all the food you just look at this isn't just Halloween candy this is stuff that we eat and drink every day even so that the repeated consumption the repeated exposure\nThat's starting to either that's causing some stuff that you talk about and\nAgain it's just marketing is just money we hear about this stuff being banned in other countries you know it's it's more expensive and it might not look as nice to use some of the quote unquote natural alternatives but we're so into things up please the eyes right in this country that we choose that over something that's going to serve us well\nYeah well you know a jelly belly forty nine flavors I got a picture of it here I'm going to read it OK color added red number forty lake uh I don't know what the lake means read forty like you get red forty in the lake I don't know and I wouldn't have actually\nI'm going to find out but a yellow five and six like blue one and two like a yellow five and six red forty one a blue wanting to uh to colored vegetables\nThey throw that in there and fruit juice color but all these all of these food dyes going into these little bodies\nUm and where is it for okay red dye number forty is a certified color that comes from petroleum desolate or cold tires\nOr the U.S food and Drug Administration mandates that it has to be lifted by name and food and product labels additives that don't need to be specified on labels are called exempt these coloring are made from plant animal or mineral sources\nBut it says potential health hazards according to the center for science in the public interest red forty and other AFC can cause allergic reactions and some people research shows they can also cause hyper activity and children and immune system tumors in mice red forty contains pie crust of dying which is a which the U.S department of health and\nAnd services says is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\nHere's the deal move our treat this in my house I don't want my family to be a walking laboratory experiments people might say oh well those are just studies in the lab and um yeah so I'm like you know when the studies in humans come out and five or ten years and we probably already know but I don't want to publish them mhm I don't want to be like oh\nSee I Wish I wasn't feeding ... my kids so cereals that are all these pretty colors that wasn't letting them eat gummy\nDrinks drinks that have the food coloring in for the last five ten Fifteen Twenty years so why don't you just hedge your bets on the alternatives in the interim that's just how I roll with us I don't want to have my family as an experiment because of that the first thing you do as a parent is just by the community without the food coloring and then hopefully slowly wean but can't\nBe much of it you don't have to have a whole bag of candy that lasts for two months in your room rotting in your room and don't let your shows that are on the crazy thing you know it's like it'll never ride\nWithout that her mom with a car oh true yeah I throw it in the trash I Want to do that I Know that sounds terrible and then I think how stupid\nAm I to do that and then I'm adding to the waste of money and what is it just the environment and she'll mothers would lead participate in this\nAgain you just have to stand up for the health of your family and you might stick outlook a sore from some initially but you will be a leader when the day comes that we all find\nThat All right All right everyone we've got a great show coming up ah we've got\n... she's going to be talking

and the gluten free trend and Michael Sallah is going to be talking about recovery after an affair stay tuned everyone you are listening to one life radio\nOf the quality of our food is bad it used to be like you know back when I don't know like in the in the seventies or eighties you know you see a\nA fast food restaurants usually a McDonalds here they're mostly out in the country you know\nUm but people still cook at home they didn't have the amount ... food that they do now and so I think it's just a cumulative effect based that's what that's what I yeah I'm I'm just so much ... much more quality food it's not like you you know you eat a\nYou know something junkie once a week it's like part of the American diet now and so I'm going to ask you do you think there's a link\nBetween gluten sensitivities and the way we is grown in process now\nI totally do it so different that how it used to be and I mean like you just said I mean who is that there are so many more process refined foods that are more processed and refined than ever before I totally think that has uh\nThey do that our bodies were just they weren't really created 'cause I'm lazy but I don't think they were created to be breaking down all these\nYou know the food there are created a loud and yeah who need that much different than it used to be I Would be nice theory I thought I'm going to do with it well\nYeah and you know I go back to my dad was in the piece of business I grew up with a pizza parlor ALS pizza [laughter]\nAnd you know our busiest day we sold hardly any pizzas during the week it was all on Saturday Night and it was a local pizzeria\nYou know and that's the way you know pizza once a week and the quality of the flower was good flower not junk flower mass produced um so we could\nSo different you know these days it's like we're eating pizza and sandwiches and yeah they're yelling hostile and\nUm you know all the processed stuff people are having that every single day and that it's actually when the low fat diet him around in the Nineteen seventies we started this kind of know that an addict and mourn grain and we're told that was how the now looking back are like well that was a bad idea because I've written better rate them you know obesity are\nDisease cancer diabetes went straight up mhm I think that you know we're just we're just so far away from real food I don't think it's bad to have that that once in a while but you know where where are you thinking like that every single day and I think that's where it really adds up\nYeah last question when we got to go to break Cassie wonder some easy gluten free substitutions that can be implemented into our diet\nYou know I always like to bring it back her real whole foods so you don't fruit and vegetable

founder of vantage point counseling services he specializes in working with trauma relationships and sexual issues you can find more about him at vantage point Dallas counseling dot com that vantage point Dallas counseling dot com okay recovery after an affair\nLet's start with is how important is trust\nAnd commitment in a relationship\nWell they're actually the foundations of assault relationship anyway so we're not just talking about\nYou know if you've had an affair than those are important things is is actually just the foundational piece that actually hold any relationship or so people have to know\nThat they want to be together that's the part and then they also have to know a they have to build up trust or what I find is that people don't necessarily um\nThink of trust as like small kind of bits for connection which is actually what they are they tend to think of the two biggest things which is I'm physically saving the relationship and I'm not getting cheated on mhm and those things actually can only damaged the relationship trust is actually um you know\nThe small things like I I Know a parts of your story I I Know something about your background I Know uh the under tones of what you like and what you're interested in those little gestures meet a lot of people in that so trucks was actually built\nYeah and trust that if I don't know of course I'm Italian so trust and loyalty are everything and it is in ... and it's just and it just like instilled in your mind I'm Talking like three years old you know you know you know a lot\nOf age about trust and loyalty um but we are talking about a fair so why do most affairs happen [noise] um\nIt's I mean there's a lot of different reasons there's um\nThere's personal things that can be going on for you know one person so a person might not be identifying something some need that they have some time that a something just gets bark when they meet somebody saw it happen kind of unexpectedly ... yeah um\nI caught sounds to me like a self control problem well it\nI mean it is um it it it's you know you have the\nCommitment and then um there's not a lot of awareness into so sometimes people aren't actually aware like they'll kind of denial like oh I don't really think I have feelings for that other person and then you know something happened you know they\nUh you know they might be in business together they have you know a few drinks out and you know some kind of event for their work and then you know one thing leads\nTo another kind of um you know obviously things are to happen so um so it it's it's it's not just the self control issues also self awareness mhm you being really aware of what kind of going on for yourself and\nYou can't keep Medicare Bernice plan replace Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that this twenty two million Americans people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and he would eliminate all of them that would be an increase for seniors this would hurt seniors especially and that's why a Mac is against Medicare for all\nWhen when you want to get a left wing persons John tightened Dan Weber asked him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay check but who's going to pay for thirty two trillion dollars over ten years yeah\nThat's right and in addition to that you're going to have rationing\nPeople say oh well Canada and Great Britain have great plans\nEveryone should keep this number like twenty two weeks that's how long it takes for a major surgery in Canada\nAfter they examined you may take months but you have been examined and now after they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks the average wait a lot of those people cross over the border and they get their operations in America\nThen wherever is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizens\nNow Dan I'm probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston way or something like that and he won that sounded it uh in Quebec and all the other provinces ultimately adopted it he still lives are as far as I Know in his nineties and he's come out and recently said\nThat I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlaw how private care and he pronounce the healthcare system or Internet in Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just got to look at\nAll socialize looking at a Cuba they don't even have\nA aspirin available and the local drugstores look at Venezuela they are socialized the medical care thinking doctors running too much and now the poor people literally dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because the socialism the individual means nothing\nThen I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a as socialized medicine Canada has a what I think Obama wants to have which a single payer are in Great Britain has something very similar\nBut when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they were in line a long time but that go to the local clinic or get taken care of it it won't be any money out of their pocket\nAnd so they have a serious problem not only that the recovery rates after cancer operations at the heart operations because of the way they rush medical care\nIs much less survival and Canada and Great Britain compared to the U.S was something depending on what type of cancer\nWas somewhere between twenty and thirty percent higher survival rates because it's not a machine like they have over there well you march in your march out your number is tablets your relationship with the doctor it's horrible system or we don't need it in America\nMy guess is Dan wherever founder and CEO of ... association of mature American citizens and we only have about Ninety seconds left what ideas to a Mack have on how to reduce costs of health care all\nWe got to use free enterprise for example we have a bill in Congress now with line co sponsors age are fifty eight fifty six listening to this so called the seven million people for free\nWe give doctors local doctors take a simple tax deduction for treating a patient for free\nThat'll cost the government about fifty bucks for the tax deduction for the doctor versus somebody on Medicaid who goes to the ER as a couple of passing costs a thousand dollars\nSo every time a person goes we estimate seven million people could be covered it'll save billions on Medicaid and Medicare for the feds and for the state so that's where the Mac is pushing\nThem wherever thank you very much for coming on founder and CEO of a Mac association of mature American citizens or Dan thank you very much I appreciate it thank you God\nBless God Bless Medicare for all forty thirty two trillion dollars over the course of ten years and when I was angry Ocasio Cortez was asked to pay for it she says well we're going to modernize things and we're going to make things more\nMore efficient don't you love it when someone who's never worked in health care\nHas all these ideas on how to make things more efficient because the people working in health care to sleep and figure it out\nWe're going to have you were raised your pay two fifty dollar minimum wage because it'll make your workers more happy there'll be more productive don't you think if I thought it would make my workers more happy more productive I Would need you to tell me to do that\nToo stupid\nNow rush tax resolution is the only taxing those informed and I back\nTax extension date for taxes
