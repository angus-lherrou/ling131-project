a pro radio show right here on hand ten Seventy\n[noise]\nHad a great question came in my face but from Johnson saying the ... the Democratic party it across the ideology\nMove the consensus that we've had here in our studio was yes because\nYou've got this um when I called mainstream democratic thought listen more centrist and then you have this progressive to the right of the left the Bernie Sanders almost a approach going up and how to Europe or what do you what do you say\nWell the only thing I Would add to the conversation James I think there is a struggle even inside the elected members of the party and I mean Jordan talked about how Nancy Pelosi would be the new speaker likely if the Democrats retain power I mean\nThat's actually an open question because if they're going to get a majority Jay it's going to have to involve Democrats who actually campaigning opposed to Nancy Pelosi both from the left and the right so I think there's kind of two questions for House Democrats one can we get the majority back\nAnd to who can unite around that can get two hundred and Eighteen votes on the floor of the house or to be the speaker of the house so I think there is a are you really are there are a lot of fractions inside the party right now are left I Would say less center and then far far your lap and they're having their own fight on it\nAbsolutely All right let's go right back to the phones yeah Linda calling from Georgia on line for Linda welcome to chase sexual alive they limit go ahead\nThank you for taking my call and or I was listening and I guess you know I Am a independent conservative girl out or African American\nDad lived Democrats you know we knew what our parents Dale and two thousand election I came out of the parties I think uh they they said I'm senator call I said\nI think it'll galvanized Mm and gave that extra pet for people to get out to vote 'em\nYou know I talk to different people I just feel that um [noise] you know people are tired of what they're saying wait you know I'm a mom with three adopt kids out of this stuff well I Want to say good things happen sure and I'm not as much thinking why he didn't\nWant to say good things happen for our children and what I see happening is that what time did we wake up we have data based it right\nAnd I voted for president in ... because I think the energy that he is and this is what we need to move America forward I'm discuss wondering what you think about the party's lives is that we've seen going on\nWhy would you said is where what part of Georgia you live at [noise]\nI'm In higher I'm slow because you're out west I laugh\nYou know no harm so look I mean I I think your your what you said ... ... is the kind of where things are I think that the American people you can take a much broader than Georgia made the American people are looking at how does this impact my children and grandchildren\nAnd you've got a situation now you look at the stability global stability which you have global civility right now and the way we haven't seen in ... in a decade or you have a sense of momentum I think I'm In the economy a low on employment\nA band even though the historically that it's still tells you that there's a switch in the in the house leadership or in midterms there's this this this presidency has not gone by the norms\nYeah I mean that that their historical data is political data I mean it's it's data that says it has a difficult for a political party that is in power to get the enthusiasm yeah but but Jay\nOr the the economic data and the other sort of facts to base data really all is flowing in the direction of the GOP right now so\nYou know it's gonna be a fascinating political study to see which of those two carries a because if you took us the one that would say that the Democrats are going to win if you take just the other and say the Republicans are going to say I think both are going to be very close but I'll be honest with you if I was going to be one party or the other heading into these midterms there's no question I'd rather be the Republican Party you think the momentum shift is when that significant\nAbsolutely and I don't think the I don't think the Democrats ever really had a real passing the Senate was only in the house and they saw that path and the house narrowed significantly over the last month\nFrom reserves in college now usually conservative hero\nAnd she spoke to yesterday conservatives were very are excited about what she did appreciate what she did for judge Kavanaugh in that speech her remarks\nBut I think it was broader than that so conservatives appreciate what she did even though they don't always agree with her a politically it it does show the big to the Republican Party\nBut independents and more moderate Republicans who may not have been as a doozy asking about getting out to vote this election cycle and never are in mid term election cycles\nI think that's where she was speaking to Susan Collins and if you could start as we said uniting the party that way with twenty nine days out well who cares about what happened fifty sixty days out\nWe now hear about what's happening now you know what what do you have in the president that's what affects the term elections not how they were doing Democrats two months ago are at war even three weeks ago when we were on the show talking about how now the Senate might be applied\nAt least if they could change again or go down there is not going to be probably political of it as big as the Supreme Court confirmation in the next or not I mean the next twenty like this\nOh darn it looks like a less economical yeah ah this is an easy one to answer from Larry in Indiana on line one Larry welcome to chase a Q A lottery Larry\nHow are you going and getting that so [noise] I Know when I asked all the stuff with that stuff [noise] confirmation [noise] ah what do you see is as far as says oh let's say that he\nWill be limited nomination put forward by the president and we'll all go through the process within the same thing in the house of environments that technically there might be other Vegas is on that one Yes sir I feel pretty quickly and do you see the um uh but yeah I don't put up one of these don't get as much attention usually sometimes there's some fighting in the Senate but ah it's not\nLike the U.S Supreme Court where it's like there's a ... like they're having to operate a down one it's not like that if the Supreme Court where it's a really affects things as much yeah I think that's I think that's where it's going to take another call after undergrad from culture yeah or Kim in Kansas online six Kim welcome to Jay Sekulow law if I could go ahead\nWell first of all you mentioned earlier so I mentioned about how fast fight a strict party that they stick together [noise] and I thought on it I'm Lindy gr inside if they ever get guidelines that the average salary that they're looking for you know because\nThey think it's not working and I'll say it might have been inside themselves [noise] somebody calling the shots probably a couple of people at the top there a lot of them I think you'd find themselves they just ... right\nRight well it is a big issue there that Kim is that opposition to a person\nHas never is never gets you cross the line and it will get you very close you can run a we don't you know anybody but Bush campaign which is what John ...\nAnd ultimately you got to be pretty badly\nUm because there was nothing galvanizing people pass we don't just we just don't like Bush so in this midterm is the whole thing is we don't like Donald Trump so vote Democrat or that is usually been historically it was supposed to do well in this or Cleveland bitter is not a winning strategy or ... you know there\nUm [noise] bless you for taking my car I just wanted to say that as an African American or land a sari silken unless a Christian but as an African American woman I asked and training for decades like saying to finally a wake up\nDonation right making the world a better place I bring them into my house and I let him out of their cage and um you get them I have a I have bigger cages to for when they need to be among the most part I kind of let them kind of free fly around and get used to be\n... her house is like probably like Snow White I can imagine you know that comparison and running around there's birds flying around people are like your\nPets are pets bird around my house if it wasn't for the ... yeah you know what\nI'm most parents say pets I said that some of the problem with them being passes they're incredibly intelligent but a great thing about them incredibly intelligent as you can potty train them so my um\nOne of my favorite parents I ever\nHer name was on a hot a after the heart ... and and she was an old rescued been shoved in somebody's garage for years was found with her mate dead in its cage\nTerrible so some construction worker that was just um it building up this way and he just offered to take her from the people gave them you know a couple of hundred dollars and uh so she came to live with me and she was amazing she's old and I could just\nSay I had her in a cage with her dead mate ... in the cage in the garage and rashes\nAnd for God Knows how long and so there are a lot of people go putting birds in the garage is a big thing because they get when they're in their cage they get loud and so people are like oh so then they stick them in the garage they can't hear them and so I don't like several of my birds have come from people's garages and they're stuck out there with like you know the bikes\nDiamond like see I Would think about what you're hearing like what do you think when you hear stories like I was shocked\nAbout leaving the bird in with me that's like traumatizing so traumatizing advice that's how she got her name so should we had to build our tobacco\nWow ... ... really well just put her holder over a ... when we're out in public um she didn't fly very well so I take her out in public with me a lot and I just hold her a trash can\nTell her she felt really that's crazy that is crazy\nAnd that you know they like to be near you so\nThey poop on you or they are they're very sensitive so my right now I've got a two year old African she's almost two two year old African grey and um she's not quite she's not quite old enough to be potty trained yet they're very smart so they're stubborn well and gaining it\nFascinates me how people want to take wild animals and and put them in cages and called them their own like what are we thinking and we'll\nEven allow these birds did they breed them here in the u._s. do they bring and say breathe them here they do\nBring some man I mean that's always the saddest for me or when you see these tropical birds that are adults and they've been caught you know it's like you can really that far I have for your entertainment that see a far away look in their eyes there's a difference between one that's been domestically raised and one that's why in the wild wow well you know is that but they love love and they love being with a flock so\nThey're not unhappy when they're not you know my birds do going cages my one of my birds as in a cage right now at home um but she enjoys the cage time and then when I get home she then ... and the house yeah\nCool all cool stuff well I'm I'll tell you it's not cool is what is what happened at the fair when I was there as I was leaving on Saturday after the OU Texas game\nUh I was lucky enough to be there and um I didn't watch all of it in the stadium though I went out and watched it in the Fox news like a you know television broadcast with my friend Carla Palmer um and so it ... it was fun but as we were leaving okay um\nThey were ... with a woman was saying get you get your light and I'm like oh boy I forgot about this from last year 'cause last\nYear they spawn this wheel and you've got a prize and you've got the ... they were giving that out and here's the thing about ... you guys OK so they\nThey they direct college games because
