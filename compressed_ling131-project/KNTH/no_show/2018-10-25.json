security measures that have been put in place have been have worked so far we pray that they continue to do so and let me just say if it's the final time we address it on air today or we can ... the fullest extent this kind of activity especially it appears ... somehow motivated just by putting these leaks together\nIdeologically there's no place for that the United states we can have vigorous discourse we do not do this to each other and whoever or if it's a group of people who is behind this should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law we put behind bars for very serious violations of crime in the United states\nUh back to the phones we go we're talking about this issue with the caravan or we Thirteen Days after the midterm elections you cannot again you just can't uh uh I Try to say that well you know tried to divide a I guess divorce the issue of the midterm elections\nAnd this caravan issue and the immigration issue it's all coming to a head at the same time by the way it would be see news reporter use a suspicious package was also intercepted it was addressed a former attorney general holder\nThis is unacceptable folks are I don't care what kind of politics you have this is unacceptable\nAs an organization that also is receive these kinds of packages before I'm a ... it's it's always on acceptable regardless of what side of the al ... at all it's criminal you should be prosecuted er and er and again thanks to our law enforcement officials\nAnd those officials you intercept these packages or before they make it a a two are there to did targets or take for that so far has been what has happened today let's talk about the caravan a lot of calls coming in about that\nLet's go to Chris said California on line for crystal welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nThank you for taking my call I well my comment is I I don't see anything for\nThat now that may be sent to the border and I think they said the question is I read about a guy that I ... and you know ... ... ... ... can anything Jerry Brown\nHere in California my hair letting these people kind of contact for that [noise] I think he gets\nTo stay out of the way maybe let his as a state guard\nAssist or the national guard or any other U.S forces of border patrol that were necessary or instead of letting politics or dominate his decision making unfortunately I think thirty days out from mid term elections\nAre at a very liberal a governor is likely not going to to make those decisions so I think at best he can stay out of the way let a local\nLaw enforcement there in California do the right thing or if he would the federal government or or who is there to provide the main support when it comes to our border it's the federal government uh that that a defense our border and also deals with situations at the border but but yeah I could I\nSee what you're going with it is that what could California's governor do\nUh some of the state government officials there who are very liberal do to try and help a ... and even encourage these kind of care of as in the future and I think that's a serious problem\nLet me go to a Andy On that and they are just they had been an anti first the idea that politicians we looked up the group behind this they're based in Oakland, California does surprise there\nAnd it's a village Without Borders is what it translates to they'll take your donations they are going to use these caravans right out of California\nRight now I agree with you what you said your and the governor of California needs to stay out of this right now he is\nA very left leaning political a percentage in the in the country as\nA and behind the California sanctuary state ideas sanctuary cities that everybody come in open borders no restrictions whatsoever on immigration come on come all that is not the attitude of the administration or should it be\nA and I think that the best thing for a brown and and those who support his position is to stay out of this and allow the president the United states who is really the chief protector of the borders of the United states the executive branch of government or do what it has to do right now in the face of this tidal wave of humanity that's coming in\nWe're taking calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one day but I Do want to go to say a minute because than I think we're just too close to election day\nOr to the midterm election and people are voting all over the country already right now casting votes we're seeing higher turnout there before early voting or what do you think the impact this has on the midterm elections I mean this is a top issue for President Trump and a congressional Republicans\nWill join I already think it played a major role in the election of President Trump he ran on a on securing the border on building a wall\nHaving a proper system for which to admit people legally and also keep people out who are trying to cross illegally so\nDuring that happened with out this caravan being you know in the news on election day I think it is going to be one of the primary deciding factor is\nUh you know all races and Senate races in in house races\nAnd actually I Would I Would double down on something and he said just a second ago\nOr the left in this country during politically has taken the position of trying to create policies on a state and local level sanctuary cities sanctuary stage\nThat perhaps are that are really a magnet for this kind of illegal entry the president has taken the exact opposite view I think the American people are going to go to the polls\nIn less than two weeks here and this will be one of the primary uh factors in who they vote for do you want to secure border and rule of law or do you want a ... or a or a lack of cooperation with federal law a law firm state and local officials\nThe heart of all of it was afterwards when Elizabeth said we worked out after that we we are inconvenient running\nAs well I wouldn't be able to move on and so I ... I Love boxing too\nI have one of those things in my bar and you know the thing about it yeah and then I never go out there I'm seems like I'm always injured and I injured myself again Saturday afternoon I broke my other foot 'em and you're like than what are you wearing those books for because I'm not going to hop along in a boot one of those other boots you know the flat\nLike ugly big boot because when I did it before it jacked up my hips and then my hips weren't right you\nDo have to you you're moving you're going to have to talk to the whole ... foot doesn't load and unload\nWell you know what my other foot still hurts my other toe on my right foot where I broke that about a year ago so um but you know right now it hurt to ... a little I brought in you know how I broke it and I ran into a cattle about\nWorking out yes the true story I'm not answering them less than working around barefoot dude like\nAnd I was I was working out barefoot it all and I got so much done without you know killing my fire ants and just you know I and I did it all myself I'd made me feel\nSo powerful just made me feel powerful guilty and I did the fire and the rest of my property I mean it draw the line what will with killing\nHim well what am I going to do they're taking over my agree\nWith you one hundred percent I just wanted to know where he drew the line well\nOkay so they're outside but they were literally there I mean I Can't even believe how many mountains that were it took me about an hour and twenty minutes to shake it shake it shake go around and you put the top of the ... with the little stick on the top to alert them that there might be food with hanging around and you're like yeah and\nSo I but I did it barefoot I was only going to do a couple of weight when Republican I was it like this white gotten night out it was ridiculous anybody with why not raise the woman what is she doing and so on and then I was like a farm girl Poland it up you know in time because\nIt was so why do I I went in the house with my with my night down completely dirty and\nSo on the bottom but I got every one of them down I'm One of those people like\nOnce I start something hard for me to stop I'm like there's another one there's another one oh my gosh there's another one you go back and I did ... one of the really took but anyway so I come in the house I think you know I'm going to work out got my cattle bells and I I did some nice squats\nOkay like several sets of squats and dance a little bit and then I thought you know what that felt so good I'm going to leave 'em right there to remind me when I get home that I Want to do some more spots in dead laps\nAnd so I left him there and so I was coming from the back to the front and one of my dogs barking I looked at looked at him and look the other way and walked right into barefoot right into my cattle bell and immediately like broke my left how\nIt's so hard to 'cause you can't like ... you have to walk it's like yeah your finger or something you can rest it\nJammed my and I jammed my rights on Saturday or friday 'cause I slipped down some water\nSome water and I caught myself on my couch but it's like holy mother of Jesus I'd have to be like really careful I'm going to end up being dad or something somebody will find me like two days later from just ...

run a little bit lie is great song from hot chocolate love that one [noise]\n[noise] All right what all basically all I've done thus far is irritated a lot of people because you're not seeing exactly what I'm showing you we've seen good policy from the Obama administration we've seen bad policy from the Trump Administration\nWe need to stop playing team a team B and recognize issues in policies\nCavanaugh is a sorry choice Kevin ... support the government over the individual and he sitting on the Supreme Court that doesn't constitutionally have the authority is assigned itself\nThat's dangerous\nWe refer to it as the highest court in the land and fine I'm okay with that but then we attributed powers it does not have a forty it does not half were granted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the\nPerson up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the\nRepublicans are going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like him and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him\nThink about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left with the right can we agree on something I Am a lunch break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes shoot a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we can go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to do some honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature I don't see racism as a bully Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been based or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sick sad thing is most of the left\nIs anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\nAnd the left is supposed to be deemed black right\nI began this whole program or made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the mindset of the public\nAnd it's got to stop being this way I support\nA person's right to self defense and what a sad as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is fat or we've seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas knocked the Texas Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen them come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one day a state representative Dutton\nPut out a an amendment to open carrying though he was opposed to open carry my understanding but he put out an amendment which all it would have done\nWas protected just put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile by people\nAnd Republicans desert Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profiled black people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks ... blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats\n\nAnd Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\n\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney who\nBasically\nSupported Obamacare lite you see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be were accepting

lacking dude\nDude they're just going to do to the idea I forget that my like eighties throwback kinda deal\nThat's what we're lacking we're lacking a focus on liberty because we have our vision has become myopic because of this left right fight\nGuys let's support let's get on one page and say we can support and respect liberty for each other\nLet's use that liberty one of God's greatest gifts

mine he had an idea and I don't know what I think the idea genuinely genuinely I I'm not sure what I make of it but I thought let me posted on Twitter and Facebook ticket comments and the idea was that what if we hired people from this caravan to build\nThe wall like kind of a crazy idea\nBut he he kind of explains it and I posted that on Twitter of fades away we'll talk about that in in our

you I'd like to know what you think but anyway I'm now we uh we're also do forgetting anything oh my gosh\nHow well you know a well you might want to get into ATF because we're in a little behind on

or I Wish we weren't the final phase 'cause we're so far behind but I thought maybe we could get somebody from ATF\nOught to talk about you know what it's like working at ATF\nThis is again is about religious liberty so we got Bob twin he's the vice president of public relations at ATF and we asked him you know what is it like to work for organizations that protect religious freedom for all Americans for free which is why we need to to help them out by giving something let's play that clip\nGetting to know our clients jak Philips ... a chief Cochran in Atlanta\nAnd I'm sitting in Kentucky a beer standing up\nFor everybody's freedom and they could have made it easy choice just gone along with what the government was telling me who do you need a compromise and their beliefs and

protects all of us\nWell there you go now that is Bob uh Trent so he's with lights defending freedom but now he also says that\nThat the mission of alliance defending freedom is to provide free\nLegal services and by the way this is like first class they they they can argue all the way the Supreme Court they've done it many times this is perfect comes of people who've been discriminated based on their religious beliefs right so listeners like you folks this is my audience without you there would not be any alliance defending freedom here's another clip from Bob Trent\nWe exist because of the

we have to tip perhaps to Francis Schaffer in the Nineteen sixties he was the one who really helped a evangelical Christians\nUnderstand that the Catholics had\nBeen far ahead of this a head head of us\nAnd that we needed to join for first of all we need to get on the right page with regard to abortion and understand that this is something that God calls the church to stand up for life and so I'm thrilled to see fifty years\nAnd not just that the humidity day but it but after France is a a Schaffer was talking about this that most evangelicals do understand that unborn life is human life\nAnd that we have to stand up for it but most or many evangelicals still don't have a beginning of an idea of why within marriage they shouldn't use contraception and I've had many conversations as I said I'm an evangelical but I I it's so interesting how we buy into kind of what the world is selling unless somebody really says no\nThat's not okay we just going to buy into it and they don't even they don't even think about it and there they say oh and you know we've been married five years but we're we're not having kids yet and I think\nWow where did you get the idea\nThat you could do that like don't you understand that marriage means kids and means family and if if God doesn't bless you with kids that's one thing but the idea that you're going to pick and choose you could say well we want to have one point seven kids just because we think we can afford it and stuff and I think\nYou're not really trusting God and and this is very controversial but I think it's important is one of the reason I Want to have young\n[laughter] I ... well exactly exactly and I mean they enjoy the calls and Catholics support so much from each other through the poll I Move on I mean Catholics have been

the author of of many books uh\nUh praised by people like the current pope Mary Eberstadt a you know we've had her on the program and Jenna we were just talking about how\nEvangelicals and Catholics have not only worked together on issues of life or and or sexuality in so many things that we have to deal with in this country but we learn from each other and you were just talking about how many Catholics in many who are friends of mine\nWho have um adopted things that you know maybe fifty years ago Catholic weren't doing like Bible studies or whatever so it is kind of wonderful to see the church being unified in that sense\n[noise] yes and and another thing that uh I don't know if it's still true some time ago that I heard that but because of the ... and you know the wonderful collaboration with evangelicals and Catholics on pro life matters um\nEvangelicals we're discovering natural family planning and and talking with faithful Catholics who said you know they're in a way to manage your family size that does not all these you know really vicious chemical subtle put in your body that are very harmful in so many ways and doesn't\nYou know involved devices that you know they they're called protection protection against what and\nYou know protection against new life he said wait a second um but that natural family planning works by people timing their sexual intercourse so that um if if it's a good idea not to have another baby and sometimes but it's certainly the case that another baby would not be really responsible act\nThat you can still get a engage in an act of such a low cost and making low All right\nUm my and I start stopped wanting to say sexual intercourse for married people our fates and making love but sometimes it's okay to make love without making babies right but you can't work against the\nRight people don't get that I Want I Want to be clear there because people often or they are you saying you know sex is only for procreation and you think will know however what you just said when you make it definitely not about procreation some you're doing something that is I guess at least a natural\nNatural and you really do we do the meaning of the sexual act or a\nSexual act I mean it has made it so that sometimes a sexual act\nDoes not reduce the result in life he's done it that way he's made it that that for two thirds amongst a woman really is in for their no baby can come about because there is no egg present right in fact there is an egg present for only twenty four hours every month and it can be fertilized for only twelve hours\nSo one has a very short ... reproductive window every month\nOr the fact is a male sperm to live in the woman's body for up to five days so even though she she really only once a month or a a spring that was a positive or five days earlier might result in pregnancy now that it's a very small chance but it's still a chance and\nRepresenting the people of the United states first not the people of the world's first that's what nationalism is what does it have to do with white nationalism what does it have to do with anything having to do with race but that's what the left tries to do is I Want you to ... to go back here just a little bit\nWe play a little bit of the stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the thing finish out what your reactions eight eight eight nine seven months age eight eight eight nine seven one seven to for three give us all is that the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston\nVery clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism not comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second\nA national is thinking about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear that this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree given the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history\nI prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on ... so we're going to agree to get where we started\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know what is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not caused it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many president has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay well what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you're you're you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway you you know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries and taking advantage of the United states if I have to use terrorists if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better game throughout the market is that right now is not not economic nationalism but is that\nNot economic nationalism is my class [noise] not if you look at the way the president of south ...\nCat an impact he would engage in saying like she's ... she's going out and partner with our allies that have a\n... say Seventy rural thank you for coming on your first year that she is on ice and B that live at the top of that music can\nBe on there of course was the end of the top of a interview that I did with a Seventy role this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that and um but when I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight nine seven ...\nUm she says she's not putting words in the president's mouth\nBut she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global just put the world's first in our country second nationalist put our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she and Jim Acosta are saying\nThis present just to follow up on your comments about being a national is there is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national I've\nNever I mean that's if that's not putting words into somebody's mouth for the purpose of trying to tear them down\nThat nothing is he literally said why did you skip the word white don't you mean white nationalist he stuck to stuff that weren't in his mouth I asked up and he wrote about it and she said no we're not putting words in his mouth that's just what he meant because he's been dog whistling and using coded language from the very beginning\nFor goodness sakes the president of the United states has set on numerous occasions I was not elected president of the world I was elected president of the United states it's my job to serve the people who elected me they are first\nI Want to give one great example that I cannot take credit for\nOne great example I think this is just the perfect analogy alright\nOn Twitter this morning when I brought this up and I had the conversation with Stephanie rule\n[noise] somebody tweeted to me and you can do so as well as France radio F.

China weeks two weeks before the election Kurt I Do not buy it for one second I smell false flags being plan to go ahead\nI think it is more likely than not not a right wing conservative outlier doing this look\nA it is one of three things at the right wing conservative outlier it is a nut who was a political and just whacking or it is a someone uh allied with all laughed attempting to do exactly what's happening now which is a conservative suburb violent Bob guys um\nIf you look at the evidence but we are constantly told how a random shooters are going to turn out to be you know and are a Christian\nYou know Republicans I may never never are we know that are Democrats have been urging violence and are off the grid tactics we know that the law has a history of bombings just look at the Nineteen sixties and seventies indisputable\nOr that they did it all it's also indisputable that we didn't see\nA nearly endless series of hoaxes mostly hate crime hoaxes on campus as an adult where someone did something horrible y'all idea swastika or news or something\nIt turned out to be the very same a social justice warrior victim or trying to create a pressure\nI don't know the answer you don't know the answer but I Will tell you this I Am not going to allow the meat\nTo tell me that I can look at the facts and fake this is a viable possibility I refer you to blame Donald Trump and sixty three decent Americans who are built this country feed it you'll end up and did\nA a base on the the the the sketchy narrative I think ... it will line\nKurt for the president came out yes or to today rather and did what a president should do so did the vice president by the way and they called for an end to this they called for civility they called for a no more violence\nHe said very clearly quote in these times we have to unify we have to come together and some one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts or threats of political sense of any kind\nHave no place in the United states of America well that was absolutely\nTrue that which of course it's true but but but hold on ... this is what I Want you to really react to\nThe response to that from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announcement or the minority leader Nancy Pelosi was to what President Trump suggesting that he didn't mean it saying quote from President Trump's words ring hollow until he reversed is his statements that condone acts\nOf violence they well this statement perks the party that actually has Maxine Waters and Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton and countless others out they're calling for acts of violence and instability in the public forum they're the ones saying that it's Trump and the Republicans who are responsible for violence going\nOh look they are black that they are blind and stupid because they missed the ... thank God if only someone wrote a book called militant normal on Amazon about this very subject they think we're stupid\nThey think we're stupid because Democrats are used to dealing with stupid people that is the rank and file Democrats [noise]\nIt's not going to work this is going to have the same effect as they thought can always a great idea let's trashed this guy and a drink beer and you know had fought in high school that's pressure and the ... that destroyed their blue way\nThis is another example of a situation that the they played it like sensible adults\nCould only benefit them political but they will not do it they will apply to bigotry and prejudices against normal Americans and try and paint ... marriage as\nSome sort of a set of violence psychopaths\nAnd normal Americans are going to say that's just not for you know whoever did this clearly needs to go to the weather is a right wing outlier a yacht well maybe you need to go to the house or a leftist trying to disrupt that [noise]\nUm and there is not a single conservative out there who condones this violence there is not one\n... heard that that's that's a big part of this because\nThe the moment even when Nancy Pelosi got shouted down by a bunch of people calling her communist just a few days ago kind of echoing and Mary ... there's been done to\nTed Cruz and and and Mitch McConnell and only challenge is to ah Sanders and sort of summers up immediately conservative condemn condemn condemn cannot you can't do that stopped that nonsense we don't

hours of this\nWhere where they could have taken the high road and maybe maybe scored some political points that's a political season or political points but once again have overplay their hand\nBecause they hate us normal people so much\nThey don't even bother to try and understand where we may be coming from so that they might be able to craft a message that appeals to us instead they say you know Trump's encouraging violence and they look at Trump and he's not encourage violent and they look at themselves and they're not racist acts of hate filled and they don't like violence\nAnd they didn't like it when as normal Americans do they went overseas and defended\nTheir country they are\nSaid this is more Democrat below me and you know\nThey are not going to discount the

catch up\nAnd you know that that is entirely possible that they are rocket discount that possibility and no one should discount that possibility the the the truth is what the facts are and\nYou know I've actually either this person will never be caught or the secret service and happy either grab them and we will find out who this person is and you know why\nI betcha it's going to be like every other situation where we had one of these where we were told we were responsible for some formal or little thing and then they find it some leftist says Pfizer\nYup planning on all sides in order in

I talked with him cause some earlier today he\nWas one of the first people to start using this term again several years ago trying to revive it because of its actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some who are looking and you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there in the open up the hour\nYou know this uh this the following his rabid peace keeper politically correct\nThe only thing politically correct about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that's the political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive I don't care\nI'm not about not offending people and neither is ... now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donating Institute and the or a Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to brags that leader Nigel for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation's first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus global is\nNationalism versus globalism\nIt's exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not a ambiguous it was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim 'cause I'm about what nationalism really mean since they have that experience there and as I said\nHe's one of the first people to kind of revive the term as the president said when he said you're not supposed to say that any more and it's ridiculous to say to not be able to say I believe in my nation first\nThere's this is part of that conversation with for him ...\nThank you for having me I have to I have to say I wasn't one of the first ever given that given that nationalism goes back hundreds of years\nBut certainly may certainly in in in in multi loans I think we we reintroduce to a little political lexical ... across the uh of course the ocean I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in and let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly\nWhen he when he you know tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's up a needs rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly or that he means national extend that I'm going to put my people first we're worried about the concerns of less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that nationally ms ... nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use anymore and I think we should use it again\nWhat did he mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction right hand but why did a tour nationalism which when compared to globalism is a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says more concerned about our people before the world's be\nWell because\nThere was actually a big role there generous about global aids and I mean I Believe that if you think about what a dog um over the past Fifteen Twenty years actually it hasn't really considered itself but the rest of the world is consumed itself\nWith a a political and cultural and media release a around the world whether it's in Beijing London or New York city of Los Angeles you know really served to shed be addressed um of the very very very few\nAre not married are very few have been you know exploit the workers at Foxconn factories are exploiting jobs from Racine, Wisconsin and so say for no reason you get a drunk Shea\n... leave it at ... at a nationalist wild people up with all the media Iraq especially because we can go out for several years I think people the study is life by the way I've seen\nOver the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he's had these nationalistic plenty but he's there actually come out and said it and and he and what he's doing by saying it\nIs is crazy gets another dividing line he's very good at doing that is a dividing line that he knows that the the ... the city too mushy the Democrats the media all of those guys\nThat they have to attack that lie they have to attack that product and they told me it it's very very hard at it gets mad and why wouldn't you be even different people even at the age of Seventeen whatever it is\nUm and they don't have the lecture logging them so they call them fight the idea of nationalism there to fight the idea that the nation states should be the final arbiter should\nBe chauffeured is almost impossible especially amongst the Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll revolution was nationalist revolution Hamilton Hamilton's ... on the subject matter of ... was a national and they don't give it\nUm you know what Teddy Roosevelt said about having one ... one of them one language and say goodbye to the immigrant assimilate\nEach nationalism and they had arguments against that so that's why they're\nAngry they're upset that he's been yet another from on that and I think that's what we've seen play out last paper routes\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is just just say just scream racism which of course is the you know the easiest argument to make\nA ... is our guest is a fellow at the middle east forum the gangs don't Institute in Lincoln fellow at the\nUh Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look I care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not that people have Paris and another event he said in his first year in the president's seat I was elected president of the United states not president of the world\nHow can any elected official whether he'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else suggest otherwise your job is to represent the people that chose not to represent the interests of outside nations especially if it comes at the expense of those who chose to lead them\n[noise] you know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually even touch the book is just come out on this subject if it's called the ... by a professor older your I'm ...\nAnd and he he sort of explains his childhood and and it it sort of also in by awful I mean the rest of the world's all you know the United kingdom and and I'm staring at math have a a an ... that we won't have right now\nYou know it's sort of ... what we've done historically imperialistic global distinctly\nIs look to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Holy Roman empire or you know the world is used to have it in ... words to one person where they are and they will\nOr several people wherever they are in the world and the world is currently doing that 'cause it's staring at the time the last few decades was the president of the United states you don't always refer to build\nA ... in that in the in that office is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all of that sort of thing\nAnd and it's it's it's a refreshing ... not just I think for Americans which holiday to you know like trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan which that it should be no money for public schools and it's a right\nUm I think it's refreshing for them but it's also refreshing that should be refreshing the rest of the world um where nations like Italy and nations like ... nations like India straight yeah an an oldie a a three independent sovereign nations actually don't have to act as protectorate table\nThey actually do have to act that independent sovereign nations and this was another thing that President Trump stretch when he talks about you know so he says look I'm not looking so flip protectorate or the looking ... allies\nAnd and so this is a major reset what's going on now I'm ... and ... and it pains me to say that when we talk about nationalism yeah certainly that was a period in history where nationalism\nUh ethnic nationalism specifically but very I'd be very quickly and spiraled out of control but have the people don't know that nationalism actually goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still looked like so many countries most countries I Would say around the world but for whatever reason\nNot for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us versus nation first\nThat through nationals I mean that is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge electrolytes up just before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever responded that pledge do saying\nThis is where my allegiance lives don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to uh to um\nUh Switzerland or to uh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national ...\nThere's no coat in it there's no racism and if there is no bigotry and then we need to stop this
