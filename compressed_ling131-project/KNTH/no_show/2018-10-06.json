and we just have to be clear about that\nOne hundred sixty four thirty one tend to get involved her final segment of the broadcast go to a seal jaded or two there's a lot\nGoing on we haven't been able to get to on these broadcasts and make sure to follow us on Twitter put her dot com slash Jordan sexual things that were there as well because a lot of this will be happening over the weekend we'll be right back\nSounds almost gum and ... do you buy about media now here's the gave in ... no I'm\nIn any other presidents either following successes would guarantee electoral victory in public approval record low unemployment of gross domestic product exceeding four percent\nMiddle class wages on the rise for the first time in decades\nConsumer confidence up poverty in decline all of these more would be a huge boost to any president and his party not for Donald Trump and Republicans polls which have been wrong before show Democrats with a double digit lead of every election with a strong possibility they'll retake the house and a slim possibility that sounded\nHow can this be three things I think one is the founding of the liberal media that are already blaming Trump with hurricane second the ignorance especially a millennial voters censored the failure of Republicans to do a better job of promoting their successes\nGranted there is the media blockade but still I might add a fourth reason the president's personality\nIf the president were to show at least some humility it would help him and his party better not by the Democrats win in November or all of this progress will be over I'm Cal Thomas\nWhere every copy of today's commentary business health I must tell more writers that values through media view about thirty seven thirty reporting the logo Florida we breathe zero three seven that to be about thirty seven thirty three forty key Largo Florida three three zero three\nSeven who's as the by the day and subject to begin to value the media help support\nWithout them his commentary\n[noise] everything the taxes can explain what's coming from the mainstream media if it were a five to ... sessions maybe you have something to talk about but this is a tweet to millions of people do we know nothing to hide\nAnd they are actually talking about a seriously filling my costs obstruction of justice folding the headline the Arizona Texas show we tend to limit on AM ten Seventy the answer\n[noise]\nJanice on Facebook and judge Kavanaugh wrote a great op ed in the wall Street Journal responding to this to permit issue which I taught told us it would\nBe the phase three attack which um we're in right now is on the as the sit at a ... has the final ... floor debate on the cabinet nominations did he just doesn't have the temperament whether you agree\nScrew the judicial philosophy or agree with it or whether you agree with a believe the allegations against him were not since they were all totally uncorroborated but\nPicking sides there that either way he just doesn't have the temperament and uh uh that's what's come out from Washington Post New York times uh Heidi Heitkamp a senator from North Dakota Democrat a Democrat Senator Feinstein Democrat Senator Schumer Durban Doug Jones or a Leahy and there are there are certainly more\n[noise] but Janice on Facebook rights that they keep talking about judicial temperament\nBut Kavanaugh wasn't being attacked as a judge he was being attacked as a person so he reacted like a person and he says that in his op ed or this was someone he was doing this uh uh primarily for his parents for his\nWife and primarily for his uh his children as well as daughters as well so let's go right to the phones a lot of calls to get through receiving a right to invite order of those who've been holding on the longest surely and Michigan on line would surely walk the J socio alive\nI focus on for a ...\nPlayer for a CAT scan out but for those that are taking that low fat off I have had the courage that they're going to need to take it so that we need to remember to pray for them but like quite a bit um [noise]\nHe is is that what they are and what the swearing in ceremony be Sunday so he can immediately start if the court on Monday or where they have to wait for any length of time ...\nSaid it can happen is as quickly as as a I mean you get to vote and you can have the swearing in um the uh you're kind of have the formal or a swearing in done very quickly you it was it that you know the media type person on Sunday and then they can be more and more formal kind of ceremony even after that\nYeah I think it would happen virtually immediately Jordan I mean I think he would be over at the court on Sunday whether or not the swearing in happen then or Monday morning or if he's confirmed by the Senate Jordan he's going to go to work immediately\nSo yes there just to answer your question very quickly sure it happens immediately what you would a likely be a kind of a small quick of it\nAnd then there would be a kind of a larger of it we're friends and family go um uh that's the case for other nominees uh uh but they start to work immediately is they have said back to the phones we go Stewart in New York on line three store welcome to chase like yo alive\nThank you for a while you do as or if you're a supporter of Israel and my question is in the audience by Kevin ... has been a judge as it's ever been in this you\nKnow I mean he got the highest rating you can get steward for baby a the American bar association which is very far to the left politically by the way when they they they are looking at these judges they look if they're kind of ... what ... how they conduct themselves it's not really supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about judicial philosophy [noise] um and he got the highest\nRanking you can from uh the American bar association well qualified so uh that again there's been no issues about judicial\nTemperament if you disagree with his judicial philosophy but no issues about judge Kavanaugh's temperament at all are brought up personal on the bench at worst a throughout his career before being a judge or the twelve years he served\nThe bitch back to the phones or we go mark is in California on line to Marcus welcome to Jay suck you alive\nThat sort of like a car and they\nGot like ... there is a ... attack first hit he got off a basically\nThat is that you know basically it was it was at least a attempted rape or you know a a a a a sauce\nI mean these are serious crimes is accused of mark is with no corroborate should even after another FBI report no corroboration no one will lead to even say you know say that that they even heard about this ever occurred\nYeah well this is I mean this is this is it's politics um\nAh the temperament issue again as it was just there next line of attack see he's too angry to be on the corner where they actually say that\nIt's too angry too much aggression to be on the court but that was not him as again the city I must eat the city of judicial philosophy there defending himself there's a big difference uh back to the phones we go stand in Nevada on live for staying welcome to chase alive [noise]\nMaybe I met this earlier but I guess I Need a lesson on representative for I've got right now I Can't I in my mind that marriage or something like ... or you'll manager who have overwhelmingly [noise]\nAh ... what is the wind wind direction [noise] to even get ... and the other I mean I Wish I didn't vote for the Washington [noise] do they want to go on their own are they what we\nWant anybody ever crass red state Democrats get through with talk that never really became ... he was catching up to a job I answer this vote a say and I think that uh uh the race was getting it just is getting a bit too tight\nAnd the Democratic party moving a bit too far to the left so that he couldn't talk with no action just didn't really work it but if it were a bit okay for them or the high camp ties in North Dakota of all places I think she's given up\nBy this will be what I think that she's done I don't think that's right because she does represent constituents like a standard set but uh but but than that I think for the job answer ties are likely the party's moved so far to the left\nThat are is trying to talk like a moderate but not actually vote like a modern didn't work and now we're seeing potentially am starting to vote or like the moderate he says yes\nI I think this is one of the main reasons that Heidi Heitkamp the race is basically lost for her Jordan I mean look the numbers for judge Kavanaugh in North Dakota in West Virginia are basically identical yeah the thirty percent approval rating a plus thirty pursue a ... percent approval rating in both of those states something like sixty two thirty\nIn each of those states Heidi Heitkamp is a new one judge Kavanaugh and she's getting be\nA rather ... only by Kevin Cramer a then you look at Joe a mansion and he's going to vote yes for judge Kavanaugh or at least the the uh voted yes on cloture and he holds a you know roughly a six to eight percent lead a they're in West Virginia and I look at his voting record as you said you were and it's been somewhat mixed\nBut the fact that he has voted with his constituents more often than Heidi Heitkamp I think that's why he's still competitive in West Virginia while she's getting beat rather resenting lead\nAll right ah I think we take these final to cause of the day remember the Kavanaugh a final votes are on up or down is scheduled for tomorrow or evening and Susan Collins has got a press conference scheduled for this afternoon a bed or maybe something for job at should as well Karen in New York online five Kerry welcome to just like you alive\nMind ... temptation mine too well maybe that was the original originally so who did it like in the in the seventies or eighties or abandonment and the Supreme Court Okay Tom Jones no not rare earth\nEarth that's it that's a cool name for a band yeah isn't what happened to him yeah I don't know your rare earth that's cool yeah I like it there you go well\nMaybe they'll come back or maybe maybe someone will me I I don't know the second the second coming of ...\nOh my gosh what we've got a really great show coming up to date we have ... Jews talking about Fifteen reasons to begin prepping\nBoy ... uh you know I I don't know what I Would do and we'll talk about it what I Would do if I had to evacuate my home my animals I I had a loss yeah I'm I Would have to kind of stay there I think but we'll talk about and maybe I'm wrong that could be wrong I we've got Doug Hoffman coming up I'm so excited to be talking about the flu shot\nA duck Hoffman is the host of the popular show no the cause and he's written a blog about the flu shot I was also reading last night a Dr Kelly broken who uh is a medical doctor and a psychiatry as a as well and she is um [noise]\nUh she wrote a book called a a mind to be around the truth about depression and how women can heal their bodies to reclaim their lives\nAnd in this she talks about the flu shot as well in vaccines and I can't wait to talk about this with Doug Hoffman I really can't but I I Will say this I'm I'm also very excited to speak with more Davies whose patiently waiting on the line with the SPCA of north Texas how're you doing today more [laughter]\nDoing great tells everybody they're\nReally good really good and uh I heard were talking about bee stings today which is really funny that I watch the movie just a couple of days ago\nA nice I I never\nHow political the B movie is it oh my God it was intense it's intense yes you need to watch it a an exit Seinfeld and Jerry Seinfeld and pay attention\nIt's very very good and you know more before we talk about bees I Want to ask you if you agree with us because I was talking last night with my daughter about cats and dogs and just how almost politically they have been put in in in camps as well so\nThis is what we think we think that dog lovers are mostly Republicans and cat lovers are mostly a Democrats are liberals have you ... what do you say to that\nThat really difficult one you know the\nThe only the only thing right and we didn't really go back to as many years ago we did an online campaign where we ask people to vote for dog or cat\nAll election day I'm a ... I had the whole campaign where people can vote price specific cat and I remember the one with chicken\nI Can't remember the dog's name but second the cat one and I don't know what that means but then we had another Lexus and the last presidential election and dogs one so I don't know oh yeah\nNo surprise there [laughter]\nAnd I love dogs and cats alike so yeah we won't get into politics like I'll never shut up okay All right well you know something funny too that a Lexie pulled off of Twitter it said surprisingly girls with cats make that a best\nEr make better girlfriends because they they've learned to to to um to love something selfish and dumb [laughter]\nWe say that I thought oh my\nGosh uh than and I the only thing I can think of is asked about religion and I'll say I don't\nYou go yeah there you go oh my gosh we make things so complicated don't we in this world um and I have to tell you after after watching the B movie um you really do need to understand how important they are\nTo uh to our ecological and just a system and the survival of the earth really and so many the foods we eat of course that's not what we're talking about today we're talking about these things with you so um and how to protect yourself home remedies things like that so what should you do if you're ... ...\nWell yeah the first thing you're going to do is to make sure that um you get the stinger out of there so one thing you can do is get a credit card and you can gently scrape the stare out um to be that the loss but it's really important to to try to figure out what it was if it's a ... of course you're not going to have\nA singer left behind ... but that that out of there if you do see that your pet is experiencing swelling whether that's minor or major\nThen it's going to be very important to contact your ... your veterinarian immediately and get your pets to the veterinarian get them treated 'em in these things can be very serious so can last things are things that people may not realize like some dogs and cats can get into a situation where their face to face with a a believer and a lot of\nTime and again where you are a all these things can be very life threatening\nThere are a lot of pictures that people will see on line of a pet um particularly dogs saying oh well call my dog got stung by a bee\nIn their mouth is all swollen can be very serious and it's something that you should take very seriously and contact you about a nine to see if your pet needs more immediate medical attention\nOkay so let me ask you this for those that can't afford to go to a veterinarian and there's a lot of people out there like that I'm a and the economy that we're in right now absolutely um so it is the first thing you could do because so get the singer out with a credit card or a tweezers have you have 'em right\nHa ha ha and then and then what ... cold on it to point out\nThat if there is swelling of any kind whether it's a nice thing or something else you can get a cold compress right there to help potentially um but the main thing if that's not helping if your pet seems to be an end to stress whatsoever if they seem to have a hard time believing if they're\nIf they're if they're they're whining or screaming and of course make sure you do anything you can uh to find a an emergency about an hour and you can also when you pick up the phone and call you could explain look I I don't have a lot of money but please help me\nYeah you know that the log without send you to\nTell them all and\nUm unfortunately and I I I I I Do want to make sure that um that that this is something that I get out there to the SPCA of Texas is not able to respond to emergency veterinary medical situation and we're just not set up to do so we are a a ... neuter and\nWellness clinic so vaccinations uh that sort of thing but um there are actually also pet insurance out there that people can walk into the ... the situation where they might need medical system right up there are also pet loan pet medical health loans that people can\nSearch on the Internet for 'em and uh just even even if you don't think it might be something you can I hesitate to ask the veterinarian hey do you have a resource do you know somebody who does that can help me\nYeah well let me ask you this because I'm thinking what would I Do you know what what would I Do is one of my dogs that song by Eddie and particularly if it's on the weekend because I have to tell you\nI Would probably not go to an emergency clinic myself personally because I've had that experience and they have gouged me incredible just incredible amounts of money I haven't gone and years and years but\nI really feel that um I don't know if it was like five times what you would normally pay normally pay and a veterinarian of to go to an emergency clinic however\nI haven't been in a long time and I did hear that there was one here in town that uh was more reasonable so check it out I'm not sure what it is maybe we can do the research for you and we'll put it out on her social media but I Want to ask this can you give your pat your pet and Anna histamine like ...\n... or something that can be possible so um I for example I like I'll I'll use my personal situation I had a wonderful golden retriever and he was allergic to many many things he had food allergies contact allergies inhaling allergies Kobe the it was a mess\nHe never got stung by a B. but um I actually called and asked my veterinary office what's um what's a ... a defense of and has\nMight be able to take and they helped me out with that as long as you know your dogs weight and you can talk about that with ... medical professional you can figure out what a good dose might be that ... absolutely help\n'em that evidence that I Do know that it is possible for dogs to take benefits that Israel yeah and better like product mhm but you know when you really really careful yeah\nWell I wouldn't I Would think you would go like by the weight of a child by the way to the dog um and just you know I think I'm looking at Seventy we're both in a sense of what we would do as a dog mine but ah so what are some of the symptoms are real quick of anti to electric shock and a dog or cat\nYes we'll end up liking shock is a very very serious thing and so some of the things that um that that if you see it's definitely something called veterinarian about even if it is going to be expensive even as late at night um luck for\nUh the the trouble breathing luck for 'em and an animal that is like seizing up if they're having seizures if they are um lethargic if they're non responsive okay please call your veterinarian alright\nSo good to talk with you I wore a thing I don't mind I guess one thing if they also have to
