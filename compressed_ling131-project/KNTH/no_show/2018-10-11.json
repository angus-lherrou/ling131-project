I think we were all the way that you know you got to the record eared rabbit cycle or ... ...\nOver there and back but it was going to be on the federal courts with you there by the way he ordered only about ... ... either ... or ...\nOr ... or ... or or they may come out in the general assembly pointing out or you know I got a full all over do away with a corner here to within ...\nYou may just something ambassador I think it's important for people understand that says you know what it's like being the only person in the room and so does she ... explain a little bit for audience\n\nDid we lose the master\nI think we have All right so one of the things he did say was that this idea of alone in a room and yeah that was you had world combination\nAnd get you there in the U.S really unwilling to take a stand or to speak clearly a for Israel I mean you know they were reluctantly do it and honestly the Obama administration's we send those final days who's going to\nBe very are dangerous and they were I mean they they allowed those resolutions to move forward Israel was Standing Alone at the un and the Obama administration the final days that\nThey need the we talked about Harry this shift that took place between the the way it was in the way it is now [noise] um this was a major shift that it really and it can happen to him pretty record time when you think about it\nYes it happened very quickly a Barry expeditiously or an inch or proves one thing that Nikki Haley will indeed be a tough act to follow\nUm she was a leader in withdrawing us funding from UN agencies that were indeed corrupt\nOr we also with drew for for instance from the un human rights Council on her watch and so we must continue to push such agencies to either change or they're too or alternatively collapse from a lack of funds\nAnd bathrooms you know and let me ask you this ... ... when you think the legacy of Nikki Haley as a U.S ambassador to pass through the United nations what do you think was the most significant or the ... we're going to go through a couple of what do you think the most significant achievements were\n[noise] what I think the ... a gorgeous you say are they read at all what you look at the ... against ... out a way to get rid of so\nYeah we're losing losing a little technical problem uh getting ambassador ... but now the UN ... North Korea was another when we talk about the middle east but the north Korea was another one\nYeah I mean I get a very key very ... they are that are ... that even the\nMaster from Israel see us talking about how the ... three areas that it wasn't just about Israel um and obviously they're interested in what she represents but what the US was doing it on the on on other issues as well very significant ... so I think\nWe played it the first thing again since we we had trouble are getting an investor lived with his he's moving around a response but he had this to say about Nikki Haley says on the record take a listen\nOr something you have the U. S. debate about their standing on the U.S and then they found a place people we spoke with us today and then you add up because I was afraid of stand firmly even when he ran that she was in that may not like the human right away to the votes\nShe was the other way and I think that that you that that we have so many calories and the Security Council and they don't want to send me\nAn important because if you want to me if I'm going to have what can we get to the un and the international community and today there anymore we spent so that but other than the United states so that when I was stationed at a bank of America stronger today\nThan looking at let's look ahead here because you have to look ahead I mean you know the ... will stay for basically ten more weeks and\nThen we're ... we're going to have a new nominee I expect there's going to be a fight no matter who it is um because they're going to be supporting the president's position and there's forty eight senators that long yeah the\nThe president is taking a very aggressive position or in a foreign policy was needed Jamie and we needed a dramatic shift in foreign policy specifically at the United nations and looked at as you know generate a lot of opposition inside the United States Senate and it will be a fight I suspect it's a fight\nOr that President Trump in the new nominee will win but I Do think it will be a fight and gee I I think it was so important than a bastard a known mention North Korea 'cause he's the Israeli ambassador and yet he sees that as one of the main agenda items I also loved\nThe fact that he referenced that sometimes the new ambassadors going to have to be the only voice in the room she would tell you a couple of things first of all sometimes that's absolutely literally I mean it takes a single detail on the Security Council you've got to be willing to stand alone and then sometimes while it might not be the only voice the new ambassadors going to have to be prepared\nWhen mask countries are staying up and walk out with a advanced the proper agenda they do the next in bats are has to be willing to stand firm and that type of situation\nWell she had a certain boldness area that I'm a little ... and uh I Would say grab a toss\nUp when we were with her uh and and and watch you are an action I mean I'd I'd met her both on a a large sitting at the U.N General assembly we're both made an address uh but I've also been ... you know at the at the White House from time to time I see her and uh she just has a tremendous presence\nAbsolutely and so I Would add she also was a clear and direct speaker you knew where the United states stood on a particular issue with Nikki Haley spoke\nUm in other words she did not hide our goals our objectives and our willingness to impose consequences both on the un\nAnd secondly the international community and thirdly on nations that oppose the American interests\nI sit down and Facebook gases or offer US ambassador to always served two years not unusual\nYeah I mean it's they're all different some serve for longer periods of time others have served a that last for your time last and and and move on I think here the weather is a unique is that a a she and she's going into the private sector but I don't think this is the end for a Nikki Haley in the public in a in a public life\nPatty and periscope said she set up a stand up for the next person I think that's absolutely true she was an extremely effective advocate for the administration's position she was just really affected both publicly and behind the scenes\nAnd she was not afraid as a bastard his own said ah the ambassador from Israel to the un she wasn't afraid to be the only person in the room or in the minority position advocating for the United states in our allies and that was a marked difference than the previous administration\nValues what he what he researches too he what he applies what he researches oh yeah yeah I'll do name and password seventies and come out and do you like to listen to seven hundred plus pounds and I go to be gone in ... in the health benefits\nYeah actually I mean it's it's going mainstream now a there was a bit an article on CNN News yesterday about intermittent fasting and how powerful that can be to improve a lot of a health problems like diabetes which is what one of the things we're going to talk about today we're also going to talk with you Daniel about working out barefoot which is something I Do all the time\nI always I I work out there but I dance barefoot once in a while I have\nLike my boots on or something but you know if I break into a a good dance but\nBarefoot is probably the ... what's funny is I have a girlfriend who she only runs barefoot so she loves to run and she runs miles and miles barefoot ...\nFoot on the uh well now you don't ask you where you live on a track she no I Know she runs she likes to do runs do like force the kind of areas holy for me I'm like anything under my foot other than a shoe and I'm a little bit we doubt\nThis yeah legit go barefoot or does she had like one of those socks that kind of cover up and\nBritish uh she had a lot yeah because you know she goes legit barefoot because once you were ... she says she doesn't she doesn't like it as much you can't feel right and that impacts hers though she tends to like to run barefoot\nWhen she runs like a marathon or something I think she uses her sneakers you know because of just you know you don't know the terrain you're not familiar with it but I'm gathering where she runs ... because she's so familiar with it right she's probably much more comfortable with it so she runs a lot of distance\nMiss barefoot okay I've been I've been that way since I was a kid and I can't imagine going out running like on concrete without shoes we would\nBe bad on concrete without she like we're not built to rather eat grass\nYou know sometimes I have not sometimes almost daily I Walk out to eat or my recycling or my garbage yeah and you know my my front yards pretty big and so I Walk across this one part of it yeah barefoot and you know it's got crab grass in there and and that maneuver around the the the rabbit holes\nAnd then you have people\nOn the regular had no idea about the size of this woman's house I'm telling ya okay he's got to other people's yards in her yards away she said she's crossing a yard and she's like crossing some major\nHalf acres\nOn it and he'll talk okay helicopter sand correct yeah ...\nI didn't know that I didn't know we won't even go there [laughter]\nI wouldn't be scared I Would step on something yeah\nBut I mean if you if you will like like with your friends you know Charles is built up ... to really talk if you did it got a lot of strong lumped on the ground like yeah yeah forty four seven then you're you're ... would be able to sustain the grass and all that but yeah walk around the girls would be really good for you yeah I get the ground being unfair to have\nTo go out every day but I but I Can't imagine running yeah ... yeah but even walking there's little tiny pebbles\nThose are the worst yeah again if your feet are tough enough or like when I was fighting fires\nCaffeine is a woman like we go we're\nBe being bad was brutally\n... is that words like just your feet are just like all jacked up drowsy yeah our winter clothes hate it when I work um our ... you\nDon't want to be in its stores have somebody stay in bed with you that are like all feminine if there are a man they want you want manly fate riding but\nDefinitely not you know three total slob toes okay I don't pause and all that crap now do you know with a mainly for it but I was just going to say\nWhat's the manly made it so it was a mailing panic I was like a lot of hair you know honest shafts like\nLeave\nOut even if he's eat up and like in like I Need a cold and get it back I Know yeah it would be bad\nWhat generation your to like we took some pictures and I are usually were under share it with my with my pillow uniform and so we didn't we couldn't where I'm sure there's some news with so much pressure is showing you have a lot of trust your Daniel my I have a normal amount it's not like normal I don't\nKnow that you're really starting to get through the normal\nHamburger were grizzly Adams but um he had to like pull his shirt down so everybody\nDown I've never really talked about this I don't think our assets or even maybe thought about it at the wrong thing as women don't have here and their chest hopefully hopefully I'll maybe around their areas\nAnd they're just ... yeah so have a accent like especially if you're incompetent and yeah I I Will only seen that on movies\nAnd some guys actually like actual shaving every single day like you know body builder type like one of the shade everything yeah but yeah the younger generation like one of our female trainers it's probably like twenty two she's like oh my goodness you have so much church or you need to shave and I'm like no this is what it was what ... what you do a little boys like this where I Am\nReally slave I call it\nMan skating they gave us another\nAt all I mean it was this landscape and the whole body isn't it I thought it was very yeah\nIn movies anyway because the other is the ... I didn't know so yeah I thought man skating was like the whole man not just part of the man no to know and part of a certain part that's what I thought but I Will get me wrong I mean if listeners know differently they should they should definitely wildlife\nAnd they do they take that they they remove all the hair from their ... I'm I'm at the back I get it I mean yeah but you know really hairy guys I Love them\nAll the doors\nAnd stuff like they're always like they would shoot a church the shavings you see that as an issue with things now like that's what you need to look like it's not\nWho you are if you're Harry if you're ... ... yeah on it and like and if she doesn't like it then she's not the right girl yeah well well she might be the right girl maybe ... for a minute don't mean to you and you know I don't know about that ...\nPeople was one where they can't have a right to certain people that have children and try to shape to none and then there's like in a couple of our trainers have know Chet Turner older guys right and then have like one little Hitler look I got here are you for like one little here in the middle there that money came early that's called the wild hair you know yeah there are some of the nationalities and\nSo I'm not going to tend to have more Americans tend to not be able to grow out facial hair and they have no hair just use on the\nArea at all for girl girls aren't supposed to typically be Harry but you know usually\nDarker hair you have more you have um you just have more hair you know like I I I've never had a lot of hair and then my hair that I have is kind of thin for some you know I get I get that line right yes I I get that yeah I get that that is one of the reasons I like to get a caller to like ... ... my hair up to give it more volume\nReally that into your hair not if not if you do it right oh no makes it a ... you know make I mean you can't get breakage yeah yeah you know you do\nToo much color on too long but now\nInteresting here talk here today\nI Know how it got all around the horn for this I don't even know how they got to that topic\nI don't know but we've got a great show coming up everyone like I said we've got Dr ... donned the casino doing Quito it down to the best you know we're gonna be talking about diabetes or intermittent fasting a lot of things that are all connected a rose Lee Robertson men by more from manly men and Daniel Day\nTalking about working out barefoot state you everyone you are listening ...

auto immune disorder I never heard that but it makes perfect sense is especially when you say you have these wild fluctuations\nBecause I have I don't mean disorder and I never know where it's kind of hit me you know I never know but I Will say this now that I have myself on just a very very healthy diet and exercise routine for the last six years seven years I was basically um you know the last\nSeven years I have not had anything major as far as an auto immune disorder I kept my body so that should be key here isn't it\nIt is a you know with a type ... diabetic the damage is done and there's there's quite a bit of research you know stem cells and other things to to help regenerate the insulin producing a beta\nOver the banker is there's a number of researchers studying that but essentially the damage is done and you're not going to get back a functional ... so they're really stuck with round again for that and we're not saying\nThat uh that you can get off of insulin but if you're requirement is thirty I use it and so on a day uh it's very common to reduce that down to five or six I use it and so on today so what does that mean in practical terms that that means a dramatic\nA decrease in the variability of your glucose overtime and it's those posts ... spikes and glucose and the tips and glucose that could really be devastating\nTo the type one diabetic patient so that is virtually abolished if not significantly attenuated you reduce your carbon because you're not chasing your blood glucose right and they rent with the with\nThese fluctuations so uh that the patients like my student who wear a continuous glucose monitoring system a like a ducks come a they have reported and they can show all their days are over the course of a week and show it before and after implementation of a low carb\nDiet and just by looking at\nThe the glucose fluctuations in the course of a week\nBefore and after it's very clear that the the person following this guy is going to add many years to their life over time because uh you know that's going to pay big dividends you know\nBecause getting your glucose in the three to four hundred milligrams ... is doing damage to your organs to your eyes to to the other systems in the body that you don't necessarily feel\nRight yeah I Do feel if you go my students before you know I've caught him before he was really implementing this uh in in a low glycemic hypoglycemic episode it's very scary to essentially go unconscious\nYou're speaking got also control of the thinking about Andrew ... neck right they had to had talked it was so interesting and how he reduced his insulin was remarkable and then I have to tell you so last night it just happened to come across a friend of mine's new said and she sent it to me\nCNN had reported this story that I'm a after intermittent fasting that was three men that no longer take insulin for diabetes but ... a experts stress caution what do you say about intermittent fasting and diabetes\nYes so that's kind of image interesting you bring that up so yesterday we periodically get low carb foods like we had a key to genetic brownie you know sent to us too young to try and uh it\nWas late in the day I was about to go home and and Andrew was stopped by the office and he was you know look checking out his glucose monitor and I wanted him to test this product\nAnd I asked him when's the last time you ate and he's like well I didn't eat anything today and uh and I know he does intermittent fasting I'm not sure if he does it every day now but his glucose number was just completely steady like Seventy Seventy five throughout\nAnd he was in the lab you know working nonstop he was dissecting tumors from animal he's a cancer researcher who he did not have to stop prepare eat and clean up food so it makes them more efficient and the law so yeah I like that right ... you know amazing anyway but ah but the point is that yet like\nGoing an entire day without food or if you told that to an endocrinologist who manages patients with type one diabetes they were just you know a freak out they would say that's the most dangerous thing to do but Andrew and other members of the type one great community are implementing\nA if not intermittent fasting drastically reduced\nA meal meal frequency you know going from five or six meals a day which they thought it was needed to maintain stable glucose to like one or two meals a day or maybe three meals a day a but many many people do one or two meals a day a incorporating\nThis intermittent fasting maybe eating within a fixture eight hour window and it does wonders for their glucose measurement\nWatershed I Wish I Wish I could keep you on here on the whole show us such interesting stuff real quick as we got to go to break out is key to all of a ... diet affect those with type one diabetes\nHow does it affect a or what it does is it switches your body essentially from burning a glucose as its primary fuel to fats and key tones as a primary fuel and in doing so less dependence on glucose especially\nBy elevating the tone for your brain that really makes the guy at a a much more safe in many ways uh as I mentioned but the the main issue I think Dr ... is that it it's not people cannot comply with it but I Know people can so the limitation from the implementation standpoint\nIs that they think things like intermittent fasting or low carbohydrate diets are are much too difficult to implement even though they're safe I'd like ... years to a patient's life yeah they're the ADA is just a little hesitant and\nBut now you see her to health is doing a lot of research on this a Harvard and Duke and Indiana are publishing data\nAnd sooner or later there's going to be sort of even an ethical sort

it does not have a forty it does not have\nGranted that authority and now we're going to set this anti liberty anti individual rights in the person up there and we're going to cheer we're going to cheer for him the Republicans\nAre going to cheer for him and back him\nWhy\nBecause the left doesn't like him and that is it that is the truth the left attacked him and so now the Republicans must support him think about this guys think about this\nI don't care if you're on the left or the right can we agree on something and let let's break this down should a woman be allowed to carry a firearm to protect yourself yes or no\nI'm voting yes shoot a black man be allowed to carry a firearm to protect himself yes\nShould a white man should a Hispanic man should uh and we could go on and on and on it's not about the color of the person or anything it's about the individual's right to self defense\nUnfortunately let's be honest we're we're we're going to you to do some honesty a lot of the gun restriction laws are racist in nature\nI don't see racism as the Manhattan around every corner I don't\nBut there is some truth out there some of the laws we have past\nHave been\nBased or initiated on racism especially with regards to firearms and the sick sad thing is most of the left is anti firearm they are opposed to people having the right to carry a firearm having a right to self defense\n\nAnd the let just supposed to be team black right I began this whole program I made a joke about its black versus right and that's the idea and I know there's a lot of conservative black people I'm just saying the mindset of the media the\nMindset of the public and it's got to stop being this way\nI support a person's right to self defense and what the sand as we've seen cases where Republicans don't and what is sad or we've seen Republican and democratic lawmakers come up against\nThe Fourth Amendment here in the state of Texas not to take his Fourth Amendment but here in the state of Texas we've seen them come up against the Fourth Amendment because they want it to be able to profile black people\nReally we did I'm looking forward hopefully I'll have Harold ... non one

put another layer of protection on an individual's right in addition to the Fourth Amendment\nWith law enforcement unions came out because they wanted to be able to profile black people\nAnd Republicans desert Democrats opposed his amendment because they wanted to be able to profile by people so there is an issue I don't see the I don't see racism is the man behind every door but there is an issue now that being said\nWe\nHave to protect the individuals right regardless of what team it is\nAnd\nI don't know I mean the the gun laws were set out to target blacks yeah blacks overwhelmingly support Democrats and Democrats support gun control do we see this guy's\n\nRepublicans supported Obama are not Obama Mitt Romney\nWho basically\nSupported Obamacare lite\nYou see this we're we're fighting team a versus team be were accepting things we don't want or don't believe do I have any liberal pardon me do I have any liberal Democrat black men out there who think that the
