interview with Fox News helped his prospects of getting confirmed\nIn modern American politics will the new McCarthyism work will slander as and deceit analyzed directed at judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed or well enough decent men and women in the United States Senate step up and say no moss\nThis is not acceptable I understand the motivation of Jeff Flake\nHe just did not seem to understand that the left would not in good faith undertake\nAdditional inquiry into the credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh as they were termed by Democrats I don't think there are any credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh but Democrats do\nThey believe that judge ... forward as a credible allegation\nIn my world ... it's not credible to me and I'm corroborated accusation from thirty plus years ago that as many internal inconsistency that had been teased out over the weekend that anyone who was focused on it would agree simply falls apart under close scrutiny and\nThe allegation ms Ramirez don't even rise the level of allegation they are a simple smear\nSo the FBI will be busy with the remarriage allegations there's nothing more to be done with Dr Ford she testified under oath at great length and her testimony has no to the Senate there are no other witnesses as she has admitted they can't talk to Mr judge\nWho took up all the other boys from Georgetown Prep should be done today\nI fully expect Senate majority leader McConnell to acquire file for cloture tonight which sets in motion thirty hours of debate\nSo that on Wednesday they would vote on the motion to cause debate and if it passes with fifty one votes to fifty three votes or we may mansion and hike camp or left\nFor but under the mansion standard that you need more than an accusation I expect him to vote to proceed it will go to the Senate for final vote on Thursday that's what I'm hoping for all weekend long I watched them used that Democrats attempt to change\nThe focus from the FBI's investigation as to whether there are as anything\nElse to the credible allegations that Democrats are credible about which I I reject\nAnd that means the Yale allegation and the doctor blogs report allegation there's nothing else by the way they referred for prosecution one of the hits on Kavanaugh Betty rapes someone on a boat in Rhode Island that person's going to jail because they called Sheldon Whitehouse and that idiot\nDo people Rhode Island you have an idiot representing him in the sense that idiot leak that to the press can they put that out there again Brett Kavanaugh has two daughters ten and fourteen and they switched over\nTo a week on a salt on the fact that he was angry at being accused of being a rapist Saturday Night live when all where despicable\nJust despicable Brett Kavanaugh had been rated highly qualified fully qualify the highest rate of maybe a has and the west has been working all we get along to get that back because the left intervene and the person that the president's ... on friday without\nTalking to the idea ... they've got the highest qualification for ratings he taught forever at Harvard He is known by everybody in the legal community I don't know about that from the beginning when my first choice but I Will not let any stove go I'm thrown against the McCarthy ...\nKnow McCarthyism does by the way it was directed over the weekend I'm not going to tell you the details at a young left wing journal washed\nOr young left wing journalist on Twitter came under assault\nWith just a few keystrokes find out what you did at ... school to this person and it exploded\nThat's McCarthyism\nYou move from the Rosenbergs who were treasonous Alger Hiss perjured himself because he was a a traitor genuine honest to God communist agents to accusing and blacklisting people in Hollywood on the basis of mere accusation that tail gunner Joe stop you know it was set up the tail gunner Joe Margaret Chase Smith\nFirst woman senator senator from Maine stood up to Joe McCarthy than I Am hoping that every Republican follows the Margaret Chase Smith example and will have nothing to do with this I was disappointed when Jeff Flake\nPast or the FBI investigation I wanted to move forward but I Know he's a decent fair guy and he thought this would help that didn't\nJeff is continually disappointed by the people around him I Am disappointed and Chris Coons in an Angus King for not denouncing the smears I don't expect them to vote for judge cabinet debate they would prefer to have a liberal they would prefer to have another way to Kagan they're sort of my are but they lost the election\nI expect every Republican to vote for him and I expect Joe mansion Heidi Heitkamp to represent their states or they will be defeated I think they're

they are voting on Kavanaugh they need to denounce malignant evil slander against him Tom Cotton was on face the nation yesterday cutting number twenty three\nJudge having a hundred percent denies these allegations there is not a single bit of corroborating evidence every evidence that we do have to include the people that mess for herself name either don't recall this instead or they deny that had happened did you find this is for a fact important kind of\nMiss Ford was sympathetic and she was sincere she's been victimized by the Democrats in this process drawn\nThey portrayed her own requests for confidentiality they leaked to the media the last minute because they were on a search and destroy mission for Kavanaugh said when we last talked in November I think it's important that women feel they can come forward that's a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society\nA woman came forward here and you're saying basically she said nothing credible how can women come forward if when they do they're they're told that not credible she came forward confidentially Dianne Feinstein\nDianne Feinstein did not share that with the proper authorities Chuck Grassley her counterpart with him she served for decades and the FBI that could have reviewed this matter confidentiality confidentially then they leave it to the media and the greater rating the circus environment you're saying for the last two years\nFrom now he went on cut number twenty four\nOh John first off what's understand why we had to have this hearing miss for these allegations and accomplish a letter to die by him sign in July shortly after ... Kavanaugh was nominated the very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened\nFor three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process into a search and destroy a mission these allegations are completely an supported by any evidence what evidence there is to eight thirty six year old climb\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh their argument of course was that Dr Ford asked\nTo have this housing confidentiality and if they tried to do that and that's what it was what ... no no no no no John let me talk to you about that when you talk to your listeners about your views about that\nThere is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could show that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI you could have discreetly conducted this increase\nIn July and August without betraying the sports confidence it and they have betrayed her they pointed her to lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers gonna have to face of D.C more investigation and in the midst their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly it happens hundreds of ...\nIn terms of ... every year and the ... he doesn't have\nAnd then more dumped on twenty five\nIs drawn any impact missing higher episode of add on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault Jon Carson also do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respected her request for confidentiality smell when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence against ...\nAnd we would have known that confidentially inside of you shared many aren't wasting its time and I don't know what I don't know what they actually are going to find that the committee if not already found but at the Kennedy staff is already interviewed all the witnesses that miss forced out of the interview message\nBoard and judge Kavanaugh for six hours an animal you argue that your job and she sent him a letter that why even interview\nBut you're not right about that so they've either interview them or they received a letter for letter is under penalty of perjury I like I said for now these are actual interview so I'd be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change their statements that they've already given this year well ...\n... yeah one or cut from cotton because you'd be bad is the bottom line you do not lie in a letter that subject you to perjure you do not change your story when they arrived a doctor in person cut twenty six\nJohn we already know what everyone who's alleged to be the party that fiction emitted statements urban interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change her statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but it just makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh's\nVery highly qualified nomination\nIn in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign them was that may end up as a good I was just count on truthful and everything he said in his testimony I found him to be truthful throughout his testimony I found him to be
