going in Chicago right now right another three dead seven more shootings to round out another bloody violent weekend a Democrat controlled Chicago\nHere's here's my advice to you if you don't want to ... honestly admittedly most of Chicago's violent gang crime it's black on back black on black crime it's gang related\nAnd the fact of the matter is here's here's the controversial statement from the host if you don't want to be shot in gang related violence\nSo in a gang that someone's going to come out and say well there's a lot of collateral damage there is I understand that but predominantly in the gang violence gang on gang crime\nSo if you don't want to be shot dead on a street corner while you were dealing drugs by someone who thinks you're on their term it doesn't want you dealing your drug there\nThey don't do it don't put yourself there\nAgain this is not blaming the victim vicious called common sense common damp that the progressive left just politically correct the media will never tell you\n\nThey'll tell you I'm blaming Mr Lopez for being shot and killed in the store what I'm telling you is Mr Lopez bears some responsibility because he was stealing things that didn't belong to him\nOh you can't say that the hell I Can't I just did that not blaming the victim that's telling the truth\nUnderstand what I'm telling you you understand it there's an armed American radio listener\nBut other people need to know this end up getting again I say this\nI said oh gosh a weekly saying this for years if you attempt to deprive another human being now get this we're going to take this back to Donald Lopez's Lakeland, Florida the Army Navy store if you attempt to deprive another individual of their life liberty pursuit of happiness\nYou lose all three you lose your right to all three of the above instantly and I don't care what happened to you was Mr Lopez\nAttempting to deprive Mr done\nOf his life liberty pursuit of happiness here's the thing Mr done is going to try to argue that he was in court yeah he was he was stealing my stuff he had a ... it was in his hand he picked it up\nI didn't know if he was going to wait at me I can promise you right now that was getting ready to go down that the beat dropping their\nThat's what's gonna happen\nAt any good defense attorneys going to take it in that direction what you see on the video is in everything that happened and he's going to be right about that or easy\nWe don't know\nI haven't seen the ... the whole tape shows the individual on the ground bleeding out in dying as a puddle of blood pools up around it\n\nBut any good defense attorney who's going to attempt to do that that's what's getting ready to happen in that courtroom in Polk County\n\nBeatty attempt to deprive Mr done it was life liberty and pursuit of happiness is stealing a hack shit depriving him of his life liberty and pursuit of happiness what I'm telling us if you find yourself in a situation like that and this is what I Want you to think about\n\nDo you want to pull the trigger I Want you to think if you carry a gun every day\nFor your own personal protection and self defense you better start thinking about these things right now because if you don't you may very well find yourself in a situation like Mr done and you know what you might not be a ... it might be your car\nWe give you another scenario you got to jump or the hops on the side of your car while you're getting gas or maybe you leave to go to the ... inside the convenience store while the gas is being pumped in your car to get the automatic thing that on the pop right\nYou come outside of your arm you come outside see three individuals happen in your car and driving off\n\nCan you turn ... fire at those of those individuals in your car and I know you want to\nI Know you do the answer to that has no you cannot\nUse your vehicle were what Mr ... going through today this is what I Want you to think about\n\nYou know I always go back to Aaron Hernandez I remember watching the video tape of him coming out of his home after being charged with murder series in a ten million dollar twenty five thousand square foot mansion keeping in his twenties got his whole life ahead of him he's\nAn idiot and he's now charged with murder they come and get a T shirt and sweat maybe as breakfast is left on the stove is beautiful girl friend is their wife whoever she was\n\nMaybe he's got kids I don't know if he does or not I don't pay that much attention to him but the fact of the matter is the guy gets handcuffed walks out of his house\nNever to see it again never to see it again imagine not coming home\n\nAnd going from that environment to a prison cell six by nine\n\nStocked with another individual that you don't want to meet\nLet alone move in with\n\nThis stuff can happen to you if you make the wrong decision\nThis stuff can happen to you if you're not thinking clearly hey man that guy was stealing that ... for me so I killed him think about what I just said\nImagine the investigative so tell me what happened that do came in my shot many stall hatch it from me I tried to stop him okay we're all go up to that point you got into a fight with a fist fight what fisticuffs and then I got the best W and he took off was running towards the door and he got away from me\nHe got away from me he was running towards the door so I pulled my gun and kill\nThe guy shot him twice and dropped it man I'm not\nLosing another hatchet I lost to actions last week I'm sick and tired of losing ...\n\nThis is the kind of stuff you think about what does that sound does that even sound right no oh and by the way there's a video that shows that\n\nHow did he say those things to to I don't know\n\nI'm just giving you the hypothetical just putting it in perspective for you absurdly letting you know that this was stumped think about these things okay\nNone of us want to be done none of us want to be yanked out of our home never to see it again never ever be able to\nThough you would show on am Tim seven [noise]\nMorning glory America ...

I'm Sorry eastern time and the third our the program got used to that part of things\nUh my friend Peter personnel United States civil rights commissioner will be joining us to talk about the caravan and the galaxy there of and also in the\nThird our of the program this morning we will hear from ah RJ home and he's the director of government relations for fair\nThat's an important organization you probably are very aware of\nAs a loyal listener of the Hugh Hewitt show of the federation of Americans for immigration reform it is an extraordinarily important organization that really has their finger on the pulse of what's going on with respect\nTo the ... now the caravan is the lead story of the morning without question and a and that includes last night's massive rally in Texas for Ted Cruz are held by the president of the United\nStates did you see not just how many people were there but there was ongoing coverage throughout the day yesterday on Fox News and in other places of the thousands and thousands of people who waited in line overnight some for\nTwenty four and maybe even pushing up to thirty six hours to get in to hear the president in Texas a rallying for Ted Cruz last night and by the way what do you know what a strange strange sight to see you know it was only two short years ago maybe two and a half\nA a little bit I guess when you go back to the summer of twenty sixteen in the primary season in the in the spring of or excuse me some are twenty fifty and then the primary season in the spring of twenty six team when Donald Trump and Ted Cruz we're not exactly sharing stages together in warm embrace\nA lying to head the calls and\nAccusations of you know National Enquirer stories about a a Ted Cruz's father and related to JFK and an all or you know these are all of these kinds of strange things\nBut I'll tell you what nothing like two years of Democrat insanity to bring former political rivals together in common cause\nAnd at the end of the day that's what this is that's what this was\nThe president of United States last night rally in for and he's done this with others to\nYou know the President Trump and Lindsey Graham didn't always get along very closely as you know Lindsey Graham was more closely aligned with one of President Trump's fiercest critics the late John McCain but it's amazing what the Democrats can do for Republican unity and unification simply by being\nWell very democratic and that's wrong way say but being very Democrat\nAnd that's essentially what has happened last night so the president of the United states last night a rallying for Ted Cruz and they came out by the thousands and thousands you know people seem to at least say people the media\nThe media the left\nDemocrats whatever you want to call them and kind of it's kind of all one in the same those are all synonymous with one another the media and the Democrats in the left are literally all synonymous with one another they want to say that these are Trump crowds are overblown they tell you this rock Obama held a rally in California a short while ago\nFilled with about three million just to just the the area and the county he was in about three million very very blue voters it's a very blue districts he had seven hundred and fifty people come out to see him\nPresident Trump has tens of thousands at all of these rallies there were always overflow crowds outside they're setting up big TV monitors\nYou know big screens for them to watch from the outside they just want to be a part of it and the reason why isn't just enthusiasm for what President Trump stands for\nIncluding his very strong statements yesterday about um about the caravan with about migrants about securing our border and so on and so forth it's not they're not just rallying for what the president is preaching and what the president President is is I'm advocating\nIt's rallying against the tactics of the left rallying against the bullying rallying against the intimidation rallying against the harassment rallying against the physical battery and assault in some cases route\nRallying against um you know the media calling for these things rallying against the left a laughing when Republicans are treated in such ways\nI Know you played this yesterday bad voice and all he played a lot of audio last yesterday and I'm surprised you didn't play the whole show an audio form because this is poison was so bad\nAnd get well soon hopefully you are a couple you're not listening right now you should be sleeping after a night in Pittsburgh God Bless ya uh but you should be sleeping but a Phillip range of course former Obama a W there is a deputy deputy assistant secretary of state\nUh on on MSNBC\nEssentially mocking Mitch McConnell who was a being harassed in a restaurant away Sarah Sanders that's been harassed and restaurants the way so many others have just been attacked or just for being Republicans just by rabid liberal protestors who listen to their\nMasters on national television\nOnline they listen to note that while they can listen to it and there are no there are no Democrats in elected positions or other well respected positions of authority calling for an end to the harassment in the intimidation\nThere no no one is calling for an end to this have you heard Nancy Pelosi have you heard Chuck Schumer the two ranking members of Congress but the Democrats have you heard any of the more popular or Democrats\nOr who are kind of in the news you know the Elizabeth Warren's the Cory bookers the Kamala Harris says have you heard any of them denouncing Maxine Waters and those who would call for more violence intimidation and harassment of Republicans no\nThey're not saying anything former President Obama who is still revered by the left\nIs he's speaking out and saying no stop this this is not what it's about we don't win in the streets by by uh intimidating harassing and and and quite frankly battering\nPeople in certain circumstances we don't win that way we win at the ballot box no none of them are saying this instead they're on television law allowing the media and people like Philip brains using the media to call for more of this and guess what it has done is this rally those thousands of people\nAll of these places where the president is holding\nRallies by the thousands they know they can all get in just starting to seats\nAnd yet they're willing to sit outside for twenty four hours for thirty six hours they're still getting like during the football game just send the chance that they can get in and if they can't get in there no cheer from the outside of the venue like they did last night last night down in Houston\nThat's that's not just pro Trump that's rebelling against the insanity of the left that's rebelling against the calls for violence and the lack of calls\nFor civility that's what's happening so the president of the United states really found a tremendous you know has found really a tremendous rallying cry\nYou know and and that is against what the Democrats he he latched on to something I Know he didn't coin it but a lot of people are truly brought into play and the president seems to have been brace that and that is jobs not mobs Democrats if you vote Democrat it brings you mobs if you vote Republican\nThe president has taken a saying now that brings you jobs\nAnd he's a hundred percent right over four million jobs created since he took over and of course the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in this country in nearly what five decades\nLiterally five decades I Want to say goes back to Nineteen sixty nine uh the lowest unemployment rate and of course the lowest all time unemployment rate for so many of those subgroups including African Americans Latino Americans are women and youth\nIn terms of unemployment rates so you bring you what do you want jobs are mobs and I think people are responding they're coming out to see the president the coming up to listen they're coming out to hear him rally not only for his policies and for you know a continuation of the tax cuts and the things that have a you know that a sport our economic growth to the level that it has\nParty to keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history in the same way that he bucked up when he won the office of president in

right to become a US citizen the same is true in virtually every other country on earth and yet there are those especially liberal Democrats who are fine with this nation being overwhelmed by foreigners\nNow why do you think that is there are several answers some cynical some political the political answer is that Democrats want to import voters sign them up for government programs and they'll always vote for Democrats\nThe cynical answer is that the left wants to change the nature and character of America instead of out of many one they want us to become out of one many multiple

are you\nFantastic thanks for the times of the press you know it's funny I started to show this morning\nTalking about it just seems like yesterday the president was calling Ted Cruz lion Ted and suggesting or a you know the national Enquirer suggesting that his father was complicit in the murder of JFK and all of these other things and it's amazing\nWhat a little bit of a democratic extremism can do to bring a political rivals together and last night they were embracing one another as if they were long lost friends\nDo you see that kind of unity happening just a you know on an on an individual or an anecdotal scale or is this widespread Republicans are all coming together to combat what they see is democratic extreme as\nI don't know if I put it that way you know I think that you have a lot of Republicans that were at odds with President Trump twenty sixteen and understand where their voters our number one ... their voters like President Trump so arguing or being at arm's length President Trump you're running for reelection in a midterm election where you\nNeed and Republican base turnout to begin with a ... that's not going to work\nA number number two I'm the president has been helpful\nWell in in firing up the Republican gays and especially the way politics has become so incensed Balkan eyes um and they're just there's not a lot of currency out there or um\nFor running a running an election especially in a red state like Texas and I could you know we can tick off a list of red states where there are better to have Senate races are potentially competitive Senate races it just doesn't do any good to 'em\nRun away from Trump so if you if you want to make sure you get the turnout that you're going to need and if you want to make sure you're going to get to turn it you're going to campaign with the president and you're going to make nice with him and I think it's just it's as simple as that\n... David I'm director is our guest a Bob ... that it's not so much just the the campaigning with the president and and being aligned with the president\nIs being United against the Democrats I feel like the cabinet an episode of this as late summer slashed ball\nA along with this caravan episode now it is it is driving a lot more unity among Republicans because they feel like the Democrats have just become solves extreme and are going to basically resorting to any measures necessary to try to stop President Trump I feel like more than rallying for president it's rallying against that Democrat push and that's what they're trying to do\nWell so I think that if if you will get correct look I think they're trying to use those two episodes we know that have a heck of it I Know that race as we know it has an impact\nOn some house races and you know the territory where you have a solid Republican territory where Republican voters have been disengaged or maybe place it and that's what happens when you call Washington it for all the White House in a midterm year I think having a kind of served to re engage Republicans and sort of wake up\nThe conservative base and and so I think that's a big part of it I I just think that when you're when you're looking at a Republican Ted Cruz\nWho had previously battle with the president and they didn't always get along and there are a number of Republicans in that boat if you look at senator Dean Heller in Nevada and make the calculation wasn't so much gee these Democrats really scare me I'm I'm going to be with Trump the calculation was\nThat I'm going to be with Trump because that's going to help me win because that's where my voters are and because fighting with a Republican president if I'm a Republican is it going to do me any good in the situation that I mean\nI think with Kavanaugh and some of these other issues have done a native a little bit easier to unite with Trump from a policy perspective because it has put in the background maybe\nSome of those issues that were problematic about Trump in some of these states content in a state like you know and a senior Arizona Texas\nA North Dakota in Missouri now the best place you could have been all along is probably with President Trump\nDavid I'm drunk or is our guest a this morning on the Hugh Hewitt programs so the the ... let's talk about why people want to align with the president the president that was supposed to be so unpopular the latest poll I think it was just yesterday NBC Washington are are are not a washing the wall Street Journal poll\nShows him at forty seven percent which is peak which is pretty amazing thing and when you compare it to a President Obama going into his first midterm in twenty times he was that around forty five forty six if I saw those numbers correctly yesterday\nHow do you explain that given the and I think you've seen the the same surveys done by the media Research Council and others that Ninety two percent of the press coverage for the president this entire summer has been negative Ninety two percent of stories including the word Trump had been negative yet he's up there at forty seven percent how do you explain that\nRepublican voters just don't pay attention to news stories that in that regard I mean I I don't think it matters to Republican voter what I write for what anybody in the media\nRight and it wasn't just a survey of Republican voters it was a survey of all there's\nIf he hadn't been such a sham Darnell than we wouldn't be too far in one right now\nBlaming Bob for that but if you can turn around and get the Senate back in jail and make sure that stays under control and Kevin McCarthy fall will be forgiven time from off the job thank you [noise]\nDoing my best view doing my best to do my job in the face of incessant trolling from the host of the show who isn't actually hear my goodness gracious [noise]\nAh the Baker Mayfield story a thanks for joining us by France joining indeed from Cleveland, Ohio my home base the paint very really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer thank you so much for joining us to start your day great conversation with David I'm drunk ran out of time before I could ask him\nA question about the caravan and and it's a pretty obvious question\nAnd that is how we use it and why is it that no Democrat politicians have spoken out against the care\nNot one not one I mean\nQuite literally no one is saying whoa whoa whoa whoa there started with two thousand and it's not what the seven thousand and by the time they reverse the one thousand miles they still have to go to get to the southern border of the United states\nIt'll probably go ten twelve Fifteen thousand whoa whoa whoa whoa we can't just take all of these people in we can't\nJust you know a release all of these thousands of people into the into the fabric of the continental United States of America on a wink and a nod promised that they'll come back for an actual am there are no asylum hearing it's simple we can't do that\nAnd also why is it why is the overwhelming majority\nOf these individuals who were in this caravan why are the men of working age because there aren't a ton of families according to those reporting from a you know that caravan\nThere aren't a ton of families it's mostly males of working age that are coming here are these people are really seeking asylum is there really something that terrible going on in the middle eastern Asia\nOr Middle Eastern rather Central American nations although the president pointed out there are people from the middle east who have joined in as well remember our southern border is essentially a revolving door for people to come into the United states from not just Mexico or from Central America but quite frankly from all over the world\nBecause these other countries are not taking their sovereignty as seriously as we uh we would like to hear\nBut anyway [noise] all of the Central American migrants are few things really so bad in their countries that they need to seek asylum from persecution\nAnd fear that they face in their own countries is that really what this is about is this really humanitarian issue where these people are being persecuted and they cannot you know they they cannot stay in their own countries\nWithout dieting well let's put that to the test for a moment we'll get a little credit to Fox News here and do a one of my listeners in my local show in Cleveland ah for sharing this with me this was a Fox News report from Sunday and I'm\nQuestions by the reporter here from Fox News of a member of the caravan I think are extraordinarily revealing well the questions but moreover the answers are extraordinarily revealing I Want you to listen very carefully to what is really going on in this caravan of quote unquote migrants\nThat many of us believe are actually more like invaders trying to circumvent us immigration law please give the socialist\nI can see as far as the eye can see I can see on during the immigrants that ignores the bus into Honduras they went to Guatemala and now they're trying to tackle Mexico right now they are north of that river\nNorth of the bridge that you saw people on yesterday so last night people got frustrated found a bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people can get a visa for potentially asylum here could take forty five Ninety Days apricot process they weren't worth it so last night\nIn the house across the river swimming people came in droves I\nHad to see maybe two hundred immigrants last night maybe in a thirty minute time processing the river coming here and now you see them now you said they're going to be as a caravan they claim and they're on their way to a town called ... there were about we're right now about twenty miles north of that river\nGoing ... right now some of the people here you can see they're taking a break [noise] they've got some shade here they're getting something great guy going to be joined now by one of the members of the ah the caravan his name is Louis here from Honduras Jeremy where these people going and why are they doing it\nWe're going to ...\nOur people wanted to go to the border of United States then we come they come in over here because um [noise]\nA situation in our country is going back\nMay ask you this so as you know the un eighty hours here un high commissioner revenues refugees who was brought\nThem and to try to help processing now the standard that they're going to use as unless you're a victim of reform have a credible fear of persecution from raised nationality religion or political views don't qualify for asylum so what are these people going to say when they get the United states\nFriday or say something I don't know they're gonna probably actually\nThey they gave him something so they can stay on the United states and the kids have can go to school so they can apartments so they can go to work as you know President Trump\nIs that's it that's it that's what\nYou needed to hear and I hope you understood what you just heard\nYou cannot claim asylum in the United states unless you\nAre fleeing persecution on the base of race or religion or sexual orientation et cetera he ran down the reporter ran down the things that you can claim asylum or you're\nBeing persecuted in your country so what is that he asked this ... this caravan remember that you're going to say when you get up there and he said basically we're coming to pick your jobs\nYou heard him\nWere coming to take advantage of your educational system are going to put our kids in your schools and we're going to take your jobs he said we want to go there and we want to work\nAnd then what are you going to do with that money by the way are you going to spend it in the United states must at least helping to\nContribute to the United states economy\nHe's not going to let people in Mexico said they're not going to let these people pass I Will tell you aren't out earlier today we saw about two hundred wires police were going to stop them on this highway ... pulled back they retreated I don't think they want a confrontation but the point is president said he's not going to let people in ... you got to\nSay that I found last last week we say over there by a friend and borders\nOn it for a voter nail radio in the United states\nThere's a change though as you know that Mexico in the United states it's supposed to reach a third party saved agreement unless you qualify receiving request asylum in Mexico we're not going to the United states is not going to let you and that's gonna be the reason for denial\nThat couldn't stand up\nThey don't look back at all and the way they send it back to our country we're coming\nAnd that's what it is funny I Wonder\nIf they send us back we're going to turn around and come back again so he says we're going to come here and we want to take jobs\nAnd we're going to take money and we're going to send it back to support our family's back there this is why it's the vast majority of the members of this caravan are like I said working age males because they're gonna come to the United states to work they're not fleeing persecution for the race in Honduras\nThey're not fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation they're not fleeing persecution because of their uh of their uh ethnicity they're not fleeing persecution because of a of any reason whatsoever\nThey are coming to the United states because their nation can't get them work and so they're coming to take jobs for people in another country and they're not going to repatriate those dollars back to their own country they don't want to come to the United states to be American\nHow do we know this\nBecause they're not walking under the American flag they're walking behind a massive street wits banner of the Hondurans live and then they were flying Honduran flags over themselves as they march\n\nIf a group of seven thousand people tries to enter another country flying their own flag that is not a migration that is an invasion they don't want to abandon the nation that has essentially made their lives unlivable in their minds they want to move\nThat nation north into a better nation but not swear allegiance to that new nation\nOne would think that it might be more beneficial for these people to be flying an American flag over their heads saying we love America we want the American dream instead they're flying the Honduran flag saying we have a right to come here and still be Honduras we're bringing Honduras north\nShore Guatemala\nMexico and into the United states and you can't stop us and if you try to we will turn around and come back again by the way the president of lettuce and last time he's going to have to let us in this time to\nNot the president of the United states last night speaking in Texas said this rally for Ted Cruz said really not so much I don't have to do that and I'm not going to do that and\nI'll let you hear a little bit more about that coming up after the break with the president says no we're not going to do that we're going to use whatever means necessary including as many troops necessary to secure that border and not allow this phony claim of asylum to take place [noise]\nWith about a thousand now it's over seven thousand it's organized\nThis isn't just you know legitimate grass roots and just people are starting to walk and somebody else followed like Forrest Gump they're not just running alongside just random laying off the cuff this is an organized effort these people are funded and they're fed they're given rides\nNot all walking [noise] they're taking turns robbing trucks to what lengths do you want the president to go [noise]\nI Want to know how the

not mocking Lee I say this legitimately because the president of the United states does have this power I mentioned this our number one of the broadcast this morning and I want you to again take this with you and share this information with those who may not understand\nIt the president doesn't need congressional approval to stop this because the president already has congressional approval to stop this it wasn't given the Donald Trump the man\nThis was passed in Nineteen fifty two section to twelve of the immigration and nationality nationality act reach whenever the president signs that the entry of any aliens or any\nClass of aliens and I'm going to pause there to say this but just the difference between aliens in class of aliens is different or there is a difference because just aliens could mean a immigrants\nTrying to come to the United states legally or illegally but literally trying to immigrate to the United states that's different from those seeking refuge in the United states or seeking asylum in the United states there were different classes of people who want to come to the United states and that's why the language of this law passed\nBy Congress in Nineteen fifty two\nIs so important one of the president finds that the injury of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United states would be detrimental to the interests of the United states he made by proclamation\nAnd for such period as he deems shall deem necessary\nSuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or not immigrants again meaning refugee seekers or asylum seekers or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions that he may deem appropriate this gives the president plenty power\nTo decide who gets to come here and when and for how long it's not up to Congress anymore Congress gave that power to the president of the United states back in Nineteen fifty two it's not subject to new congressional approval", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year":
