about the Mexican mafia or the strenuous stuff a subset of the Mexican mafia\nThose are two of the biggest most detour yes\nAll right and there are others will go there in a minute [laughter] the Aryan Brotherhood was another one\n\nPrison gangs that have infiltrated the nation's prisons they come from California but those aren't really the ones I'm Talking about you ever heard of Eighteenth

and uh you know I got used to fall up and up in Virginia Falls come to\nDC in Virginia so I Walk out the plane like Ninety five and a hundred percent humidity so I go inside immediately I turn on BBC World news expecting to see how are the bracket negotiations going you know Theresa May's over in Europe trying to save the deal and not have a hard breakfast blah blah blah and ah and of\nCourse we had a lot of ... reporting and it is becoming increasingly clear that the number two in the secret services the fellow who ordered the interrogation the interrogation went wrong with her by designer intent there is some horrific details out there and put out by the Turkish media but look this is the yellow dog media of Europe I'm not going to trust them on the details will eventually get the forensics\nBut looks like the number two guy in Saudi Arabian intelligence or Tibet\nAnd uh\nThe question will be did he do so with the knowing approval of the crown prince and the ... that's the only question will find that out but that's what I thought I Would say on BBC Breakfast and could show gate instead that a reporter in\nNorth Dakota North Dakota they said there is you know eight people per square mile and North Korea went through the whole North Dakota thing\nMore more cows than people in North Dakota it's hard to find people to talk to about politics I said what in the world is the b._b._c. doing in North Dakota well Heidi hide camps outing\nOf sexual assault survivors and rape victims as well as miss naming people as rape victims\nHas shattered her campaign journalist by twenty points and BBC was set up there to explain to Brits why Americans would be so upset over publishing a list of a hundred and twenty women many of whom were not sexual assault survivors or many of whom had not given their permission\nAnd it's like a tailspin and they spent a lot of time talking to Heidi Heitkamp supporters who are saying we're though so crushed we're sorry she did she's terrible I'm terrible we're all terrible yeah you are who sat up and Heidi Heitkamp and find anyone yet to my knowledge but she'd done she tells me\nWhat was interesting is they didn't ask will have any impact on any other candidate of course it should\nEvery Democrat in every race is attempting to explore like me too movement for democratic purposes that's what the cabinet hearings was all about\nWas the attempt to using me too movement Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby moment to smear him an innocent of that Bill Cosby and the generally turn into an attack on all man people like me people like you got nothing to do with this who conduct themselves a gentleman who brought up the right way\nWho have wives have thirty six years or Thirty years or twenty five years or Fifteen Years or ten years or one day whom you honor and trust and you got daughters\nAnd mothers and you do not act this way there's a there's a five percent of the population three percent I don't know creepy terrible horrible people\nHarvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby's among them and there are a lot of it by a survivors of sexual abuse and rape out there I Know some I represented one and it's a terrific how indifferent institutions are\nWhen abuses occurred\nBut that does not or license Democrats to turn everyone into a mob shouting me too at innocent people like Brett Kavanaugh\nKorean Heidi Heitkamp ... position to publish a list of people who are not victims of rape or sexual abuse or who did suffer that terrible assault and did not want to be publicly out it she's got a bunch of list from a women's advocates groups around the state didn't check with the papal bats Heidi Heitkamp\nTry you know what I I I punish Joe Donnelly for that I'd punished Claire McCaskill for that I punish a Bill Nelson for that I punish Joe mansion for that Joe mansion voted for cabinet but he didn't do so until it was over so we already had fifty one votes\nHe knows coming so he just decided to do I'd still vote for pat Morrisey in Virginia over Joe Manchin mentioned about for the next one\nPorsche are not going to vote for better or working about protect crews of course you're going to vote for Josh Hawley over Claire McCaskill\nAnd the guys creeping up John James in Michigan I think we're in a sea fill in the game but it it's that that will require Ohio to surprise away Kentucky surprised when they elected I'm Matt Bevin in the off year that was truly a stunner he was supposed to lose by five Seventy one by the same amount\nThat's what Rene she won't let you only to ten point error in the polls but John James up in single digits and rising I think he is the most interesting Senate candidate tied with Muslim excel in Arizona because their fighters are veterans of combat they defended you they defended me with their lives\nBut at the mic Sally in the air and eight ten providing ground support for troops in combat or first attack pilot fighter attack pilot who was a woman in the air force history\nAnd a John James out at West point became an Apache pilot\nFought in Iraq and Afghanistan then then sadly is life took a bad turn he went to the University of Michigan business school\nBut then again a successful entrepreneur in Detroit and I do not understand why we have not got stories everywhere about the the black guy up in Michigan who flies Apache attack helicopters went to West Point and has given Debbie Stabenow a run for the money you know why you know I we get paid or work every night on every show\nThat's an about John James because John James is black and a Republican in bed O'Rourke is white and a Democrat and the mainstream be is full of blue Barbara bubbles that like white Democrats in red states and they blow a\nLot of money and time on 'em and they really are afraid\nOf an African American like John James in Michigan they are afraid of John James ... if I if you would get the Koch brothers or somebody I Would just poor ad after at into the televising marketed Detroit I'd go and try and get ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of the African American by the judge and yeah\nHe's a Detroit kid he went to West Point he made good he went to Michigan we like that or less where you know Michigan State people like Alberta\nWaiting John James can when you get behind that and I I get the sense that hedging I saw on BBC\nWatching MSNBC you know my my viewing is you'd watch Jake Tapper at Fort Chuck Todd at five and Brett berets six there the three best news programs there actually newsy Bab all points of views\nJake Tapper for Chuck Todd at five but parents that could be got time you're throwing the b._b._c. world news if we can do you want to find out what's going on ... my sense is everyone knows it's jump ball for the house and it's moving to the Republicans\nAnd they're all off chasing to show geek because they should be ... ... one of us one of my colleagues at the Washington Post and it's pretty bad story but it's profoundly not of interest to the average American voter who was looking at this economy\nAnd saying oh my gosh this economy is great you know what Chuck Grassley did yesterday he yelled another hearing from orange judges Chuck Grassley thank you Chuck Grassley another hearing for more judges including a thirty seven year old terrific judge is going to go on the fourth circuit\nWhatever you give we'll be matched

fourth circuit had her hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee and I read from the people for the American way a mat\nDuring last go Alison rushing chose a summer position that the alliance defending freedom then called the Alliance Defense fund better now ATF is one of the far right leaning organization opposing algae ... quality church state separation and abortion rights\nAnd the eleven years since she graduated law school she has continued to support the organization through its Blackstone legal fellowship which helped mentor in advance like minded lawyers I gotta tell ya I Love Alison rushing now more than I ever did\nWell we are uh you know pleased to see a great plate of judges overall being chosen up there and I'm very excited that it's of any as well\nNo well tell me about did you ever work with Allison have you ever did you do know or from your time is on the legislative counsel no I did I okay so I just want people to know the\nBlackstone fellowship program is one of the great reasons why it's offending freedom exist they meant to young lawyers they help them get jobs they teach them up and originalism they help them with their careers they're everywhere but you're also on the hill Matt tell us what a ATF does on the hill\nThat there's a lot of work going on with legislation impacts religious liberty that impacts campus free speech in a variety of issues and we're constantly consulted a without legal expertise that hates it the Supreme Court and\nLitigation across the country of what is the impact of these laws who are they going to help who are they going to hurt some bad laws out there and so we're asked to provide our legal guidance on these very important legislative issues with that\n[noise] so so how big is the center for legislative advocacy alliance defending freedom is quite vast I've got four thousand affiliated attorneys I've already mentioned the Blackstone fellows they got their alumni throughout the country but this particular center is focused on statutes in drafting how big is it\nWill say you know there's a handful of us were working at not only if they you know with policy group and allies on the hill but across the country with state policy groups that are fighting or religious freedom fighting for free speech and so again with they're helping them insulting them on pieces of legislation and the legal impact\nAnd just again taking legal expertise in helping to ensure that the laws apply with those legal you\nKnow you're lost some of your key people Matt Bowman went into the government of course ah my friend Carey went into the government you know Greg Scott went into the government and came out of the government or how you doing when the government wants your lawyers to go to work for him\n[laughter] well you know there is a strong group of people across the country many came out of our black program that are passionate about fighting for religious freedom that\nWe are blessed always have a strong belief of attorneys and others working with is joining us that our work and so I you know although we all wish well that was the other positions where we're always blessed to have a strong crop ready to jump in and pick up the take up the battle with for religious freedom\nNow I'm at home and not Matt Bowman match sharp I'm Sorry about that I kind of think that the Supreme Court is going to find a way to get to the establishment clause quickly\nAnd to finally bring some coherence and dean Irwin chairman ski on the program earlier this week he's a man of the left he's the dean of the Berkeley law school which is a left leaning place he said he expected the new majority to articulate a rule\nThat goes back to the original intention the public attention intention of the constitutional conventions ratifying the federal convention and they came out of Philadelphia\nWhich is we will not have one religion in the United states and we will not have overt financial support for religious institutions and everything else like crosses in graveyards\nThat's just fine how are you as optimistic\nAs I'm dean Chevron ski as pessimistic because he's not happy with that but I sure am\nYeah I think the the cracks in the existing establishment clause just put it into starting to show that was the\nOpposite of her idea object I think at some point the court is going to have to grapple with these issues and you know I think we're we're optimistic about the district\nInstruction is that are on the court and a third jurisprudence on those issues and that hopefully be correct some of the laws that have been sorted into that establishment clause cases over the years\nMatter you getting worried about winning too much you won jak Philips a master piece of cake shop un
