Jim Brown where they're at the same time but I was over and the older you obey I sat down with our national security advisor Ambassador John Bolton and here's the conversation we had\n... thanks for talking to me it's good to see or hear glad who had hit a use\nFor your entire life for this job and you were right with the most disruptive presidents since Andrew Jackson in the world or to put his collapsing is the job ... thought it wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office and every president has a different style ah I think good job of the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs to make decisions\nOr that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine that we've got to disrupt the president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made\nA we're seeing a lot of ... bills come do from the Obama administration so it's very fast paced uh but uh I wouldn't trade it for anything else\nLet me ask you about your old job since it's now in the United nations ambassador you're right and they should be president twofold what kind of personality and should this be a job in the cabinet or should it be stuck habit\nWell you know on the second one it's really up to the president or he can make any job a cabinet rank\nA and he'll make his decision or as he sees bass I ... I did not have cabinet rank uh when I was ... I don't think it affected me in any way either up at the un or in my dealings within the administration uh I think it's a job where you have to be\nPrepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important and implementing\nPolicy and mostly what you do with the un has implement policy that you\nUnderstand the significance of the actions you're taking a and it'd be part of a team I I felt very privileged when I was there\nI help make policy but I help mostly to carry policy out some national security advisers travel a lot some stay close\nTo the oval office\nWhat's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and they're like\nWell I've spent most of my time in Washington or traveling with the president when he travels overseas\nOr I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the Caucasus countries uh in about ten days reason for that is to continue to carry through on the\nConversation that President Trump than president potent hadn't Helsinki during the summer to talk about\nU.S Russian relations and where we can make progress where we still have issues and disagreement or and then in the caucuses to see the very significant geographical a role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russia dealing with turkey\nSo it's selected I work very closely with Jim Madison I ... we had breakfast this morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security adviser I think under any presidential style has to be an honest broker and I I work\nHard at that when you sit down with your kind of hurt Russia next week are you going to tell them hands off our election I may say three or four times loudly\nYeah well every time I've met with the Russians in this job including with President putting themselves when I went to Russia to prepare for the Helsinki meeting I've made that point as has the president\nOr as a message to believe that we received well so far\nWe don't see the kind of Russian meddling we did in twenty sixteen Chris Wray the director the FBI said a couple of weeks ago that that could change with the stroke of the key we are very worried about the question of Chinese interference not just in individual elections\nBut more broadly trying to influence the American political discussion with an influence campaign that uh I I think could well be unprecedented we heard vice president Pence speak to this issue or last week it was a very important speech I think people need to read it and consider it\nA and I think the United states needs to stand up frankly to any foreign government that thinks it's going to interfere in our politics we are a self governing people we will govern ourselves we don't need international institutions that tell us how to do it and we particularly don't need foreigners are trying to exert undue influence over us\nWhat about this issue of the story of his day job ... we're trying to influence the response of the Saudi Government for the world at noon on Thursday are you satisfied with what the Saudis have told us about the disappearance of Mr ...\nWell I don't think we've we've known enough or I spoke with the crown prince yesterday along with Jared Kushner a secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to the crown prince says well the the president has spoken to this issue or it is something we need to get resolved and uh we need to do it as soon as possible\nIn the aftermath of the Annapolis newsroom shooting something people criticize the president or has the enemy of the people writer in the aftermath of the ... disappearance some people have said the president is turning a\nBlind eye to violence against journalists are across the world to clean Russia what do you make a critic for the president trying to tie him to the ... as well\nI think this is ridiculous I mean I think this is a he has spoken out about it uh he's directed a secretary said ...\nUh to speak with a ... a fiance and that'll happen as soon as they can get that scheduled a we're taking a number of other steps or that I really can't get into at the moment but I think that ah it's just a hypocritical\nTo say that somehow the president's not concerned about these things when manifestly his words in his actions are to the contrary\nA certain Vassar Saudi Arabia and political structures that fast convoluted is it possible to Henry the second situation who read any of this metal some praise spiraling out of control or even something more and more level what that someone intended to undermine the crown prince and the king the this action\nYou know honestly we just don't know what the facts are and that was one of the points that are that I made to the crown prince or we need to find out what the facts are and we need to get this resolved quickly because if it is a a a a another operation\nA people need to understand that I I think the the Saudis themselves are being damaged because we don't have the facts out there is obviously been historical animosity between turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOr we have our own difficulties with turkey at the moment with they're keeping pastor Brunson effectively under house arrest for no good reason whatever a so this is a this is not that anybody's benefit and it needs to be\nCleared on is it possible that if the operation happen it could have happened without the knowledge of the crowd\nI I think a lot of things are possible in the middle East I'm at the United states does not have information that is not revealing or if we had information we'd we'd know better exactly how to handle this we've made it clear we want to know what the facts are we're going to continue to do that\nLet me turn from our ally to our enemy or the commander the Iranian Revolutionary guard so Lamont use social media to threaten the White House there are reports that there are sleeper cells in the United states given those sorts of threats and those sorts of reports are American should we be alarmed about ... reach into the United states\nThink we should be I think the Iranian regime as an enemy of the United states are we just had a within the past ... on the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states uh scoping out of the Jewish and Israeli targets for possible attack uh we've seen France and other European countries\nArresting a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack when a rally of dissident Iranians in ...\nOr is this summer we've seen ... for example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this behavior so we see Iran or not\nA conforming to western norms because of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to modify are concerned about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime is a threat that's why the president\nOr got us out of the Iran nuclear deal that's why the economic sanctions or being re impose\nThat's why we're putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect you can hear the European governments talked about staying in the deal\nEuropean corporations and I mean the biggest one the biggest oil companies the biggest manufacturing firms are getting out of Iran are Iranian oil exports are plummeting their currency has gone through the floor unrest is spreading across the country\nEven countries like China or reducing their imports of oil from Iran because they don't want to tangle with the United states\nOr this was something that we shouldn't be concerned about because Iran remains what it has been since Nineteen Seventy nine it's the world's leading state sponsor of tear at a press has its own citizens\nAnd it continues to pursue programs of weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological this is a dangerous stayed in the region and a dangerous state worldwide\nAnd I like

persuaded\nLet me close to the good news that reading at the wall Street Journal this hour that turkey is expected to release pastor Brunson today he'd been held hostage for many years uh he was been held since twenty sixteen so say prayers were going to break into that I'll keep following that but the wall Street Journal says they expect him to be released today\n... last night roaring through Virginia I think done and Virginia Beach Norfolk Hampton Roads area it's a lot of power lines are down in center I'll keep you posted on that [noise]\nI'm pleased to welcome the guy who would be in charge in Ohio were a disaster to happen next year for the next four years Mike DeWine he's the attorney general in Ohio right now he's running for governor in one of the most closely watched creatures in the United states former senator now attorney general DeWine welcome back to the euro ...\nHey you it's great to be back with you and your listeners thank you very much\nOne of the things I think when we watch Michael come ashore governor a jar general the wind is\nWe listen to candidates and we think to ourselves are they are they able to handle a crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speaking of Richard Cordray your your opponent has been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's been a lawyer or how about you [laughter]\nWell you know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting thing\nOr if you compare Cordray and Mike DeWine is that we both are were attorney generals and ah you know I beat him eight years ago close race but I but I beat him but what we inherited a was a real mess so they turn Joe Ohio runs the state crime labs and\nWhen we took office a court right left this was if there was a rape or serious crime that occurred in Ohio the\nUnknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab a it would have sat there\nIf you can believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without anybody overlooking that that's how far\nA backlog that they had and a quarter a left that maps and so we fixed it\nUh we turned cases around now a twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did the day he left office and uh you know our average times about three weeks but we can turn case around very very quickly and another thing that he can pair Cordray and what we've done now he left\n'em and they were they were old rape get sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that have this problem\nOr he didn't do anything about it when I became attorney general we we\nStarted hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out told the police say bring it to us ah we want to get this evidence are tested\nAnd uh we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these were all court cases old cases uh some there's some Fifteen Years old\nAnd we've got hit or matches in thirty six percent so we've gone back you know and better than a third and told the the local police who then\nTurned told the victim hey we got your rape or we get your rapists\nAnd the entire county alone in Cleveland where we had a large large number of them are they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people\nRate while as a result of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem\nYou go after it a quarter right just just sat there and didn't uh you don't do anything and don't forget a courses time are heading up Obama's of consumer group\nOut in Washington if you if you recall uh\nWe we saw for example ah because of overregulation we ... we saw\nThe number of our community banks or go down significantly in Ohio and I'm sure that occurred in in other states as well just because of the over over regulation a quarter a and others had in place\nNow now I got to ask you a general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is doing well in this recovery I mean we've got I Know north eastern oil pretty doggone well I Know\nWhere it's done is cook and I know that that's Trump country as well up in owning in Trumbull county ... county but even in Cuyahoga County it's cooking why in the world would return the state over to the left the uh the laugh I mean what in the world well the people they think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well and Ohio uh we do not want to go back to where we were eight years ago eight years ago when Cordray I'm a ... you know was was attorney general\nAnd a ... ... you know he was the attorney general state of Ohio we had had lost a\nClose to four hundred thousand jobs\nA and you know we just were not moving a or unemployment rate was high and in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership uh we've kept taxes down cut taxes are we seeing the economy move forward and so\nYou know what I Want to do my running mate John Houston we want to take Ohio to the next level or we've come a long long way we do not want to go back uh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we got an opiate problem that we we have to get in front of and now instead of a you know\nPeople are not being able to find jobs and not the economy not moving forward our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who have are able to pass a drug test so\nWe're really focusing on you is is two things uh one is tackling a drug problem we have a twelve point action plan which makes makes real ... real estate\nOr some of the things I'm already shirt has already started to do is attorney general but there are things I Can't do until\nTill I'm governor I mean one of the things that we want to we think is very important is education prevention for young\nYoung kids in regard to drugs or you know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney and I can tell you that I don't know in five years or ten years if we'll have an opiate problem but uh it there's always some drug problems\nAnd so we want to prepare young people starting as early as kindergarten K. through twelve southern age appropriate every year every year something that's been proven to to actually work\nUh we will implement that and it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're we really want to do a is doubled down on President Trump's opportunities because ah we're have opportunities owns Ohio or this will mirror the tax cuts\nAre and in the job act that the president and Congress put through a we will make it so that ah somebody looks at the state of Ohio and they say well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital gains I Want to take a ticket to Ohio or would do this in our\nMost problematic areas and we but we believe that a given that tax break I was going to get a lot of money invested in Ohio we hope from a you know all over the country\nAnd I ... yeah if you take that up the Youngstown warned given the physical structure that exist there already and your combined with economic opportunity and it will cook I talked with ... valley chamber when they came to DC on their flying but first she got away now tonight I'm planning to Columbus Ninety eight Ninety answer dot com and people want to come out and\nSee a Mike Gallagher and Jim Jordan and ... my taxes like sitting down at\nI'm over it you're going to college oh that'll be great and we're gonna we're gonna juice turnout but early voting gets going in the Buckeye State doesn't it I mean we're we're ...\nWe're into it we should we ... we started this week and uh you know we're ... we've seen a since the cabin up\nA nomination and what the Democrats did and what happened in the Judiciary Committee we we've seen a real a firing up of our conservative base in Ohio a in a county is all over the state and you and you mentioned\nYou mentioned in an area of the state of Ohio and eat in eastern Ohio them hunting valley for example superhero\nEr which are very very familiar with you know historically historically big big a Democrat area bought socially conservative and what\nWe saw course are is what what President Trump did when he ran and just exceedingly well uh in areas that\nYou know has never in in several lifetimes have not been a gone gone Republican\nHumble county went for Trump bad happened since I think Nixon\nSo I'm sure that's right it's been it's been a long time but but you're right we lay lay are opportunities zones on top of that I mean\nWe ... we have them with with the tax bill but we're on doubled down at Ohio because we're going to say we're on to do that with our our tax code in the state of Ohio too and and we really believe that that's going to have a lot of investment [noise] ah we ... we can't\nHave there's there's not enough government money out there to have government government investment and to have\nA we have to get the private sector and ... and we have some great things going for us and a lot of areas but with this with this tax cut that we're talking about that opportunity um it's really for economic development Ohio\nLast question attorney general Mike DeWine gonna be next governor Ohio and I was there for Rob Portman before I joined NBC and had to stop doing fundraisers thousand people running for governor but they all came together behind you and you're not used it as you're a as you're a\nNumber two guy

Council Ambassador John Bolton\nWe're in the old executive office building building where they used to be the department of war and picking up we were in the office of secretary of war and we talked a lot about what kind of war might calm here's my conversation from yesterday afternoon with Ambassador John Bolton\n... thanks for talking to me 'cause she or he I'm Glad we were hit a use for your entire life for this job and you were right with the most disruptive president says Andrew Jackson in the world or to that is collapsing is the job I Would have thought it wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president\nOr who's who's in office in every president has a different style or I think good job of the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs\nTo make decisions that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine that we've got a disruptive president even a kind of chaotic world\nBecause there are a lot of changes that need to be made a we're seeing a lot to do bills come do from the Obama administration so it's very fast paced uh but uh I wouldn't trade it for anything else let\nMe ask you about your own job since it's now in the United nations ambassador you're right and they should president twofold what kind of personality and should this be the job in the cabinet or should it be sub cabinet\nWell you know on the second one it's really up to the president or he can make any job the cabinet rank\nA then he'll make his decision a as he sees as best I ... I did not have cabinet rank uh when I was ... I don't think it affected me in any way either up at the un or in my dealings within the administration I think it's a job where you have to be\nPrepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important in implementing policy\nAnd mostly what you do with the UN is implement policy\nThat you understand the significance of the actions you're taking a and that can be part of a team I I felt very privileged when I was there I helped make policy\nBut I have a mostly to carry policy out\nSome national security advisers travel a lot so stay close to the oval office what's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and the election\nWell I've spent most of my time in Washington or or traveling with the president when he travels overseas or I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the caucuses countries are in about ten days reason for that is to\nContinue to carry through on the conversation that President Trump and present potent hadn't Helsinki during the summer talk about U.S Russian relations and where we can make progress where we still have\nIssues and disagreement and then in the Caucasus to see the very significant geographical a role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russia dealing with turkey\nSo it's selected I work very closely with ... Madison I ... we had breakfast\nThis morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security advisor I think under any presidential style has to be an honest broker and I I work hard at that when", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "12"}
