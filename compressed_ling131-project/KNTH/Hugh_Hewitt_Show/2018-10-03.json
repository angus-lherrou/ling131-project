Stein ... what is playing out on the Democratic side of the aisle is thinly disguised solid as him and that ... is\nThe goal was genocidal tyranny being the result it's not hyperbole if signs observations are allowed to stand quote there is no trial on facts or\nLaw any longer I Want you to think about what you just heard Stein say there is no try on facts or law any longer that's why David tells us it's not hyperbole if his observations are allowed to stand continuing as others have pointed out we now have guilt by accusation\nJust stopped Donald Trump the Democrats have tossed out the whole basis of Anglo saxon jurisprudence innocent until proven guilty is there no end to it Stalin would approve so we Josephine bubbles quote if this Democrat trick works there simply has no meaningful legal protection in this country any longer\nThis was a defining moment for the constitution Republicans wake up now here's where the brilliance of David ... comes in\nBecause he had another diary entry in American Spectator contradicting what David says its own sub had quote the time for civilians to own a are Fifteen is over Stein wrote this back in February\nAnd he says David gives us to quote let have at least a modicum\nOf common sense I'm going to quote Stein in David's piece titled Second Amendment guy Ben Stein should learn before presuming to teach and I want to quote what David puts in here from his peas and sign peace\nIn the diary in his piece called the diary over the American spectator from back in February quoting now I'm a Second Amendment guy\nI Believe Americans who are saying and do an excuse me\nBelieve Americans who are saying and not criminals and pass a genuine background test should be allowed to own weapons for home protection for target shooting and for self defense if this is what I Love about David ... and wisdom and his intelligence\nPrior restraints where shall not be infringed question mark allowed question mark of course David is saying well wait a minute what about shall not be infringed bad and what's this allowed to own\nAnd then David says perhaps Stein could point to the delegated power in the constitution he says he recognizes\nDefining moments for and David points out the thing we've discussed on this program so many times over the years that and every professional gun grabber and anybody who professes to believe in the second amendment\nAlways does he shows everybody is big but\nI Believe and the second amendment or I support the second amendment but there is no but in the second amendment David continues but for the life of me\nI cannot see why any American civilians need an AR Fifteen or any other military style semi automatic rifle\nHere who's well that's a quote from start here's a further quote from that same piece it's horrifying and yet another example of why no civilian need a are Fifteen or a facsimile\nEats just sickening remember this was coming from a perfect gotten guy now\nA few months later after someone took away had his guns taken away too tired and then shot up David reminds us a gun free waffle house\nDie and said I'm a Second Amendment guy but no one needs to done that just bag the owner to start shooting people oh for crying out loud\nBen Stein might want to take David hog out for dinner and the two of them can come up with the most outrageous quotient begin tweeting up but remember signed gives a path because unlike David hog Stein told us he's a gun guy no gun guy in the world says something so stupid\nI'm a Second Amendment guy I don't know really want to know what a second I'm not sure what a Second Amendment guy is but you know what I I guess that means gun rights supporter I Know being a little cynical here I'm a Second Amendment guy but no one needs to gun that just begs the owner to start shooting people\nI have multiple a are Fifteen in the studio with me\nCan you do you find out\nThe intensive\nShow on AM tend to be\nMore\nAnd more a America John Hi can you run on my Canadian ... is doing time in the early ... dot com studio the home of a mid term madness that everyone else to go back and re directory the second time midterm madness is taking off people\nAre playing that left and right because they want to be they want to be recognized as in Larry Sabato the news the ... the brand new Chuck Todd or Michael Barone assembled the twenty by closes races in the United states and I have a contest going that you hear what the cubs come mid term madness\nYou're registered ... then you have to pick the winner and the twenty five race was\nWhen you have to pick their margin of victory\nShow a lot of the early birds got in last week and they said oh well we know where we know what's gonna happen\nNot realizing that thirty days of the lifetime in politics so the bottom falls out on Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and Joe mansion because they\nHave participated in McCarthyism named the judge Kavanaugh and now they have to go back they might have picked a Kevin Cramer North Dakota I sure would've but they might add a margin of victory of two to four points that I gotta go they're not going to get points for that if he wins by more than four points\nSo they got to go back and they either adjuster and trail but we allow that\nYou make your entry and you go in so I think you've got to go in and make a second entry but head over to\nMentor madness and play I think judge\nKavanaugh is going to make him for it but I Am I Am now persuaded that when the president opened up last night although the hot takes from the media whoa how very do this for days ago he said Christine Blasey Ford was a credible witness yeah but four days ago a lot of stop had not happened before I talk about\nWhat has happened to her testimony let's first talk about what the president had to say last night and this is what do you have to say last night\nCutting number twenty ever got already so I'm not hearing it\n[noise] right [noise] well do you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago [noise]\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know [noise] well I don't know if that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nIn a man's life is in tatters a man's life is shattered\nWithout all over the media this morning is the word mock\nAll right that's it that the president mocked\nChristian ... before I don't believe that is a fair characterization but it's a bubble characterization cause a Catholic president a negative light what are you doing as he is casting doubt on her testimony is not mocking or as a sexual assault back to me is casting doubt on her testimony let's play it again ... number eight\n... [noise] right I Want to be [noise] well do you think it was it was what I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I [noise]\n\nWhat was it I don't know where [noise] where I don't know if that's the only thing [noise]\n\nAnd a man's life is in tatters a man's life is shattered\nNow I don't believe his wife is shattered er and tattered I think he's going to be confirmed adjusted to the Supreme Court because this is McCarthyism but I Will tell you why the president did that he knew that people were talking off line off the record in the green room with their hands over their microphones about the fact that\nThe fear of flying defensive there'd been offered up the Chuck Grassley\nFor the delay but that was a lie maybe not her alive but it was a lie that um\nShe said she wasn't aware that the Kennedy would come to her and we got like a part of the documents that can be offering to come to her not sure whether lawyers over back from her or she lied she is familiar with polygraphs according to an corroborated letter\nRight now by the way on MORNING Joe the current says Trump mocks Dr ... Christine Blasey Ford keep mock is what they want it isn't mocking it's casting doubt on her credibility so her boyfriend has filed a letter that raises first of all\nThey've been boyfriend girlfriend for a long time before she met her husband she never raised an issue of sexual assault to him and she was familiar with polygraphs\nOr bad is it in the boyfriend ex boyfriends wetter it's uncorroborated there is also a new report from real clear investigations that the second front door in her home was not installed because of cost her phobia\nThere are no contrary evidence that court was installed as a second entrance perhaps for an office for therapy no I don't know the answer to any of that stuff but what happened last night when the president went after her one beer testimony\nIs to appeal to people to begin to look at the credibility of the primary witness it also\nGot the attention of the McCarthy I attacks on Brett Kavanaugh and back on the fact that this was all set up\nSo people are down on the president it might have been more prudent stabbed the vice president do this in a more prudent way as I just it perhaps might a bit but it is it that's not what happened\nMeanwhile Lindsey Graham went out on Fox News with Hannity last night said this number fourteen\nWell the cat and I'll bump Israel that the biggest change in the twenty Eighteen mid term so political observation in North Dakota sixty to twenty eight he should be confirmed every race in the Trump or red state held by Democrat there's been a surge by Republicans fly\nOr whether you're a ...

Scranton and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa than in Detroit who was a teenage son\nNorma in Michigan or legs Andrea Newport Beach California are weighing in Louisville\nUnion Oregon showing Columbus and in San Diego ... percent colors all a bit more than a confirmed nine out of ten of them support what the president said last night one ... and set it and they all\nDo believe Dr ... testimony though they are all very sympathetic and indeed one as a daughter who's ... survivor of sexual assault that's\nJust a slice of what I've been hearing what have you been hearing\nWell I Am hearing of course a mixture of the calls I get to the office a lot of them are are saying get Kavanaugh confirmed and then there are others that um are you know adamantly opposed we see those folks on the TV all the time um but what I Do hear when I'm Out and about and people just\nCan't understand why we haven't moved on with a getting him confirmed they understand that he has the right to um credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done soon\nOr ... I Do not believe the president was mocking the idea of someone being assaulted love but he was poking holes in testimony and I want to review a few things with you about the testimony\nFirst of all there was a story and political that she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be delayed she never actually said better so but that was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so there could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she some lawyer with polygraph they'd never discuss sexual assault\nThere was a new real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows it was not about claustrophobia but a second entrance for an office\nThere wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the ritual Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could not Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I\nDo honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point shortly wife show do I I I think most folks will agree with that however um even the witnesses that she called forward actually uh can't corroborate or\nSimply tear down that the testimony that she gave about um some party that she had attended so unfortunately um for for her I don't\nFind that to be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma but I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way who's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters taught me telling the fourteen year old\nThey will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people were much stood up to to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is but none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse is allegation\nWas libel and slander as an immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and stand by judge cabin on your view\n[noise] well I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put through um the\nThe worst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and end discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up\nBe nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusation which can put a family literally through how\nDuring the other who would be the chairman of health judiciary if the Democrats take the house that's a very scary thought he said\nHe is going to open impeachment hearings based upon the judges perjury nothing he said I'm a been doing this for thirty five years remotely approaches perjury as a lawyer nothing there's not a single under viable assertion that he made he characterizes drinking who did not\nDenies drinking why would anyone take that seriously\nWell at just look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance and as about what\nCan we stop and put it in the president's way what can we put in Congress has way to stop them from doing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and\nKnow thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it is as stopping the tax\nCuts in JOBS Act what ever it is\nThey try and delay delay resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the\nHouse we can expect that for the next two years\nSo I've been calling this frequently on law and the new McCarthyism because McCarthyism as the taking of a very serious charge that's been proven in other contexts in that case originally treasonous conduct against the Rosenberg perjury by his\nAnd the sun and get to the Hollywood screenwriter that's McCarthyism this McCarthyism is taking people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and they're horrible crimes and attributing them to a Brett Kavanaugh and I think people need to stand up and said this was hysterical and it's deeply unfair senator\nAnd as it is absolutely unfair and it is absolutely ridiculous\nIf you look around the Senate you can point fingers here too and members that have edit admittedly I'm had bad behavior and they're in their past which probably surpasses any accusation that has been\nLeveled against Brett Kavanaugh so I think people should tread very lightly on the things that they are throwing at this respectable man and his family\nThey don't want it to come around five fold against them in the future so um we just need to do a better job here in the United states at teaching our children what is appropriate behavior what is not appropriate behavior\nAnd then of course I'm just doing better as society but for other members to kind of laugh about what they did in their college days and then a point the finger at Brett Kavanaugh on say you are not qualified to serve on our nation's highest court because you drank beer and high school or college you know shame on you\nThey had better start thinking twice about what they're doing\nYou know a ... boy of campaign within four and are believed to be a third decent man he actually had good for them to Democrats who's been proven wrong of course they did not use those to wait for the FBI report their media we moved the goalposts\nOf you got any sense when the FBI is going to finish and therefore a motion for cloture filed do you have a timetable\nI Do think that we will see that this week I think the FBI as probably winding down as as we are speaking out with their witnesses\nAnd I know that to our leader is very intent on getting this uh voted on this week so as soon as we can receive the report\nI Do think it is important to a review the information and the report\nFor the supplemental investigation um we need to know that for our constituents just be able to verify you know everything is okay if everything does check out then we move forward and and have the same wrapped up but I Would anticipate um as the leader has stated he wants to see it done this week\nHave you heard any ... I've heard that possibly the FBI report will be done today and culture filed tonight have you heard that\nUh I have heard some semblance of that and but um again I I Would hesitate to say that on on a national program I just think that uh we have to make sure that we are going through the report\nThat we've had time to absorb it and make sure that we're able to push back to our our constituents that everything has got to go and then we move forward do\nYou expect at this point at this point obviously with a report to review that you will be voting for judge governor\nI well I'm unless there is something that surfaces and they are and the investigative report that you know the supplemental report that would corroborate Dr Ford's testimony unless that happens I plan to support judge Kavanaugh\nAnd the last thing I Want to play pea Lindsey Graham on on a Sean Hannity was by cutting number Fifteen what about these rich they approach I think they're toast all all of your ... uh do you agree with that senator I are going to go ahead\nAll of them politically ... anybody they only they are open seemingly ... even though there are tests that they know they should they present Trump one day states promising to nominate conservative judges well qualified this is a Bush guy\nHe worked for the Bush White House he's as mainstream as you can get\nIn on the DC circuit court of appeals for twelve years going uh assessments had this credibility has integrity before this hearing now if you're going to reward people for destroying his lie that's questioning his temperament and you're sitting in motion the destruction the judiciary to any Republican\nWho wants to question a Kevin Alice temperament what to do is rewarding the people who are putting in this box\nAnd they're also

dot coms\nThirty are joined now by Congressman Mike Gallagher is the Patriot and mobile member of the week congressman Gallagher I normally start by just bringing up the latest disaster in Wisconsin sport but I'm not going to do that then it just going to ask you to comment on the Green Bay Packers uniforms this weekend\nHey that was a throwback to the acme Packers that classic obviously the most plastic theme in all sports I was at the game great when go tax go we are headed towards the Superbowl\nSo your judgment is that those are good uniforms to wear yeah absolutely\nI had I just I writing and everything I've ever known about the Marines I just I mean you've just come from the marine corps approach the static alright\nJudge let's talk about judge Kavanaugh I spent the first time I talk to ten women all all first time caller and I've gone through their name but Joni Ernst and people heard them nine of them are believed the president did the right thing last night\nTen of them believe judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed what are you hearing in your district\nYou know I was at a a couple of parades this weekend and then just running around on the council meeting with a bunch of people so this is a statistically significant but I certainly had a lot of people both men and women come up to me saying they were just very disgusted with the way the political circus played out\nIn the Senate and I do think it's transparent that there are many Democrats who are just trying to delay this past election and would like nothing more than two delayed seeping still\nUntil perhaps the Democrat could win the presidency and twenty twenty and I think even if you're right in the middle right let's say you're not committed partisan one way or the other I think there is a general sense that okay elections have consequences edited and the president right in the authority to nominate\nSomeone a and that judge Kavanaugh none of the allegations against him and been corroborated in any way and I just would draw people's attention to the nineties you can do that the outside prosecutor Rachel Mitchell sent to the Senate\nOn Sunday and while your average person I think not and if they're going to read that Ninety Days or even your average politician right rarely read more than one page um\nI Do think it expresses what I've found to be the common sentiment back at my district this weekend but just to say we have enormous sympathy for Dr Ford but\nNone of the accusations she has made so far has had any iota of cooperation and that has to be the standard right we simply can't have a standard where you can make any accusation without any cooperation and that's enough to destroy some of life for no other reason than no capable people will want to serve in public office going\nForward but I also point out and and junior it's confirmed all this are there are enormous gaps in holes in her testimony the fear of flying story did not pan out not aware that the committee would come to her that would be on her lawyers her ex boyfriend has now sworn under oath said she's familiar with polygraphs there is a second news story\nOn the second door having nothing to do with claustrophobia there wasn't a single verifiable assertion not one that could be disproven in her testimony", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "03"}
