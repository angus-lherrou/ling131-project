D. to eight seven to two two and you might be that winter good luck to you okay the promotion and soon I don't know exactly when I Will keep you posted I'll let you know when it does All right let's go back to the Old West\nYou know I spent some time in tombstone\nI Wish I had more time to spend out there doing some fun stuff but we were working while we were out there we had a lot to do that with a lot of find people about some upcoming events that were helping put together for the freedom day's in June of next year and that's going to be on your faster than you can shake I can promise you\nBut it's fun because I get these emails all the time I talk about going to choose to own a lot of broadcast it from there are three or four times\nOver the years and I got this one in from David ... who says mark I couldn't help but laugh when I heard you talk about gun rights in Tucson on Sunday show it seems incredibly ironic to me that the whole reason the herbs and cowboys got into that famous gunfight was because the Marshall was going to enforce the ordinance to disarm the cowboys they were violating the city ordinance by\nCarrying guns in town some today might even question who was on the right side of that argument that's from David David you're right and then David right back we're gonna we're gonna discuss this year but he writes back\nOn October sixteenth that original email came in to me from David on the sixteenth at seven thirty three am\nBut later in the day he writes back from his rise in four G. L. E. E. smartphone mark I guess I should have listened to Monday show before I say you my email you did address the issue of gun control with some air keep up the good work I Love your show David well David thanks for both emails let's talk a little bit about that\nBecause it it kind of well together doesn't it when we're talking about Montana and a little city ordinance tombstone edits peak had about Fifteen thousand plus residents when it was booming\nThere were people who predicted that tombstone could get bigger than San Francisco well that never happened\nToday's resident counties between sixteen hundred and twenty six hundred depending on who you talk to the numbers not hard I we were talking with Gordon Anderson and ... and he said it was about sixteen I hadn't thought it was about twenty two to twenty six he lives there I'll trust him on that because he knows what he's doing is working with the chamber of commerce\nBut any day even at Fifteen thousand was still ... still a small town while booming small town now who put together this city ordinance\nNo firearms allowed in town who who who did that did the herbs do it did the ... do it did the town council do it I don't have an answer to that I'm going to find out for you\nBut I Will tell you this and it was the urge to enforce it and I wouldn't be surprised back in those boom town days to see the sheriff or the either the county sheriff or in this case the town marshal\nActually create the ordinance out of thin air why hundreds of misguided principle that it would keep the town face\nWas tombstone safe I\nGuess it was if you were a law abiding miner who minded his own business but if you went out after dark you and the risk of being robbed or shot remember how dark it was back then with no electricity in those streets gas lamps candles don't hold a candle\nA big old fat bright street like do that the point that I'm trying to make is that everywhere the herbs tried to enforce gun control including dodge and tombstone is what we're talking about now it was a complete and utter failure\n\nAnd what David is referring to is the fact that the cowboys were in town rumored to be armed in violation of that tombstone city ordinance\n[noise]\nWell you know a little bit about the gun fight you know that that was more than likely an excuse for the urge to go down there\nAnd take out their eggs on a group of individuals who have been threatening to kill them I won't go into the history of that right now it's too deep we don't have enough time\nI Will tell you was that gun control this used as the excuse to do it\n\nTo ... Lowery brothers and Clinton were killed in the span of about thirty for second\n\nAccording to the ... because it wouldn't hand over their guns\nAgain more proof positive that gun control is an utter failure it will fail in Missoula, Montana just added failed\nInto stone and dodge and everywhere else it has been tried every where it's been tried don't believe me see Chicago Baltimore your numbers are climbing through the roof\nMaryland has some of the strictest gun control in the nation we even want to talk about Newark Camden in Trenton no we don't\n\nAnd what do they do they want more and more and more\nWhat are they doing in Missoula, Montana coming after\nMore and more and more the petri dish\nIs just beginning to fester and grow in Missoula, Montana and the rest of the state had better be on alert no wait the rest of the nation had better be on alert\nDishes how it spreads\nOne day Montanans who weren't paying attention will wake up on their five thousand acre ranch in go I Can't do what on my property I Can't sell what\nMy neighbor rancher I got to go into town and pay thirty five\nBucks because of some dopey skinny gene wearing why taste sipping saw a guy who said what because he's from San Fran and knows what's best for me I don't think so cowboy\n\nYou'd better start paying attention or this is going to happen to you and it's not just Missoula, Montana\n\nIs WD which show on Haiti Amgen Evan [noise]\nGlory American to you and I left there this morning I Am in roads to have all place in New York City than Pittsburgh oh what a weekend\nMy friend Montana's there and bring has been good news on ten cruise versus at radio guy I think it's good news at least take it away my friend Martin Amos from Dallas\nIs very good news you and thank you thank you so much I Know he was fresh off a bomb phone engagement in Tampa at our at our answer station there and the immigrate\nTampa Bay on the Gulf Coast of Florida Florida very much in our minds you know the hurricanes come they go and the whole Michael thing was just a disaster I got family all over Panama City my wife does too so every prayer and every continuing good wish that to the good people of Florida wherever a ... that entire damage range\nMay be a but it was a I'm I'm guessing some political damage done there in the Tampa Bay area by you and everybody might Gallagher and various other people on the stage seeking to explode\nIn the midst of the blue wave I Do have I I I don't just have good news here from Texas\nA I've got fresh news here from Texas I was hanging out with my buddy Ted Cruz there's a name drop of a lifetime but it's true out just last night we did a Facebook Live\nBroadcast he could probably go I'm just at that that that uh but ... Ted Cruz page on Facebook or the the main with those two point one million followers so that was cool\nAnd it was kind of a sudden because I'll I'll pull back the curtain a little bit and take kind of what happened 'cause ...\nHad a a had a vanity infomercial on CNN last night and doubled down on Trump impeachment that's always a winner in taxes ... I'll give you some uh some some view from here on the ground as the saying goes in Texas and by the way that's where I Am and it's great to be back with you spend a little while\nAnd lord knows I

seen\nIt means I have an hour and forty minutes to figure out exactly how to massage the first man issue [laughter] guess what new sunny and I have in common we both love whew what new study and I have in common we think the first man controversy is ridiculous [noise]\nWas it I got to get some Chad and ... and this\nCaravan of of folks coming to the border what do you want to do about it one eight hundred five two oh one two three four one eight hundred five two oh one two three four\nJamal to show he as a human being I care ...\nHe's one of God's Children he was brutally murdered and chopped up in a little bit just terrible as an American\nHow much am I supposed to twist off about this exactly it is a question I'm asking maybe you're asking yourself to let's try to cobble some answers together at one eight hundred and five two oh one two three four we have movies coming out this weekend we'll talk about that with sunny but I just I just got to\nCommiserate with my buddy of of all why be sunny I mean I Love to commiserate with you I I went to I went to war with this uh with my Gallagher because ...\nIt's the knee jerk reaction of of of the decade there is no such thing as I say there's one time and then then I'll pick it up with funny if necessary there is no such thing as a human being\nWho has seen first plan\nAnd thinks the American flag was slighted no such thing I'll just leave it at that is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement I walked out of it as proud to be an American as I've ever been and so\nJust if you're sitting here thinking you know global is Hollywood pitiful by the way there's plenty of global is Hollywood ... don't listen if you're looking for ways in which Hollywood designers America you will not have to look far but don't look at us because it does not happen in his magnificent it is the stuff of Oscars for director Damien ...\nAnd Ryan Gosling who is no and clarify as Mrs Armstrong he is no perfect as Neal\nBoy you're talking about the the here's Maine drop even bigger than Ted Cruz you're already ten years ago I had a chance to hang with Neil Armstrong I Know how that happens\n[noise] well this gig is helpful and living in this town is out but we have a wonderful I'm\nJule and the crowd of\nDFW called the frontiers of flight museum and ten years ago we did a fortieth anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo program 'cause obviously if you do the math that means the fiftieth anniversary is now and you are correct about that [noise]\nUh and Apollo seven a crewman won't Cunningham knows a lot of other astronauts and so I'm looking to Neil and buzz in bill Anders one Apollo eight and Alan ... the leader now late Alan Bean walked on the moon Apollo twelve of Fort Worth guy and I I I Am seat a panel with all these guys I'm pinching myself because I Believe\nYou me I Am a ... hue and his feelings about the Cleveland Browns that is me and a manned space flight ... which is probably a horribly clumsy analogy but uh\nBut but that that was me I mean I'm sixty right now so in in my pre adolescent years through my adolescent years we're all the Apollo missions I live with them I Breathe into them\nAnd uh it it simply must be a God Singh aware through through a set of circumstances that I scarcely deserve that I was able to meet and hang out and speak with these folks and Neal is very unassuming he was very much the American hero very much uh the the the uh\nThe enthusiasts for his country but he was also very aware that he was ... if if he was representing humanity I miss the thing that made me probably the most nuts about the whole first manned controversy it's like we had to pick sides it's either an American achievements\nOr a human achievement guys it's both\nThey're not mutually exclusive okay enough about that enough enough enough enough of that part\nOf what's the best thing that I can share with you about Ted Cruz and a ... for months and months and months and months you know maybe not so much lately but for many moons are all the stories were pouring out of my state of Texas\nIt's a close race oh Ted Cruz's in trouble who'd Texas is gonna turn purple and the way they're turning blue oh there's never been a candidate like may do\nTed Cruz is running scared every single one of those stories were crap just to use the vernacular\nBy it was ridiculous it is ridiculous this was never a close race on paper now were there a couple of polls that there was one that had a beta with like a one or two point lead well we know the kind of recent history that polling organizations have had no don't wait\nBut in fairness to that industry polls are a snapshot\nOf enthusiasm or\n... that are taken in the blink of an eye so if you go back when was that ... by one or two of the month and a half ago company or something like that the August September hits\nPossible that a bit of survey with a ... a sample size of acts might have run into a vein of democratic enthusiasm because let me tell you a Democrat and the Z as I'm In my state is higher than it has been in a long time now what does that mean\nWhat does that mean it means that Ted Cruz is not going to beat ... by sixteen points as he did Paul Sadler six years ago to get to the Senate it's not going to be a big team point when\nIn fact it could be ... as much as ten points closer\nI Believe that the ... and it's kind of a wide range but hey it's an election who knows these days predicting is a very sketchy game I consider the range of possibilities for the Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke\nRace when we wake up on November seventh or go to bed really late [laughter] it's been my gaze on mistakes I Believe the range of possibility is Ted Cruz winning by four to Ted Cruz winning by twelve\nTo eight points but day I die if if he wins by for that means that Cruz voters were lazy it means that Texas Republicans were complacent it means that we sat on our ... and we thought we got this\nAnd in in that capacity I never want to be part of the problem because I'm here I live here my show is here\nAnd I know and I was I was hanging out with my buddies in the Ted Cruz campaign last night did a Facebook Live with Ted that I it's it's still ... we had a good time about forty minutes or so talking about stuff pulling back the curtain on a few things it's all in the Ted Cruz Facebook page\nAt that as we get down to election day\nIf it's for points or five\nOr God Forbid free or something like that it will be like beta one and we'll never be rid of these people\n[laughter] I mean we have Democrats in Texas we just don't let them run the place and uh at at the they'll go gunning for John Cornyn\nTotally get it does the country feel like it's better run now that it was you know three

gym to buy the suddenly of\nMatter of pressing obligation the first for starters to cover people with preexisting conditions if you and I run an insurance company and all of a sudden when there are millions of people we suddenly got to cover and they're sick already what do you think we're going to do the premiums they are going to guy rocket that's why free market solutions state run state funded risk pools\nCan help folks like you free market solutions\nCan help bring rates down to bring premiums down can bring co pays down the Affordable CARE Act has been\nThough you would show on AM tends to be the answer [noise]\nMorning glory Americans who you are in Iraq there this morning I Am in order to have all place in New York City than Pittsburgh oh what a weekend\nMy friend Mark Davis is there to bring has been good news on a cruise versus that radio guy I think it's good news that we take it away my friend Mark Davis from Dallas [noise]\nThanks very much she had the occasion dean good news ah last night I had a great pleasure and doing a little Facebook Live on Ted Cruz's a Facebook page which would make sense you can go to a take a look at that it was filled\nWith a with the charm and authenticity [laughter] like what one point the images kind of went sideways you had to mess with that for a little bit but it was a it was always straight shooting from dead we talked about a\nA number of things going on and be it'd be cruising O'Rourke race I give you from taxes my honest take which is unwavering and that is the cruise wins and it is not that close cruise wins and it will not be that close now\nDon't messed me up here in Texas\nEverybody listening into Hugh Hewitt affiliates through the great state of Texas need to make sure that I'm right about that it's not about me but it's about our state it's about our country and that means that if if if that is I think the blue wave is already dissipating\nBut is there a Democrat enthusiasm in Texas is there a Democrat enthusiasm all over the country in the first opportunity that Democrats have to interrupt the Trump agenda is the most conservative governance we've had since Reagan you bet there is Democrat energy\nBut the good news is there is Republican energy and it is freshly motivated the cabin on hearing absolutely had an effect\nIt made us in Suzie asked about the way we acted I I mean when when all of a sudden\nConservatives on their list of heroes list Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins you know everyone has been made better there has been as a conservative spine infusion and Lindsey Graham I I I I Can't not love the guy he's dead\nWrong and immigration maybe we should check back maybe got better on that too but on a whole lot of other things especially a war on terror national defense national security he's he's inspiring way correct and wonderful\nLindsey Graham ah is it has been a joy to be cold for these last few weeks since that moment of magnificent righteous indignation\nThere in the Senate Judiciary committee when he just gave it to Democrat America for what they've done gave it to his Democratic colleagues for what they've done absolutely great and then Susan Collins of a ... a wonderful woman\nOr a New England Republican meaning Swiss cheese conservatism unless they we don't we don't do Republicans in New England the way we do Republicans in taxes or\nYour or or Mississippi or Utah right it's a New England Republican we used to have Democrats in Texas who are more conservative than some New England Republicans but as I said I'd rather have an are by somebody's name and the state of Maine\nThen somebody in the state of Maine to set up with a D by their name so I've never sat at home drop my fingers on the table going oh Susan Valentine never lamented that you take what you can get and all we got from Susan Collins is magnificent\nClarity at Sharon ... two principal and the vote that got us justice Brett Kavanaugh I Will be for ever grateful and meanwhile she'd better have food tasters\nAnd I am not kidding I mean they're they're they're\nMysterious packages being sent to her home Lindsey Graham is being being spat on everybody's being dogged and screamed at an airport and I know it's a long walk from being screened at an airport to being shot\nBut today's violent left is something that cannot be ignored the unhinged laughed exist\nAnd I just got to tell you if you were in the Senate and you were a yes vote on Kavanaugh you better but I think armed security is a very good idea\nAnd I am not kidding yeah [noise]\nUm here's an example of of of of someone who was getting a little I guess\nThis is that the Al Smith memorial foundation charity dinner in New York and a ton of money gets raised mostly for children's charities it's absolutely great and it tends to have a political keynote speaker engaging in moments that are not\nSo dry and political right last year it was for example house Speaker Paul Ryan\nAnd this year they secured a keynote speaker who is certainly attracted some attention of light and that would be soon to be former UN ambassador Nikki Haley\nSo think about it okay Nikki Haley is your keynote speaker in the first time and she had last evening was about the selection process that led to her\nYear he ... he's a boy scout\nFine I don't remember where I Am [noise]\nHere he wanted to buy things again right\nNow that he wanted an Indian woman\nOne day and [noise]\n\nHe okay [laughter]\nTime up of\nA brief worried about Nikki Haley I just love her\nOr she will you know when I make my list of my favorite un ambassadors ever which I guess I'll do if I ever had some time I buy it\nUh you know John Bolton gonna let us probably at the top of that last uh her and she's she's just great to be as governor of South Carolina great I think one of the things I really like about her especially in this era where we were just poisoned by the\nThe ... of of Max Boot and a new annoying book from Ben Sasse and\nYou know and and God Bless Jeff Flake kinda wish anybody ill I I Want everybody to just just go in there if you're going into private life just go do that and go do whatever you want to do\nAnd just just leave me alone with his hand wringing cells floating navel gazing you know conservatism is bad under drugs drugs the anti Christ just just take that and and walk down appear All right um\nBut Nikki Haley is an example speaking of governors so as my other good friend and former Texas Governor Rick Perry in so many others I could name\n[noise] of people who not only didn't know what to think about Donald Trump they flat out didn't like him they opposed mightily the concept of his presidency the concept of his nomination\nAnd you know what they did they came around\nThey came around they open their eyes they open their minds and said wow okay maybe there's some stylistic things that I didn't love about this guy but I sure a lot of the results I Love is the economy I Love are stronger borders\nI Love the dismantling of the regulatory state I Love the tax cuts I Love it\nThere there's it [noise] so God Bless Nikki Haley now her exit ramp just days before the midterms\nThat's a little weird I wondered about that\nI was talking to Sebastian Gorka on on my local show the other day\nAnd I said you know what what's the deal with that I was making ... there is
