R. G. or just about anything I Love getting emails from you always a lot of fun got a bunch of them this week then I'm going to be getting back to because there were some really good ones including still getting email\nOn the Army Corps of engineers I told you how to get the permits to carry a firearm on corps of engineers property and I'm Still getting responses that a lot of you thanking me for that a lot of you've gotten your permit some of you wanting to know hey I just heard that on the podcast from a long time ago can you tell me how to do that I Do a lot of\nYou know I recreate quite a bit on corps of engineers property and would love to carry my farm so I'll be getting back to those of you have written we had to promise you that\nTo back the anti Hoosier the voice of reason for the final segment Andy you care to make any predictions about\nUh about Kansas before we switch gears\nOh boy well I tell you why I put it on the spot buddy of mine\nWell hey you know what I think that we're going to keep all for house seats that we have in the state of Kansas I think it is going to be a really close race in the second district as I mentioned with an open seat with the season the Democrat who's been in the state legislature for like six years tried to run a whole bunch of different positions and last but ah the unseen\nIsn't that a non politician Republican that we have Steve Watkins who is a solid military guys sell conservative into he he loves his guns as well and I think we're going to keep that seat as well is going to be close but I think we'll get it so I think we maintain all four seats here I mean we are in a really really dead heat within\nI mean they're tied it like forty two percent right now with the Republican and Democrat or for the governor's race we have a third party candidate the voting around ten percent is pulling predominantly from the left side of the aisle\nBut that wasn't a toss up right now I I Am really good friends are friends with Kris Kobach I absolutely love which he does I've I'm supporting him a two hundred and ten percent and I really hope it gets in there but that was really close but I'll give it to him I think that we can pull away with this and I think that we can keep Kansas solidly right across the board\nI agree with you a hundred percent let's go to the let's go to a Congress us\nHouse of representatives now I'm I'm On record I think I think again just like I said during the presidential campaign twenty sixteen I said tomorrow morning a lot of people are going to wake up very surprised at what happens Trump plus three hundred electoral votes I'll see you tomorrow that was how I close that show on Tuesday of the election\nI was right and I still have my kids you are not as soon as people go do my lottery numbers for me it was going to get three hundred and six electoral votes that's a plus three hundred electoral meeting over three hundred or so I was right on that I still think the U.S house is\nGoing to see four to five red seat pick up and I still think the Senate is going to see two or three pickups as well blue waivers immediate created term now I may be\nWrong okay if I'm wrong well I'm wrong but I'll tell you what if I'm right and you won't hit\nMe for some lottery tickets what do you think in the U.S house in the Senate\nI'm with you I think that we're going to keep it especially the house of me come and they're not going to win over what do we have like a thirty five forty point majority in the in the house it's not going to happen they're not going to win that many uh no I think that we may lose a couple in the house I don't think we're going to gain any but I think we'll definitely keep all majority when it comes to the Senate we do have that to vote majority in that in the Senate\nThey say it's a sure fire when for them to win the Senate\nEven a couple of our congressmen here in Kansas think that they're going to lose the Senate and it turned blue but I'm the eternal optimist eye with I'm with you I think that we're going to be able to maintain its not pick up a seat or two in the Senate and be able to keep it read\n[noise] oh I don't I I have no doubt if I was to doubt anything I Would doubt the house I doubt you know keeping the house more than I Will just and I think the Senate is going to stay solid red ... close going to be very close but I Do think we pick up two or three states I'm at this stage of the game I think mansion is safe unfortunately pastors in a fight for his life\nYou know I Can't done there there's a couple of them that that are going to be interesting and fun to watch but I think he's the one two maybe three Republican pickups in the Senate not surprised to keep the Senate not surprise to keep the house now\nOn a bigger know\nWhen the Democrats ... after the midterms and they're still gonna realize after the midterms anti that Trump is still president what do you think happens between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty\nOh well you know it's funny you mentioned that I have a guest and national guess what I bring on all the time uh and I'll give them a plug Gerard marrow or he's done a lot of predictions he's studied a lot of election since the beginning of the founding of the nation is written a couple of books great news for America dot com and he's a great guy have him on the show quite a bit he predicts that the Democrat Party will crumble\nTheir own way and that there will rise a new a brand new like actual legit socialist party but the Democrat Party will be no more\nNo I don't know if I take it that far but I think that if they end up losing the midterms up to this blue a mentality that they think they're going to have that they're going to try to do the impeachment they're going to try and bring back Obamacare they going to try and repeal the tax cuts and they don't get any of this\nI think that they are stuck in a really bad place and they will do something crazy drastic because they're not going to handle it any more I mean you were mentioning in the last segment about the people that are just so angry all the time and don't know how to handle Trump being in office I like to think about something for just a second the millennials like you mentioned the millennials my generation\nThe very first election that we get to vote in was Iraq Obama in two thousand eight\nThat was the very first election that we got to have the we get to partake in the end they won they never experienced ... feet and remember this was the generation\nThat's a great Berlin patient trophy\nThis is the generation that's never been told no by their parents the gossip the participation trophy all throughout their life and that they feel that they could walk through life doing whatever they want to they finally lost and they don't know how to handle it which is why we're seeing the outcry and the response that we are right now nationally with the anti ... and all these members that are throwing temper tantrums across the country they'd never experienced\nThis before so if they lose again\nI don't know what to expect from them I don't know who they're going to put up\nFor the twenty twenty race whether it's going to be a Cory Booker well there's going to be a Kamala Harris I don't know what they're going to go more extreme and try Bernie Sanders again [laughter] I don't know but we're in New territory to where they're trying things they've never done before because they've never been in this position the way they had before\n... that's a fantastic point I've I don't think I've ever heard anybody phrase it like that that that's a wonderful point I appreciate you bringing that up and mentioning it really gives us some things to think about and I'll tell you what's interesting about what Andy settlers and I'm Talking directly you know and that is you'll notice he says they don't he's a part of that millennial generation and every time I talked I kept you're saying that\nAnd certainly if it's interesting to me tell me why you do that\nWell it's because obviously I'm part of the millennial generation but they don't represent the the fringe out\nProbably the ones that throw the ... they don't represent me look there's a lot of millennials that are conservative that that feel bad because our reputation is being damaged because we're part of that or we don't like to be represented in that sense but there is a division in my generation where either\nYou have the compass of conservatism understand things or you've gone through schooling so much to where you think Bernie Sanders has the answers on finances which is just hysterical I mean uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nAnd all of her gas that she's made on the public scene saying that somehow we're going to fund the forty trillion dollar social program\nA Medicare for all and also the garbage she's talking about and then when she tries to debate her Republican opponent who is an economics professor at the universities are it shows how silly that they actually are but they don't ... cognitive bias\nUnderstanding of conscience to run a there's\nTruth in their ... back to counter what they're saying but they don't want to listen to it because it doesn't fit the narrative so they put the horse blinders on and to continue down the trench that has them is that is not me and we need to decipher between the two 'cause there are many conservative millennials there that are trying to wave and jump up and down saying hey I'm not representative is don't let me into that category\nYou know it's interesting we wish we had another hour oh\nYou have thrown some red meat on the table rather you you really have but I Want to go back to the point you made about you don't know how they're going to handle this after they lose because here's what's going to happen\nThey are going to lose the midterms even\nIf they get in the house because Trump is still precedent Andy germ comes not going anywhere\nAttempt to impeach him in the house will fail and it will certainly not going anywhere in the Senate and the Internet to dredge up\nAnd and then you know ... Obamacare will die anything they will die any gun control move there any whatever bad will die they they have already lost so that begs the question when we see them as you refer to them as pets temper tantrums that they've been having some of them very violent temper tantrum\nThere's a place where this American politics we have vigorous debates vigorous disagreements but we never resort to terrorism or violence and full extent of the law the ... the law should be thrown at him\nAnd this person should spend a lotta time behind bars we'll talk about one hundred sixty four thirty one ten we get into the caravan as well so if you've got questions about the\nPipe bombs give us a call the caravan one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenant then we're going to get into electoral politics one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero give us a call ... alive [noise]\nAm ten Seventy the answer\nIs a critical time for nation hand for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family [noise]\nDefending human life standing up for a good friend Israel\nWorking to uncover the deep state so massive corruption in Washington battling to end the genocide of Christians in many parts of the world\nAnd to form commitment to constitutional efforts to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorists [noise]\nYou can learn more about the mission and work can be ... online and hasty L.

... am ten Seventy [noise]\nIf you're just joining\nUs we have breaking news the suspect has been arrested in these hype\nBombings and we have a name now a just a name is saves are say Iraq I think I pressed that right ah in Florida someone with a ... some criminal history a for grand theft back in twenty Thirteen or he's been arrested as the main suspect\nIn these twelve pipe bombs had been delivered so far\nThere were two more devices delivered a this morning I attempted to deliver they were all you know intercepted or those who were going to Cory Booker a senator and James Clapper uh CNN contributor and former director of national tells you is that what you're seeing it again um the the so far this started on Monday\nWith a pipe bomb at its Soros home um none of these have exploded no one has been injured but it has caused a lot of tears member the evacuation of the time we're talking about the significance that with the\nHotel with the office buildings with the apartment buildings with the grocery store shopping um which CNN located there I mean the effect has caused hair\nEven if these devices were voting\nOr just weren't built correctly or that would be a good thing that thankfully no one was injured there's no place for this our politics eleven days out from mid term elections certainly uh put things into perspective\nUm but it does not mean we can't have vigorous debates and disagreements in our country or without resorting to not just violence but tear\nWhich is what this is is that acts as a domestic terror and the tempted uh to to terrorize the people and to get we condemn it to the fullest extent of should we have a name now a again of the suspect\nWe know the location in Florida sunrise implantation Florida I'd up here's a vehicle was in one of those locations homeless and the other location a such a north of Miami kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale and uh and we don't know yet or if there were other people involved this is the suspect\nSo I get it may not be over the president is planning to address this that happens while we live on the air we will certainly\nCover it I Want to take a your your comments on Nancy on Facebook and we're taking your phone calls as well at one hundred sixty four thirty one ten dancing on Facebook right said what kind of consequences does a person like this face Andy\nWell of course the obvious ... and then most appropriate and prudent and proper consequence is that he's put in prison because someone like this is not fit to live in the society of human beings and they're locked away\nFor a period of time because they've obviously committed or attempted to commit the the most terrible crimes are and and then the worst scenario this could be considered an attempted murder\nBecause you're doing everything you can do to a eradicate the life of a human being by means of an explosive device if in fact that's what it was and even if it didn't ah explode the the fact that the perception of the recipient is what counts so the ultimate penalty here\nIs jail yeah I mean this is again what we hope is that this will bring an end\nTo this time period after this week in the United states have\nA these are devices being delivered even as early this morning with two more devices so a total count at twelve but the postal service law enforcement said they have\nNo reason to believe that all the devices um and I buy apprehending the person that will stop them from sending more but how many more out in the postal system is is still the question so you have to remain vigilant uh we should we have listeners on both sides of the aisle she's obviously are focused on a lot of uh left uh those on the left\nUm if you work in those kind of offices in in Capitol Hill or in regional offices for members of Congress or be vigilant you know is going through mail and if you were the postal service\nBe vigilant as well or we want you to be safe because while some of these individuals are so high profile their mail to get screened at special facilities others are not\nAnd they're going through the regular postal service so again I we've got to remind all of the people who could be in the light of danger\nBecause of an individual like this we condemn it to the fullest extent I think you put the politics aside because that may be their purpose or their ideological purpose behind it but obviously a something seriously wrong with a person whether it's their criminal\nOr or or just insane or criminally insane\nI think you put it altogether or they should be facing serious law enforcement penalties that they'll go through the process but again this because the disruption that uses the mail service or the people who were targeted a very serious and now we suspect that President Trump\nWill address that as well as ... will cover that on the broadcast if it happens while we're on the air department of justice is also going to speak to it later on today a show or taking your phone calls running hundred six eight four thirty one hundred sixty four\nThree one what is zero we're going to get into a little bit\nOf this caravan issue out got Eddie here as well as a caravan of migrants heading towards the border or are they are in Mexico now their looks like they're heading towards either a Texas border or a California border Texas border crossing it's closer\nThe president Andy I yesterday's authorized\nEight hundred additional troops through a a General Mattis Secretary Mattis department of fence\nThat includes that would then up the number two ah they're already Twenty one hundred National Guard troops there that could increase to four thousand this eight hundred could be more as well so the U.S is preparing\nA for for a border effort for this to happen at our border if it is not able to be stopped before in Mexico but that is the hope is that we work with the Mexican government and gifts\nStopped and dissipated because the numbers are still in the thousands estimates anywhere between three to fourteen thousand people that is a lot more than the last Caribbean we experienced in April twenty Eighteen so and so again Eddie I mean it appears that the Trump Administration preparing for two things one\nPossibly are having to deal with this or their own to try to get Mexico to work with us to deal with it together\nRight as we said the position of the scale Jay has always been that we want to have an intervention prior to the arrival of this a wave of humanity as the border and by that I mean the intervening with Mexican authorities to stop them to turn them back\nTo put them into a\nCategory is perhaps of those who are\nLegitimately seeking asylum which says really available in the first thing in which you feel safe and the first nation who would you feel safe which should be Mexico in this case\nAnd then ... out those who are here to do ill to the United states are people who are not here seeking asylum but to do danger those who are engaged in human trafficking and so forth with working with the Mexican authorities to do that\nOn of course as you said Jordan we're sending troops to the border but the ... they're they're only to support the civil authorities and they are not expected to come into regular contact with the migrants if they carry arms is solely for purposes of self defense\nAnd of course the law and the United states currently prohibits the routine use of troops in law enforcement routine law enforcement activities I don't expect that that will happen I anticipate and hope that they will not be confrontations at the border between this wave of humanity and the United states troops you never know I Hope it doesn't happen\nLet me remind you the president's executive order that was ultimately okayed by the U.S Supreme Court after many legal battles on a a immigration and preventing a certain individuals certain from certain countries\nOr city in Mexico you should be claiming asylum there\nThe Mexican authorities would then go through that process about whether or not you meet the qualifications that we know people want to get to the U.S and we have allowed a I think the laws are not tough enough\nPeople to keep crossing through multiple countries then heading to our border and making an asylum claim and get and say well you know I didn't really want these other places I couldn't be safe either in some cases individual cases that may be true\nBut the vast majority you should be able to claim asylum in the first places called the first place you land for\nShe touched foot in his outside of your home country when you're under the jurisdiction of a new law enforcement um and the new country or the new sovereign territory I can take your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to remember our second half hour\nWe're talking all midterms are so ... and your calls about that as well eleven days out from the mid term elections will give you

we we know that there are a lot of our department of homeland security\nHas reported that there are known criminals gang elements middle Easterners or people who are not from Central American descent and obviously those who would use a caravan like this to take advantage of it for bad any legal purposes and you're talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face\nIf it makes it to your border and you decide to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before we go into our our next break Laurie in Arkansas

think we want the un\nInvolves on protecting our borders they they get involved with their regional military conflicts\nLike between the two countries are not win two countries should be able to work together\nLike the U.S and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in like Lebanon Israel border\nIn Gaza Israel\nPlaces in Africa not where it's two allies together so let's not get the UN involved\nLet's handled this between us and Mexico working together\nHopefully long before this caravan reaches our southern border we come back mid term elections eleven days away politics get your

the\nBeginning of the second half hour Jay sexual alive let me update you with the biggest breaking news the day and that is that a suspect has been arrested\nIn these pipe bombings to twelve that have been intercepted uh some high profile individuals are current and former\nGovernment officials well some celebrities are suspect has been arrested or they again does not mean there's not other devices that can be out there still remain vigilant\nOr the president is likely to address if it happens while we're on the air we will go to the president's comments but we do want to focus in on give you an update on the mid term elections right now we're only eleven days out there is a you know we covered the caravan er which obviously has an impact on the election or we covered the devices\nObviously has an impact because the entire week of news has been on these devices are but now we want to look right into the mid term elections were eleven days out\nFrom election day but let me remind you of many places including my home state you can already vote\nMany people are I'm actually planning to vote in the next few days I'm so people are already making up their mind casting their ballots\nA lot of votes will be end before election day so we're at a time period now in America where we have election day but it really is like a two week period where you can go and vote and convince people to get out there to actually cast their final vote for candidates if they don't want to start off in the U.S Senate\nAh because that is where it looks like Republicans are having to potential for the most games and there's pretty shocking news\nOut of New Jersey a Senate race there are pretty blue states do to elected people like Chris Christie they've been Christie Todd Whitman types and and uh in New Jersey\nThe Senate race there Bob Menendez is in some trouble and the race has been moved by the cook Political Report to a toss up that would be a huge victory for Republicans\nTo be monumental Jordan I mean this is one of the races that you and I have talked about several times on this broadcast and keeping an eye on it because if it did move into a competitive territory it was going to be a clear sign that not only the we're the Republicans going to keep the majority\nIn the United States Senate but it might be a significant majority now pulling inside that state\nHas it in some cases within the margin of error with Bob Cuban closing to within five five points a button and then ended it Mendez of course during\nA bottom an index has been plagued with scandal over the last couple of years ... has run a very good campaign he's a businessman he appeals to people that are maybe a little tired of the political process but the fact that New Jersey is on the map tells me that the Republicans are are in a very strong position\nIn the United States Senate Jordan as we've talked about most of the political battlefield in the United States Senate is in Trump or states that were carried by Donald Trump in Republican states as of this ... New Jersey which certainly not be one of them and yet it's in\nPlay let's go to the president right now he I Believe is addressing the issue involving type\nOf that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nIncredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find that person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI've instructed authorities to spare no resources or expense and finding does his possible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [laughter]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nTo the extent of the law much never\nAllow political violence to take in America cannot have and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nJust like we have echoed and the president waited to suspect was apprehended to say we will not accept\nPolitical violence in America to do everything possible\nMake sure it's this individual and not a hill additional individuals as well prosecute them\nThe fullest extent of the loss of their you've heard from President Trump the announcement of the suspect being arrested but still law enforcement activities ongoing he's taken very seriously also taking the mid term elections very seriously as well or we will continue to talk about those we come back ... New Jersey has now he toss up\nBetween incumbent Democrat Senator Bob Menendez a again a folks this was a race that people were not watching that closely and an upcoming business and\nPay 'em ten Seventy the answer\nIs a critical time for nation and for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important than right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family [noise]\nDefending human like standing up for a good friend Israel\nWorking to uncover the deep state massive corruption in Washington battling to end the genocide of Christians in many parts of the world\nAnd to form commitment to constitutional efforts to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorists [noise]\nYou can learn more about the mission and work in VC OJ on line and hasty L.

wanted to address the too close Senate race is right now\nOr in the country eleven days after the midterms and we're going to go right to your phone calls those are in Arizona and Nevada let's start in Arizona than a this is an open seat because of the the passing of Senator John McCain tell us about uh the two candidates they're both both members of Congress\nYes right Martha ... versus ... send them a Jordan I I'm I'll be honest with you I think this is going to come down to one issue in the state of ... of Arizona that's immigration and border security there is a very big divergence between the two candidates ah Martha ... closely aligned with President Trump on his efforts to secure the border and then work on an overall solution\nHere since cinema just quite frankly is not and I think that has been the driving force of\nOf really having the numbers move Martha ... way a matter of a month ago it looked like a two three four point advantage for years in cinema\nAnd now it looks like Martha McSally is up by about a winter to uh the early numbers there as far as registration sure do look like they're favoring her up but again Jordan go back globally this is one of the two Republican seats the Democrats absolutely have to have if they were to take majority\nYeah I mean so again this is these are important races and they are down there within the margin of error\nEither candidate could win a but there's some momentum going behind the Republicans right now I take a listen this is just interesting the Democrat candidate congressman uh ... uh she said this radio show this is coming back to haunt her a bit by thirty three\nNo no I don't buy more me as an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there or not you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban that I'm saying is personal decision and I\nMean I don't know why she said something like that find that don't care if you go fight for the Taliban but as a member of Congress and then she says this about her own state by thirty for speaking to the very liberal this year that routes nation just a couple of months ago\nFor let's say I have a lot of democracy and then my hair is I'm a

T. and this is what the Silicon Valley executives are coming forward publicly and apologized without the whole like buttons or the whole notion of getting you to click click click click it is an outright addiction and that's what psychologists to Spain\nAnd it's interesting because I was in New York the other day launching this book\nAnd I stopped by one of a college there and I was talking to young man he's a sophomore and he said he had a he said to me in these terms I listen to this he said\nI have been sober for two weeks\nOff from social media so\nIn other words what we're talking now is about a new twenty first century addiction these kids are are ... ... that this stuff and what about what's happening which I find very interesting is\nThat a lot of them are cutting the court they call it in fact it's called court cutting they are abstaining from using social media they are literally turning their cell phones off for weeks and\nMonths at a time in some cases permanently we have I quote some executives from Silicon Valley tech they're just giving up on social media period they're throwing it out the window or they want nothing to do with it because of side effects are so devastating\nI'm Down to a checking my Facebook page once every two weeks because now I realize that it's a tremendous time shape if nothing else you wasted a lot of time\nAnd you know because I'm In the media you know I have a lot of friends I don't really know and you can just get sucked into that ... it's no good I blame as a positive note I Am seeing more people are out in restaurants and so I'm not with their faces stock in the phone so I think people are becoming aware of this\nAll day very they very Americans are and I think this book is going to help that ... also we we I I Want to not neglect mentioning something else that has to do with the world Wide Web and there is this burgeoning a inventory of gas has called the intern it up everything that is to say\nHe's smart TV you're smart coffee makers um you're you're smart cars all these devices\nAre now have a chip in their mouth some stores that are connected to a work through the Internet are and what we're seeing for example and smart toys\nAs a as an alarming invasion of privacy in our home uh for example I give stories in the book of what's really happening out there um\nAnd now that we're coming upon Christmas season I just want to ah with parents and grandparents choosing to buy toys for their children I really hope that they read this book because there are ways that protecting ourselves with what is going on out there but you cannot protect yourself take the\nUnless you know what is happening forewarned is forearm\nAnd so for example the lottery smart choice they can they can be ... I'll let me give me an example of a of a monitor that parents will use for example the monitor their answer\nA or their ... young children and their bedroom these devices are now part of the Internet if everything they tend to be smart devices that worked through the Internet for example you can be traveling you can monitor if you're if you're away from home you can look on your iPhone and you can see OK everything is okay little Johnny or little Jane is are okay\nHere's the problem there these are ... and I tell a story of a hacker who got into these devices and in an entire brand name of the product line of the bedroom monitors and blast those uh output the video on the Internet along with the location of where they were\nThere this is killing stuff that's going on in what's called the dark Web\nAnd now there are surfing in the dark Web just like we have Google for the regular Web like you and I use every day there are a search engine flex showdown and others that I mentioned in the book that ah allow you access into the dark Web and you have these malefactor going in there that have access to these devices we brought into our home\nAnd it's something that people thinking about what we need to be aware of in order to protect themselves their children their family and their communities from the stuff\nWe've heard stories about these devices on Amazon has won a Mother's Day gift Google's got one now with the yeah you can address them and they will address you back and they will yeah change the channel on your TV or your radio or whatever\nBut we've also heard stories about those things recording a lot of things that are going on in the room and ending up being a witness to invention in court I don't know how successful that was but it's a scary scary saying\nNo it's it's been very successful and I have stories like that I have a story of a little girl I Believe she lives in Houston, Texas in fact\nShe ordered the that the parents had one of these the Lexus and the Amazon Alexis and you just say Alexa you know a plane need this music elect them die me this is Alexis tell me what the weather is\nAnd this little girl all of about five or six I tell the story\nA ... an auditor self all kinds of stuff and the parents didn't know about it and tell it arrived at the house\nAnd then this is a stupid thing I take the once the parents found out they kept the device in the house and I called to the mother as saying oh well now we have to whisper in the house where well how how is that you want to bring in this device listening to you literally listening to your twenty four seven\nBecause it is activated with a wake word way you say a Lex as soon as you say Alexa she she she perks up but she's listening twenty four seven to everything is going on there and I tell I tell stories of court cases\nThey spent less than half the drainage fees on drainage [noise] now you know Einstein had this famous shame that the definition of insanity is

the provisions in it all the all we've done is to make our regular bond payment shop a general fund like we've always made you know for ... you know for decades\nAnd that would have paid down some decks if they went out and borrowed new debt to replace that sure weren't exactly the same place we started no deaths been tied down and not one penny the drainage fame money went to pay down debt you know ... how do you explain the fact\nThat we're spending less on streets in drainage but we added a hundred million dollars you would be using that money to pay down debt it's just a complete why not one penny of that drainage feet ever went to pay down any debt\nNow I did go to high hiking by coordinators and the pay five hundred or their full time employees and pay for developers to develop properties in the floodplain but it did not go to pay down in that\nRoom by a reminder but those are great for the ... before and I have a chuckle because I'm not laughing as a matter it's like it's a great word meeting or what was the amount spent on the bike like coordinator in the midst of all this with an eighty grand sixty ran\nTo the shower he was posted I think it's sixty Seventy thousand

pockets and came up with a half billion dollars over the last seven years to to to commit towards fixing our drainage\nAnd Sylvester Turner took that money and spend it on something else is a moral outrage there are thousands of families that were flooded that didn't have to be flooded because that money was diverted from what the voters of Houston intended for dummies span on\nIs a great news

affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr pain 'cause there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr pick as he is a nationally recognized authority on natural\nAn alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a born a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract day and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right\nAt a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the month of getting the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramped in their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and\nIt has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many captain supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah and it does do here too but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet yeah and so it was from the bones themself\n... orbit back from the bones if neither\nThat's right I see and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the counting from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yep okay\nAnd so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy sure just drink milk just\nDrink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yet because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food started writer right but these things don't absorb and the body that's out there for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... minute like Tom's first of all calcium absorbed in the body unless", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "27"}
