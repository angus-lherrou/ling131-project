All right\nAll right I just got this email a little bit ago I've been looking forward to reading this this is a good email and it it's a provocative one remember last week we were talking about Democrats and gun and can you be a Democrat and a gun rights activists but pull the trigger\nPun intended and the voting booth for a Democrat who hates your gun rights and and you know it will fully knowing my response to that is no no you can't but what you are as a Democrat who loves guns and there's not a damn thing wrong with that\nNot a damn thing wrong with that you can be a Democrat that loves gun but to be an activist it requires something else this has to be your issue\nAnd if it's not your number one issue than you are in fact just a Democrat who loves guns and as I said there's nothing wrong with that lots of Democrats love gun was something else is more important to them and I use the example maybe it's global warming maybe it's roe v Wade whatever it is\nOn their platform there's something there that's more important to you than gun that's why you are willing to love your guns still pull the lever for Brock Obama\nOr Hillary Clinton who you know want to take away your guns or maybe your\nRepresentative or senator who you know wants to take away your guns\nSo to me I don't have that I don't have that dilemma I sleep well at night I Love my guns and I know who I pull the lever for also loves my gun take a listen to this email mark your show discussing how a Democrat can be pro Second Amendment really got me thinking\nYou see I'm a gun loving conservative trade union member so I knew exactly where this email was going a moment I saw that I knew exactly where this letter writer was going let's let's check it out you see I'm a gun loving conservative trade union member\nThere are many of us out there we should be quietly among ourselves about America's current issues are rights with the left is doing to America however\nWe also hear what are the loving conservative Republican Party hates our right to collective bargaining for retirement healthcare and for a great wage\nWith that great wage I pay for without government help my son's college and for my latest firearms mark we're put between a rock and a hard place when there are politicians out there that will support my right to collective bargain but nothing else I stand for you mean the Democrat\nSo if there is a politician that will stand up for my Second Amendment right to my right to collective bargain I'll give him a second thought for my vote\nIt's the same issue I have with my conservative brothers on the radio embraced the union Brotherhood regardless of the leadership and see how many more votes will come to the right side gun rights union Brunner thank you wow that's a great email for lots of different reasons here's my response sit down and talk to\nThe politician that has the our next to them\nThat you think doesn't support your right to collective bargain I think what you're gonna find is if you're being sold a bill of goods by big money packs and a Democrat Party trying to scare you away from I've never met a Republican politician that hated\nA trade union member hey here's a motto I Love this right skilled labor isn't cheap cheap labor isn't skilled\nI Believe that with all my heart I Know lots of people in the trades and there's truth to that\nThe unions have changed over the years the guy did battle with the Teamsters way back in the day I'm Talking about the mid eighties early eighties when I first got out of college and went to work for a trucking company it was a non union company it was over like transportation but I later took a position in the late eighties in Philadelphia tough union\nTown which St john's very trucking member St john's very trucking some of you probably do some of you might even remember their motto but Satan outlet you sent me an email market armed American radio dot org if you remember scenes on various motto I'll be more than happy to read it on the air but\nThey were union Kerry and it was a real culture shock for me to go from a non union carrier to a union carrier\nI read and it was propaganda coming to these drivers in the form of the teams are magazine every week I read this stuff and say we're in the world is coming from because I was management had grievances she filed on me before\nI did the whole mediation thing and rooms I I I did I went toe to toe with the shop for me because I Would go out riding with the drivers and I get a star and yell and before when I don't you touch any free if you touch any freight you're taking a man's job\nWhen in reality every driver I ever went with as soon as we got in the truck and started move because you are gonna help me out right\nIt was propaganda now a lot has changed since those days but a lot has changed since those days but here's my suggestion don't believe what you see at the top go sit down and make an appointment and talk to that representative whether it's local\nWhether it's your congressman state or federal whether it's your senator make an appointment when they're in the district and talk to them about your concern I think you'll be very very surprised at what you hear\nPeople have to tow the line politically we're witnessing that right now with Kevin Oh by the way funny how we're not talking about Kavanaugh today right that's by design will probably take that conversation up again on friday\nBut I Know a lot of politicians letter writer you don't put your name on so I can address you by name and I won't give your email address out obviously so I just want to say that again there's a lot of meat to this I Wish I had more time to cover this you say there are many of us out there oh I Know there are\nBelieve me I Know there and I understand\nThe rock and a hard place that you might find yourself in and I also know that you speak quietly quietly among yourself because I get lots of emails like this believe it or not you talk about current issues you talk about what the left is doing to America with some how you feel that I've got a vote this way\nFor this very reason no I don't know who the politician as you're talking about I don't know where you live\nSo it's hard to address it specifically if you want to write me back and let me know those things I Would be more than happy to carry on a really nice private conversation with you and I'm gonna betcha I'll bet you ten bucks on national radio that we can fix\nWhatever perception or problem there is\nIf we get our heads out of the media does I Know you're a gun lover and guess what I Believe based on what I read here and how I read it you don't want anybody taking your firearms either\nAnd you know it's interesting I've never met a Republican that wants to take away your wage too is that you make less money take away your health care and harm your family I've never met a Republican that wants to poison your drinking water and everything else but Democrats say but I'll tell you one thing\nToday [noise] fifty two possibly\nWe have Joe mansion comes to his senses he will be confirmed tomorrow if\nHe doesn't he wrote should he be what eight hundred and five two oh one two three four only women\nWho are first time callers are invited to call me only women who are first time caller is what do you think about Brett Kavanaugh

Washington Post report cabinet members closer to Senate confirmation that you have the argues FBI\nReport exonerate the judge that the New York times set it moves towards friday showdown vote by Nicholas Sanders hadn't Cheryl gay Stoltenberg does not make any predictions I have no protection\nI have no idea I Believe that to\nThe fore center as we do not know about our Jeff Flake Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski in Joe mansion most confident of Jeff Flake I have told you all along is that good and decent man he weighs is\nHe is reviewed all the information he thought the the investigation as good as its Susan Collins the sources of my optimism but we don't know\nAssume they are listening women what do you want them to know\nBecause yesterday for example Easter Murkowski to her credit for many hours with one hundred women from Alaska I assume that most of them were against Colorado not no I wasn't in the room\nA lot of people are assuming things they do not know and I don't like that all I Know is what you tell me I Know that caller's did the show showed up in the New York times today they shut up in the u._s._a. today today cited as evidence that\nThere are many many women out there who want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed for many many different reasons so I'd like to add to that evidence jury trial one eight hundred five to a one two three four by begin by

Atlantic city council where he had been hired as the fire chief because he led they wrote a men's Bible study that's actually true and she Cochran says that's when he turned the alliance defending freedom\nNo American should live in fear or be fired because of what they believe it's unjust and it is unconstitutional my attorneys\nSome of the alliance defending freedom and its he has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on my behalf to vindicate than God given freedoms every American his guarantee on the United States Constitution and the federal law\nDefending cheap Cochran defending jak Philips defending Baron I'll start spend all of them and you when your turn comes in the barrel the alliance defending freedom will be there for you there is no better group to support and there is no
