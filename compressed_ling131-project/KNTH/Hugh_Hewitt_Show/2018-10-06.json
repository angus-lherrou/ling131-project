is everywhere on the on your smartphone on ice on 'em and I are radio oh this is ... the answer [noise]\n\nTomorrow tomorrow's\nA scheduled final vote on the Kavanaugh nomination this will be the vote the up or down vote\nOn whether or not judge Kavanaugh a becomes justice Kavanaugh you need fifty one votes the vice president came cast the fifty first vote if necessary there was concern that one Republican sitter had a daughter's wedding to attend a tomorrow he made clear\nA sitter days that he will fly back to Washington DC tomorrow evening if necessary to be the vote 'em to be that fifty or fifty first vote so that is no longer a a really a concern\nI let me say this before we get into kind of all of the what ifs as well\nI told you yesterday that and again they're not related to the Democrats they only had one ... ... ... all the rest including some who are facing very tough political battles in states Donald Trump won the Republican traditionally win state wide and\nUm they just all the bug Joe Manchin decided to vote against cloture\nAnd let me read some of these topics that came out member of the word temperament I said listen for that from Democrats here senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota she's a no vote now she was one that used to be that group of five to ... talks about always the word potential a vote for judge Kavanaugh no longer now\nShe says last Thursday's hearing called into question judge Kavanaugh's Kurt temperament she's voting no\nThe Washington Post editorial board which is no surprise opposing judge cabinet and calling for a no vote or said that his judgment and temperament would be a doubt the New York times just comes out and calls him a jerk seriously that's the\nTerm they usually call judge Kavanaugh a jerk sitter Feinstein says that he's angry anti ... and and the aggression so talk to you about to permit she didn't use the word\nBut Senator Schumer did question the confidence to judge Kavanaugh has the temperament Senator Durbin um uh it's asked me put on the ... how could you trust his temperament\nCenter Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama\nAre showing a temper methods of becoming a judge and Senator Patrick Leahy a he has neither the judgment or the temperament that is just a sample again they're not going to let up on this folks I fix it does seem to be made very clear to you that we have a time period here it's more than twenty four hours for like thirty hours\nWhere people like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins a A R going to be under immense pressure as well as Joe mansion\nOr from both sides but especially the left right now who is flooding the offices in Washington DC and obviously did have an impact on these past ... so they they it is said\nUm I think with the white Lisa Murkowski explained she was the only Republican to vote no on culture is she decided that she was walking into the Senate chamber or right before we went on the air they had that vote that are those protesters did have an impact\nSo I don't think they can impact every senator I think that they probably don't have as much of an impact and stuff like Joe Manchin of West Virginia especially with its Hollywood liberals protesting but they did on in Alaska Senator\nSenator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski now the big question of today is what will Joe Manchin say\nWhat will um what will Susan Collins say she's are scheduled a press conference and we'll just like say anything or do we go into tomorrow it it really still not have a clear indication that the votes are there for\nBrett Kavanaugh saying right before I get to the phones I just want to make it kind of clear to people you need fifty one votes\nUm he got that today the gift to cloture if those votes held he would be confirmed without the need for the vice president he could lose one more and the vice president could be the fifty first so\nYeah that's right joined in fact if everybody votes as they did today the way this would probably go down as the vote tally would probably actually be fifty to forty nine because Steve Danes will not have you back in Washington DC now now you're absolutely correct he said\nIf his vote is needed he will fly back in time to cast it so if you play that hypothetical out so you did you know Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Joe Manchin\nA flip to know the final tally when it is initially taken will probably be forty nine to fifty but they won't close that vote Jordan and in in that scenario you would see Steve Gaines get on a plane to come back from Montana and at the same time the vice president would have to make its way\nOut to the Senate chamber so if everybody votes as they did today I expect it would be a fifty to forty nine confirmation and if you see the tally a sort of come to a close at forty nine to fifty then it's going to be holed held open for several hours to get the Danes backdoor and all\nRight I don't want to put words in the city or college math but she's having this press conference which\nTo me is unique because she she indicated one way by voting yes on culture I think she could have let that stand but she decided to have a after do press conference than\nHypothetically you lose Susan Collins and if you assume that used to work ... that's what she could vote or you did have to rely on a job at should to save this combination\n[noise] yeah I I think that's perilous or Jordan I mean I Know there's a lot of reporting out right now the Joe Manchin has a pretty solid yes because of his race because of how popular judge Kavanaugh is an estate and maybe even some speculation of the party changing after the elections but Jordan\nThat's a very tenuous place for this nomination to be now I won't tell you that is absolutely impossible for that to happen\nBut look if you go down to the floor of the Senate and the final vote is forty nine to fifty and you're starting to fly Steve the Danes back from Montana like we just talked about and you're starting to bring the vice president over to cast a tie breaking vote can you can you imagine the pressure that would be an Joe Manchin during those hours while that vote was held open and the delay was\nHanging on his vote look it might happen\nBut that that is not the best path to nomination for judge Kavanaugh the best path to nominate a confirmation for judge Kavanaugh is to hold Jeff Flake to vote and hold Susan Collins vote and by the way during there there is some reporting coming out right now the Jeff Flake is Tovia orders that he's a yes on Kavanaugh unless something changes\nYeah and again the typical jeopardy you're saying but I mean right they can change or thirty hours of a debate right now it's just started last hour or so or Jeff Flake is a waiver yes uh but still is leaving it out there to be persuaded to vote against\nAh the nomination I did want to answer this one called the companies I think this may be a incorrect information may be some confusion with names as well or it's something that would be totally breaking news that has not to report it looks good Roberta in Colorado online for Roberta welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHigh if I heard correctly Cory Gardner\nNo and I encourage in Colorado and please call Cory Gardner ... office and encourage tend to vote yes cap now\nYeah I think that that's incorrect information he's a Republican from Colorado I think you might be confusing\nOr you're in Colorado but don't confuse the Cory there's also Cory Booker in New Jersey fan who is definitely a no vote but I've not got any Cory Gardner whether yes he was a yes vote on cloture he has not indicated all that he'd be in a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah I think he's a yes on final Jordan I mean there there there was some reporting last night that he was still undecided as of last night but he has since announced his vote so you're either there's some confusion with Cory Booker or\nMore maybe as thinking back to that story of last night you know there were there were several senators yesterday yeah that came out and sort of made their first public statements like Ben Sasse you know you had some problems with the process but his vote was never in debt and doubt and I think that's the category put Cory Gardner and I don't think he's somebody you have to worry about at this point\nYeah at that point if those votes started dropping a you've you've you've got the nomination is doomed\nUm so you know you've got to really be able to focus in\nOn these final hours and I wish we got some questions about these final hours to than we have to be the focus in these final hours uh because if you got everybody out there's potentially listen if they voted for cloture and that was their first kind of comment on it and they haven't been one of the people who have hung themselves out as I'm undecided throughout the whole process\nUm you know may have they said for the twenty four hours but then they voted\nOr you can't focus there because if you do focus they're literally that means you've got serious trouble with ... I don't think that's the issue right now I think the issue is these handful of senators but let me explain this up both Rhonda on Facebook who wrote and please explain the thirty our weight dawn on Facebook writes why can't they hold the final votes day than [noise]\nWas not about the allegations\nThat temperament and as I read to you I was told yesterday listen for the words to prevent it appears in all these no votes\nStatements city that senator Heidi Heitkamp which I think she's good by North Dakota or the Washington Post editorial board that says to vote no uses to prevent a New York times editorial board just called him a jerk a very very uh again very uh\n... it's ... just a bit of ... these are the kind of terminology at certified side uh angered aggression is how she explains Schumer uses temperament Durban uses ... Doug Jones in Alabama uses temperament so this Patrick Leahy plenty of others have as well as just kind of\nA sample for you as well this is a good ... what company from Facebook talked with Saudi and one eight hundred six eight four thirty one too that's one eight hundred six eight\nWe're three one was zero uh which stood on Facebook I'm surprised a sitter jokes from Alabama voted no on closer than Doug Jones just showed everybody that uh you could get an Alabama senator and a Democrat or that he is he's got to be voting with the Democratic party a so long as he's a U.S Senate\nYeah he's been showing that for a while and I mean honestly he was never really in play on this one and he's not been on play on a lot of key pieces of legislation as well as on the nation's um\nYou know I I guess I Would read the political tea leaves on that a little bit maybe Doug Jones doesn't think he has much of a chance for reelection so he doesn't have to play or to the base in Alabama I'm not quite sure but I Would just I Would just say this I don't think this is the first indication from Doug Jones I think this is a pretty much more of the same of what you've been getting from him since he's been in town not listen\nTo him today on CNN bite Nineteen\n\nThere you go for Doug Jones is the temperament issues phase three the question is is face three\nSuccessful [noise] it's a question because the cloture vote was so close to that is just the vote to allow a final vote\nAnd just because you vote to allow it up or down vote does not mean you also we're going to vote affirmatively for now many\nThe fish out of the first half hour that you should always allow it up or down vote 'em out but again this was fifty one forty nine back her second half hour on a second line\nJust simply conservative do not apologize for that we do not think our listeners suffer from talk radio fatigue they're energized deadly day\nWe always conservative we are ...

Democrats voted for cloture that was Joe mansion Lisa Murkowski is from a Republican from Alabama a from a Alaska and Joe Manchin is the Democrat from West Virginia\nWe're taking your phone calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to the final vote\nIs likely tomorrow evening I mean that's was scheduled for a Jeff Flake voted yes if you're wondering that on culture he said he's likely a yes vote 'em off the domination unless something changes so he's left to cap the ad out there who's in college was a yes vote as well\nUm she has a press conference scheduled for later today where it's reported\nThat she's going to announce how she will vote\nOn the confirmation or we can play off the Sears for you and we will throughout the second half hour of the broadcast as they had been a joy to be a from Washington DC I Do want to get right to the phones people have already been hold on for a half hour a Andy calling from Missouri on line three Eddie welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nYes how are you doing today hey Andy I'm enjoying it I'm enjoying your program which I got the whole hour here but real quick my father and my question regards if Kevin uh it was voted down tomorrow\nOr looking ahead to Monday morning I'm my thought is known Trump do you think he would just come right to the microphones Monday and say okay you didn't like the ... ... ... a woman to yeah to run for\nI think I think you know I don't want to think past this vote because I think judge Kavanaugh deserves to become justice capital I Hope he does become justice Kavanaugh for his family\nFor him up for our country or is this will philosophy a and a and I so I I for and it's you know for those reasons that's my personal opinion so I don't really want to look past that\nUp but I Am also a political realist if this is a a nomination that have the balance could go either way these six thirty hours certainly um and we have to do before that exactly um or how they come down I don't speak to the White House will take a long time and announcing if they had to\nBut again I don't think we ought to bid to leak go there yet I'm sure that they are prepared because there could be more victim they're already preparing for\nPotential for more vacancies on the Supreme Court during the Trump presidency during the first herb even potentially so they're ready ah always with a ... they have to be a things happen\nUm and so because of that they're they are always ready their lifetime appointments but no one does get a sometimes justice retire\nSometimes to pass away while they're still serving and sometimes it's unexpected Li like in the case of of Justice Scalia one hundred sixty four thirty one tenth we do have a couple of lives that we just got opened by taking some phone calls early in the second half hour if you want to talk to us on the air one eight hundred six eight for\nThree one zero that's one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenth said um\n[noise] we have a press conference coming out from Susan Collins we're waiting to see if Joe mansion issues are the kinds of statements um\nPeople can follow me on Twitter for that it will be you know and it was not tweeting on the hearing involving the allegations of making statements about that I Am on to come down to a political vote to things like that if it doesn't happen while we're on the air it's certainly the final vote will happen tomorrow but they\nWere just briefly we go to this break out competed should capital supporters be right now\nOh I think they got what they want it today Jordan I mean it was a third of four votes he needed on the floor of the Senate I think they'll feel a lot better after Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins go down to the floor as part of this final debate and announced their position assuming it's a yes\nOr but look I think he set it up right I mean this is a margin that really hang on one Republican right now because of one Republican were to flip Jordan or then it all hang on a Democrat and I don't think a judge Kavanaugh supporters would feel comfortable in that scenario\nFolks we will continue taking phone calls we come back [noise]\nAm ten Seventy the answer [noise]\nIs a critical time for a nation on hand for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work going to be American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ACL Jane were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family [noise]\nDefending human like standing up for a good friend Israel\nWorking to uncover the deep state so massive corruption in Washington battling to end the genocide of Christians in many parts of the world\nAnd the firm commitment to constitutional efforts to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorists [noise]\nYou can learn more about the mission and work in B.

I Believe the allegations against him were not since they were all totally uncorroborated but\nPicking sides there did either way he just doesn't have the temperament and uh uh\nThat's what's come out from Washington Post your time's a Heidi Heitkamp a senator from North Dakota Democrat a Democrat Senator Feinstein Democrat Senator Schumer Durban Doug Jones or a lay he and there are there are certainly more\n[noise] but Janice on Facebook writes in that they keep talking about judicial temperament\nBut capital wasn't being attacked as a judge he was being attacked as a person so he reacted like a person and he says that it is often\nA this was so when he was doing this or a primary for his parents for his wife and primarily for his eye as his children as well as daughters as well so let's go right to the phones a lot of calls to get through\nWas going to go right to invite order of those who have been holding the longest surely Michigan on line one surely walk the J you'll live\nHigh voltage or long before um I think we all need ...\nFair for just cabin out but for those that are taking a vote it's awful we'll have to have the courage that they're going to take the thoughts that we will turn number to pray for them but my question is um if\nHe is voted for him with the swearing in ceremony be Sunday so he can immediately start at the court on Monday or what they have to wait for any length of time to swear you know\nSo say it can happen is as quickly as as a I mean you get to vote and you can have the swearing in um the uh you can kind of have the formal or a swearing in done very quickly what was it that you know immediate time period on Sunday and then they can be more and more formal kind of ceremony even after that\nYeah I think it would happen virtually immediately Jordan I mean I think he would be over at the court on Sunday whether or not the swearing in ... or Monday morning I he's confirmed by the Senate Jordan he's going to go to work immediately\nSo yeah so just to answer your question very quickly sure it happens immediately what you would likely be a kind of a small quick of it\nAnd then there would be a kind of a larger of it we're friends and family go um uh that's been the case for other nominees are up but they start to work immediately states it back to the phones we go Stewart in New York on line three Stewart welcome to Jason you'll live\nHigh um thank you for a while you do extra up your support of Israel or my question is and the tortillas Brett Kavanaugh has been a judge has his temperament that they've been in this you\nKnow me he got the highest rating you can get stored for baby a the American bar association which is very far to the left politically by the way but when they they they ah look at these judges they look at the kind of what how how they conduct themselves it's not really supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about judicial philosophy um and he got the highest\nRanking you can from uh the American bar association well qualified so that again there's been no issues about judicial\nTemperament you can disagree with his judicial philosophy but no issues about judge Kavanaugh's temperament at all are brought up personal on the bench at work or throughout his career\nFor big a judge or the twelve years he has served on the bitch back to the phones or we go mark is in California on line to Marcus welcome to Jay secular life\nThanks for taking my call\nPartner caught me Eric I'm right now there's they talk they attacked him saying he ... he got off the field basically\nThat is that is that basically it was it was at least a attempted rape or you know a ... a assault mean series he's serious crimes who's accused of markets\nWith no core operation or even after another FBI airport no core operation no one will lead to even say you know say that they they even heard about this ever occurred\nWell those were attacked first\nYeah well listen I mean this is this is it's politics\nI'm at the temperament issue again if it was just there next line of attack she used to a agree to be on the court I mean they actually say that\nIt's too angry too much aggression to be on the court that that was not him as I get the city of ... of judicial philosophy there defending himself there's a big difference uh back to the phones we go stand in Nevada on life for staying welcome to Jay Sekulow live [noise]\nI I maybe I missed this earlier but I guess I Need a lesson on representative form of government I cannot in my mind that magic a summer like Heidi Heitkamp Joe Manchin who have insurance went overwhelmingly for just for one for one direction\nTo even consider the other I mean are we sending people to Washington to do what they want to do on their own or they want people to\nWashington Democrats red state Democrats are going to get through with talk\nThat never really became an action that was catching up to a job at this vote than I think that at a race was getting just as getting a bit too tight\nAnd the Democratic party moving a bit too far to the left so that he couldn't talk with no action just didn't really work it but it ... it's been okay for them Heidi Heitkamp types of North Dakota of all places I think she's given up\nBy there should be what I think that she's dead now I don't think that's right because she does represent constituents like a standard set but uh but but say that I think for the Joe Manchin types of likely the party's moved so far to the left\nThat uh he's tried to talk like a moderate but not actually vote like a modern didn't work and now we're seeing potentially Im sorry devotes a light the moderate he says he is\nI think this is one of the main reasons that Heidi Heitkamp race is basically lost for her Jordan I mean look the numbers for judge Kavanaugh in North Dakota in West Virginia are basically identical he has a thirty percent approval rating up plus thirty pursue a percent approval rating in both of those states something like sixty two thirty\nIn each of those states Heidi Heitkamp is a new one judge Kavanaugh and she's getting beat\nA rather resenting lead by Kevin Cramer or then you look at Joe a mansion and he's going to vote yes for judge Kavanaugh or at least ... he's a voted yes on cloture and he holds you know roughly a six to eight percent lead a they're in West Virginia and I'll look it is voting record as you said your and it's been somewhat mixed\nBut the fact that he has voted with his constituents more often than Heidi Heitkamp I think that's why he's still competitive in West Virginia while she's getting beat rather resenting lead\nAll right I I think we can take these final to cause of the day remember the Kavanaugh a final vote or on up or down is scheduled for tomorrow evening and as soon as the college has got a press conference scheduled for this afternoon I ended up maybe something for Joe mansion as well cared at New York on line five Kerry welcome to Jay struck you alive\nThanking God Bless you for all the Indian and my question is when someone calls in the Senate or Congress in ... I didn't they extrapolate that one phone call to be representative of more people like your one caller may be representative of how thirty people in your state\nIf there were there flooded by this day they take note kind of a fan of ... as best they can now where they start getting flooded in running to voice mail you got thirty hours to go through thousands of calls but as best they can like kind of the calls it favor yes or no\nYeah I think the short answer to that is yes Jordan I heard from a U.S senator yesterday who said he had six thousand calls on the nomination in a period of twenty four hours it's a pretty good sign of them but it's important to voters\nAlright folks so let's just explained it for a very quickly we got forty seconds left follow me on Twitter Twitter dot com slash towards the secular\nSusan Collins has a press conference scheduled for later today uh she said she will announce that press conference it's being reported at least how she'll vote on the nomination Jeff Flake says he's probably yes vote or unless something changes so again\nI Wonder about a a lot of men worrying about what they may may put on\nSocial media in the pasture Ashley may have made it someone you know innocent pass somebody's will I'm going to try and see whether she's known for its right some sort of the\nSame thing is when you go to a party or you go out to a restaurant and bar and there's a dance floor and there is no one on the dance floor and then all of a sudden a couple of goes on the dance floor and then what happens\nBunch of other people go on the dance floor so that sort of what's happening here on my theory is that there's something called emotional contagion and so what ... is gate tea is we get a\nEmotional so I I don't know I could have a bad day and if you are my spouse that kid that emotional negativity you could ... um\nCouldn't get it contagious like a virus or a bacterial infection and so what's happening is if you're very emotional about something in may trigger\nSome bury a severe memories that you may have had a that you were you were repressing so for a cause this repression and then all of a sudden you go to a therapist and you you you remember all this stuff well what Elizabeth Loftis is finding out is that these memories that we stuff\nThat we may remember things we don't remember them do like a video and so they're like a wicked ... which means that\nI can change them you can change them or they can be totally false now doesn't mean online J. P.\nSo I really believe that he's memories and it's very scary because they're they're doing studies and they've been doing studies since the seventies\nAbout how these memories are these eyewitnesses you can't really count on eyewitness testimony\nYou know I think that's especially true or when it's a ... across racial lines of eyewitness testimony I saw this prime robbed the bank and a lotta times people don't do very well with people of a different race and that's not necessarily partners it's just the way we're wired I think\nIt's the it's the way we're wired it also has to do with our upbringing and has to do with uh our our culture and it has to do with our our beliefs\nAnd so everybody's perception and it was just talking this morning about that so if I saw something happened\nMy memory is going to be different than your memory J. P. when you're a guy [laughter] you know men think different than women and your your background my background is going to be different the way my parents raised me my moral character is going to be different all that it's going to affect\nHow I perceive something and then to remember it is just going to depend on how my brain as compared to yours and miss memories\nThe longer that you have had something happen but once you get or we're not right I mean if I asked you\nHey J. P. do you remember when you were in first grade and you had a teacher a and I could I your first grade teacher do you remember what her name was there were a member of the classes that you took your going to probably say no\nOther you might remember her name\nWhen you know I look back in my past just exactly as you're saying\nAnd I remember something in my wife who sometimes shows are very clear memory you know that is what happened at all been wrong and you know we pursued a little bit more ... you know my memory was wrong or right I think that happens all the you know go back to the or maybe it was in the eighties and nineties when\nThis whole movement was a four to a\nTalk show about being abused by grandparents or their daycare workers or their parents or whatever and you don't want to preserve the stuff from a child's memory you put ... [laughter] right right how would a child get it right\nRight and that's go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo that's fine you're you're on\nI was gonna say that that's where Elizabeth Loftis came in\nAnd she has studied this uh since the Nineteen seventies but in the Nineteen nineties what you're talking about with repressed memory and I don't want to say too much negativity because I'm a therapist these therapists though we're taking these clients and not meaning to distort their memory\nBy but by the way that they were getting these clients to recollect memory they were put in a little bit of biased us and them and said this was causing people to go in counseling with one memory and coming out with another\nAnd so she started doing studies\nAnd there was a study done in two thousand four team this was in her study\nFound three hundred defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do because\nThree fourths of them\nWere committed out of faulty eyewitness memory so it's very scary that this can happen to these people spent time in jail tend to Thirty years and because of the DNA testing they were proven that it was incorrect so it's a very important to realize that\nMemory is constructed and can be reconstructed and people just need to be educated out there that just because you hear somebody J. P. sane sane something very passionate and and and being very factual that does not necessarily mean that is\nTotally true or is that it's true at all yeah so this is very scary what's going on and ah and you're seeing a lot of this with a sexual harassment and this is a touchy subject because a lot of these people probably have been sexually harassed or or um had been raped but not by the person\nThat they are accusing\nThere and you never know how somebody may um wow she would say overreact to something that happens you know young teenage years uh I don't remember stuff I did that I Wish\nI had become part but everybody does I don't know\nI don't remember anything [laughter]\nSports fans\n[laughter]\nAnyway so so what happens is people don't talk about it and they don't remember it and so therefore when somebody else says oh I went to this party and so and so was there and he was drinking a\nMember of that so that\nThat could have been a faulty memory 'cause how do you know that person remembered it correctly\nYeah and then when you put politics into the middle of this I think you go to an attorney you go to a therapist in if they are now of the same political ilk that you are\nAnd ah there's an opportunity to go there as we have today and I'm not saying anything specifically are about the current case but for the last uh as you indicated that a therapist can\nPush my memories of different dimension and\nCome out and wanting to know weed out or sometimes with with me\n[laughter] well when you get to the police if you have a line up they've done a study where if you have a line up and then you imply that the the crook is all in the lineup that person will pick somebody out\nThere are a lot of whether or not yeah exactly do they yeah well if you have any\nStudies where she had people look at videos and car wrecks and ah if she said that they will uh how fast are they going ah in this in this rack when this person hit this person a person's\nAh says no one speed and then if you change it to say that ah when this percent smashed into this car that person uh the the people would say that they went faster than if they just\nHad the wreck so it's any you know just words can influence our memories\nThe way we pick out from our head so it's just we just need to take it with caution and realized that if somebody says something just like you said that that's just somebody's accusation and it needs to be proven proven by other\nThings that are you know DNA testing or other witnesses or a\nYou know some real substantial evidence\nSuch talk a little bit about those rare occasions when really use a false accusation with mal intent\nOf those do happen when your quest for money I Know um I heard the name of Reno on Fox News the other day talking about having been in the press office at the White House with President Bush but they used to get calls all the time from somebody accusing the president of\nA vote raping them or doing something like that and it was just a quest for money they just they just want to do a book\nAnd that these things do happen and I'm just thinking about\nThe the parents who have kids all some college or even high school for that matter worried about their sons being accused of my daughters are not being believed because of this whole controversy that goes on when they when they should be or wherever we go with this this is turmoil upside down for our criminal justice system it seems to me\nIt it is and it's very scary for young kids and I said especially for the young boys that are out there it's changed the dynamic so J. P. that if you think about it if you were in that position\nWhere you are you're a man so that you would be extra cautious so my advice to parents is to educate but it's the the females and the males on what what is going on talk to them about boundaries and ah\nI I'm going to tell you when my son was younger this will be for any of this stuff happened and he was in high school and I told him I said Taylor do not ever I\nWe talked about sex very openly and I said the one thing I said people usually in high school you're not really emotionally and intellectually equipped to have sex\nYou know some of it for the chronicle and headline was vote no on property and insist on a real lock box for flood control funding for all that and then like don't touch hot items like common sense right and you know\nBut but you know you've got the same cabal of special interests that are down there supporting proposition I because they all make money off of it and it's a slush fund for the mayor to use every wants to and you've got you know I let me tell you what\nWe we need to spend the morning and talked about campaign contributions at the city of Houston something needs to be done to reform the system because special interests are absolutely running city hall for their benefit right now we've got to do something to step in and make sure the average\nVoter the people in spring branch whose houses get flooded every time they come to rain or in Milan where we need to make sure the ... he's working for them and not the special interest that fund these campaigns\nWell there's no right to work with the city and you have a business uh you want to keep that contract alive and well right send that\nPromise you they ... they look I used to I used to have a business had had government contracts all of the country and you get calls a day late from people pushing the armed why aren't you show up my birthday party and by the way the brain will campaign contribution I sure would be nice got those calls all the time\nIt's amazing the shakedown oh and that's one of the cities in the sheep is it is okay in terms of growth folks in terms of traffic the mess from the Galleria through the highways are these scandals and the city hall something's got to be done something's got to\nKnow your to see the campaign contributions to the landowners long post Doug that we're promoting this ridiculous boast or this bustling project compared to\nWhat's going to have a real quick question on that that\nI'm not in among the transportation business I'm not an engineering business I'm just in the business\nA that is the worst thing you putting a bus line\nThe Galleria expecting people to ride that when they find the numbers crash right when they find the numbers rise nobody who shopping together is going to stand outside\nFrom may to October waiting for a bus okay through the summer with the range in the new humidity women are not going to go in and whatever ... ... be playing this rap the damn thing would play plants and that's when they look\nThe [noise] I I you have to look at what happened with the light rail which meant two billion dollars on the light rail overall trained to ship broader ship is down um you know the um\nUh the the the broader ship projections for white relevant cut and cut and cut and they're still not making them\nAnd so what do we do they put a plan to do more like braille amazing I mean it's just ... there's a religious belief in these projects that justify any kind of you know true in a statistical analysis or financial\nNow like and if they looked at it like a business bill and said hey we're going to increase our\nNobody nobody would invest their own money and that's their own like unless your money in other people's money\nOPM baby OPM your bath or different bilking you've given by the Houston Chronicle\nEditorial Romano on prop hey vote no on ... don't forget that day and that was ...

McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even\nThe little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr paint is this going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right at a doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel that she has the muscles get an artery oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles\nIn and around your digestive tract ... these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit and your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and\nIt has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYes and it does build your teeth\nBut he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... orbit back from the bones if ... that's right I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the counting from the bones instead of frozen nitrogen\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yet because things like pastures Asian\nFoods are irradiated um the calcium at least from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food started writer right but these things don't absorbing the body that's out there for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... like a Tums first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself has that been absorbed\nBy sea because it has to be in a in an as an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy combat formula it's natural and the differences that isn't a powder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead
