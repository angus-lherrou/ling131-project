exclamation points on anything we talked about um it'd be so easy to keep you want to hear just go another hour to start getting angry mark on you know\n[laughter] well you know I think you kind of a force shattered it a bit every ball and watched their legislature\nAnd every state that has a preemption I think that is the new tactic why why why go after semi auto is where I go after ammunition or standard capacity magazine they're going right through the jungle or by going through going for preemption I think that will be a new tactic so everyone needs to be aware of that and\nBe watching out for that\nThis is just government run amok in your face is what it is let me give you an example the\nState of Georgia where I reside\nJuly first governor deal Republican sign this no texting no phone hands free phone deal it is illegal for me to touch my telephone it cannot be on any part of my body at all while I'm driving a vehicle\nPeriod I I Can't rested on my leg after ticket can't have it between my legs under my crush or my style I'm driving up the ticket I\nCan't pick it up or move and put it in the consul I Can't touch it on the console if it's on a little hook thing\nUp on the dashboard I'm not allowed to touch it with my fingers however I can touch the radio screen next to it and I can change the radio dial and I can turn my air conditioner fan on and off and I can turn it down or I can turn it can do whatever I Want\nIn my own car I can reach for a soda and drink it while I'm driving I can go through a drive through in order fifty hamburgers and eat all of them on my way to tamp if I Want to\nI can touch anything else on the phone I can look back and yell at my kids if I Want to but I Can't touch my damn phone\nAnd that's a state law and I get a ticket I Can't even touch the navigation scream a screen on it while I Move you know\nLet me tell you something at some point in time governments in your face get outta my car get off my phone if I Want to use my phone I Will because now if somebody's gonna come out and say texting and driving kills people it does but what I don't need as the government taking my rights and we and privileges away from me because I Can't talk to what you do is\nYou go after you put you put a campaign out much like we did was seatbelts right you can't run a shame that people who do those things that are getting people killed to the point where when somebody else sees you they hit their horror and they do whatever it is but you don't tell me I Can't touch my phone 'cause I'm going to touch my phone I'm telling you that right now\nIf I have to use ways I've used it a number of times I'm going to use it\nAnd no state law going to stop me from doing that it's just the way it is wow I'm such a bad person I just had to get that off my check to make myself feel better\n[laughter] but this is\nThe same type of thing this is preemption a little local town filled with a bunch of people who for whatever reason never made it where they wanted to make it in life who just want to be a pain in whatever to everybody else and run their life and so you can't carry that got in my part\nAbsolutely ignoring the stupidity of what it's like when you have a state concealed carry license that allow somebody to carry throughout the state that now has to worry about Seventy five different counties and they're dopey little lost the absurdity of it as insane because that's what's gonna happen\nPeople are going to do like I Do with my phone in my car they're going to carry their gun anyway and they're not going to worry about it what am I missing\n[noise] no I think he nailed it especially when you brought up a choice I mean what was the only people on the age away boards or people without enough to do and it's it's just like these little municipalities you know they gotta they gotta\nTinker around almost sort of non suitable word [laughter] they've got to take her because they got nothing better to do [noise]\n[noise] yeah it's crazy people tell you look I'm not telling people to violate the law I don't text and drive why because it's dangerous\nI Know that I don't eat the steak signing a piece of paper telling me that I don't\nText and drive it's it's very difficult to do I don't know how people do this but it is mind boggling you drive by I got a truck I stood up higher I look down and I see people doing it all the time\nThey're on they're holding the phone with the steering wheel and they're texting away with their thumbs down a ... billion miles a minute and inevitably every one of ... kind of words over to you at which point I Love your lawn in my truck is scaring the crap out of them\nAll right but that's unfortunate that that to to me that's just another example of government and the way\nWhen it shouldn't be we we we shouldn't need a law to tell us not to do that okay\nBut nonetheless that's a I call that a that's an H always type law are evil people we you know even exist in this world I Know you know\nI Do [noise] it's really bad how evil people can be isn't it\nYes trust me it it it is\nYou understand that so you carry a gun for your own self defense because he will exist and you understand that an accepted that right correct\nYou also know that evil will bite you went it chooses not when it's going to say to you would give you advance warning I'm going to bite

S.\nThe media three kill him like the way they treated Morocco bottle when he ran for president to them he is a messianic that you're about to say Floridians\nWhatever happened to ideas the answer is Democrats have run out of ideas at least ideas that work and so they focus on other things that have nothing to do with individual lives wake up Florida I'm Cal Thomas\nWhere every copy of today's commentary visit health on this stuff come or white as it used to media ... bucks thirty seven thirty reporting the Largo, Florida we review of resented that view about thirty seven thirty three forty key Largo Florida we three zero reason\nAs a budding and subject you're ... we'll get to value the media hopes of horror\nThey go down this commentary fighting back against tyranny of the radical left this is the Big Ten Seventy me as\nThe other way\nBudget American diet and make sure that the senators out that one third of the Democrats in the Senate support Bernie Sanders was and I read too I'm\nI'm the remarks of Mr Smith from the Massachusetts ratification convention on January twenty fifth Seventeen eighty eight Mr Smith rises and Mr President I Am a plane man\nUh get my living by the plow I'm not used to speak in public but I beg your lead to say a few words to my brother plowed joggers in this house\nAnd it goes on to say that when I saw this constitution I found that it was a cure for these disorders it was just such a thing as wanted\nI got a copy and I read it over and over I had been a member of the convention a former on state constitution and learn something of the checks and balances the power and I found them all there and I did not go to any lawyer to ask his opinion we have no lawyers in our town and we are do well enough without I for my own opinion and I'm pleased with this constitution\nThat so the Democratic impulses and the jokes about what's that say eight thousand people those conventions that ratified this that kind of\nAbsolutely and the conversation that you and I are having who is exactly what I Want\nDialogue argument that you and I would disagree about originalism ... and the constitution\nAnd doing so in a coat your way yeah and ... and that was such a divided people now we're all living in our own little apps on our own little bubble and the ability to reach across the space between us and have a coherent argument is and he's actually what I'm trying to do in the book\nOr the word that public historians come in like you and and Doris Kearns Goodwin on earlier this week and I've got General McChrystal coming on public history as you say it expands your memory it gives you a longer memory and dust better arguments what'd you picked up a couple of minutes to tell me tell you audience why it's so important that they read popular history\n[noise] well I think that they should read his feet that can speak it beyond the ... that the categories that academic sometimes occupy outlook on a card carrying the story of a bad and the other end up ... we'll end and\nUh and too many historians are only writing to each other and uh they've created narrower and narrower definitions of American history\nOr the amount of the the Americans who couldn't even past the civics test that a new a new immigrants to America has to pass his is astounding and\nYou're right it does expand our memory back in time and ways that\nAllow us to have perspective on ourselves\nUh that uh that we all know that when we get older we look back of our lives and um so what you're doing now is what we need to do more and the historical literacy of the population will allow us I think to break through the kinds of cross that ...\nI and I think that is actually I read David Brooks piece earlier this week the rich white civil war most of the anger comes from a person on the left and six percent on the right and if those fourteen percent cannot\nDestroy the conversation for the eighty five percent of us who want to have that and to move the ball forward I don't think you\nKnow the times I get pessimistic and uh I'm a realist and I'm ... I mean when you get on the Internet and listen to what people are saying you you it's hard to believe in what they call the better angels of our nature and I'm a and so which is like yours are helping us to recover the\nEnd of ... and I really do think that\nIn the in the end argument is the answer um it's it's not that that that's what the constitution really is it's a framework to argue it it doesn't it doesn't provide you with a clear set of answers it provides you with the ... which we argue and each generation needs to be able to do that all the time terms\nAnd Madison's example is I think maybe the best because he's not gifted as Hamilton is with charisma or physical side he hasn't got Washington's rectitude ... are alleging but he just works at it he just works\nAt it every day because you have to pay any\nHe thinks like a lawyer even though he's unlike Hamilton or out others or jeopardy so he's not trained as a lawyer or he just thinks that way and um any you know he can change within his own mind of the building is sort of step on step across\n\nShe's now a matter of days before America decide who run the country for the next two years Republicans have benefited from having a Republican in the White House was losing the house or Senate\nThe country back to Libya wing lunatics can you see is booming economy do we need to keep up the jobs do we need to keep adding the rank judges who are going to do we need to keep spices on the run this one is too important to sit out am ... and the answer\nIs do you show on AM tends to be the answer\nMorning glory I'm Eric I'm\nOn to it and I no longer voice ... first play his pass over the land and the drugs are working\nGreat to be back from the relief factor dot com studios inside of the belt way and to welcome my first guest this morning\nFlorida's governor Rick Scott is calling in from the sunshine state governor Scott welcome in the first question is how is the recovery in the panhandle\nGoing\nWell that a lot of people working really hard uh we're down to about twenty three thousand or something morning\nOr good I had the better we're down to about twenty three thousand people without power right now homes and businesses that power so was ... on goal is to get most everybody back on that there'll be some pockets a few pockets left by um first of November the first part of next week's will work with our utility companies\nWe've had in the late National Guard a response I called the thousand numbers National Guard these communities don't ever go home and she'll can are so good\nSo we've got a lot of work to do a yesterday I was with vice president Pence which was a good day because he came down to announce that the president's committed to rebuilding Jindal air force base which is just\nTo the east of Panama City um that is a got a great military presence\nGot a two and a half billion dollar impact on our local economy there but of course about twenty thousand jobs so\nThat was a big deal we went to a church that was a providing\nA a really nice lunch to our National Guard the coast guard members and families from ten to ... so you know we're working hard every day and it's going to take a while um but\nFor the ... we've had these her Kansas or I had one last year we come back you we build stronger people love to live in Florida we got the nicest people helping each other down here and got so many people coming from all over the country a serving food helping people parks on their house it's a it's really nice\nYou know I've got a lot of support for team or a book on over the last couple of weeks here because they they go down and do the heavy lifting I'm sure you've run into him but that Kendall announcement is huge Chuck Todd and I were talking when the hurricane hit\nHow homestead never came back after Andrew twenty five years ago and sort of get the confirmation from the president the vice president D O D the turtle is coming back that's a big deal to everyone in that community\nIt's a big deal and the truth is they they need to come back a source of great military mission which we don't have drilling in the eastern half of the uh the eastern part of the Gulf there that allows\nA our military to test I'm test different um pieces of equipment they they can do a lot of training there which is where you know where the air force the navy that's where you're trained to learn to be a pilot\nAnd so they can do it and I interrupted by a commercial activity there so it's it's an important a mission for the for the United states we have twenty military bases and reunify the man and\nAs governor I've tried to do everything it can to help them fulfill their mission and make sure all the military members enter veterans have all the resources they need to ... everybody want to live in the state\nNow governor Rick Scott let's turn to politics or I have heard it said that you would be running away with the Senate race but for the fact\nMichael wiped out the voting ability of many Floridians in the panhandle I read an executive order you sent out our ... going to be able to vote because they want to send you to Washington as their senator they really do want to replace Bill Nelson I Want to send you but they're going to be able to vote and you know there aren't any school to go to\nA huge ... what we've done is we had eleven counties impacted and some some impact a little bit less like a with the state capital is the ... county so we sat down with their supervisors election they were elected by county\nAnd we said how how can we work with you to make sure\nYou know people have the right to vote and they can get out there so you can vote by absentee or by mail um in our state um\nYou can do it by early voting and you can do it on election day and we've worked in every county to make sure that you can get out the vote what they did in Lake County which is Panama City they have five supervised election wanted to do there has to stop by big mega sites because that's what we got\nA more damage where there's a lot of people and so the supervisors doing of elections down there is doing\nTSA I'm just making sure everybody gets off the boat and and clearly you know campaigns will go and make sure people know where to vote because you know you what happens a lot of people they wake up on election day say okay I'm going to go vote and they just go to the last place they voted on the last time and so\nThere are everybody's working hard to let people know that you might have to be going to a different place\nAnd so how do you feel about the campaign right now I I look at the CPI average three of the last four polls have you had but you're busy doing hurricane recovery it's not really campaign mode in Rick Scott style which is a hundred and ten percent or how you juggling the effect\nBut my first job is to take their I'm going to get on the governance okay like this and so that's what I've been doing\nMy wife has gone a campaign for me uh when I ... I wanted to run back and she says that score eight honey but I hate public speaking I'm scared to death well she's been given fortified speeches a day and then there's been a great job a so she's working there but here's what we're going to let\nIt actually becomes evident when you see so in her ... here's the difference between the two of us I've been in the panhandle and been in this county generally three or four counties today\nMy opponent did three or four days a photo ops and he said oh there's nothing else I can do I'm gonna go back to campaign he's a quicker and everybody knows that he doesn't want to work he's not a worker\nI'm I Am and so people see that and they're the reason we're going to win is they've watched for eight years but I sat there and every day whatever whether what everyone is going on I showed up and did my job should have said\nHe can't he actually won an added up saying one thing he's\nDone nothing on education nothing on the environment and that's enough transportation there's one thing and it's become evidence and so he's the biggest example of why we have terminal he's been on that theme in forty two years in ... in public office\nForty two years wow yeah and and the whole astronaut thing I actually thought he was an astronaut until someone informed me that he hitched a ride on the shuttle because he's on appropriations I really didn't think he was an answer I ... I think it's one of those things that gets into the public psyche\nAnd they think he went through the whole program and all that stuff and I'm just amazed that this is my living right I don't know that so Governor Scott what what's your agenda going to be in D.C what do you want to bring to DC\nWell here's here's will give you and I'll give you a Y. two K. I grew up in a family I don't know my dad was a dumb public housing going up and I watch my mom's struggle with food on the table get healthcare it's all the struggles that people have so when I became governor\nMy goal was to say this is the three most important things to family one got a job\nAnd put to your children have to have a great education because that's a chance to live the dream and number three you got to live in a safe community how changes it a little bit when you go to Washington but it's the same thing what do we do to to make a con me better for everybody\nWhat do we do to have an education system and most of the education issues are going to be done at the state level and how do we keep people safe at the federal level more but it's going to be tied tied to the military\nUm and so my my gender age is is to think about every family and how you make every family in America in better position\nAnd so I think it's I think it's the ... at the federal level it's gonna be the economy and it's gonna be how do we make sure we defend the feelings of this country\nThat Governor I always tell people I Lived in California took two years ago I moved to Virginia to most diverse places in the country or Florida and California you got lots of demographics or it's even a greater ... parts of California the Central Valley not particularly diverse\nBut how do you but you did very well with the Cuban community the Latino community Puerto Rican community the African American community the or the Asian American community do very well in every community why is that\nI show up it's a simple as that uh I show up and I in my eyes I tell it was like\nI'm the sitting governor of the states I'm going to represent you I and so so in so I'm I'm going to focus on issues that are important to you I Know I Know for the Cuban their ... year yes you're is over with rock bottom up and sing and building also did with regard to Raul Castro\nIs good is waiting they're furious that their country has basically been decimated by by a\nMaterial and the Nicaraguan so furious will happen um with their take what he's killing peaceful protesters and then with regard to Puerto Rican when they had Maria I showed up the next eight times\nWe brought resources we brought 'em I sent them highway patrol vehicles National Guard um utility workers to show up and do your job and take care of everybody when you do people say look like I cares about me maybe perhaps\nWe could we could use that in some other campaigns Governor Scott it looks like you're surging it looks pretty good right now so last question what's your\nFeeling about between the last ... you know we've got ten days down now it's only ten days out\nOf Logan when we just got to get you know right now it's we've we've got her message out just to get people off because they know if everybody gets out both of them were going to have a we're going to have a big win because people know there is a big difference so\nThe packages it wasn't President Trump that's riding by Bernie Sanders for the guy who shot the baseball field it's all crazy to assert that sort of thing and it is important that people stop trying to assign blame and and I think average Americans just think it's silly\nIt's we don't know anything about who set this it's like I was abroad when Gabby Giffords was tragically shot my my friend got Bentsen was filling in for me that day and he he began a line that is used over and over and over again let's just wait for the facts\nAnd I I Am a hundred percent with him let's just wait for the fact uh instead of Jen Psaki with Jake Tapper yes they cut number four place\n\nAnd I also think that President George W. Bush would have done something different and President Clinton would have done something different and present aren't taste audience I should have done\nI think we're seeing here is there are moments that really has\nLeadership and whether they have the moral leadership\nIronically given his statement to leave the country and Donald Trump has failed repeatedly south when it came to Charlottesville he felt he has failed when it came to the hurricane and this is another failure to bring the country together\nPresident Obama certainly would have handled it definitely there are times when you put partisanship aside and you try to bring the country together it's not just missed opportunity and dangerous ... because they just escalating at us only probably going to get worse if he doesn't change this town\nHere I'm telling ya Democrats are going to go backwards because of this was just an issue that I Know that Trump got nothing to do with it and they just think to reach a deal so much about the media they certainly show [noise]\nYou're in the middle of a nonstop action packed information unless the huge us this coming right back [noise]\nWhen it comes to meat quality matters that's why I made the switch to butcher box but your boss ships free right to your door every month and their meat is guaranteed to be humanely raise no antibiotics or hormones ever what's your ... grass fed and grass finished their chicken is organic and free range\nTheir heritage pork is far from that other white meat and they saw us there from pigs raised you keep their fat and play with or whether it's supposed to be cuts in qualities that are impossible to find and stores butcher box also comes at a competitive price\nAnd get a month's worth of delicious meat from what your box for less than six bucks to mail you won't find any better deal on premium high quality meat like this anywhere else\nExperienced the butcher box difference for yourself is it puts your box dot com slash you can get twenty dollars off plus for a bank and I'm not that ... may get on your first by hurry up is offering assume that butcher box dot com slash year for twenty dollars off and pray bacon butcher box dot com slash you\nThis is a huge huge show [noise]\nSymbol lo J.
