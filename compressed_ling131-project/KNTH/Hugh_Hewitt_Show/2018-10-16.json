S. could pull the mayor of tombstone do hereby proclaimed that from this date forward tombstone shall be known as America's Second Amendment city\nIn full support of the declaration of independence and the constitution of the United states approved this temp day of January two thousand seven\nIn\nThe ... or dusted asking pulled them era when he was sitting here made a comment that\nI got to ask you about I didn't he didn't have enough\nTime because I knew the response would be a little bit longer than he had he mentioned that all went away back in Nineteen Seventy that they've talked about that was actually put it in this town by the ... seventies right\nBut you can carry a gun anywhere in town now question for you there used to be some businesses in town and I won't name them although I Know who they are it used to be you could check your firearm in this town at the ... shop across the street from a couple of places\nIf you wanted to carry a gun in certain places and I have done that before and I think it cost me like six box and I got to be honest with you I thought it was kind of cool that I was checking my guns are tombstone\nThe only thing on cool about that is having to check your guns in tombstone you see right there how both of those can you can you can say once cool\nOnes not but it's cool but it's not it's cool to school but it's not really cool but it's cool but it's not do those\nBusinesses now has there been a change since this proclamation that businesses allow UN with guns if it's legal in the state of Arizona am I making that did you is that question to that come out right\nYeah that's fine uh the most of the best of course I think all the businesses in Tucson support our Second Amendment and this proclamation um there's some of them to still allow that um but I think the ones with liquor are that's an issue so they don't allow guns in an environment serves liquor like a bar of course\nNow is that Arizona law that you can't have a gun in an establishment that serves liquor or is that their choice they just don't want it in there or can you go in with a gun and not drink liquor because there's a distinction there\nI Believe it's the the the establishment choice and um but you know guns in alcohol don't always mix I think anyone would agree with that\nYeah and it's interesting and the reason I ask that is because I have contacted a couple of establishments here in town yeah again I won't name names\nOr the ... all great established it's often fantastic and ask because I was unaware and I'm going back a few years am I allowed to carry my gun in your establishment and the response was under Arizona law you can and if you really want to you okay but we would prefer you not\nAnd you know I honored their honor their preference so I I think it's interesting because I Know every single one of them that I spoke to\nKnow that we support the second amendment and they do support the second amendment I Know they do but I just was curious if this proclamation\nChanged anything in town did anybody in town fight you want it did anybody say hey we don't want this or guns or bad I mean those people are out there did we did you get any pushback to literally\nOut of a of a whole city town and uh but it did support people didn't support the proclamation and they did support our constitution and and I write in our individual rights yeah\nYeah because there's some there's fun interesting politics in the town of two of them and I'm curious what did anybody push back hard did what did you get any particular level like you would in a you know in a place like Phoenix or where you know you've got groups that would actually come out and and actually picket you or fight you you didn't get any of that\nNothing nothing no demonstrators just just you know one person maybe wasn't happy with that but to everyone else was a it was very positive\nGood it is positive thing I Love it now let's talk about some big names you

just mentioned was killed those back to where they generally belong where they were called in Tennessee or Indiana and North Dakota North Dakota and Tennessee especially\nAnd it's created the possibility of a much tighter race in West Virginia that people didn't think was there and it may have may have an impact in Arizona\nHere here's my counter arguments when Jim Messina is trading at Elizabeth Warren stop it stop it stop it that is because he knows the effect of having that foolishness erupt right now Twenty one days from election\n... well ... the well yeah but what he was talking about was bottling it using the message because if you're a Democrat you and all the focus should be President Trump but that was that's a different question of whether or not these guys are still going to get out of all of the book was the vote which I Believe they'll\nYou know David this is going to be interesting I I think the uh the political record the White House deeply and just said the president's put the Republican in a position to defy history I think the polling is beyond what we know begin to nations I have is I think Kevin uh uh just\nA um ten Seventy the answer is is do you do a show on him to be the answer\nYou're hearing what was your mind Canada I'm In the early ... today and joining me from abroad\nDavid Kirkpatrick of the New York times he is the author of into the hands of the soldiers freedom in chaos in Egypt and the middle east you were recall about two months ago David joined me for a long interview about into the hands of the soldiers which I consider to be a must read primer\nOn the middle east and he joined me today to talk about the disappearance of Jamal ... who is his friend David welcome what was your relationship with democracy do you\nPlay with the source you know he was somebody I was friendly with the fact that we would have lunch together and chit chat you know not someone I Would have over to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew he was he was a hard guy not to like\nThat that is what I've been told by many people I've talked to about this about\nA half an hour ago Muhammad ... posted this Saudi website says ... will some of the Fifteen people friends who turkey claims were the hit team that killed ... show me close friends to ask them what they were doing an instant ball and the day 'cause she'll be died what do you see happening David\nWell the music the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nThat turkey was likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that your mouth show he had been killed inside the confidence in Istanbul and that seems like the way things are headed at this hour or last night of a well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia\nHad identified the person they're going to say is responsible or he put it more honestly and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and intelligence\nHad the authorization to carry out some kind of a rendition and that went horribly wrong um if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that does seem terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nThis is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid ... will no one read me of this troublesome praised him for his lights go off and slaughter Thomas of Beck and can't America the drop it works and you know the twelve hundred in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think oh\nWell what does works mean you know for them and the government to make do with a partial troops fairly often or the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish ah officials and all this been confirmed\nIt's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair\nHis ... his reputation you know he he'd gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up the kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover of the rendition gone bad\nUm implicates NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do think the royal court changes in succession\nA two elements there first of all I think this person this ah intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person has tried that person will be tried in that Saudi court so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the ground perhaps a second of all\nA you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession a Saturday and it has changed crown prince Mohammed or someone had consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key\nLevers and so the best handicapping it there's no one in a position of change of\nRain in to challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over there he's made many enemies along the way none of them seems to have\nEnough heft to push him out a lot of succession as long as you're dead is okay with it and his dad is elderly and may not be that company right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king I'm not too long ago and she expected me with NBS when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that\nThere is within the guy and this was just a range of possibility and giving the every second option which is your ... responsibility but not a guilt\nThe other one as you say someone was trying to take me out the rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals that I had improving the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know it to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that is what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend of a crowd Brits had been Solomon who felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition\nAnd who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nThat is the Henry the second I had is pure Henry the second term is back at a parallel will that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the fact that the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would the better the second defense ... a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence red turkey Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video\nOf from inside the conflict showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks\nThen that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S to try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now does that impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America\nTrying to confront these were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome or as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure this has any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish tennis whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting ahead of the Saudis and already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begin to float that explanation\nThemselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession a inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long ... Patrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit a the crown prince is with elite opinion\nYou know the wall street and Silicon Valley uh he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they know how to help diversify the Saudi economy he's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort\nAnd that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nA last question Democrat Patrick Winn into the hands of the soldiers goes into a paperback edition or is this going to be the the forward because this is I don't know if it's a turning point or a bump in the road\nYou know to sort of do\nWell I appreciate your coming to join me David jak or Patrick on the New York times author of into the hands of the soldiers which is the definitive you've got to read it to understand what the Arab Spring was about what happened to the Arab Spring where the new on time comes\nFrom and how it is going to endure or not indoor thank you David let me that's just so great to be able to talk to someone that she knows what they're doing on Saudi Arabia is very difficult [noise] um it is not difficult to tell you don't touch my Medicare dot com is where you go to join the a Mac team are fighting against Bernie care\nIn these elections don't touch my Medicare dot com is run by the association of mature American citizens dot us\nA Mac dot US you ought to be a member of that it's a million plus a strong Dan Weber has built a machine and they counter left wing A.
