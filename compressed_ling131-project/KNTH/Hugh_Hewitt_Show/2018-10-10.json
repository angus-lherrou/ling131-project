Penn wings on US marine corps first lieutenant Michael Pence two weeks ago congratulations to him to you and Mrs parents what got aircraft as he got to be ... flying\nWell he'll he'll be flying uh

guessing that puts you in the mid ship men during the Army Navy game as secretary of state with the cadets and the president going back and forth\n[laughter]\n... anywhere they let me and that I'll be very proud to your family as well and family services\nNow Mr Vice president a UN ambassador Haley's announced that leaves us all a little bit started last time I saw what was it the swearing in of Richard Grinnell to go to Germany he is on the shortlist to replace her along with Robert O'Brian admiral ... when you talk to the president what qualities as opposed to name you're going to urge him to look for in a UN ambassador\nWell before we look at the future let me say how how grateful we all our president myself our entire ministry ... for the extraordinary job or that ambassador Nikki Haley is done for the United states at the United nations or she is a she has a tick you\nTaking the president's America First agenda uh carried it into the\nThe for the United nations that she's traveled around the globe\nAdvocating American interest uh and uh we will miss her in this role she's a personal friend of mine and she and I spent a little bit of time or after she was in the oval office with the president and I just I just told her personally grateful I was uh for\nFor not only the job she's done but the way she's the way she's done a with courage and character and and grace and we wish her and her family every blessing and the years ahead here\nVery tough act to follow so how do you follow it\nWhy they will be a decision for the president but uh there are a number of men and women ah that ah that that would be a very qualified very able to follow on in that role but what I can promise you as the policies aren't going to change I mean one of one of the things that does is I think than than most uh\nUh admirable about the job that ambassador Haley did at the United nations that are secretary's day my ... my ... who is doing now John Bolton is doing\nIs is every single one of these folks and gets up every day or to carry the agenda that we were elected to advance\nOn behalf of the American people that America First agenda on to the world stage and so we're we're we're looking for folks that are that are not only can follow in the big shoes that Nikki Haley is going to leave at the un but we're we're going to be looking we're going to be looking to fill that spot a with someone who comes in with just as much bigger to advance\nAmerica's interest to advance the America First agenda and to and to continue to see of\nAmerica um respected again on the world stage you know Nikki made that comment in the oval office today and I I can tell you haven't\nHad the opportunity to travel around the world over\nThe last two years few um and uh I'll be headed to the Asia Pacific here and in about a month\nOr as a as I've met with world leaders as I have witnessed or the response to President Trump's leadership uh on on the world stage there's no doubt that America is respected again and that is a credit to the president of the entire team and and uh\nAnd we are so grateful for the contribution that Nikki Haley may to that causes well\nIt does take some sparkle and some charisma like ambassador Haley that's why I bring up Grinnell Robert O'Brian and and James ... we got to have some sparkle or\nWell look it's a it's the United nations is a big steak\nAnd are having having the right talent they're all of those people are are outstanding people there are other people there's actually there's a a great number of people that have already expressed an interest in that position but I\nI I can tell you I'm I'm I have every confidence that the president or we'll we'll make sure that the United states is a once again well represented on the floor of the United nations and continues to advance a\nAdvanced said that ah agenda that's making such a difference for the American people and for American credibility in the world\nIs right for
