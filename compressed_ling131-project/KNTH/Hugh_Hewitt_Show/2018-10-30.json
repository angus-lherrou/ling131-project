at LAX airport a number of years ago on business\nI've got about Ninety percent of my voice back out during the day of rest I'm so glad\nThat I got it back in time for the last year we got from the election\nAnd the Republicans are looking very very good in the Senate and they have a fighting chance in the house this is not the blue wave that had been forecast later in the program we'll be joined by Senator Tom cotton to talk about outlooks on the Senate map and Marsha Blackburn who's going to be elected to the Senate in Tennessee she pulled away from Phil Bredesen pretty significantly\nI don't think the Republicans are going to lose any seats I think Martha McSally is going to hold on to Jeff Flake seat fairly easily in Arizona it's all split her way and I've been looking at the internal models down there and I I Would expect her to win by six seven points\nUh Marsha Blackburn is pulled away double digit went in Tennessee Dean Heller it's much much closer and uh it's dog fight but he can do it he's very very likeable there in Nevada so they hold on to their fifty one to start with\nBen Kevin Cramer beads\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and nobody even argues that that's a double digit when Josh Hawley has pulled away from Claire McCaskill in Missouri Mike Braun has established a significant that statistically significant lead in Indiana that's three pickups then we get to the dead heat Rick Scott in Florida against incumbent Bill Nelson\nI think Governor Scott is helping himself every day by just being a great governor Matt Rosendale the auditor or Montana against John tester and that's one that's very very difficult to guess because of the polling has been so elusive\nVery difficult to pull Montana the president's going back there and of course John tester voted against Brett Kavanaugh and most of Montana likes the second amendment right\nJohn James is surging in Michigan Mike Pence was there yesterday Bob Haagen has pulled within five in New Jersey which is extraordinary impact Morsi was on the show yesterday competitive in West Virginia though by it's going to be great and the Senate and then what happened yesterday a gift\nAgain because I had been under the weather I spend a lot of time just watching and reading on my back every ... new book the corrosion of conservatism I'm reading for later in the show today Jim ... new book I'm just reading lots of different stuff but I watch a lot of cable keep my eye on MSNBC Fox in and and yesterday when fall on\nThe left wing media when fall and and it's in the Washington Post this morning\nIf you want to know a summary of what the left thinks about you if you're a center right voter if you're an independent or Republican Catherine Rampell what my colleagues at the post war I write a column as well\nWrote a column saying the title of which as Trump isn't to blame his entire party is it begins the White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump for our poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what rights capping ramble there right Trump isn't to boy\nHis entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nDo you understand what that means that means Catherine Rampell writing on behalf of the entire left wing media establishment and the Democratic party thanks you are a murderer neo Nazi pipe bomb sending scum\nThat's what it means that's what they think of you\nAnd that's why I think they're going to get the surprise of their life again on Tuesday night because Americans are not neo Nazi pipe bomb sending people they are deeply wounded\nGrieving with their friends in Pittsburgh but they do not know they may not be cover religion is but they are co citizens and they are rallying to them and they reject pipe bombs and they reject\nAttacking senators in restaurants and they reject firing the shots in the Republican\nHeadquarters in ... County Florida they reject it all and the idea of attempting to assign that that\nCrazy action of a tiny infant decimal sliver of the three hundred thirty million Americans to ordinary Americans is repulsive and they are going to vote that repulsion that revulsion at the polls meanwhile and by the way you can watch\nThe quips I'm about to play over here you're dot com we have a live stream from the studio and we have the clips ready for you in the meantime President Trump went on Laura Ingraham show last night on Fox News to talk about some of the recent rhetoric here's what he first had to say about the mainstream media ... number one\nThere was a woman who was shown on CNN a short while ago saying that you have radicalized more painful than ISIS that was hanging on to that\nWell that must be some kind of a sick when the when I say the enemy of the people I'm Talking about the fake news and you know better than anybody he left news out there that shows fake\nPlaying I can do the greatest thing have or North Korea\nAs an example we would have been going to war normally would have been going to war with ... I think President Obama would have gone to war very he had an extra year he would be in right now a war with North Korea he told me it was by far and I'm not knocking them for that she said is by far is the biggest problem [noise] look at what we've done and yet when they talk about North Korea and they say\nWhat's taking so but anyway for Seventy ... some odd years and they say ... I left\nI left Singapore where we had our meeting\nWhere we've really had a very good meeting in a good relationship like what four months ago they said in ... seconds so long I see we\nHad help expand here may to call them the enemy of the people I thought it was a\nQuestion before we finish up with and then they said we can't get him on anything because the sanctions are wrong we got everything there is no missiles we got our houses back we have to remains got me everything so now they said she met the new line is\nThat they're going to be fair to think of us have never going to be fair he was thinking the same ... [laughter]\nOkay that's a new line I shouldn't have net so you know and if you go back to before I got here it looked like we were going to war a bad war with North Korea so\nIt was ... and I work for Reagan they called him seven dollars an hour after an incompetent a warmonger hang out with\nHim when he ... he was\nThat he didn't have a social media that was what if what he did not social made it one day my form of of telling the truth is the problem\nWe have a lot of supporters you know that better than anybody when you have to do is look at your writings okay but you know better than anybody do support his you know that the airline I watched meet the press this week\nWas so falsely plug\nPutting words in people's hollow you in the mid term for this party that's going at\nIt that way and I'm getting twenty five and thirty thousand people to these rallies nobody's ever see there has never been in this isn't bragging that it never been anything like what's happening I went to Illinois ... knowing seven forty seven this massive hangar\nAnd how to use a second day for the overflow nobody's sing and always look what happened to Ted Cruz is doing great now we left he said he's not doing great and they don't even talk about that race than his opponent is a very long\nSo there is the president keeps going with Laurie ... and he he's not going to let up on the media attacking him cut number to\nKnow I look he was he was saying a long time before you look at his medical records he lives in Spain for a long time [noise]\nBernie Sanders had a fan who shot a very good friend of ours held seats killings and other people he is a total maniac nobody put his name in the headline Bernie Sanders and the headline was a maniac\nDo not politicized\nThe time I was in the headlines of the Washington Post my name associated with this crazy bomber\nCome bomb or something but I was in the headlines when they got him\nIt didn't say why were found they talk to the Trump in the headlines now they didn't do that with Bernie Sanders when he said they didn't do that with the Democrats when other people cannot they didn't do that with President Obama with the church the horrible situation with the church they didn't do that they put my name is ...\nIt's just the way I see the enemy of the people I'm Talking about this thing and it is fake which will get oriented and my people understand when a reporter for the Washington Post has a story that place that I was in the arena was empty\nAnd he chose not to the crowd listen Trump something to that effect\nIt turned out that he can to picture five hours before\nThe people coming into the arena when it was packed\nWith thousands of people outside [noise]\nThis is a kind of dishonesty that we have\nOne more cut because the president ... is laying out the case I think it's going to motivate a lot of voters who are not even Trump supporters they understand the fundamental\nWrongness of blaming Donald Trump or his supporters for the neo Nazi you hated Trump who killed the eleven people in Pittsburgh they understand that the nuts and who shut the pipe bomb is a super fan of Trump but Trump does not encourage violent better stand that and they reject the assignment of blame\nOr he does however uh talk about what he's not going to do before the election or I'll say that until after he's not going to release the Pfizer wart um and of course Muller is not going to release anything we're up we're up against the election friends\nAnd I want to tell you right now get involved get out there remember mark the mix Sally in Arizona if you're an early vote or go and vote\nDean Heller in Nevada Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee she's going to be on later she got double digit lead already Kevin Kramer's one in North Dakota Josh Hawley has won the Senate race in Missouri Claire McCaskill's all but conceded getting blasted for calling people crazy Democrats Mike Braun is\nPretty we should like we're not letting them at what happens is they would catch and release would catch it we're not releasing work hatching\nWere not releasing he went on to say there will be tense there will be nice pants but if they're not eligible for asylum they're going right back [noise]\nUh it's um\nIt's going to be a flashpoint issue for the next week so what matters I think more is that Americans have revolted by the

Hyun Jonathan Swan that he intends to sign an executive order banning birthright citizenship\nNow I Do not believe that constitutional\nI Believe in in fact no one disagrees the court has believed since it\nFirst ruled on the matter in the early sixties that to be born in the United states has to come under the jurisdiction there I've been to be a citizen in the United states but there are some legal scholars including my friend John east men who dispute that\nBelieves that subject to the jurisdiction Arab refers only the green card holders and us citizens in that a foreign national on the soil United States without permission and a green card or on a tourist visa and who gives birth here it's not in fact giving birth to a citizen but to another foreign national I don't believe that\nI don't believe the Supreme Court will uphold that executive order but it is news with the president is going to set up a test case that his news the president also sending five thousand two hundred troops in the southern border to be prepared to receive the caravan\nTo house them intense and then return them to their countries immediately unless they're eligible for asylum and at the same to me to be the necessary consequence of not building the fence that I've been arguing for for twelve years\nA long tall strong double wide fence for the big gate illegal entry for asylum seekers who are legit and I'm the outward manifestation of any word resolved to protect our national borders\nAlso got to tell you about the editorial in the wall Street Journal today by Jim Greene what now everyone knows a or should know one of the sponsors of my program its citizens for truth and drug pricing\nBecause I Am I'm an opponent of the way that big pharma prices their products I Believe very much and making prescription drugs affordable and I believe that big pharma is looting the system\nAnd that they spend a hundred and Seventy million dollars a year to lobby the system and that they sold us down the river when Obamacare came along to protect their profits and so the president and secretary age are have proposed using reference price and\nWhich is to take a combined reference price of what a drug cells foreign countries they through Z average him out and then say why are\nThe election day vote came in and then we looked at how these votes were distributed so um I think that they look I think there is on a racist very close to mark and mark mix Sally can win I don't think anybody has to grade of elite either way I'm an ... up to see\nHow it turns out you know this is one where we're doing mid term madness and I hope you have you played yet David ... you can't you gotta go now I can\nI Want to see where you finish in the rankings it's like the ... going court marathon I Want to see where David ... director finishes in Iraq and it's because\nUh there are thousands possible points and thousands of people are playing mentor mad as over your your ... name in there somewhere but in any event the um the again I Want to walk people through I think there is a blow out first of all David ... she has collapsed and there isn't much of a governor's campaign dah du she's going to win by more than double digits\nSecondly the early voting is our plus tan are plus ten\nThat is not necessarily going to hold up I cannot imagine a Republican voter voting for Christian send them a over Martha McSally like you might for example in a in West Virginia right maybe they like Joe mansion 'cause they've known Joe for a hundred years but\nA Republican voter an Arizona David ... is not going to vote for Chris incentive agree or disagree\nNo look I disagree I think it's very possible that you're going to find a moderate Republican woman in the Phoenix suburbs it's been a book of course the cinema as a Georgia circle quaint against Donald Trump but I think it's very possible\nSo that we did a great I I think that is the most beltway the invention checking I talked about this Todd\nAnd I talked about this last week the invention in the beltway mind of a moderate Republican woman who is going to throw away their vote on a senator because they don't like Donald Trump I mean have you met such a\nYes I met lots of that list sounds like the argument that there weren't such people that were gonna vote for Donald Trump because he was crazy and set a bunch of weird things I've you\nKnow but that's different from that argument that if the argument is I I haven't seen anyone yet and\nMaybe a report their name and we can get them on the air of a moderate Republican woman who is going to vote against Martha McSally the first female combat pilot because she doesn't like Donald Trump it doesn't make any sense it's irrational\nIt makes it makes it yeah well voting is not always what everybody thinks it's rational but these sorts of things happen all the time they'll look I think Martha McSally\nA very likely could when I Am just saying that it is not incredulous that there are Republican women out there or some people they consider themselves Republicans they usually votes Republican for Congress that are going to go into the booth\nVote for Doug do see because they didn't Garcia is completely out of whack but that was on a federal issue they're going to take a different mindset\nInto the booth and they're going to say to themselves but I'm gonna vote this way on this rate I think it's possible\nI think I I think we see this all the time we're on on federal and state and federal issues voters make different calculations and so I just said don't rule it out\nAnd when you have polling it's anywhere from you know a few points this way to a few points that way it indicates that there's a close race but I think mark Mick Sally very well could win I like the crowds sentiment has had a horrible few weeks and it's all looked at each uprising with Sally when I was just telling\nYou mean by going to win by ... when she wins by more than five points David director let's look back at this conversation because there isn't close it isn't even close that's why I I have a problem with I don't know Manhattan ... late\nI don't think that's just dealt with Manhattan Media elite look I talk to people in Arizona you know the race we want to know like Sally want her to win and they are the ones telling me this is a close race they're the ones that are not tell any do big blowout everybody's getting this wrong so\nSo not blow out five percent plus and I talked to the Republican pollsters that you talk to and ... and and when I see an NBC poll that is a hundred percent off I think to myself the media is trying to resuscitate a dead now\nNot what happens that's not what happens it's just that a lot of these public pollsters don't know how to poll individual states I see this in West Virginia I see this in Nevada it's especially Nevada all the time it's knowing\nJoined by Loni Chen\nDie David in dance that they tell us over institution always someone what am I go to analysts as we get close to an election which is a week out\nLaw and he I look at the numbers and I'm very very very optimistic about the Republicans in the Senate and I'm not resigned are losing their houses I was a month ago what say you\nKnow I'm In the exact same places you are a I think Republicans look very very good and is that fight this is something that we always thought would happen as we got closer to the race that some of these races would settle out and I think we're seeing that for sure\nAnd the house is really a toss up I I I think it's one of those things where it's very difficult to predict exactly what the margin going to be\nBut I think Republicans are going to be competitive coming into the stretch right here on the house side but but the Senate does look very good question about it\nNow what are the things that ah that I Want to always report objective way my audience and the NBC and Maris put out a full this morning that shows Kristin cinema up five points over Martha McSally now I have seen the internal polling from a Republican pollsters in Arizona the early voting was ten plots are\nThey use a five plus our model for the electorate and Martha McSally wins by five and a half percent under that model and so they're under estimating the actual Republican turnout and I do not believe Arizona is going to vote for radical and you know Arizona pretty well what do you think\nRights I think there's a few factors you're the first of all absolutely the data I've seen as well from Arizona suggest that the early vote has come in I had to pay for Republicans in other words if you compare early vote in ... in two thousand any team versus early vote in two thousand sixteen\nUh things are looking favorable in two thousand Eighteen even as opposed to twenty sixteen cycle which was a ... which was a good cycle for Republicans in Arizona\nThe second point is is just the fact that it just in cinema\nI I mean not only is as someone who has seen fit to criticize Arizona and Arizona ends but someone who's record is is really from the far left\nAnd I think when people really sit down and they think about what the choices are you a market next alley decorated combat veteran somebody who has represent the people of Arizona well versus someone like his cinema who was record is really quite out of touch\nI tend to think that even the late breaking voters will settle in favor of marketing Sally don't get me wrong it's going to be a close race I think five is a little bit traumatic margin from Sally I think she when she went more in that two to three point range\nBut I just have a very difficult time seeing the people that are voting for care subset of someone who's so fundamentally is out of touch with the value of the people that\nArizona law in the I don't know if you've played our mid term madness game yet but I Am hoping that you will go over to your dot com and play it because I Will I I I I Believe the margin of victory the people have to pick the winners and twenty five racist but they also have to pick margin of victory\nAnd I'm going to do plus for for Martha McSally which we have you know under one one to three and plus for\nA margin of victory and I think it's going to be so much easier than people believe ... but that\nThere is a built in desire in the media\nI mean deeply ingrained almost subconscious to make racist competitive when they are not when they hit the wall and it's sort of like Todd Akin hitting the wall in St Louis Christian ... is the Democrats topic and she just absolutely ran her boss right into our offer the Grand Canyon cliff and and there is no way\nTo recover from that topic and talking about voluntary rape um six years ago and you just can't come back from that\nLet me talk to you though about the meta thing that's going on here Democrats were panicked or a week ago because of the cabinet in fact Israel and by the way it continues to be real\nAh people were disgusted by what they did to Brett Kavanaugh along comes the crazy bomber David French calls him a super fan I call him a deranged psychopath oceans Thirteen would be bombs and there were bombs to targets\nAnd then comes the neo Nazi Trump hating\nMassacre of Pittsburgh Jews\nI think Democrats are hoping that the jar to the country will somehow jar the election and Catherine Rampell writes in the Washington Post and it's almost ... to me\nThe White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump for poison is\nIncreasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what they're right Trump isn't to blame his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nNow I Believe she's sincere and I believe most of the elite media believes that but I think that absolutely is repulsive to the ordinary American what do you think ...\nYeah I I not only is it is it repulsive but it it it just defies read this notion that somehow\nBecause you've got Republicans that have tried to work together with President Trump in advancing an agenda for the American people that somehow or because they they are responsibility for what is clearly fundamentally the responsibility of at the arranged a man\nWho set pipe bombs through the to the u._s. mail a and and and a and a person filled with hatred\nWho committed in my mind and I forget all act and so I look at this as part of the media narrative you get it you understand it at some point it was always going to get here how is it that the folks in the media are going to figure out a way to try and blame Republicans to turn the election\nAnd I think you're I think you're seeing that now the question is whether it's going to work or not and and I'm just I'm I'm not sure that will uh I I mean I see the narrative out there I see a lot of people trying to make this case\nUh but I but I just don't see it I think at the end of the day it's election particularly on the house side it's just going to be a whole lot closer than people think\nAnd you know we'll see what the outcome is but I I I I just think the American people are going to come back to the fundamentals here which are strong economy a lot of accomplishment that Republicans can rest their record on ... and you get a lot of Democrats running that are fundamentally out of touch\nAnd and I also believe always in the fundamental common sense of the American voter they realize if they don't like Donald Trump\nVoting for example for Christian sentiment is not the response you empower the responsible Republican Senate led by Mitch McConnell you don't empower radical left us\nAnd I think there is um a I'll call it the bounce back in fact people notice when they use aspirin for example in the nasal congestion the more you use it the worse it gets the more crazy rhetoric the crazier gets this is Julie I off with Jake Tapper last night's Simone Sanders David Urban onset as well\nGive a listen to this number six to\n... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that to where they launched his presidential run on talking about Islamic radicalization\nAnd having a has radicalized Sal many more people than I did I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste is that says it the way that stop\nRight there that was David Urban looking just amazed in perplexed as I did now she later apologized they stopped the show they let her come back and do a clean up on I Will be but none have when you get stuff like that you realize the Democrats are enhanced\n[laughter] yeah I mean this is the problem with with where we are now is that you know look we have a discussion about whether we would we like the president\nAt times to take take a different time I think that's entirely appropriate critique but for some reason I think people on the left ... that it allows them to to say things that are completely ridiculous and by the way she thought the only one who's been saying you know things like this notion that somehow\nOr you know we we we we compare what's happening\nWith his lot Islamic terrorism abroad\nTo to some of what we see here with the axe here are despicable make no mistake but trying to draw these comparisons trying to to use these parallels to attack\nThe president of the Republican Party is it is just off faith that I have to say I do think it is a function of the time we find ourselves in\nHis rhetoric become acceptable\nWhen we play for you I'm Marsha Blackburn had a rally yesterday but she began when a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh this is what happened cut number eight\n[laughter]\nA radical leftist interrupted a moment of silence for a for victims to do that and Marsha Blackburn was done she took to Twitter last night I think tendency will be revolted by this is why I think that\nThat crazy woman who did that are destroyed Phil Bredesen any chance of is coming back because it's it's scary it's actually kind of their unhinged\n[laughter] yeah I mean in in in that race in particular person was already cooked you know if if he could be any more cooked after that I you know I mean he certainly is\nI think I think I think people see that and they ... what it does is it makes clear for them what's what the face of liberalism of like it makes clear to them\nWhat the alternative is and it is and it is scary look I think people people like checks and balances in general we seen this over and over again in American politics\nThey get money out of it you want to buy a house you're a senior citizen you want to reverse mortgage or a veteran you want one hundred percent financing\nAndrew and Todd dot com they were Sierra Pacific mortgage lenders are 'cause it's not a call center\nYou can call limit to bullet Triplett eleven Seventy two I think they're going to Andrew Todd dot com after a couple of questions there'll be right back to yesterday the Dow got slammed again down two hundred and forty five point the NASDAQ down a hundred and Seventeen and ... market it's alright again there will be as off twenty five hundred and fifty four in the\nDallas off another two hundred and Seventy seven the correction continues I'll be right back America stay tuned Andrew and Todd dot com during the break into your your child [noise]\nYou weren't ...

been more in turmoil in this election season than Pennsylvania that's because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court mandated new districts not the state legislature the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the United States Supreme court did not disturbed that decision\nSo they throw all the old lines into the trash can came up with their own line I think that's unconstitutional but it's what you got to deal with one of those new districts is the fourth it includes most of Montgomery County which is close to Bucks County it's a suburb of Philadelphia\nIt's got some familiar names like Norris town and and green lean in it and and boy your town and box town but it is and it's a free for all\nAnd joining me now to talk about that is Dan David\nAnd David as the Republican nominee for the Pennsylvania

me on\nIt's great to have you on a diet set that up right that that out of this confusion of lawsuits has come a fourth district in which to newcomers are pitted\nYeah so there's no incumbent here and uh it it looked every county is the second wealthiest county in the commonwealth with king of Prussia and and uh other large metropolitan areas in Montgomery County\nAnd look at you know Republicans I think a part of our ecosystem take adversity and make opportunity a Montgomery County was split the five different districts as it was before now it's all one will win it and it'll be a prosperous county for the commonwealth him for the United states and that's that's why you\nDidn't even tell people a little bit about who you are and why you chose to get involved because this is not the er I Would have chosen to enter into politics especially in Pennsylvania especially with this is the state Supreme Court doing everything that it's done\nYeah well you know let the Supreme Court has has the right to consider something unconstitutional and and they did what they did what they don't have the right to do is to draw lines on a map that's governing\nUh and and I I I felt strongly about
