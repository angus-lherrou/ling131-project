point not solving brought up\nThank you so much Carrie in New Hampshire\nI judge Kavanaugh as qualified and he had the experience is just the person that he wanted to print carpet and more importantly I feel like\nThis is such a critical moment he looks like you've been talking about like Madison talking about we need to stand that perfect so we're feeling the stand up for profit principle we're

um your outpouring but I also struck by how they're making very good points and and and reason points I mean that that the caller that she was from the New Hampshire it's about facts rather than not feelings I'm\nRight they ... they they see that but this is why we have this whole process to me the whole movement the creation of the American constitutional system the establishment of of this thing we call the founding that we're trying to protect here was precisely to set up\nA process by which we disagree and in front of a month we have great disagreements we still have a process\nA legitimate a fair a judge process so that we come to a reasoned\nA deliberate conclusions and we can govern ourselves we can go forward as a nation this these days that this does come together here I Am really moved by these these calls I'm ed took said that they see they see the core thing going on here this is a it's unjust but it's also an attack\nOn the very system that's behind that that is necessary to a whole justice on a day to day basis in a in a free country\nAnd that's I think very powerful ... so I don't know how this is close Smith Spalding I really don't because it it is so transparent and the story this morning about witness manipulation cetera part you an optimist about this and when it's all said and done\nWell I'm optimistic about I'm not necessarily an optimist I mean a lot of madness at our politics for some time there's there's a lot of um\nA aspects of this it needs to be kind of deconstruct it out of the system what I Am an optimist about these calls I think underscore that optimism I've always been an optimist about the American people and their ability to govern themselves\nWhen they're engaged in what's when something is before them I mean this goes back to the old notion about the jury system is based on what\nTwelve of your peers\nOrdinary Americans they decide these things why because that's how we we we we do that\nIn the ... the characters formed in a way that they're going to be fair and just uh that's I think the only source we can have optimism ultimately the question is whether the American people engage on this and other questions\nIn ways that restores self government and and rebuild that system I'm In in the near future if at all possible [laughter]\nYeah we can we can proceed yeah it is\nJust a remarkable to me

or the cubs justice Kavanaugh you need fifty one votes the vice president came cast the fifty first vote if necessary\nThere was concern that one Republican sitter had a daughter's wedding to attend a tomorrow he made clear a sitter day that he will fly back to Washington DC tomorrow evening if necessary to be the vote a to B that fifty or\nFifty first vote so that is no longer a a really a concern I let me say this before we get into kind of all of the what ifs as well\nI told you yesterday that at ... again they're not related to the Democrats they only had one ... defection don't manage all the rest including some who are facing very tough political battles in states Donald Trump won and Republicans traditionally win state wide and\nUm they just all the bug Joe Manchin decided to vote against cloture\nAnd let me read some of these habits that came out there was a word to permit I said listen for that from Democrats here senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota she's a no vote now she was one that used to be that group of five to say and talks about always that were potential a vote for judge Kavanaugh no longer now\nShe says last Thursday's hearing called into question judge Kavanaugh's Kurt temperament she's voting no\nThe Washington Post editorial board which is no surprise opposing judge cabinet and call it for a no vote that says that his judgment and temperament would be a doubt the New York times just comes out and calls him a jerk seriously that's the term they usually call judge Kavanaugh a jerk\nSenator Feinstein says that he's angry at a grass and and the aggression so talking about two permits she didn't use the word but Senator Schumer did\nQuestion the confidence to judge Kavanaugh has the tip permit Senator Durbin\nUm uh it's asked me put it on the ... how could you trust his temperament center Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama also a show a temperament that's a big company of a judge and Senator Patrick Leahy a he has neither the judgment nor the temperament that is just a sample again\nThey're not going to let up on this folks I think that it seems to be made very clear to you that we have a time period here it's more than twenty four hours for like thirty hours\nWhere people like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins a are are going to be under immense pressure as well as Joe mansion\nOr from both sides but especially the left right now who is flooding the offices in Washington DC and obviously did have an impact on the ... so they they say it's\nA I think with the white Lisa Murkowski it's played she was the only Republican vote no on cloture she decided that she was walking into the Senate chamber of right before we went on the air and they had that vote\nThat are those protesters did have an impact so I don't think they can impact every senator I think that they probably don't have as much of an impact on someone like Joe Manchin of West Virginia especially with its Hollywood liberals\nProtesting but they did on that Alaska Senator\nSenator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski now\nThe big question of today is what will Joe Manchin say\nWhat will um what will Susan Collins say she's already scheduled a press conference and we'll just like say anything or do we go into tomorrow it it really still not have a clear indication that the votes are there for\nBrett Kavanaugh saying right before I get to the phones I just want to make it kind of clear to people you need fifty one votes\nUm he got that today to get to cloture if those votes held he would be confirmed without the need for the vice president he could lose one more and the vice president can be the fifty for so\nYeah that's right joined in fact if everybody votes as they did today the way this would probably go down as the vote tally would probably actually be fifty two forty nine\nBecause the Danes will not have you back in Washington DC now now you're absolutely correct he said if his vote is needed he will fly back in time to cast it so if you play that hypothetical out say you did you know Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Joe Manchin\nA flip to know the final tally when it is initially taken will probably be forty nine to fifty but they won't close that vote Jordan and then in that scenario you would see Steve Gaines get on a plane to come back from Montana and at the same time the vice president would have to make its way\nOut to the Senate chamber so if everybody votes as they did today I expect it would be a fifty to forty nine confirmation and if you see the tally a sort of come to a close at forty nine to fifty then it's going to be holding held open for several hours to get Steve Gaines back Jordan all\nRight I don't want to put words in the Centre College math but she's having his press conference which to me is unique because she she indicated one way by voting yes on culture I think she could have let that stand but she decided to have a after do press conference\nThen hypothetically you lose Susan Collins and if you assume that these Murkowski's that switching a vote or you did have to rely on a job at should to save this nomination\nYeah I I think that's perilous or Jordan I mean I Know there's a lot of reporting out right now the Joe Manchin has a pretty solid yes because of his race because of how popular judge Kavanaugh is in the state and maybe even some speculation of a party changing after the elections but Jordan\nThat's a very tenuous place for this nomination to be now I won't tell you that is absolutely impossible for that to happen\nBut look if you go down to the floor of the Senate and the final vote is forty nine to fifty and you're starting to fly Steve the Danes back from Montana like we just talked about and you're starting to bring the vice president over to cast a tie breaking vote can you can you imagine the pressure that would be an Joe Manchin during those hours while that vote was held open and the delay was\nHanging on his vote look it might happen but that that is not the best path to nomination for judge Kavanaugh the best path to nominate a confirmation prevent Kavanaugh is to hold Jeff Flake to vote and hold Susan Collins votes and by the way during there there is some reporting coming out right now the Jeff Flake is ... orders that he's a yes on ... unless something changes\nYeah and again the typical jeopardy you're saying but I mean right things can change or thirty hours of a debate right now it's just started last hour or so or Jeff Flake is a waiver yes uh but still is leaving it out there to be persuaded to vote against\nA combination I did want answers one call the companies I think this may be a incorrect information may be some confusion with names as well or\nThat would be totally breaking news that has not to report it looks good Roberta in Colorado on line for Roberta welcome to Jason alive\nHigh it's I heard correctly Cory Gardner is thirty now and I'm encouraged to Colorado ends to play is called Korean Gardner's office and encourage him to vote yes for cap now\nYeah I think that that's incorrect information he's a Republican from Colorado I think you might be confusing\nOr you're in Colorado but don't confuse the Cory there's also Cory Booker in New Jersey fan who is definitely a no vote but I've not got any Cory Gardner whether yes he was a yes vote on cloture he has not indicated all that he'd be in a no vote on Capitol\nYeah I think he's a yes on final Jordan I mean there there there was some reporting last night that he was still undecided as of last night but he has since announced his vote so you're either there's some confusion with Cory Booker or ... maybe it's thinking back to that story of last night you know\nThere were there were several senators yesterday that came out and sort of made their first public statements like Ben Sasse you know you had some problems with the process but his vote was never in debt in Dallas and I think that's the category put Cory Gardner and I don't think he's somebody you have to worry about at this point\nAt that point if those votes started dropping a you've you've you've got the nomination is doomed um so you know you got to really be able to focus in\nOn these final hours which we've got some questions about these final hours to than we have to be the focus in these final hours or because if you got everybody out there's potentially listen they voted for cloture and that was their first kind of comment on it and they haven't been one of the people who have hung themselves out as I'm undecided throughout the whole process\nOr you may have they said to the twenty four hours but did they voted\nOr you can't focus there because if you do focus they're literally that means you've got serious trouble with ... I don't think that's the issue right now I think the issue is these handful of senators but let me explain this up both Rhonda on Facebook who wrote and please explain the thirty our weight dawn on Facebook writes why can't they hold the final vote today than\nNot about the allegations that temperament and as I read to you I was told yesterday listen for the words to prevent it appears in uh all these no votes\nStatements city that senator Heidi Heitkamp which I think she's good by North Dakota or the Washington Post editorial board that says to vote no uses to prevent a New York times editorial board just called him a jerk a very very uh I get very uh\n... it's just a bit of ... these are the kind of terminology ... certified side uh anger and aggression is how she explains it super uses temperament Durban uses temperament Doug Jones in Alabama uses temperament so does Patrick Leahy\nThere are plenty of others have as well that's just kind of a sample for you as well ... what company from Facebook talked to a Saudi air one eight hundred six eight four thirty one too that twenty eight hundred six eight for three one zero uh which stood on Facebook I'm surprised that sitter jokes from Alabama voted no on culture\nSand Doug Jones is just showed everybody that uh you ... it at Alabama senator and a Democrat or that he is he's got to be voting with the Democratic party a so long as he's a U.S Senate\nYeah he's been showing that for a while and I mean honestly he was never really in play on this one and he's not been on play on a lot of key up pieces of legislation as well as nominations um you know I I guess I Would read the political tea leaves on that a little bit maybe Doug Jones doesn't think the as much of a chance for reelection so he doesn't have to play\nOr to the base in Alabama I'm not quite sure but I Would just I Would just say this I don't think this is the first indication from Doug Jones I think this is a pretty much more of the same of what you've been getting from them since he's been in town\nNot listen to him today on CNN bite Nineteen\nThere you go for Doug Jones is the temperament issues faced three the question is is faced three\nSuccessful [noise] it's a question because the cloture vote was so close to that is just the vote to allow a final vote and just because you vote to allow it up or down vote does not mean do you also we're going to vote affirmatively for now many\nThe fish out of the first half hour that you should always allow it up\n'em out but again this was fifty one forty nine back our second half hour on chasing you alive\nJust simply conservative do not apologize for that we do nothing listeners suffer from talk radio fatigue they're energized every day\nAlways conservative we are ... the answer [noise] live\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow\nOn this side of the age of fifty one who knows are forty nine the notion is a green killed [noise]\nAnd now your host Jordan\nWelcome to Jay Sekulow live in our second half hour of the broadcast [noise] a lot of phone calls to\nGet to but let me just jump to speeds people just joined us will do very quickly the full Senate took their first of two votes on judge Kavanaugh uh today it just happened just before he went on the air and the vote was fifty one forty nine in favor of cloture on the Capitol domination that means the nomination moves forward\nOr that was a vote to basically allow\nThe final vote on whether judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capital\nOr we don't have to really go through and read through the entire list because it it was pretty easy only one Republican voted against\nCulture that was Lisa Murkowski only ... Democrats voted for cloture that was Joe mansion Lisa Murkowski is from a Republican from Alabama a from a Alaska and Joe Manchin is the Democrat from West Virginia\nWe're taking your phone calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to the final vote\nIs likely tomorrow evening I mean that was scheduled for a Jeff Flake voted yes if you're wondering that on culture he said he's likely a yes vote\n'em off the domination unless something changes so he's left a cab out there who's in college was a yes vote as well um she has a press conference scheduled for later today where it's reported\nThat she's going to announce how she will vote\nOn the confirmation or we can play off the Sears for you and we will throughout the second half hour the broadcast as they had been a joy to be a from Washington DC I Do want to get right to the phones people have already been hold on for a half hour a Andy calling from Missouri on line three Andy welcome to Jay secular life\nYes how are you doing today hey Andy I'm enjoying it I'm enjoying your program which I got the whole hour here\nBut real quick my father and my question regards if Kevin uh it was voted down tomorrow or looking ahead to Monday morning I'm my thought is known Trump you think he would just come right to the microphones Monday and say okay\nYou didn't like this but not when a ... pound living a woman to yeah to run for\nI think I think you know I don't want us to pass this vote because I think judge Kavanaugh deserves to become justice capital I Hope he does become justice counted offers family\nFor him up for our country or is this will philosophy a and a and I so I I ... it is you know for those reasons that's my personal opinion so I don't really want to look past that\nUp but I Am also a political realist that this is a a nomination that have the balance could go either way these next thirty hours certainly um and we have to do before that exactly um or how they come down I don't speak to the White House will take a long time and announcing if they had to\nBut uh again I don't think we ought to ... go there yet I'm sure that they are prepared because it could be more effective they're already preparing for potential for more vacancies on the Supreme Court during the Trump presidency during the first herb even potentially so they're ready are always with a ... they have to be\nA things happen um and so because of that they're they are always ready their lifetime appointments but no one does get a sometimes justice retire\nSometimes they pass away while they're still serving and sometimes it's unexpected Li like in the case of of Justice Scalia one hundred sixty four thirty one Ted we do have a couple of lives that we just got open by taking some phone calls early in the second half hour if you want to talk to us on the air one eight hundred sixty eight for\nThree one zero that's where the hundred six eight four thirty one tenth said um\n[noise] we have a press conference coming out from Susan Collins we're waiting to see if Joe mansion issues are the kinds of statements\nUm people can follow me on Twitter for that I Will be you know and it was not tweeting on the hearing involving the allegations of making statements about that I Am on the come down to political votes and things like that if it doesn't happen while we're on the air it's certainly the final vote it will\nHappen tomorrow but they were just briefly we go to the spray how confident should capital supporters be right now\nOh I think they got what they want it today Jordan I mean it was a third of four votes he needed on the floor of the Senate I think they'll feel a lot better after Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins go down to the floor as part of this final debate and announced their position assuming it's a yes\nOr but look I think he set it up right I mean this is a margin that really hang on one Republican right now because of one Republican were to flip Jordan or did it all hang on a Democrat and I don't think a judge Kavanaugh supporters would feel comfortable in that scenario\nFolks we will continue to take your phone calls we come back [noise]\nAm than seven days the answer\nIs a critical time for our nation and for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work going to be American Center for lunches has never been more important than right now\nAt the ACL Jane were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family [noise]\nDefending human like standing up for a good friend Israel\nWorking to uncover the deep state so massive corruption in Washington battling to end the genocide of Christians in many parts of the world\nAnd the firm commitment to bat constitutional efforts to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorists [noise]\nYou can learn more about the mission and work in BC OJ online and Casey OJ dot org [noise]\nThere's not a better time to stand with the C.

I Believe the allegations against him were not since they were all totally uncorroborated but\nPicking sides there that either way he just doesn't have the temperament as a uh that's what's come out

certainly more\n[noise] but Janice on Facebook rights as if they keep talking about judicial temperament\nBut capital wasn't being attacked as a judge he was being attacked as a person so he reacted like a person and he says that it is often a this was so when he was doing this or a primary for his parents for his wife and primarily for\nHis uh his children as well as daughters as well so let's go right to the phones a lot of calls to get through was going to go right to her by order of those who have been holding the longest surely and Michigan on line one surely welcome to Jay sexual live\nHigh voltage yard long form [noise] um I think we all ...\nFair for just ... but for those that are taking that vote it's an awful low helpful had the courage that they're going to take the thoughts that we will turn number to pray for them but my question is um if\nHe is voted with the swearing in ceremony be someday so he can immediately start at the court on Monday or would they have to wait for any length of time to swear we'll know\nSo say it can happen is as quickly as as a I mean you get to vote and you can have the swearing in um the uh you can kind of have the formal or a swearing in done very quickly what was it that you know immediate time period on Sunday and then that can be more and more formal kind of ceremony even after that\nYeah I think it would happen virtually immediately Jordan I mean I think he would be over at the court on Sunday whether or not the swearing in half the men are Monday morning if he's confirmed by the Senate Jordan he's going to go to work immediately\nSo yeah so just answer your question very quickly sure it happens immediately what you would likely be a kind of a small quick of it\nAnd then there would be a kind of a larger of it we're friends and family go um uh that's been the case for other nominees are up but they start to work immediately states it back to the phones we go Stewart in New York on line three story welcome to Jay suck you alive\nHi I'm thank you for a while you do acts up your support of Israel or my question is in the audience Brett Kavanaugh has been a judge has his temperament that they've been in this you\nKnow I mean he got the highest rating you can get stored for baby a the American bar association which is very far to the left politically by the way but when they they they ah look at these judges they look at the kind of ... what ... how they conduct themselves it's not really supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about judicial philosophy um and he got the highest\nRanking you can from uh the American bar association well qualified so that again there's been no issues about judicial\nTemperament you can disagree with his usual philosophy but no issues about judge Kavanaugh's temperament at all\nAre brought up personal on the bench at work or throughout his career for being a judge or the twelve years he has served on the bitch back to the phones or we go mark is in California on line to Marcus welcome to Jay secular life\nThanks for taking my call these were caught me every time I get them there is they talk\nThey attacked him saying he was he saying basically\nThat is that is that basically it was it was at least a attempted rape or ... or ... or a SALT I mean these are serious crimes he was accused of orcas with no core operation or even after another FBI report no core operation\nWould we leave to even say you do say that they they even heard about this ever occurred\nWell\nYeah well it listed I mean this this is it's politics or the temperament issue again is it was just there next line of attack she's used to a agree to be other quarter we they actually say that too angry too much aggression\nTo be on the court that was not him as again the city of ... of judicial philosophy there defending himself there's a big difference uh back to the phones we go stand in Nevada online for staying welcome to Jay Sekulow live [noise]\nI I maybe I missed this earlier but I guess I Need a lesson on representative form of government I cannot in my mind that magic a summer like Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Manchin who have given us went overwhelmingly for just for one for one direction\nTo even get ... and the other I mean are we sending people to Washington to do what they want to do on their own or they weren't we checked the wires\nTo the Democrats red state Democrats who really gets through with talk\nThat never really became an action that was catching up to a job at should this vote a than I think that uh uh the race was getting ... is getting a bit too tight\nAnd the Democratic party moving a bit too far to the left so that you couldn't talk with no action just didn't really work it but it ... it's been okay for them to Heidi Heitkamp types of North Dakota of all places I think she's given up\nBy there should be what I think that she's dead now I don't think that's right because she does represent constituents like a standard said but um but but saying that I think for the Joe Manchin types of likely the party's moved so far to the left\nThat uh he's tried to talk like a moderate but not actually vote like a modern didn't work and now we're seeing potentially am starting to vote a light the moderate he says he is\nI I think this is one of the main reasons that Heidi Heitkamp race is basically lost for her Jordan I mean look the numbers for judge Kavanaugh in North Dakota in West Virginia\nAre basically identical he had a thirty percent approval rating a plus thirty pursue a percent approval rating in both of those states something like sixty two thirty in each of those states Heidi Heitkamp is no one judge Kavanaugh and she's getting beat a rather resenting lead by Kevin Cramer\nA then you look at Joe a mansion and he's going to vote yes for judge Kavanaugh or at least you know these are voted yes on cloture and he holds a you know roughly a six to eight percent lead or they're in West Virginia and I look at his voting record as you said Jordan it's been somewhat mixed\nBut the fact that he has voted with his constituents more often than Heidi Heitkamp I think that's why he's still competitive in West Virginia while she's getting beat rather ...\nAll right I I think we take these final to cause of the day remember the Kavanaugh a final vote or on up or down is scheduled for tomorrow evening and that's usually college she's got a press conference scheduled for this afternoon or and or maybe something for Joe mansion as well Jared and New York online five Kerry welcome to Jay you'll live\nThank you God Bless you for all the new my question is when someone calls into a Senate or Congress in ... or do they extrapolate that one phone call to be representative of more people like your one caller may be representative of health thirty people in your state\nFeel if there were there flooded by this they take note kind of a fan of it as best they can now when they start getting flooded in running to voice mail you got thirty hours to go through thousands of calls but as best they can like kind of the calls in favor yes or no\nYeah I think the short answer to that is yes Jordan I heard from a senator yesterday who said he had six thousand calls on this nomination in a period of twenty four hours it's a pretty good sign of them but it's important to voters\nAlright folks so let's just explain it for a very quickly we got forty seconds left follow me on Twitter Twitter dot com slash towards the sexual\nSusan Collins has a press conference scheduled for later today uh she said she will announce that press conference is being reported at least how she'll vote on the nomination Jeff Flake says he's probably yes vote or unless

outlets did their part in the facilitates the allegations of the Washington Post and the New Yorker and then it was something of a free for all\nWhy do qualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a lifelong liberal now moving somewhere near the center laid waved to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings my colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what was happening\n... denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt originally impossible imprisonment\nHe may no longer be able to teach law coach sports are expected to be treated respectfully if he could be forced to resign as current traditional position because having a coat convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence\nOr some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he could go back to his life it Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life\nWill never be the same\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair and issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote\nBe resolved against the accused nominee but we live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism\nWe must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrat Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy is\nEven know if you read the report of racial Mitchell the woman who seems to have asked you know put very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bunny assessment of Dr forwards allegations in a legal context in the legal context here's my bottom line and he said she said taste is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell a prosecutor is extra buck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee newer ... believers evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then to understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard that's different from\nBeyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThe Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus\nDelayed the confirmation one vote one week as the FBI mated visual in where he met with guys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate and also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice [noise]\nNow if it in fact when we get word that the FBI is done and that should all center as well have the report it's okay to file the notion of cloture because that's just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right under the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\n... you know senator I represented the victim of a sexual assault on a major college campus I catch anymore because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to victims because the institutions in America have not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nThe terrifying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraph inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nDid not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that's very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there problems whether testimony\nWell there are some eyes of well a Rachel Mitchell a that was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um\nAnd I thought did a very professional job but I thought she got the basic facts out demonstrated that there are gaps I understand that victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after\nThirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated allegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry ... Adler the incoming chairman of how to sharing committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh why I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking he did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful in attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're off on this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts as five friend the majority leader like say a ... continue to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cut number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats\nAll of them all up all of

basically confirmed\nThat yes now I think things very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge cabinet knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or hug not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I\nI thought I thought he handled it appropriately uh there were a couple of times where I think well one time any particular where he asked a judge or ... or corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut ah he shouldn't be expected just to uh take uh this this slander these allegations of\nCriminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they had been falsely accused I think would be angry and um be justified in showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a ... some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge Kaplan I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican dozens of boredom his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the ...\nI think

FBI investigation\nAnd then it was written by the president of the ... the name of Robert crossing\nTurns out Robert Carlson deny permission from the standing committee to send that letter and they're unhappy that he sent it without their permission and they're unhappy that people are suggesting that the ADA has withdrawn its support of Brett Kavanaugh they have not here's an article from the national review headline American Bar association backs Kevin out despite previous letter to the contrary\nPoor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst or you know abusers of the trade laws and on the planet one other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump had his past outbreaks of one of the point she said\nIs he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but\nWhat is it working because these countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office\nSays it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of Comic Con and found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did you know and I told them I disagreed with among that I think you know I actually help traps now they're back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nBut Trump also had a point that it could be approved this was the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to come up any longer\nBut it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open our borders are between all three countries it is modernized because America has a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage out another country should right and that's one of the things I don't like about this be also very it got me on that one I've not you know we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of out of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan\nShow I'm going to agree with you on that\nOne so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and lowers terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nNot just how do I was just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot
