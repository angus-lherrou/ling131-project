I didn't even know there was an ex rating uh but ... ... the difference being the regular half and the effects is that if you're supported by a it was crazy moms against everything in every town for gun safety and and the Bloomberg folks then you get the ax after you're apt to say that uh\nYou know you've been bought so he's he's but he's been bought by the uh the anti guns\nOr he's running against\nRon dissenters who's a Iraq War vet navy veteran and uh and uh you know is is very very conservative and backed by President Trump's though where you know hoping things go right to their\nUh the see the next one I got as Mike what about the what's the latest with sixteen thirty nine I sixteen thirty nine out of Washington state\nI Know you've had to mark talk to you about this before I have talked about this a march program I talked about this on my program so we'll give you I I give you the latest I got on on sixteen thirty nine if for folks that they're they're just just tuning in first time sixteen thirty nine as the\nGun control agenda that said that it's going to make it's going to make Washington them more miserable place well listen everything east of Seattle you know or or north of the you know and and south of Seattle is is is is pretty nice well to call them I guess so the that Sea Tac area over in there as become\nThe new as a new north ... ah California\nSo they've they've they brought up a lot of those California rolls rest of Washington state's beautiful place or you know I'm visual wise and and and uh and law why statute wise but a sixteen thirty nine the issue is to puts an extremely I don't have enough time we only got five minutes left I don't have time to give you\nA are you know all the sixteen thirty nine would do if a if you're just tuning in\nA in a couple of easy ones are are are the you know that everybody is going to register guns or you have to put 'em all of your firearms or into the registry or you have are you in this this is done through the sales that can be no more private sales is what sixteen thirty one of the things sixteen thirty one nine once as a um\n... and that's how it's done is every every time you get a gun is sold you have to go through the background check process uh and then that creates a the database there obviously raises the rates to uh to her she made the age of Twenty one years old and the state of Washington to purchase any kind of firearm um\n[noise] it's it's just horrible it's horrible for gun owners and Second Amendment supporters and people that believe in you know the constitution in this in this country but\nThis this uh this bill or is this proposal that's now on the ballot this ballot initiative\nOr had to get the proper number of signatures to get put on the ballot it was done completely a half a half baked a you know they they they didn't follow the rules and follow the law or the ... if I recall even the judge that reviewed the case said\nListen the type fought on here is so small I Can't read and I got twenty twenty vision they didn't follow the proper way of a of a entertaining and documenting what was the new part of the law was the old part of the law so the judge said no it's out of talked about\nI think I lasted three days three days and the Washington state Supreme Court said no it's back on we want we want the we want the citizens to decide yeah well obviously you know you're what you're left leaning a court you want your citizens of this I guess what if it sends a passing out there and it's challenged again by friends out at the second member foundation or wherever it happens\nTo be you know what those judges are going to say one more time well yeah we know it was bad but you know it's what they want it so we are going to we're going to let the real at all left habit so\nUm that's you know you're pretty much by my latest updates and a half or there is that uh this is still a a ... um the majority that I I saw somewhere with uh the the law enforcement age I think was the chief in sheriff's association\nOr that they came out and said they didn't they are against this they're against sixteen thirty nine so so they want to see that they want to see that gone as well\nUm let's see what a [noise] a Nike wanted to say a little Nike store a moment or two here I'm In the story yesterday with um my daughter she's a soccer player she needed to get some new shambles slides uh the kids go on these days and she went over in and she let her try him on herself she came and said daddy\nOr Thirteen Years old I'm does Nike ones they they fit the best and I said maybe they're Nike we can't get Nike she said why not I said ... remember that the Catholic thing with a meal on the flag and she she\nShe's holding them in their hand and at that point it was like she was holding like a dead snake and she told them by two fingers ... who in turn around dropped him on the shelf went over got a pair of a of a I think those are the deepest she grabbed and we we ended up with the so\nA cute story I don't know why they tell you that the beginning of program but I wouldn't want to say that um there's a\n... there was rumored that a sheriff's department out in Arkansas was putting Nike shirts on their prisoners to embarrass them that again and ended up being crap ended up being crap because\nAh they the sheriff said listen we got a whole box of free shirts here and we've got people coming in with no shirt so we got to take pictures or you know an intake so that's we're just dirty shirts on blacks or black people white people

good news\nUm looks like your pastor ... runs it will be coming up to the United states he\nGave me some of the details about that that that government been obviously working on their release but that process would be going to to military bases that's how these things are handled but ice threats to the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member ... family\nAre three she Asian for his unyielding unyielding a effort to obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers and support for the pastors and let me also say that uh I have a lot of idea what the media lot\nAs you know a ... in several different capacities outside the kill Jay but I Need to say this to my friends in the media\nThese reporters are for these ah newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matters type of Barry ... in covering pastor Brunson case and the story and that help keep them alive as part of the process when you got\nPeople held like this and I'm a I'm a huge thank you and I told us to a couple of reporters today I appreciate them covering it and continuing to cover it and uh that's across the board here uh it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN\nOr at covered extensively ABC ... uh that's covered it down and talked about it with George Stephanopoulos on ABC this week a couple of weeks back so a good news on that broad and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining us ... are now being processed out of\nTurkey and what that means is east they're removing the ankle bracelet which which is monitored 'cause it was a house arrest\nA will be taken to a military transport aircraft\nUh them probably blow that directly to Germany or be evaluated the return to the United states I don't know exactly when that law that will be yet we're ... into that but I'm a will keep everybody posted is this a progressive progressive over the next several hours but a great day\nUh on any time you get these releases like this door to a great day we're still waiting for the one on a CBP\nOr that case was earlier this week I Know this way way up to the others but yeah that they are there were reports running that that could be coming at any moment yeah I'm Out of the pack up and was a great day go ahead and\nThe Pakistani a Supreme Court that that case\nHere or what happened pastor Brunson\nUltimately was ordered is that is unique is similar in these situations as time served all the witnesses or I guess ... brunch who basically dropped their\nStories this morning in court in Turkey um it said they were that was they were not accurately reported as as uh what they had accused pastor Brunson of\nAnd ah and then ultimately the prosecutor I recommended in Turkey did he uh be allowed to travel or the ... no longer under judicial order and so that's why the ankle brace it will be coming off or is coming off as we speak right now\nHis house released a house arrest or will be released and ultimately I Will be given his passport and able to travel and and we plan on doing that um later on today\nA in Turkey I just to remind you this is someone who spent\nTwo years and containment a year and a half that in prison\nBecause of his Christian faith ... been there for twenty three years in Turkey and American\nI raised his family various three children he'll be reunited with the United states or two sons and one daughter whose daughter's spoken out a very publicly for her father even going to the United nations in Geneva a show again I've heard of his ... as a sister\nOn a as well so there's a family\nWhich is very excited to watch to see pastor Bronx is released it was a long and difficult process more difficult than it should have been with a NATO ally like turkey ... and that was not like a situation\nI'm In Iran or North Korea right by a with how complicated it got\n'em and because it's an American citizen dead I figure it's just as big of a deal or to see his freedom or saw everybody's a ... who was innocent and persecuted because their face it doesn't matter what countries doing it what relationship to us may have with that country or their release is something to celebrate\nWhat look absolutely and we're thrilled with the outcome here ... I Hope this also goes a long way in restoring relations between the United states and turkey Turkey's been an important ally of NATO ally\nAnd they play up strategic role in the region and it would be good to see those relations are stored and this was a positive step is a secretary Pompeo said it very positive step in that restoration process having said that also let me just say that this also gives you a glimpse\nAnd I'm going to go to bed on ... gives you a glimpse of that nature which we have these cases that was a unique situation here in that\nUm we had a situation where we had a NATO allies Jordan said that took custody of an American so a NATO ally taken custody of an American pastor\nIt happened to be also with the very same time but that pastor was a big jail\nHis family contacted us we immediately began a representation of him that predated my representation of the president but then of course not represent and it happened for over a year and a half built about a year now representing the president the United states and so it gave us a unique perspective on it and\nUh I think it was helpful for the past year or two to have an advocate back it obviously a speak with the president but having said that this president has been very very assertive on returning hostages that are Americans back to the United states is that a great track record there\nBut it was a unique perspective for me and we've had a lot of these over the years but this was a little bit unique in that sense but again I when I got back off with the president this morning I was just a really delighted with the ah with the news that we wanted to convey that I'd be set up a a video on Facebook immediately\nOr we set out some a report ports our social media outlets as well but we're glad now that we're talking with our our radio audience than I think it's important for you to state the nature of the bipartisan ship that was involved in this at what we were able to accomplish on the legislative level that help move this whole [noise]\nI think it was particularly important given the fact that you just pointed out jaded this was an ally of the United states that we had a vested interest in maintaining a good relationship with today we're grateful to both countries but you're right change this was a little bit different in that regard first of all it was important for the administration\nIn a to speak with one voice the vice president the president the secretary state ambassador brown back being in the courtroom Jay but then in Congress I mean\nI I I Would first get they give me a tip of the hat to senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrat from New Hampshire who went over to turkey herself and J I Will tell you was extremely engage behind the scenes\nBoth on putting pressure on turkey when when it was appropriate but then also engaging diplomatically with turkey and reassuring turkey did the and I'd states wanted a strong relationship with him and and free and pastor Andrew Brunson was the best way to accomplish that and so\nYou know there was sort of a a team of four senator Lankford senator tell us who went down to the floor of the United States Senate every single week for the past several months to speak on behalf of the pastor and Senator Graham but Jay\nMultiple letters multiple congressional testimony a pastor Brunson daughter came up to Congress to testify visits to turkey engaging diplomatically and also through pressure means up\nBy camera all bipartisan and all of them J. speaking with one voice from the half the United states government a behind the president\nAnd at the same time I use it to my uh came our team your teeth are that are listening and members of the AC okay your team at the gate bad bet it is Steven DC a great work with ... with a team at the European Central on justice engaging un on multiple occasions\nUh so we're very happy that are very happy with the way this tape\nCame out a Logan team that was in charge of the media and social media raising a year steak you toward tire eat we eat a lot when we say we utilize all the lawyers\nOr government affairs a professionals\nAre mediate professionals so suddenly the professionals video media proposals everyone engaged in this top to bottom\nGoal here I thought that that kind of bigger picture I even heard pastor Brunson a sister talking about that how important of a ally turkey is the United states and that you shouldn't have this kind of relationship so that's very important Senator Graham was talking about that\nAs well I I just want to underscore to all of you\nAre thanks and how how important it is to stay with it these are tough cases they take us a long time\nI uh ... you try diplomatic options um you could ah we had a White House and a president willing to take steps a after diplomacy or or was not working just to get it done even issue things like us a targeted sanctions on Turkish officials\nTo see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough\nUm how important it is that all of you stood by for those two years I'm a pastor Brunson I Know he thanks you add to his family thinks shoe and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story\nUm I think he will come to realize even more so over the next twenty four forty eight hours how many people were following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states is certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows or something I'll be doing later today who ... who stood with this story I Would this American pastor because of his wrongful imprisonment I we've got a second half hour coming up on Jay Sekulow alive\nWritten take your

Andrew Brunson after two years being in prison and then under house arrest in Turkey because of his Christian faith after a working as a Christian pastor in Turkey for twenty three years so I think the issue at all\nRaising his family their three children who wait a their father as fathers return to the United states um he has been released after this two year a horrible ordeal\nI and I know it's been in the news a lot a lot today but I always want to make sure people tune in and out of radio broadcast that they do a director for justice represented the Bronx and saying we continue to do so there's a lot worse they're raised to be done\nUm at as we air right now he's not yet left turkey\nI'm a for somebody you hear the broadcast at different times that may have changed uh but uh but again a he has been free by the court a and a and these past four returned ankle bracelet being taken off because he was under house arrest and ... and ultimately I Will return to the United states\nMay uh will likely stopped a ... at a military US military base in Germany I'm a which she could be on his way to as early as this evening I'm with his wife we are going\nTo take more your phone calls in one hundred sixty four thirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four thirty what we've been taking throughout the show so we do have some phone lines open for you right now if you want to talk to us on the air if you've got a key questions about this matter or about how helpful the White House has been members of Congress have been in fact let me play\nSenator Lindsey Graham ah who was on I just saw a on a TV this morning about a pastor Brunson\nHe's played a key role listen to what he did on behalf of pastor Brunson\nThat's been too long gears is kill I talked to a person or to wind up about it directly affected relationship\nMainstream proven this would be a great step forward person tromp advised first of all over this and satellite put in Tillerson shade pushing very hard for a long time when he gets home I'll feel better but he's not home yet\nAnd I think again that is that everybody obviously you feel that way too is that you want to alternately see this a hundred percent completed\nAnd that is to be that's kind of leaving Turkish airspace that military base or whether that's Germany is a U.S military base I stand these members of Congress like Lindsey Graham said they they played a key role even go as far as uh not just usually their contacts to meet with\nThe president turkey but also to go right into the prison to meet with pastor Brunson\nYeah far more than just issued a statement or giving his speech tournament several members of the house and Senate went over to turkey or to visit with a pastor Brunson also to visit with officials I mean do you think about senator tell US Senator Shaheen who\nUh use their seats in the Senate Armed Services Committee or to raise this issue Jordan so you know they they injected it into a conversation about defense programs that they cared an awful lot about and we're willing to take a human rights case like pastor Brunson into that debate and it really did put\nA leverage into the situation and again I Want to cast it in this lady was not you know leverage that was looking to push turkey away in fact\nUh I think Senator Graham said it very well he wants a strong relationship with turkey he wants turkey in the United states to have a positive relationship\nAnd he was very careful and directing communicating to his Turkish colleague that this this release of pastor Brunson was going to be necessary for that relationship\nTo be as healthy as he would like it to be so again a singer Lankford senator tell US Senator Shaheen senator grant and many others Jordan did weigh more than ... speak out about this they made it a priority for them and they spend hours and hours and hours are working on the case\nUh let me go to Pam called Oklahoma on line one I think it's important called the take right now Pam welcome to Jay sexual alive\nI'm so glad they were ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... and I want to thank everybody and I call it a bad night having salon not gonna stop pray Kelly it\nLiterally I just you know I think you heard what Senator Graham says they'll feel a whole lot better you continue to pray I prefer this family even after he's back to the United states
