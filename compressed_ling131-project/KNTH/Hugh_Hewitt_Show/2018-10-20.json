Seventy year old mom\nCops received a disturbance call at about five Fifteen pm on friday last they arrived to find bystanders had men or ... administering the lights of life saving procedures on

herself and her mom as they were being attacked\nOn our county sheriff's captain Tim hemp pills that and I quote evidence and witness statements collected to this point support the claim of self defense of course they do of course they do of course they do because this is the second amendment in action and according\nTo the Bonner county daily be bought our county sheriff's office is saying and their headlights shooting may be self defense is shooting is self defense I can promise you that\nBut let's go to some of his deputies and a priest river police officer was summoned to the one hundred block of rebel ridge road after receiving a port report of a disturbance at five Fifteen PM prior to the officers arrival dispatchers advise them that a forty one year old woman shot up thirty nine year old man who was attacking her and her Seventy year old mother\nWhen the cops got they're recording this piece as I just mentioned bystanders were administering lifesaving procedures on Joshua Mac you called Spirit Lake\nThe preliminary investigative finding according to the B she has to do and to this and what is this a bond or county daily be\nSaid to be forty one year old woman was acting in self defense of her mother and her self evident to witness statements collected at this point support that claim\nInvestigation is open though some of what we talk about on the show all

as you can the U.S each day by the way is a great place to start\nOh boy yeah it's subject to review by the bought our county prosecutor's office for a decision on whether any criminal charges are warranted but let me tell you something when the sheriff pops out and tells you that this appears to be a clear cut case of self defense is highly unlikely\nThat this woman forty one year old woman and Seventy year old mother are going to be or the woman is going to be charged for any for any crime it is highly unlikely that would be very very surprised apparently the loser has had some uh charges in the past\nI guess she had been charged with marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession in addition to domestic violence in the presence of a child in ... county and twenty Fifteen\nAnd says the drug possession of domestic violence charges were dismissed by the state and call pled guilty to the paraphernalia charges according to Idaho's online course database\nSo if this incident

who is now back home in the United states was at the oval office with the president sci fi I was there as well on Monday and sees me Sunday and took the day off\nA that was Saturday Sunday and Monday kind of took a day to recover and then I did some media interviews this morning we're thrilled that he's with us a pastor before I did you say anything to you let me say what Pamela on Facebook says so thankful for your freedom pastor Brunson Andrew welcome to the broadcast\nThank you very much I Want to I Want to I think for on behalf of our entire audience um let you know and you know just as we talked about this as you literally had the world praying for you and the folks that are listening does the millions that listeners broadcast every day and we're praying for you without the U.S teaching but can you describe\nFor folks I think this is important for everybody understand you were in Turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey and and what's your activities were and then we'll we'll we'll bring a current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I first say something that we are so grateful to people prayed for us and we are so grateful for a field day a such a tremendous job fighting for us and uh the the uh high all was tireless and advocating for us and you also J uh at\nFirst he see I Know she's a ... lawyer but she was also\nA personally involved calling Noreen encouraging her and so many ways and a and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ACL J\nUh took this on and uh we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous uh uh help this was and and I'm grateful we are too\nWell look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we got another case right now where do we haven't had that result right now and that is a representing is helping to see a baby and her office in Pakistan but your case ended successfully but you were there in prison in Turkey in very difficult circumstances but I think is a I'll take a call them and many here\nBut I ... Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nWell we were there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to uh go and priests to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in with church planting we're involved with several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attack Syria a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid\nBut also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurtz have never met a Christian or in their lives and in Syria you're kind of preach the gospel it was forbidden so we got involved with a Syrian refugees and we're a started meeting among them and we're doing evangelist and what's that\n[noise] so you were there as basically it's a missionary I mean we can safely say that no we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did a very openly we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... a mission work to Syria's what it's all done out of the open\n... before we take costs pastor Brunson the question that over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local uh style regional government or the national government in Turkey and all\nWell there are cycles sometimes\nThey're more accommodating to churches into Christians are sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up uh we had a they're often rather than from the government it's from a\nA a there are people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats or we were attacked once at our church with a man came with a shotgun\nSo that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but it's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to arrest you and try and one of the one of the charges was Christian ... so ... nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that and that part of the world but but what happened to you is something that has not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing yes\nSo you there's one follow up thing we're doing you know I said your case is closed and that's a great thing 'cause you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but she she you got it we still one legal issue we're going to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah they engaged in\nThe working group on arbitrary detention on engaged and pay ... percent of the whole case to ban here still making their decision and said that I have to announce finalize ... than what the professional I went to court that he's back\nAnd I said family with actually that decision and the conviction and and what can release conditions where\nOh here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally jammed Facebook comments coming in Eleanor said God is so good so happy to pastor Brunson history Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly here due to answer prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving to God and I said that the beginning to broadcast\nA Andromeda you caught and I said this and I I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work that was done by our team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that day in ... and Washington and government affairs shop and Greg ...\nWho runs for office in ... and it's just a great job and and and the circumstances of that I was representing you and then ended up representing the president I mean you none of nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day\nThese though I I Believe that with and you just have to take nothing away from any one\nThat uh the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to give credit where credit's is also do you're not just the way we feel is a institutionally\nBut let me do this we we Andrew we've got a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that phone and we're going to start taking calls yes Karen is calling in from New York on line to Karen welcome\nTo Jay Sekulow live Hi Karen you're on the past right ...\nYou for taking my call and I ...\nDaily I'm so thankful for parents to answer any harm and I wanted to let him know\nWhat an inspiration ... testimony as a Christian to other Christians throughout the world and um the light that he was in the dark room and I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian to um the mold\nAnd preach the gospel time there's that's what were called to do so I Want to thank him and tell them how happy I Am to have him back in the United states\nWill do what you're talking right to um Andrew where where do you what do you say the ...\nWell we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who prayed for us and we believe a obviously a God used as a people are but I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level or with the president\nA it was was periods of God's people and but I also think that\nAs we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to ride a for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as a almost like we're looking at a puzzled but from the bottom side\nAnd someday we will look from the top and will actually see the picture right now we don't see the full picture but God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from ... prison a I think there was he was just pouring prayer from God's people\nInto turkey and into the middle east and that there is going to be\nA great harvest from this we haven't seen all of what all of the results yet but I think there there was much bigger than us\nI think you're right and again I I think the confluence of events that took place here was was pretty unprecedented I say that\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give up or to anyone we asked the president and if we could pray for him he was very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air with pastor Brunson Julie\nI encountered in part\nBecause of all that's why I don't remember the hail today it per se clear about one individual and they care about us since the whole world and passed up on her like question you and they can feel the pressure on her people around the world\nHere and around the globe this is a global number back one more in just a moment\nAm tense at the end\nStores now the United states as soon as the Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf Israel and is very right to exist ... been issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issues of the world is more Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies about\nISIS among the law in Iran all pledged white is real from the police of the new book times best selling author Jean secular present so powerful political and historical rationale\nThe existence of Israel wants to sovereign nation Jerusalem was cool and historical things for the Jewish account for since you were\nTo remove any down about Israel's right to exist in the book do spells legal miss by Israel's enemy\nToday in Jerusalem in middle school in historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon\nThis radio stations and he's not going to let that happen and then the answer [noise]\nHear dam on the right thing for your testimony in the fullness of Jesus I\nGuess I'm going to say is pastor Andrew Brunson let's go ahead and we're gonna continue to take calls so you can speak to pass runs we'll get to as many as we can\nGo next to Jerry is calling from Tennessee on line six Terry welcome to Jay Tsinghua live you're on with pastor Brunson picturing\nBoth they don't have to show that I failed and our heavenly father\nAnd our own trace my faith in God that hey you know where we are at all times and the dark probably only Kelly\nLike Patrick prank phone hit failing [noise] and so is there any more or in Gary ... told me what I had the courage to stand up for my faith and ask pray for\nParts Katy Perry can still have that\nPower from Todd how could I react and Elena whole that whole can call April ... to get ready get ready for that time there for a full strength and courage cashed out\nAndrew yeah so I I think\nThat's a very important question and ah\nI noticed one thing one when we when my wife and I were held together for Thirteen Days were arrested at the same time and I have a a seminary degrees I have a peace day New Testament and I've taught for many years and preached and uh yet I saw that my wife\nWas stronger than I was during the Thirteen days and it came from\nA deep devotion and she has and I should say a consistent time with the lord every day for years she set time aside and she read the Bible and she just spent time in God's presence and prayed\nAnd I was more sporadic I'd run fast and then I'd slowed down but she was very consistent and\nUh it's not that she had incredible revelations every day but it was the uh over time the consistency and just feeding herself so that when the crisis came and wear\nNFL together there are people and from ISIS and the cells around us and we thought what's happening what's going to happen we had no idea so we're Thirteen Days cut off a together and and that are holding fatter and she was doing better than I was\n... fan so I thought this is a message says she carries and that I found a ... I Want to practice as well as emphasize just a consistent time spent with God it's strengthened says uh for the difficulties or will you be able to handle it when it comes\nA well you get the grace at that time [laughter] you know before and uh sometimes it doesn't feel like enough to be honest with you sometimes it doesn't feel like enough and I'm working through that but the fact is that it did it it was enough\nI just want to remind people pass the Bronx and kind of citizen passing because I think his experience in Turkey for so long but because of the refugee flow out of Syria and ... that he was even in that original holding the Dow deportation facility\nOut there with his wife was a prisoners from ISIS\nYeah I mean this is these were a difficult situation right from the beginning uh and then he's a man you got to remember that yeah the ... the ice is part of this because turkey was dealing with this overflowed people out of Syria some who were ISIS fighters so again I didn't want people to to miss that it it passed readers' comments will go right back\nTo the phones had David in Washington state on line five David you're talking to pastor Brunson\nHello pastor Brunson my name is David ... on the Jewish American the air force whereabouts in ... by more radical Islamic ... when I was stationed at ... my ... from the Truman ... um especially considering my circumstances ended with you and how ... assets that was true for more\nThan although I can only imagine that enjoy them too many others that I Know when the pollen count on social media including those with Jewish ... every single day\nAnd followed you with a ... as much as possible\nYou know pastor I was thinking about that too I mean we we you know you don't even we don't even know the ... we know the numbers of the reach that we have we not many millions\nI'm listening each day and all that but I think that the fact is is what David just said that you literally had the world praying for you know you felt lonely at times and we do we talked about that I hear on the air but the world praying for you um those friends made a huge difference in your life and and you release I Believe\nThat they they did and I as I said and I keep thinking again and again how does that make any sense on a human level that so many people were praying for me and I think that God was doing this putting us on people's hearts\nAnd that's because there's a much greater purpose behind this and he is going to use these bears to bring harvest not only in Turkey but in the countries around it so it it's a very much a God thing we don't feel worthy of all of this prayer or many I feel very humbled by it\nAnd are not at all but uh but incredibly grateful for it\nLet me go right to the phones John ... in North Carolina\nOn line three John Mark welcome you're talking to pass or brunch at\nA thank you for having me on a answer tell me a sense of elation fat and feeling of breed on your clients when you're released and also was there a Bible verse looking back in hindsight that has come to mind about your release and it and\nLet me and I just want to make a ... that's a great question let me I'm trying to get to some more questions you're ... that's a great question I'm so you're at the trial that ... on that did did did they really did night of the release of the day the release and you finally find out when the judge says time served what went through your head\nWell I can tell you the ten minutes before that we did not know that that was going to happen we didn't know if I had a bag packed to go back to prison and we didn't know if they were going to get me Fifteen Years or twenty or what and uh we thought maybe this will just the lead to another escalation\nPolitical escalation\nAnd who knows when all come out or it's all come out so when I heard time served a it was almost unbelievable and Noreen came up to me or near the front of the court and we just got down on the floor together we know together and we thank God uh NFL\nWas your reaction inside the courtroom\nI think most people are ran out to file their stories because\nThey kept actually that day they kept most of the believers out who it comes to support is a they weren't allowed in the courtroom so it was primarily a media\nYeah I I couldn't imagine what it was like I Know we had ... was it was a ...\nThe whole process I remember that night because I was talking to see she I mean all throughout the literally we said Ravi me I mean it was the morning to in the morning three in the morning for in the morning and and that process of your release and then getting to the airport you know as long as you're walking through every page the bat\nI'm but I also want to say this to this um the state department and the staff\nAt the end but she's what a great job you know we've fought very hard for her now to be the ambassador from the United states to Germany and then I find out from Rick about an hour before he met you a Andrew that record now being Basset or we're going to come and meet you at one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning and I thought that was a quite a moment to\nThat was very touching a we got off the plane we just we just left turkey obviously very intense circumstances that we got off the plane at the air force base and someone walks up to Seventy says the ambassador to US ambassador to Germany and\nIt's one thirty in the morning or and I'm thinking what are you doing out here [laughter] you know he was talking to you on that at all and they had to be an American flag that had come from you come from Berlin and in front of the Berlin Embassy and gave me an American flag and and I just a kiss\nBritish and English law farther than even the right to religion so you know freedom of religious certainly but also a freedom of speech so it's it's one of the oldest rights that were brought over to a colony is or to the new world by the British settlers at least\nIronic that the British have lost some of their rights\nYes indeed\nWell I don't know how you could settle a wilderness without having guns especially when you've got wild animals there who might see you as part of their lunch menu and and the the natives the indigenous people who weren't too happy about these invaders\nWell certainly the most unique aspect of our gun culture which I think is a continuing from those days comes from\nFrom just the reality of living in a in a place in the wilderness that is populated by people who are often times aggressive and wants to Hershey so um but more than that even you know the the the the initial people who came here want it to settle here but they also have to deal with the French\nAnd Spanish and others who were sort of infringing on their own\nUh settlements and so forth so they\nSo surf putting together the the the the the ideological and philosophical understanding of what it meant it with the with the just the everyday practical necessity of having a gun is for individuals that they kept moving west probably until the Nineteen fifties event\nAh the gun was an integral part of of of their tool kit as it were and and almost every family had one\nReally has become a a\nI Would say a part of the ... floor of American history when I was growing up in the Nineteen fifties early sixties uh my youth was dominated by television shows and movies that were all about the gunslinger ears and having a gun to get through life\nThat had a huge part of ... of the American consciousness\nThat for for me as well even today in movies with the guns used to watch it in ... all the time you know most of that is with allergy though you know I mean in the sense that\nOf course people needed guns and they use them to protect themselves but a friends that's when we talk about the west the sorts of violence that we see in movies is rarely actually happened that way they the gunslinger is who who teaches guns were off and just sort of released a psychopath or [laughter] or not any sort of anti hero\nAnd um because when lots of people have to protect somebody take a step back dodge city which we we all know about I think er during the gun slinging error the murder rate was around a little over one person per year\nWasn't as if people were shooting them each other out all the time but\nI'm certainly people needed those weapons and the reason probably that crime wasn't as high as because you know if you're going to pick out a gun and everyone else has one as well it's it's probably going to go a little bit more difficult week for years and it would as criminals today who have guns and and don't fear any retribution\nYeah I think about my my own grandmother who was homes that are out in northwestern Nebraska a hundred years ago more than a hundred years ago and she talked about being afraid my husband would go on account of bribes and my grandfather and uh she would be left alone with the baby there on on in the middle of literally in the middle of nowhere\nShe didn't know she had a gun but I I don't think she never occurred to her she was worried about people coming to the door in the middle of the night and I was in an era when you didn't lock your doors and all that so she was scared to death of those experiences\nBut she never talked about thinking about pulling the gun out in those days so I think you're right about the mythology of the Old West\n[noise] yeah I mean some it's it's difficult to quantify what how how much violence there really was people didn't keep records and the way that they do now but we still have some sort of quite a bit of evidence that there wasn't as much\nViolence has certainly as the movies portray all the time and it's not safe not entertaining it's fun and and guns didn't play a big part in that in that world that they did I mean a lot of the guns that cold made for instance in an an others at that time\nTo find them the sharks rifle and others repeating rifles help people hunt buffalo and survive and that way so it was a big part of life but it wasn't always aimed at other human beings certainly\nRight um I guess the part that comes up in the American argument over guns today always comes back to the wording of the second amendment where do you think that came from where where does that because it's the issue of the militia and all that\nWell I go see that history in my book and it's complicated it's almost as if it was over edited in a way but the thing is that is no one\nUntil maybe the Nineteen thirties ever even challenge the notion that owning a gun at Second Amendment with an individual right it's a complete modern concoction it's not something that anyone argued about certainly not at the founding what they're arguing about then was who control the militias the state\nTo state so the federal government most states in fact in their own constitutions it's very clear amendment store in the constitution itself very clearly stated that are owning a weapon was an individual right I'm going to protect them from the state\nThat was one of the main purposes because as a gun is a tool of survival was a no brainer it was like breathing you couldn't really do it without a gun so um\n[noise] the wording itself I mean that you know is it's complicated die in Madison was trying to to to ah just make it a a wide ranging amendment it turned out to be a little bit a slightly written I hate to even say that about a founder but it's true so I think a clear amendment would have been better but\nI think ah Scalia recently in the Heller decision not that recently ten years ago I'm\nReally laid out the history of of of of the event minute why was an individual right\nYeah and I think you know if you go back to the history and that's where we like to do when we try to understand these a cloud only worry is ... not a word I don't know [laughter] less than clearly written things in our history or we go back to history to find out what they had in mind and as you say they were afraid of the state\nThere's literally not a single person not one found or that I Know of a that argued\nBefore the gun gun rights being a collective right not one there's not a single argument about it no one not a single founder or anyone else at the time that even the British\nAh during the revolution ever made the argument that people shouldn't be allowed to own guns because they should be able to protect themselves they were simply trying to uh you know preemptively stop the revolution that the people who fought at Lexington Concord against the far superior British force um we're\nWe're defending a cache of weapons without that cache of weapons they wouldn't be able to find any of their other freedoms which is why I called the book first freedom so I think another reason I called the book first freedom is because how you view the second amendment we're\nNot talking about specific debates about\nSafety but just generally how you view the idea that an individual should be able to defend himself is property in his family started turning to the state all the time tells us a lot of it how you view individual freedom in general I think\nYou know if you don't think the gun played a big role though in the throughout the history of the United states we've been talking about Sears lately because they filed for bankruptcy and I I've gone through some of those old Sears catalog the section on firearms is enormous\nAnd kind of gun you can imagine caliber is that you've never heard of a back then they end up apparently the everybody had one\nOn the Nineteen fifties there was a huge up kicking in hunting as a hobby and other sort of Shooting Sports which has not you know which lately have served diminished but at the time there was just an explosion\nOf a sort of guns and then later when criminality rose a sort of the modern debate was framed and some people said we have to get rid of all guns and other people said we need more guns to defend ourselves for criminals and there was another by the Nineteen nineties there was another huge explosion of gun ownership\nUm so yeah I mean it's been part of our lives forever and do what you know since the beginning of American history for sure\nAnd you know the other thing that I I find interesting in this whole discussion is is that we we talk about kids having guns and access to guns and all that kind of thing and certainly there should be a training and and safety regulations put in in place\nBecause of the danger to children but you know when I was twelve and most of the friends that I had at the time and everybody I talked to about their age eleven twelve Thirteen we all had guns\n[laughter] twenty two I had friends who had shot guns they went hunting I Would go out with my friends and we do squirrels and stuff like that this was just a part of American a childhood at the time of strangely I I'm sure it does seem we're doing a lot of people today but that's the way it was\nWell it's funny because I grew up in New York or the New York area in New York City and for me was the opposite whenever anyone spoke about guns that was always in a negative connotation typically criminals are the only ones who had guns in my experience so uh it was a little bit different and\nThat's part of why why where my curiosity began about gun culture and I want it to explain and understand because it it'd\nBe a logical I believed in the second amendment and philosophically I Believe in the right to self defense but I had it really didn't understand gun culture until I moved to Colorado many years later I hadn't fired a gun until I was in my thirties so [noise]\nUm for me that I think growing up in a place where there wasn't gun culture sort of drove the curiosity to explain why America was so unique compared to any other country in the world\nYeah well New York's always been a little off [laughter] well actually\nIn New York at the ... gun control laws or you know in the early Nineteen hundreds so they've always been a head of the ... in a bad way a\nLot of New Yorkers were on board for the American revolution either so\n[laughter] that's true\nDavid thank you so much I really enjoyed this tell me about your book where you can get it and all that again\nWhich is interesting because you know racial until very recently Harry Reid and Bill Clinton\nAnd Barbara Jordan and Dianne Feinstein we're all very very strong on\nThe difference between a legal and illegal immigration but the Democrats
