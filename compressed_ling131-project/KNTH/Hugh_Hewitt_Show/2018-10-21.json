I made the statement that the Senate I bet that the people must rule eventually\nTo which the left his critics like this fellow from GQ would respond but the Senate prevents the majority from rolling so I'd like to expand on on how in fact the majority will work its will as it did in the thirties it just take some time\nThat's right well so you know obviously if\nThere's if there's a public opinion\nSo sewed Madison many in there to supply places in the federalist where Madison's\nA describes what will be achieved by the constitution and then the fifty first federalist forty nine to can't remember now sorry he says I'm\nA a\nIt is the reason alone of the people that should be placed in control of the government their passions should be controlled by it\nNow how do you achieve that well you spread authority across the country that is what the Senate does\nBut then the second thing is even bigger than that and this thing just the whole structure of the constitution if you were the argument to get rid of the Senate is an argument to get rid of the whole constitution because the house is represented from districts every\nTwo years and the Senate is elected\nFor six years from states and the president is elected nationally every four years and then a lot of the power is is lodged in the states and they have lots of different systems right\nAnd that means to get a big dramatic thing done you have to ... you have to ask the people their opinion over a series of elections\nAnd isn't it it's just so you just gave the game away though\nUm it's an attack on the constitution right not really an attack on the Senate it's an attack on the constitutionality there the whole thing and and ... to the end of what that's what we really got to get to wire people attacking the Senate in order to attack the constitution what is the motive Larry on what is their objectives\nWell the cat the attack on the constitution started with the rise what was you know they've been several there was one one slavery became a big deal people decided they loved it under the influence by the way of a bunch of ... ideas of the evolution foreign to the founding of America\nThey they then they were attacking constitution are supporting it you know abolitionists would attack the ... tech slavery a southerners wanted more Confederate white more slavery would attack it because it doesn't give us enough protection for our slaves in the territories\nRight so these things are not new but the current one starts in the Eighteen eighties nineties with ... Wilson is a big author and what he says is this regime of checks and balance\nIt's a it's a like Newton like his picture of the universe but now we have darling and we know the government is living organism and has to change right so the progressive movement is very impatient with this\nBecause the fact that people should understand is right the effect of the constitution is to make public opinion\nPowerful and sustained way in the end even today with the government has its limits on more than half of the economy right even today it does matter so very much what the people think\nAnd to sustain that and get that that is what the constitution does but their idea that progressive Joe Wilson for example what he thinks is\nExperts people who know people who can apply science to public policy should become much more influential in the government\nAnd that's what gives rise to this fourth branch of government which now makes most of our laws and in forces them and and educate them in their independent ... hundred and fifty or so independent agencies\nThat that's where all that came from and it is by the way a change in the nature of sovereignty\nBecause sovereignty came in the in the American revolution according to the nature of the individual then you're born a person you're not on a horse or a dog and so you have to be by your nature govern only with your consent the new way as\nWe have power over nature now and if we use science and knowledge that we can perfect the society and people who have that science and that knowledge they become a new kind of suffering\nAnd so of course the constitution must be swept away because it's specific achievement is that it keeps the people in control of the government for a long time\nAnd that is the whole game in every attack on the Senate and that is why today's Hillsdale dialogue needs to travel far and wide before these elections and hopefully we'll even got some no nothing's a constitutional intent and freedom to pay attention to a doctor Larry on a building with college thank you I Want everyone to go to Hillsdale\nAm tends to be the answer\nIs a critical time for our nation and for the world\nWith so many

and the phone lines are jamming up our guest I Am happy to say our client a pastor Andrew Brunson who is now back home in the United states was at the oval office with the president she see I was there as well on Monday I'll see if we Sunday and took the day off\nI don't you know it was Saturday Sunday and Monday kind of took a day to recover and then I did so many interviews this morning we're thrilled that he's with us a pastor before I did you say anything to you let me say what Pamela on Facebook says so thankful for your freedom pastor Brunson Andrew welcome to the broadcast\nThank you very much I Want to I wanted I think for on behalf of our entire audience um let you know and you know just as we talked about this is where you literally had the world praying for you and the folks that are listening does the millions that listeners broadcast every day and we're praying for you without the U.S ceasing but can you describe\nFor folks I think this is important for everybody understand you weren't turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey and and what's your activities were and then we'll we'll we'll bring a current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I say something that we are so grateful to people prayed for us and we are so grateful for a field day uh did such a tremendous job fighting for us and uh the the ... was tireless and advocating for it\nAnd you also J uh efforts have the I Know she's a lawyer but she was also\nA personally involved calling Noreen encouraging her and so many ways\nAnd a and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ACL J\nUh took this on and uh we want everyone to know what\nA what a tremendous uh uh help this was and and I'm grateful we are too\nWell look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we got another case right now where do we haven't had that result right now and that is a representing us or helping to see a Bebe in our office in Pakistan but uh your case ended successfully but you were there in prison in Turkey in very difficult circumstances but I think is a I'll take the call them and many here\nBut I I Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nWell we were there for twenty four years before I was arrested and our main goal was to go and priests to this Christ\nOne of the main things we were involved in with church planting we're involved that several church plants and then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attack Syria\nA number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid\nBut also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurds have never met a Christian\nOr in their lives and in Syria you're kinda preach the gospel it was forbidden\nSo we got involved with a Syrian refugees and we're a started meeting among them and we're doing evangelists unless that\nSo you were there as basically it's a missionary I mean we can safely say that now we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did a very openly we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... I'm Michelle worked to Syria's what it's all done out of the open\n... before we take costs pastor Brunson the question that over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local uh style regional government or the national government in Turkey and all\nWell there are cycles sometimes are\nThere more accommodating to churches and to Christ centered sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up\nUh we had a they're often rather than from the government it's from a a a there are people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats or we were attacked once in our church with a man came with a shotgun\nSo that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but\nIt's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to arrest you and try and one of the one of the charges was ... ... nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that and that part of the world but but what happened to you is something that it not happen over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing yes\nSo there is one follow up thing we're doing you know I said your case is closed and that's a great thing because you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but see so you kind of we still one legal issue where you got to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah they engaged\nOn definitely in the working group on ... on engaged and pay ... percent of the whole case to ban\nThey're still making their decision and then I have to announce finalize ... than what the professional I went to court that he's back um I pay family with actually that decision a conviction and and what can release conditions where\nAll right here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally jammed Facebook comments coming in Eleanor says God is so good\nSo happy to pastor Brunson is free Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly here due to answer prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving the God and I said at the beginning of the broadcast a Andromeda caught and I said this and I I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work\nThat was done by a team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that they invented in Washington and government affairs shop and Greg ... who runs her office in ... and it just a great job in the end and the circumstances of\nThat I was representing you and then ended up representing the president I mean you none of nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day\nThese though I I Believe that with ... to take nothing away from any one\nThat uh the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to give credit where credit's also do not just the way we feel as a institutionally\nBut let me do this we we we've got a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that bone and we're going to start taking calls yes Karen is calling in from New York\nOn line to Karen welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nKaren you're on the pastor ... ... patients\nTaking my call and I did find a cow pasture grandson I pray for him daily I'm so thankful for prayers to answer any harm and I wanted to let him know\nWhat an inspiration hand testimony as a Christian to other Christians throughout the world and um the light that he was in the darkness and I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian\nTo uh be mold\nAnd preach the gospel time there's that's what were called to do so I Want to thank him and tell them how happy I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWill they will you're talking right to um Andrew where where do you what do you say to Karen\n... uh we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who create for us and we believe a obviously a guy that people are but I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level or with the president\nA it was was periods of God's people and but I also think that\nAs we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to rise a for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as a almost like we're looking at a puzzled but from the bottom side\nAnd someday we will look from the top and all actually see the picture right now we don't see the full picture but God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from print prison a I think there was\nHe was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey in into the middle east and that there's going to be\nA great harvest from this we haven't seen all of what all of the results yet but I think there there was much bigger than us\nI think you're right and again I I think the confluence of events that took place here was was pretty unprecedented I say that\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give us an opportunity when we asked the president if we could pray for him he was very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air would pass the Bronx I'm Julie\n... in Oregon topped ... because of all that's why I'm a member of the hail today the perfect clear about wanting to pitch all and they care about is the whole world and passed up on her question\nYou can feel occur Arthur people around the world ... ... ... it's hard to tell their friend Corey\nOK so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so\nMy wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day go through a whole day at work and just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fear that I had it's an irrational think perhaps\nBut when when one is isolated the way I was is it I Would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that for because I I felt very weak and so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one guard was rebuilding may I\nDid it feel God's presence very much\nBut uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a there was a grave coming to me that often was not felt right with like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I Would look back and say well I\nCame through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself\nYou know I Know it was great you know you're absolutely right in by we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs in a moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases during where people say the exactly the same exact was saying that they feel even though it's irrational they have no it's irrational in those situations there can there be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more of Andrew Brunson in just a moment\nJust simply conservative do not apologize for that we do not seeing them as they're suffering from talk radio would be\nEasy they're energized and we\nAlways conservative we are in them and the answer [noise]\nLive from Washington DC on line [noise]\nComes to the American Center for law and Justice Samuel oh\nThis is certainly a joyous occasion for us with this is not something we get to do often we cases you know it's it's interesting we've handled a number of these over the years\nUh and with the success in but sometimes it takes I mean this was actually number Andrew ... felt like a lifetime but in our work is important thing to point out\nWe've had him take four years we've got one right now with the C a bb going on six year nine nine okay since yet and since since came that's almost a decade so in one sense this was quick although when you're the one in prison it sure doesn't feel quick\nBut Andrew Brunson of course is now home in the United states and a lot of people all want to talk and before we get more calls and that's what we're going to do we want you to be able to talk to pastor Brunson\nUm for the next half hour this broadcast as we've done the first half hour but I Want to ask you something here because I Know this was on people's minds and that is what's next what what are you thinking next where do you pray and through\nWell we want to spend two or three months just seeking the lord and uh what he has for us but are we also need to go through some healing process or the lord has already done a lot of healing in our lives\nEspecially over the second year but but we still need to work through some things I think uh I Want to be a seeking a refreshment and the lord and as presents\nA and our hearts and then it makes sense for years is I haven't missions calling and it's still an missions so in some way a ...\nIt will continue so we're waiting for God to show us or how and where but that is where heart is\nSandra let me introduce you to somebody about another person from ... studios right now in Washington DC who worked on your case tirelessly with members of the United States Congress and that is Ben Ben he's our director of governmental parents were already in those and you haven't had the chance\nTo meet him yet he's ... your family all over the course of the last couple of years the representation than what's your reaction when you want to say the Vassar\nWell past the brunt of not just an honor to be with you and I just wanted to first of all say welcome home I I guess J just just real briefly I uh I Would tell this story to pass the bronze and yesterday I was on here with Jordan we were talking about pastor Brunson case and I was running late to a meeting when we got off the air when I walked into the meeting\nWhich was a dozens of of uh senators and congressmen officers were represented there\nAre they actually stop the meeting and the house leadership was on the agenda to talk about their priorities they stopped the meeting and they said actually we want to use our time to than from the ISI all day you just got here because we want to hear about pastor Brunson and how he's doing and how he has returned home so\nA pastor I just wanted to convey to you that is Halloween to the United states government is on the legislative level to your case\nIt was inspiring to me that they wanted to hear from you are so badly I knew a lot of them are looking forward to to meeting you and welcome you home and I would just say a an honor to honor to hear from you and honored to speak with you and welcome home\nWell thank you and for us is very surreal because\nUh we are not very important people and as we we as I said we've been working at a corner of turkey for many years and to see this level of interest or we can say is it is God who did this\nIt isn't just a natural thing and uh I Believe God did this because of a purpose is far beyond us or that he thinks he plans to accomplish if\nWe take another call yeah Barbara in New Jersey on line three or talk to the pastor Brunson Hi Barbara\nHi welcome back to the United states I Am so happy but you have I been crying for you I learn about your story a short time ago

night perhaps vision of persecution or that it would just be a time of joy and attempt to intimacy with God or even though it was a difficult time and I I didn't find that to be my experience for much of the time it was just hard\nAnd there were things that I really struggled with Annette questions about\nAnd there are some things I don't have an answer for them and I had to\nAm tends to be

ready for that time they pay for it to the strength and courage cash out\nAndrew yes I I think\nThat's a very important question and a ...\nBy noticed one thing one when we when my wife and I were held together for Thirteen Days were arrested at the same time and I have a seminary degrees I ever pays the New Testament and I've taught for many years have preached and uh yet I saw that my wife\nWas stronger than I was during the Thirteen days and it came from\nA deep devotion and she has and I should say a consistent time with the lord every day for years she set time aside and she read the Bible and she just spent time in God's presence and prayed and\nI was more sporadic I'd run fast and then I'd slowed down but she was very consistent and uh it's not that she had incredible revelations every day but it was the uh over time the consistency and just feeding herself so that when\nThe crisis came and wear NFL together there are people in from ISIS and the cells around us and we thought what's happening what's going to happen we had no idea so we're Thirteen Days cut off a together and and that are holding fatter and she was doing better than I was\n... fan so I thought this is a message says she carries and that I found a ... I Want to practice as well as emphasize just the consistent time spent with God it's strengthened says\nUh for the difficulties or will you be able to handle it when it comes\nA well you get the grace at that time you pay for and ah sometimes it doesn't feel like enough to be honest with you sometimes it doesn't feel like enough and I'm working through that but the fact is that it did it it was enough\nI just want to remind people pass the Bronx we kind of citizen passing because I think his experience in Turkey for so long but because of the refugee flow out of Syria and that he was even in that original holding the data deportation facility\nOut there with his wife was a prisoners from ISIS\nYeah I mean this is these were a difficult situation right from the beginning uh and then you got to remember that yeah the ... the ice is part of this because turkey was dealing with this overflowed people out of Syria some where ISIS fighters so again I didn't want people to to miss that it it passed readers' comments will go right back\nTo the phones that David in Washington state on line five David you're not going to pass the Bronx I David\nHello pastor Brunson money does David hobby I'm a Jewish American airports ... who's never moved by a more radical Islamic turtle when I was stationed at ride my ... some some truth in ... um especially considering my circumstances ended with you and how radical Islam paths that was true\nThen although I can only imagine that things are way too I and many others that I Know one of the parliament on social media including those who do is create a single day\nAnd ...\nIt's just a simple [noise]\nYou know pastor I was thinking about that too I mean we we you know you don't even we don't even know the ... it's hard we know the numbers of the reach that we have we not many millions I'm listening each day and all that but I think that the fact is is what David just said that you literally had the world praying for you\nI Know you felt lonely at times and we do we talked about that I hear on air but the world praying for you um those friends made a huge difference in your life and and you release I Believe\nThey they did and I as I said and I keep thinking again and again how does that make any sense on a human level that so many people were praying for me and I think that God was doing this putting us on people's hearts\nAnd it's because there's a much greater purpose behind this and he is going to use these bears\nTo bring harvest not only in Turkey but in the countries around it so it it's a very much a God thing we don't feel worthy but all of this prayer by many I feel very humbled by it and are not at all [laughter] but incredibly grateful for it\nLet me go right to the phones John Mark in North Carolina on line three John Mark welcome you're talking to a pastor Brunson\nA thank you for having me on a and to tell me the sense of elation fat and feeling of breed on your clients when you're released and also was there a Bible verse looking back in hindsight that has come to mind about your release and it can't\nLet me and I just want to make ... ...\nThat's a great question let me I'm trying to get to some more questions you're ... that's a great question um show your after trial that ... that one that did did did they really did nine of the release of the day the release and you finally find out when the judge says time served what went through your head\nWell I can tell you the ten minutes before that we did not know that that was going to happen we didn't know if I had a bag packed to go back to prison and we didn't know if they were going to get me Fifteen Years or twenty or what and uh we thought maybe this will just a lead to another escalation\nPolitical escalation and who knows when\nAll come out or it's all come out so when I heard time served a oh it was almost unbelievable and Noreen came up to me or near the front of the court and we just cut down on the floor together we know together and we thank God uh NFL\nWhat's your reaction inside the courtroom\nI think most people are ran out to file their stories because\nThey kept actually that day they kept most of the believers out who it comes to support is a they weren't allowed in the courtroom so it was primarily a media\nYeah I I couldn't imagine what it was like I Know we had ... was it was a ... [laughter]\nThe whole process I remember that night because I was talking to see she I mean all throughout the literally we say ... to me I mean it was the morning to in the morning three in the morning for in the morning and and that process of your release and then getting to the airport and you know as long as you're walking through a brief age the bat\nI'm but I also want to say this to the um the state department and the staff\nAt the embassies what a great job but you know we fought very hard to record now to be the ambassador from the United states to Germany and then I find out from Rick about an hour before he met you a Andrew that record now being Basset or we're going to come and meet you at one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning and I thought that was a quite a moment to\nThat was very touching a we got off the plane we just we just left turkey obviously very intense circumstances\nThat we got off the plane at the air force base\nAnd someone walks up to us and it says on the ambassador to the U.S ambassador to Germany and it's one thirty in the morning and I'm thinking what are you doing out here [laughter] you know [laughter] it was all can you hold on just at all and they had to be an American flag that had come from you come from Berlin and in front of the Berlin Embassy and\nNose in North Dakota Indiana Florida but none more than Missouri because incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project Barrett tossed\nThis time keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got some news biggest Claire McCaskill charged responded to our hidden camera destination she attacked\nA video of course but she made a false statement in this state and she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II had brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct\nI had nothing to do with Josh all I've never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation Claire McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and McCaskill bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and mechanical herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun ban some type so the capitals now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they're talking about hand guns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into there than actual vote with so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's a red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are a moderate they're not left to their their their moderate\nTo pro life pro gun Democrats it's the only thing in Missouri I don't think any swing state so what has to gauge and exposure is is that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to the people and that's what our open staffers are saying\nHe's saying the moderate we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because of the ball hitting US Senator has\nNow responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response teams okay\nWell it is some startling and Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting on me and my campaign\nUm he's the attorney general of the famous Harry he's supposed to be going after fried not participating in it\nSo um there is nothing there I've been very upon my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment much really telling about this is how how far they're willing to go too far jointly embed company my campaign\n[noise] well first of all it does it mean to both the fly categorically unequivocally falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri where you know what's gonna happen next to this other Senate candidate John ... and I'll tell you that had\nNothing to do with it chicken at respond to that so I think were were cheating our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nFor hurricane that ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable the death toll

ability to be concerned about that Ted Turner regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher around the house armed services committees defence expert at a Marine Corps intelligence veteran\nHimself let's get right down to it the danger zone\nHas receded according to I'm reading a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr my boss Rodney Davis Brian mass John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory it if we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and\nVery sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district in northeast Wisconsin we've seen an upsurge in volunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to pick up signs and ask what can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight\nMomentum shift I've always thought this was going to be a knife edge when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other\nUh but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out\nOf a couple of states that look if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have just as you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we're talking about here\nSo let me talk to you about some defense issues first of all the F twenty to ten dull a it's a murky picture I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe are doing to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment why by the way do we keep at twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell from trying to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask\nHard questions of the D O D D figure out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty to lose or damage I think ten of those are cats in the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus mile per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen when Lester rated hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little working forty hours prior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here on the planes are basic and do so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a budget that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas is too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country so as best I can tell him talking to officials pocket experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired\nBut the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the missile site survey suggests that the air frames appear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but repairing the skins um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question you know why we're so many their ground it\nJust goes back really to the Obama administration decision to halt the program that you guys are nine Dr Gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on the air force personnel and train maintain ours and funds for writing it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground in the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of a lack\nOf spare parts and a lack of train people to repair that\nPresident enjoying worthy John campaign when candidates in vulnerable critical house and Senate races in Ohio he took time to praise the work of some of America's

have lead to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did what Amy ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks\nAnd then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally right now does that impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront the teachers who are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome as being a necessary course correction middle aged\nI'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish has whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts certain moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to
