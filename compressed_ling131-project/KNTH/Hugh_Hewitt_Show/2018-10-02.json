I'm a civil war buff\n[noise] excuse me\nHave been for many many many years in particular the battle of Gettysburg went to see it when I was a kid it fascinated me\nLater in life when I got out of college my first job as a sales rep for a motor carrier took me to York, Pennsylvania and part of my sales territory you know the area my sales territory covered from the Maryland border which was around truce Barry going up straight up interstate eighty three\nUp to Harrisburg then a kind of over to Carlisle then down to Gettysburg and then back down to ... I had that big triangle and of course that included Gettysburg, Pennsylvania\nSo I found myself going out to Gettysburg I'm up to a lot of manufacturing there's a lot of industry in Pennsylvania particularly central Pennsylvania and Gettysburg has a lot of manufacturing both on the way through you know out to hand over and down that way from York into Hanover and out towards Gettysburg\nAlong route thirty and also a lot of stuff out there but I had a guy his name escapes me now I Believe his first name was leave but he he\nWas he he was an old guy then and he was in his seventies now that that's going back thirty plus years ago he's no longer with us\nBut it was a traffic manager and on the weekends he was a private tour guide\nAnd historian at Gettysburg and I used to go out there on

and toward the battlefield on your own lots of very cool stories if you're interested let me know marketing armed American radio dot org and we met at more than happy to tell you some of them\nOne

the paperwork that you get\nWhile you're there and the little maps and you could look down and see the devil den and you could look over into the seminary rich and you could she way back out where Pickett's Charge it occurred you were standing on this high ground\nAnd I was hearing the stories of officers that were being shot by snipers from both union and Confederate side and you know part of the reason the civil war casualties were so high was because the weaponry far out age the technology of the weaponry far outpaced the battle tactics\nOf the time while warfare was changing the battle tactics were not changing as fast as the technology of the weapons one\nOf those weapons is the Henry repeating rifle\nThere was a twenty thousand dollar reward offered for stolen civil war rifle right now\nThat police in central Pennsylvania have offered\nAnd they're just it's just for information about a stolen Eighteenth sixty Henry repeating arm frightful if you know anything about the Henry repeating arms rifle\nIt was the ... it was the rifle that you could load on Sunday and shoot all week it was a devastating weapon during the civil war I mean imagine if you were shooting a a a

smash this thing open with a sledgehammer\nAnd get out with that rifle and for that\nMatter what do you do with it it's like stolen artwork I've never I guess people themes to steal that stuff just put it in their houses and admire it\nBecause you can't do anything else with it less you'll be busted for stealing and I guess they'll sit on these you know like art thieves do they'll sit on these paintings for decades and decades and decades until they finally reached surface\nBut four hundred and five hundred thousand bucks I guess according to this investigators believe the suspect recognize the vulnerability in the way out of the museum prompting the heist\nWhat kind of person recognizes that I mean you've got to have a thieving mind even recognize that stuff and you know again just another reminder that there are bad\nPeople out there I guess the display was sponsored by a twenty five thousand dollar grant from the from the n._r._a.\nThey said normally the guns remain locked

soldier anyway\nThis thing was peace of mind [laughter]\nPretty sure it was peace of mind they called it the sixteen or Seventeen shooter depending on whether or not one was loaded and the chamber or not\nBut a a big it made it made a big difference in soldiers confidence level to know that they have this repeating arm in their hand or was it I Want you to imagine the amount of firepower you would

senator who was a woman she was from Maine\nSeek Noel by Susan Collins she was the first to stand up to Joe McCarthy\nAnd the politics of personal destruction strike me as exact McCarthyism except the charge here is assault and battery against women legit true against Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby many others not true against Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid just happy you know the well the question is how do they know that it is I haven't done over the testimony because no evidence has been produced tonight I haven't done you know there have\nBeen six investigation Durbin such fulfilled investigations are bred cabinet and six\nFulfilled investigation revealed nothing not even an allegation Dr Ford came forward and as the special counsel proved your narrative doesn't hold together it needs to be corroborated it's not persuasive and in the absence of evidence to make the allegation dispositive his McCarthyism\nAround I think frankly that there are things that\nAre relevant to me is that person and I\nThought about yesterday ... catch up on his career working I can start here she came to that do I answer that question in that debate\nThat part of the country and having right now and the question fundamental I Am in charge right under any effort to\nWhat I'm not sure but you know Iraq debate about perjury in which case skate next batch and drink in around ... million on line issue that's been raised by Dr Ford and the others which as you point out I had not been a subject\nYeah I mean going back and I took the FBI presumably is working on right now are we talking about their own and he produced are we talking about the underlying question of the issue or what happened to change your teenager so\nLet's focus on the first issue I I\nYou and I disagree I think it is a difficult at all unless we change the standard of due process but on the issue of line he did not lie he did not perjure him so he said he drank he drank a lot he drank to the point of falling asleep\nAnd the people who are out there on the Web saying he Persian themselves are themselves lying because he never said that and and do you have any testimony that has been contradicted by anything that's far\n[noise] you really think that\nWe're fucked around thing and throwing up stomach and\nYes I Do yes I Do\nThat and of course at the high school yearbook I grew up in the ninth inning when there are facts Cornish\nPlayers are\nVery poor me well I agree I agree but that he was protected I\nStopped Gawker or certainly relevant that question the way in retrospect rejected Supreme Court presented himself too much\nThere is no way that his discussion back and forth about Ralph thing is perjury there just is no way that that is lying medicines characterization it could well be true it is not lying and in fact he said there were many jokes about the fact that he would often throughout that just means you can't hold the beer\nThat just means you can hold enemy and it also occurs to among other things but that's not on your perjury and I think Susan fundamentally the reason you saw Heidi Heitkamp numbers plumbing and I don't know if you saw that poll yet she went from four points bonded ten points behind in one week thing for points to ten points in one week what does that tell you\nWell we started out and I think it points to circle back to work right in the middle of the selection that in America\nAnd I just kept on which I guess it won't be competing versions of what's happening during that might be around rally parties increasingly\nDistraught and upset a political base it and it would not at all surprised me is that when the case for Heidi Heitkamp in a very solidly red state at the same time obviously he this feeding off for many women in British gates who are concerned\nThat the testimony of women is being ... years and so I think you could actually ration where\nIt appears to live in the country and yet\nMotivate voters parts of the
