grandmother told me the guys just want guns because it makes them feel tougher this is a completely inaccurate stereotype that needs to be dispelled you I'm sure there's\nSome misguided people do own guns in order to cover up their own insecurities to not only the three minority this attitude just shameful and responsible gun owning you as a group gun owners for some of the most humble and responsible people that our society has to offer for most of us choosing to own a trend firearms is it a mission that we're not and visceral\nReal vulnerabilities it's because we understand that because we've taken the time to think about the uncomfortable things like our own mortality because we understand how quickly life can be\nLost that we cherish our right to defend ourselves\nAnd our family with firearms this may not be the image that's been portrayed to media\nPeople like that don't make good Hollywood heroes but they are the backbone of this country people who never looked create trouble but stand quiet and ready who trained for the moment they hope will never come will not hesitate to stare down even should the need arise\nDon't be confused by what you see in the

Trump Republicans polls which have been wrong before show Democrats with a double digit lead in every election with a strong possibility they'll retake the house with a slim possibility the Senate\nHow can this be three things I think one is the founding of the liberal media that are already blaming Trump for the hurricane second the ignorance especially a millennial voters censored\nThe failure of Republicans to do a better job of promoting their successes granted there is the media blockade but still I might add a fourth reason the president's personality\nIs the president were to show at least some humility it would help him and his party that are not like Democrats win in November or all of this progress will be over I'm Cal Thomas\n... did they come to visit to almost fell

States Supreme court\nHe will have plenty of five thirty thirty five years God willing to write opinions that will be his legacy but church or whom you've studied your entire life often what was it sailed by criticisms some fair mostly unfair how did you deal with that Larry aren't\nA well he uh this is a ah this this will be a controversial point with people probably but we have changed the libel and slander law is in America is they have not done in England and he would sue people if they said things that were not true\nOh what what I did not know he was to just\nWell not you know huge now but uh like a a fellow ah there's a lot of Alfred Douglas and there's a there's another guy wrote a book and you know accused him said that when he was a little boy\nThat sentence was he stole and he was beat\nInternational made him take that back you know it's like kind of parallel to Kevin alright yeah he's he wrote a book\nYou wrote in a favorable book about church the church it was it the when he was in high school and Churchill made him take it back and ah you know Churchill's famous areas went to see the ... and the guy was prostate before Churchill you know he just he's\nJust trying to write a favorable book\nAnd Churchill was tough about it he demanded a complete retraction and he got it and what was your name\nOr well there's another guy I Can't remember the guy's name but there was another guy named lord Alfred ... always whipping up scandal about Churchill all the time and they have litigation and they were and you know but the thing is if somebody\nWhat we've done now is we have made it so that if you're a game day public figure\nThan it's very difficult for you to do you have any relief if somebody tells a law against cute that harm she [noise] and that is one

you know Larry are and murdered someone last\nNight in Michigan and you can't sue me [laughter]\nYou probably could get that I Would that would be knowing disregarded the facts but I could come pretty doggone close to that in any other you know you can just make wild assertions in in American media and we're beyond touched because of New York times we saw that I liked that but that is not the case in Great Britain\nAnd if he is so Kevin Oh gosh you know he he's got children right and he has damaged by this year your point is not just that\nHe might not have gotten confirmed on the Supreme Court nobody has a right to that right but your point is his personal reputation has been hard exactly and he will ever after the\nThe person who you know was accused of the things right and they'll never be resolution of it and that means his children will be on the inside\nBut how better if he chose to do it for them to be able to say they had to retract that because that wasn't true\nThere is there a trade off here um because it is true Thirty years from now someone will be using\nThe ... claims against their kids to hurt them\nPainted him right they'll say oh you had we all know that and and I knew that what was weighing on him because you and I are both fathers right and so we know that that weighs on a parrot that what people say about you will be used against your children and so I understood is anger and I would have been\nDone that he was not that angry\nYeah that's right and and you know you you I urge you because you run your show at a certain way in other words you don't go around slandering people all the time\nAnd you know [laughter] yeah you know are you talking to [laughter] do I think that really count because he's not really there [laughter]\nSo it's you and me and the way that our whole field [laughter] anybody but the point is\nYou should surrender your affection for that Supreme Court opinion about New York has versus sell them because everything\nIs a bad thing because\nYou have the right you have a right and I have a right to our reputation and it cannot be harmed we have a realty if it is unjustly\nWe still you know what you just set up a great

release but that process would be going to to military bases that's how these things are handled but I express for the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member of course the ... family\nAre ... for his unyielding\nUnyielding a efforts to obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers and support for the past ... and let me also say that\nUh I have a lot of idea what the media lot as you know a ... in several different capacities outside the kill Jay but I Need to say this to my friends in the media\nThese reporters a for these ah newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matters I've been very tight and suffering pastor Brunson case and the story and that helped keep them alive as part of the process when you've got\nPeople held like this and I'm a I'm a huge thank you and I told us to a couple of reports today I appreciate them covering it and get your degree to cover it and uh that's across the board here uh it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN\nOr at covered extensively ABC News uh that's covered it debate and talked about it with George Stephanopoulos on ABC this week a couple of weeks back so a good news on that front and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining us ... are now being processed out of\nTurkey and what that means is he's they're removing the ankle bracelet which was his monitor it was at a house arrest\nA will be taken to a military transport aircraft uh them probably blow that directly into Germany I'll be evaluated the return to the United states I don't know exactly what that ... will be yet we're ... into that but I'm a ... will keep everybody posted as this progressive progressive over the next several hours but a great\nDay uh on any time you get these releases like this door to a great day we're still waiting for the one of the baby a that case was earlier this week I Know this way way from the others but yeah that they are there were reports running that that could be coming at any moment yeah I'm Out of the package and with the great that go ahead out of the\nPakistani a Supreme Court that that case\nHere or what happened pastor Brunson\nUltimately was ordered is that is unique it's sitting on the situation as time served all the witnesses or I guess ... or ... or drop their stories this morning in court in Turkey um and said they were there was they were not accurately\nReported as as what they had accused pastor Brunson of\nAnd uh and then ultimately the prosecutor\nA recommended in Turkey did he or be allowed to travel I ... no longer under judicial order and so that's why the ankle brace it will be coming off or is coming off as we speak right now his house release a house arrest or will be released and ultimately I Will be given his passport\nAnd able to travel and and we have planes on doing that um later on today\nA in Turkey I just to remind you this is someone who spent\nTwo years and containment in a year and a half of that in prison\nBecause of his Christian faith I pastor been there for twenty three years in Turkey in American\nI raised his family various three children he'll be reunited with the United states uh two sons one daughter's daughter spoken out a very publicly for her father even going to the United nations in Geneva a show again I I've heard of his ... as a sister\nOn as well so there's a family\nWhich is very excited to watch to see pastor Bronx is released it was a long and difficult process more difficult than it should have been with the NATO ally like turkey these are not was not like a situation\nI'm In Iran or North Korea right much uh with how complicated it got 'em and because it's an American citizen dead I figure it's just as big of a deal or to see his freedom which everybody's\nA ... who was innocent and persecuted because their face it doesn't matter what countries doing it what relationship to us may have with that country or their release is something to celebrate\nWhat look at it absolutely and we're thrilled with the outcome here ... I Hope this also goes a long way in restoring relations between the United states and turkey Turkey's been an important ally of NATO ally and they play up strategic role in the region and it\nWould be good to see those relations are stored and this is a positive step is a secretary bump bail set it very positive step it met restoration process having said that also let me just say that this also gives you a glimpse\nAnd I'm going to go to bed on the edge of gives you a glimpse of that nature which we have\nThese cases that was a unique situation here in that\nUm we had a situation where we had a NATO allies toward and said that took custody of an American so a NATO ally taking custody of an American pastor\nAnd happened to be also with the very same time but that pastor was a ... jail his family contacted us we immediately began a representation of him that predated my representation of the president but then of course now represents and it happened for over a year and a half built about a year now representing the president the United states\nAnd so it gave us a unique perspective on it and uh I think it was helpful for the pastor or to to have an advocate that could obviously a speak with the president but having said that this president has been very very assertive on returning hostages that are Americans back to the United states and just had a great track record there\nBut it was a unique perspective for me and we've had a lot of these over the years but this is a little bit unique in that sense but again I when I got that call from the president this morning I was just a really delighted with the ah with the news that we wanted to convey that we set up a\nA video on Facebook immediately out we sent out a report ports our social media outlets as well but we're glad now that we're talking with our our radio audience than I think it's important for you to state the nature of\nThe bipartisan ship that was involved in this and what we were able to accomplish on the legislative level that help move this all [noise]\nI think it was particularly important given the fact that you just pointed out jaded this was an ally of the United states that we had a vested interest in maintaining a good relationship with today we're grateful to both countries but you're right change this was a little bit different in that regard first of all it was important for the administration\nTo speak with one voice the vice president the president the secretary state ambassador Brownback being in the courtroom Jay but then in Congress I mean\nI I I Would first game today he gave me a tip of the hat to senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrat from New Hampshire who went over to turkey herself and J I Will tell you wish extremely engage behind the scenes\nBoth on putting pressure on turkey when when it was appropriate but then also engaging diplomatically with turkey and reassuring turkey ... states wanted a strong\nThey should have within and and free and pastor Andrew Brunson was the best way to accomplish that and so\nYou know there was sort of a a team of four senator Lankford as senator tell us who went down to the for the United States Senate every single week for the past several months to speak on behalf of the pastor and Senator Graham but Jay a multiple letters multiple congressional testimony a pastor Brunson daughter came\nOut to Congress to testify visits to turkey engaging diplomatically and also through pressure means\nA by camera all bipartisan and all of them gay speaking with one voice in the half the United states government a behind the president\nAnd at the same time I use it to my uh came our team your teeth are that are listening and members of the AC okay your favorite the ACL Jay bad bet it is even D.C agree ... with a team at the Europeans at a blonde justice engaging un on multiple occasions\nUh so we're very happy that are very happy with the way this\nCame out a low it's team that was in charge of the media and social media races a year steak you to our entire eat we eat a lot when we say we utilize all the lawyers\nOr government affairs a professor at all\nOur media professionals social media professionals video media ... everyone engaged in this top to bottom\nThis will be something good for uh the relations between the U.S and turkey who our NATO allies I mean ultimately that's that's a big goal here I thought that that kind of bigger picture I even heard\nPastor Brunson a sister talking about that how important of a ally turkey is the United states and that you shouldn't have this kind of relationship so that's very important Senator Graham was talking about that\nAs well I I just want to underscore to all of you\nAre thanks and how how important it is to stay with it these are tough cases they take us a long time that a ... you try diplomatic options um you could ah we had a White House and a president willing to take steps a\nAfter diplomacy or or was not working just to get it done even issue things like us a targeted sanctions\nOn Turkish officials to see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough\nUm how important it is that all of you stood by for those two years um for pastor Brunson I Know he thinks you\nAdd to his family thanks you and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story um I think he will come to realize even more so over these next twenty four forty eight hours how many people\nWe're following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states is certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows are some that will be doing later today who ... who stood with this story I Would this American pastor because

broadcast news like this a pastor Andrew Brunson after two years being in prison and then under house arrest in Turkey because of his Christian faith after a working as a Christian pastor in Turkey for twenty three years I think the issue at all\nRaising a family there are three children who wait or their father as fathers return to the United states um he has been released after this two year a horrible ordeal\nI and I know it's been in the news a lot I'd I'd say but I always want to make sure people tune in and out of radio broadcasts that they know or the Americans are flawed justice represented the Bronx in saying that we continue to do so there's a lot worked there remains to be done\nUm as as we air right now he's not yet left turkey I'm a for somebody who hear the broadcast at different times that may have changed uh but uh but again I he has been free by the court a and a and these past four returned\nAnkle bracelet being taken off because he was under house arrest and ... and ultimately I Will return to the United states\nMay ah will likely stopped a ... at a military US military base in Germany I'm a which she\nCould be on his way to as early as this evening I'm with his wife\nWe are going to take more your phone calls in one hundred sixty four\nThirty one that's one eight hundred sixty four thirty what we've been taking throughout the show so we do have some foe large open for you right now if you want to talk to us on the air if you've got a few questions about this matter a about how helpful the White House has been members of Congress have been in fact let me play\nSenator Lindsey Graham ah who was on I just saw a on a TV this morning about a pastor Brunson\nHe's played a key role listen to what he did on behalf of pastor Brunson\nThat's been too long gears is kill I taught a course to wind up about it directly affected our relationship\nPoints to improve and this would be a great step forward person trap and vice president [laughter] been all over this and satellite put into a shade pushing very hard for a long time when he gets home I'll feel better but he's not home yet\nAnd I think again that is that everybody obviously you feel that way too is that you want to alternately see this a hundred percent completed\nThat is not to be that's kind of leaving Turkish airspace you're at that military base or whether that's Germany is a U.S military base I stand these members of Congress like Lindsey Graham said they they played a key role even go so far as uh not just using their contacts to meet with\nThe president turkey but also to go right into the prison to meet with pastor Brunson\nYeah far more than just issued a statement or giving his speech tournament several members of the house and Senate went over to turkey or to visit with a pastor Brunson also to visit with officials I mean do you think about senator tell us in senator she knew\nA use their seats in the Senate Armed Services Committee or to raise this issue Jordan's so you know they they injected it into a conversation about defense programs that they cared an awful lot about and we're willing to take a human rights case like pastor Brunson into that debate and it really did put\nA leverage into the situation and again I Want to cast it in this lady was not you know leverage that was looking to push turkey away in fact I think Senator Graham said it very well he wants a strong relationship with turkey he wants turkey in the United states to have a positive relationship\nAnd he was very careful and directing communicating to his Turkish colleague that this this release a pastor Brunson was going to be necessary for that relationship to be as healthy as he would like it to be so again\nA singer Lankford senator tell US Senator Shaheen senator grant and many others Jordan did weigh more than ... speak out about this they made it a priority for them and they spent hours and hours and hours are working on the case\nUh let me go to the parents called Oklahoma on line one and I think it's important called the take right now Pam welcome to Jay sexual alive\nI'm so glad they miss the average weeknight ... ... ...\n... ... ... and yeah I my bank everybody and I ate at night having ... not going to stop ... he didn't tell hit me\nLiterally I just you know I think you heard what Senator Graham says they'll feel a whole lot better you continue to pray I you know to to pray for this family even after you back in the United states\nBecause of the process how horrible the process has been on for the family this is tough um it takes a mental toll it takes a physical toll as health is a bit of the issue and that's why he was ultimately allowed house arrest was because of his health so it takes all the different kinds of physical mental emotional and psychological tolls\nShould continue to pray for the family obviously you could celebrate what is a tremendous victory and a great moment to see pastor Brunson are in prison because of his Christian faith and ultimately\nReleased today in Turkey you take a listen this is a shows the bipartisanship here matrix senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrats or says she'd also spoke out this morning take it was\nReally many can you talk about the first time on the\nLine of credit call first\nThat work hard to find\nOut how many people I Can't wait on American soil\nThat is again a shows the bipartisanship than right there a sitter average dinner she partnering with with the rain it's better to do is sit her life for a ... and again because we all understand\nThe importance of a sea in
