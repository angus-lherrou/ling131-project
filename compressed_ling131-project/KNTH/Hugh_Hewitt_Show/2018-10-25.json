W. R. Hawkins Ga Ga he's put a couple of pieces out on Georgia why\nWhy is it W. R. Hawkins of Breitbart News writing about Georgia because all countries watching the race down here\nIt was as predictable again as the day is long I predicted it right after the the primaries here in the state of Georgia and Brian Kemp won the nomination\nAnd was be going up against Stacey Abrams a radical leftist professional gun prohibition is who hate your right to bear arms who hate your freedom senior capitalism and wants to take all your money increase our taxes and take away our gun that's what she's running that's not me telling you that that's the that's that's what the platform that she's running on\nAnd I told you it wouldn't be long\nBefore the left will be out there with their headlines creating the narrative it wasn't twenty four hours later\nWhen I Believe it was time magazine put her on the covers that couldn't George W turning blue\nGood heavens man to headlines who may W. R. Hawkins number one Democrat Stacey Abrams sheiks ban on entire category of firearms and repeal of campus carry that's number one the second headline Stacey Abrams sponsored bill to ban and the\nCommonly a semi automatic firearms we'll start with the first one\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams does what\nHe eats a ban on an entire category of firearms and repeal of campus carry\nShe is running on this pledge\nTo ban an entire category of firearms and repeal the campus carry laws that allow concealed permit holders to be armed on campus for self defense let me remind you listener that over the last two weeks there has been eight gorge of crime\nOn Georgia's downtown campuses and students talking about arming themselves Stacey Abrams doesn't like that idea also let's go back and think for just a second on how many how many of those law buddies students that carry guns how many\nNegligent discharges have there been how many suicides everybody ... oh no that's right because their production of doom and gloom doesn't happen but that's not good enough for Stacey Abrams\nShe just doesn't like guns period\nEven in the hands of good guys unless they're protecting huh you see how that works\nShe wants to implement according to a W. R. Hawkins other gun controls including universal background checks she doesn't even know what that means so I'll tell you what it means it means forcing you to get government permission just all gone to everybody and anybody in private sales\nTo your hunting buddy to your dad to your neighbor I don't care what they tell you that's what their goal is that is what universal background checks are\nUniversal background checks don't work because they cover private sale how does the government know that I sold a gun to my neighbor bill they're not gonna know because I'm going to solve done to my neighbor bill period\nI don't need the government's permission to do it\nBut wait a minute the government's going to step in and say well how do we know that he's abiding by our newest man made law\n\nWell gosh darn we have to register these guns so that we have a record of everyone who has them and where they wind up\nThe natural progression that's what they're not telling you the AJC Atlanta Journal constitution is indicating according to a W are the Abrams ignoring Democrats previous habit of running as moderate on guns now pushing for gun control once elected instead she is literally riding on a gun control platform in other words she ain't hiding it\n\nAnd like the rest of embolden Democrats emboldened by a crash giving tremendous amount of coverage to people like David hog and the marches and everything else while ignoring the vast majority of Americans\nOver a hundred plus million Americans law abiding Americans that are gun owners ignoring us painting a picture creating a narrative\nThat is giving the the Democrats the socialists embolden ing them to feel that they can openly run on a gun grabbing campaign bring it on good luck with that I Want them to continue running on that you should to let them by the way here's what\nThe Atlanta Journal constitution that heading over to their page Stacey Abrams another leading Democrats have broken from decades of conventional party strategy in Georgia in this year's midterms let me stop there for a second if that means\nLying and hiding what they want to do that is what the age where she is telling you they've stopped lying in hiding and waiting until they get in power that's what they're telling you right there without saying I'm saying 'cause that's what they're selling\nBy calling for new firearms restrictions Abrams another state voters shell shocked from a spate of mass shootings are now more supportive of her calls for universal background checks for private sales of firearms a ban on high powered assault rifles and the repeal of campus gun legislation\n\nYou think that's going to happen in Georgia you think we're going to repeal campus carry you know what is required to do that\nDo you think we're going to ban high powered assault rifles in the state of Georgia and do you think that we hear the voters and George are going to allow the government to tell me who I can and cannot sell guns to less I pay them a tax to do so\nThe fact that the AJC Atlanta Journal constitution\nIs telling you that they're breaking from tradition is openly admitting that hey guess what the Democrats are involved and there are no longer going to hide an ally now they're out of the closet what am I have been telling you four years\nI Am back ... high Canada or do not bring my voice back

Gillum as you know the object of an FBI probe uh protect can stop including tickets there I'm often\nAndrew Gillum was\nWhen they know Andrew Gillum\nWhat else is in the in the early ... I really can't imagine Florida voting for Andrew Gillum override the census rather says this is only\nHarvard law naval officer a jak deployed to SEAL Team won the Baghdad incredible leader in the

take on dissent this but CNN being seen in Burma Nelson camera\nFrank Bruni talking about it was Hamilton tickets will play the music again and this is Frank Bruni tried to downplay\nWhat happened was we got it right I I think\nTrump is worse than the situation but I think in all fairness this predates Donald Trump and you know and I said correctly that Floridians have a high tolerance for this sort of thing I don't think it's confined to Florida I think most American voters to assume that politicians are not totally clean\nI mean they assume that they hang out with some people whom they take favors from and that sort of thing and in the context of that honestly I don't think a single Hamilton ticket is going to ruin Andrew Gillum campaign I also think\nThis new information is not does not resolve and solve everything I mean he's correct\nThat test just sort of ambiguous he can say that that text does not prove that the ticket was from the FBI agent or from the guy trying to buy influence at the vigil reference to the crew gives Andrew Gillum enough wiggle room to kind of say what he's saying I think a lot of this is just noise to voters\nGuy tickets in the room where it happened again you're dealing with the subject of an FBI investigation\nI think it's not going to be limited to that and Floridians vote for him they should expect to lose their governor mid term to
