not Maggie Theresa May is coming to address the parliament\nAre striking news it just it another example of how this\nBalance that Theresa May has tried to strike a beam someone who can be both in the ... camp but also work with and then they go ... tried to have some kind of agreement\nWith the Europeans just not working as an appetite against globalization and the ranks of the conservative party they want their their heart exit I mean the barrage\nWalk of the Tory party is really the heart and soul the Tory party and there's still a lot of anxious about Theresa May what she's trying to do it and maybe salvage their relationship with Europe rather than moving away\nThe I Would watch that story very closely on to another story and I I think this has implications for last night's interview when the president brought up secretary of defense Mattis\nSuggested maybe he's not long for the administration\nRobert I Am stunned that were Seventeen twenty choose left behind and Kendall air force base their presumed damaged at least and perhaps destroyed they can't get into the hangar that's eight percent of our strategic weapon or number one the greatest fighter ever made we only have two hundred of 'em or something like that [noise]\nThere will be accountability here is this going to be the occasion for the secretary of defense to fall in the short and say a buck stops with me if I run the department of defense those planes were my watch and Mr President here's my resignation\nSecretary Mattis has signaled to a lot of people inside of the Pentagon and the administration that he's probably going to eat after the terms that this is someone who's on his way out so\nThis whole situation with with the planes it could prompt sooner but it's always been really heading for the exit and the president kind of like a Democrat on the minute was\nRevealing that this is a secretary of defense is really worn out his welcome highly respected by the president and others ... but not the one who's going\nTo hear secretary of defense\nBut he's also a huge proponent of accountability and they they fired five senior admirals last year over collisions and grounding and I think this is a way for him to send a message about accountability that it's just a huge strategic blow to the United states if that is the early reporting is correct\nMe move to Maggie Haberman you and Maggie no the president about as well as anyone and she interviewed a bunch of rally a tenders a four story yesterday\nAbout why they loved Trump and then there are four things quote he wins regardless of how punishable the definition of winning maybe he takes the tie directly to Democrats unlike previous Republican presidential candidate to preferred comedy ever controversy\nHe does not about a politically correct culture and he does not condescend to them and to quote it is that last thing Robert concept that I think is so critical\nPeople really resent the blue bubbles of Manhattan and Washington Silicon Valley in Hollywood they really have gotten the sense in the first man flop movie flopping confirms that sent me the elites do not know or care about them your comment\nI saw her and why it I mean the I thought it was a really inspiring film or about the country and about the\nSpace program that was very accurate in about ... is the courage of took to go to space uh but I guess that there were different issues surrounding that film and\nThe American flag and different things that led to it not being successful at the box office but I think you're right Maggie ... story is strong and that it shows that I was just on on the trail with the president last week I was on air force one in New York, Pennsylvania\nAnd at the rally she's the crowds are still there and he is an answer they see him is for all the problems and controversy he has been gone swamp in their eyes and he's still a thorn in the side of the establishment and that really more than any ideology is what seems to attract them and President Trump\nYes yes he has a gun swamp by the way that is a great phrase I I Will give you credit for that he hasn't gone swap I Know you're pretty well that's where I went to summer camp I'm getting that her name and it's a it's a part of the land part of the northeastern Ohio western Pennsylvania beaver falls Joe name as you\nNamed Bernie ... is our land and they love Trump I mean they just I Can't stay how much he loved in my home town of war in Ohio but I talked to about first\nFirst man flop a Robert red Neil Armstrong grew up in war no how he wasn't born there but he grew up there and I really was looking forward to I Will not see a movie that does not show Armstrong the iconic moment the picture we all know of him planting the flag they made an artistic choice\nBy of and two hundred about that choice that decision to serve the world rather than the American audience in history and therefore I'm not going to support it and I think millions of Americans into it at the same I guess it's sort of contempt for our intelligence do they not we will react to sway\nSpeaking here we are here I I was\nI saw the movie having not seen any article about that the American flag controversy that not showing Armstrong with why\nThey do show the flag on the moon I guess they don't show Armstrong putting it into the ground and the moon I thought the whole movie was about American perseverance and grit and so I was actually kind of stunned when I saw that a lot of people will say oh we'll never see the film\nI thought the film was terrific but I I understand I guess now looking but there were some that that's not\nThere's not that scene at the flag being put in the ground but I don't know you I mean it's a good movie but\nI I'm a moviegoer and sunny bunch says it's a wonder if what you might movie reviewer right at the Washington pretty big gains are great man and he is with you that I'm a lunatic pronouncing it but I Am into it and how can you take the central moment that it is the iconic picture why would you exclude that Robert and I would expect\nThe president had to eventually get around that is why would they exclude that plant thing of the flag because it's a moment of American trial and went to trial\nI I [noise] I'm Still surprised by that controversy because the movie shows the flag in the moon just not the plant you know the flag\nSo it's not like it doesn't mean the whole thing about the American space\nProgram at all the whole movie to let the American flags everywhere throughout the whole on but\nI I Would I don't understand\nThe filmmakers knew it was caused such as the star of the whole movie almost patriotic\nAnd seen it does not have that that scene\nDoesn't make sense I guess because you're really preventing a film from having traction\nSo easily preventable so predictable and yet\nThe arrogant to continue on in the face of the controversy which has been six weeks I could've cut it in I mean it just wouldn't have been hard [noise] let me talk to a little bit about it ... what's coming ahead in these elections as I read\nThe tea leaves and I was in Ohio in front of going in Tampa on Thursday talking to people across the country I've got Kramer winning in North Dakota Holly winning in Missouri Braun tied in Indiana Scott winning in Florida Rosendale creeping up on and going to be assisted by the president black burns pulled away and it makes Sally is pulled away Heller is I had\nThis could be a great night for the Republicans in Twenty one days in a day Robert Costa in the Senate do you agree with my assessment of its fans right now\nI have a slight disagreements about such a competent production I have a story in the front page of today's post that rate is a bit of caution for a Republican in Senate races in the mid west I mean what Lou Barletta\nRunning as many drawn to Pennsylvania struggling against Bob casey in Michigan Republicans are struggling in Ohio Sherrod Brown looks like he's on the weight of reelection Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin ... vulnerable months ago she seems like she's on pace to probably win Wisconsin\nAnd so in ruining the tests are still pretty tough candidate I think you're right about North Dakota that's probably it looks like it's gone\nA ... I I think the Republicans have to find a way in the mid west to get some of the Trump like candidate come across the finish line I mean the president has his agenda the voters or their their their their enthusiastic but at the bar letters of the world and the leaves are still ten points back\nYeah the I've been told that the book where Paul is not right that Walker got a little bit of a leading these polling are up but that general you're right Rosendale is not a hat and test are in desperate land yet but he's gaining the right direction and the cabinet or\nThis is my last question Robert

Trump but everybody else but there is a Republican Party\nAnd it stands for the judges and it stands for cabinet and Gorsuch and they did not like that at all they they reject\nThe ... you know the
