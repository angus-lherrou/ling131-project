{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "Area yesterday said I Want to get off the air and quit working and go have some fun and we did that yesterday did where did you take\nUs yesterday we did well first of all we walked over to the marshals department where we met the tombstone Marshall a very fine man ... and we invited him on the show today but unfortunately he's out chasing felons or something he's busy today so he couldn't make it\nA but after that we went I Believe we went to lunch with the crystal palace saloon a legendary they just built a brand new balcony upfront work that overlooks Allen Street in tombstone\nAnd I'd say it's a real cool about that I Know about that building that used to be using it used to be the eagle brewery many many many many moons ago back in tombstone heyday and it later became virtual ... office when he was deputy deputy sheriff did not\nThat's right right up in there and they've done a great job of keeping it up and it's it's a landmark property here in tombstone\nWhere else did we go from there we left there and went to we went to the courthouse and the court house I mean I I I've been there so many times I there's a couple of new displays in there that I didn't recognize before it tell us about um there\nIs a couple of new displays a the thanks to Arab leader donated a over thirty Josephine herb letters original letters and many a wider letters a and I'm photos excuse me photos of white or from the Nineteen twenties uh\nJust absolutely priceless and John floods original document manuscripts who was a one of a one of those ... biographers are one of herbs are people that are documented or life a lot of his original material has been donated to the courthouse and it's on display for the world to see there\nIs also in addition to those letters which are fascinating they're kind of tough to read\nBut they're really cool just to look at because you can see the signatures and see some of the names and just to know some of the history behind it and where it came from to me that's enough I just think it's cool that we can look at it and see it behind the glass case but there was also a couple of very cool pocket watches there there was a little imagine there probably were fifty sixty bucks right\nYes there was a there was one of supposedly wider pocket watches but there is something brand new and their Josephine\nA pocket watch and it was donated to the courthouse about two years ago or by some gentleman that stay at my motel and uh\nWe convince them to put it on display there and maybe maybe indefinitely and it describes a inscribed on there are two my sweetheart Josephine ah\nAh why it in the state of the state of Nineteen twenty four just shortly a few years before he died a is priceless and it's it's been a authenticated\nYeah that I I mean you know ... what do you say about something like that and it's interesting because she met Josephine hearing tombstone did you not in a fascinating story they were married forty seven years long\nLong time that people don't realize that this is not ancient history this is fairly recent history we're talking about it I'll use myself as an example I was born in Nineteen sixty to\nEighty year old man when I was born was born in Nineteen eighty or Eighteen eighty two we are not to my grandfather was born in Eighteen Ninety six we're not talking thousands of years ago this is well documented stuff you walk into the birdcage theater which I took out and today I Want you to tell us a little history of that that's quite fascinating but\nThis stuff is all here for us to stay in touch and feel it's wonderful and by the way those Josephine are players one of those letters is completely fascinating it describes a Josephine visit back\nIn the Nineteen thirties to tombstone and she came back after White's death to visit to stone and there's the letter and they're describing that and that's available to look at and a wonderful collection and we're always looking for new items for the Tucson courthouse that\nBe fifty years after the gunfight at the OK Corral probably fifty two years from the time she showed up here fifty three years and actually met him here in Tucson correct\nThat's right can you imagine Josephine are coming back that late date and Nineteen thirties and you know everyone's gone you know every now and probably even those who wider is that at that time but uh it's just fascinating to think that she actually travelled here after his death\nAnd what the town must have looked like it to her that you know as a whole lot\nDifferent from the in the Nineteen thirties tombstone it was in rough shape we're going through the great depression and uh\nMining was gone and it was a pretty much a ghost town then so I'm sure she was shocked from boom towns that goes down but we survive\nYou know the town historian who we met at the crystal palace yesterday was quite fascinating and he talked about something I was completely unaware of and that was the second mining boom\nHere in in the city I I had no I've never I did not know that I thought when the when the mind flooded when the town burn that that was it and it was over but that's not necessarily the case about twenty some years later in the Nineteen twenty nine there was another boom\nThere was a boom right before World War one I Believe they were getting strategic minerals in this area and it did have to mining boobs and\nUh the mining history of tombstone often gets overlooked I mean people think of the gun fights and the bad guys and the good guys and then the cowboys and the Indians but really what Bill to my son was the mining and that's at chef one came here in Eighteen Seventy Seventy and uh he he is the one that\nBuilt up to basically started Tucson and built up tunes on which a Tucson what was the original first name do you know\nOh you're going to embarrass me on my radio I should know that if we talked about that\nOkay it's ... ... I did not know that I did not know guy should I should know that it was you know I was going to actually say something along the lines of contention because that was the biggest strike and the most valuable minded tombstone valued at over thirty million I Believe than at the time which is a ton of money today\nBut it just notably ... by the way so that contention\nFor three hundred thousand dollars at wound up producing nearly thirty million dollars is that right\nEd chef one made millions of dollars in tombstone in and that was of course a huge it's a huge amount today but then it was you know you were like a Bill Gates type of person really very very wealthy [noise]\n... where did that come from I Need to know that I I I think that was right very initially that was initially called goose flat because this area where we're at right now is a flat area and he gave him someone came with a name boost flats and then as you have some changes to tombstone which you know the story tell us your story about tombstone\nWow that of course was we've talked about it a lot and that was of course with that kind of coming out of Fort what yoga and you know the town of ... students don't all that fun stuff but yeah the whole goose last thing I had no idea there's something else about this area that most people really don't know about there is a town about thirty five miles south of here right near the Mexican border right up pretty much on the Mexican border\nAnd ah of by the little town of narco Mexico and it's called busy you know this is where all the or moved to what it all the copper there's still the world's largest active copper mine there\nThere there is a compromise there it's it comes and goes but busy is fascinating also ... certainly worth visiting out there is a big open pit there are the original open pet\nCom studios inside the beltway had it down to Tampa today where it will be doing an event tomorrow night broadcasting from Tampa tomorrow night going to check into the Rick Scott for Senate campaign or Ron dissenters campaign for governor and uh I saw yesterday that a\n...
