know you're you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you\nAre giving a liberal moderator and the host of this I tell you that you're giving my I'm told everyone thinks that I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary by definition\nYou're up the word modern the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the constitution and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states\nAnd it gives people the right to protest it doesn't say where you can join ... will you please let us\nOK okay if I have a drink so you can do whatever you want and you can leave the show if you want but let me finish I'm not going okay well then shut up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much in the constitution you can protest\nWhenever and wherever you want it doesn't tell you that and you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can do it on a football field and doesn't tell you that you can do it on a cable news show you can do it wherever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale will\nCat is by the way incorrect Don Lemon was one hundred percent wrong I've been teaching constitutional law for twenty two years time place and manner of restrictions\nOr even better than the first amendment you cannot do it wherever you want whenever you want that was mob rule breaking through barriers is mob rule\nFits the definition of mob rule it is a mob on the left right now and we're dealing with a mob

you getting calls says sixty three percent of women say they will be voting for Democrats so Republicans have a one in ... this is not new and it just seems gotten worse\nHow do they fix it by November ... yeah I mean I think this is the most potent potential\nProblem that Trump has brought up to them it turns out that tensions problem that's all right let her I said my friend I look I think he has taken a group of maybe ... flash slightly right leaning white college educated ex urban women and mom and\nShipping them to more fully swing voters or even folks who will lean left in the theater and that is a problem particularly in these vulnerable healthy I Will say also though that this cannot fight I think people are potentially underestimating how much it did energize\nRepublicans on the other side including Republican women um and the issue for Democrats I think that their enthusiasm was already here that was already way up here and art and the Republican Party is added to bring parity and so I think they actually do have a chance to gain a vet\nAnd it will matter more in Senate races than it does and he's vulnerable house races where those women really mattered switching left Sherry and tear pointed out energizing at Republicans and in Europe than Republican women that do you think they really ... sat again Republican strategist and she gave a weapon I sing Brett Kavanaugh you know they just\nDo this for the next four week do you think that that's a winning strategy\nI definitely think it's a winning strategy for the midterms there could be a long term consequences that we look back at this moment and said that this was you know one moment on our way to Republicans having a demographic problem but in terms of the midterms I think Mary Catherine ... exactly right Democrats are already motivated Donald Trump\nLike nothing that happened uh you know last week is going to matter to the person who's already upset about all the other thing Donald Trump has on Democrats were motivated\nPassionate angry survey are either going to turn out or they are not Republicans there the team that needed the the excitement the past and the energy they didn't have it\nIn mid term is that what matters for turnout and now I think they do and it's because\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a lap when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob or you're not going to use the word dollar totally a mop it is without a doubt\nThat there's no other we're now it's going to put a stop the mob\nIs what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August to go it's not what we saw chain thing I don't think we've All right\nAbout the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls all that civil protest or that a mob\nIf he had to leave them all\nYeah and if there are people out here as we call it a mob pressure come on but I think there is now let me let me\nLet me move pack the N word because I Do feel like that in part of the the weaponization of what's happening now on the right but at the same time I think you do make a really interesting point and a piece I write I'm hearing today that while the whole issue\nWith tapping on Fort has been incredibly dismissive in this country it has been unifying among Republicans like Republicans had a Republican problem and you had the Trump or isn't the never Trump or in your whole point is that this is what\nCauses Republican to be one being ... by the family again\nYeah look I think that that\n... the Brett Kavanaugh okay now there are never proper prominent never cropper who aren't and ... and intellectuals that this was very ... uh the capital case really split the never Trump movement and you had about half of them the era era ends of the world\nWho are basically they hated Donald Trump but now they feel\nPushed into Donald Trump camp I think it's a backlash against the law um and then you with other people like the ... groups of the world the general ribbons of the world that were pushed the other way but in terms of the rank and file average\nRepublican voter a lot of people out there around the country they don't really like Donald Trump what they saw Brett have it all it's just a regular\nKind of conservative that Bush and Marco Rubio would have Pecker George W. Bush and so the attack on him which they view it totally bogus as an attack on them so this really had a unifying effect a lot of people who don't like Donald\nTrump who might not bother to turn out in the mid term now very well Mac I think the real question is can they keep this going for a lot that we have a month ago and that's a long time at all it that apparently\n[noise]\nWe're Alfredo you

it now I have\nIncredibly timely given the controversy over the parents have Jamal ... because I Believe you obviously talk of Jared Kushner am focused in on the Riyadh summit in a way no one else has and on this relationship\nSo would you put Mr Trump's wild ride in the context of the ... the crisis that is now consuming the relationship that Jared and the president worked so hard to establish\nWell the context is during election night as Jared tells me all this on the record by the way which I think it's a distinguishing factor of my book [noise] all the interviews are on the record everyone's name that's a strong journalistic component of the book you said a well have been some on the Arab parents the reformer\nThe very strong emerging force within the Saudi kingdom and regime was very excited about Donald Trump's victory and the two communicated\nRapidly and frequently during the transition and\nIt was at during those conversations that Jared Kushner on behalf of the president elect his father in law communicated that the president elect was very serious about transforming the U.S role in the middle east and that the Saudi kingdom could play a very large role in that new policy\nAnd that he meant what he said during the campaign about taking on Iran bolstering Israel\nWorking on a peace plan to trial is settle it but not in any way under cut anything that was going on within Israel and if the Saudis were open\nThings could be achieved in the near term like a large anti terror summit in the kingdom meeting the first visit of an American president as president to the Saudi kingdom which I Know\nYou you also as I did that was pretty amazing considering the rhetoric of the trip of the Trump campaign\nMost important speak to the Trump presidency is the Riyadh speech on terrorism\nSo I I look back on that event and thought as I was put in the book together\nA lot of us it's not missed it did not perhaps step back and say this could be a really important moment and I don't know if it will be but the things that were said there has never been said before either by king Solomon\nOr an American president and you'd never had a gathering of that

our rallies and when you do that\nYou know bad things happen but they were the ones that started everything so no it wasn't us it was it was totally the other side by it and I would ever rally and paid people were going into those rallies causing trouble and in many cases it didn't work out so well for those\nHey Jennifer pay people were in those rallies but when I hear oh they're making a statement like he made today I think it's a disgrace an air raid I didn't really understand she just doesn't get it she never did she never well and that's why she lost the election\nI think we all hope that we can get back some form of civility where we can have that they were in and out pops out jacks and respect each other in the process and\nI Hope so too I Do I Hope so too I Hope we're going to be able to do that\nWhether there is not a lot of hope here when Eric Holder's telling people to kick people when Hillary Clinton saying don't be civil Lindsey Graham on Fox News last night
