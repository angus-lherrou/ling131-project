you miss the big story this week you can catch up with a town hall review Sunday mornings at six am ten Seventy the answer [noise]\n\nBroadcast every one we're taking your calls the one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten and the phone lines are\nJamming up our guests I Am happy to say our client a pastor Andrew Brunson who is now back home in the United states was at the oval office with the president sees the I was there as well on Monday I'll choose me Sunday and took the day off I don't use that was Saturday Sunday and Monday kind of took a day to recover\nAnd then did so many interviews this morning we're thrilled that he's with us a pastor before I say anything to you let me see what Pamela on Facebook says so thankful for your freedom pastor Brunson Andrew welcome to the broadcast thank you very much\nI Want to I Want to I think for on behalf of our entire audience um let you know and you know this because we talked about this or do you literally had the world praying for you and the folks that are listening does the millions that listeners broadcast every day and we're praying for you without the U.S ceasing but can you describe\nFor folks I think this is important for everybody understand you were in Turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey and and what's your activities were and then we'll we'll we'll bring a current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I first say something that we are so grateful to people who pay for us and we are so grateful for a field day a such a tremendous job fighting for us and uh the the uh high elbows tireless and advocating for it\nAnd you also J uh at first he see I Know she barely lawyer but she was also a personally involved calling Noreen encouraging her and so many ways\nAnd a and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ACL J\nUh took this on and uh we want everyone to know what\nA what a tremendous uh uh help this was and and I'm grateful we are too\nWell look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we got another case right now where do we haven't had that result right now and that is a representing is helping them see a baby and her office in Pakistan but your case ended successfully but you were there in prison in Turkey and very difficult circumstances but I think is a I'll take a call them and many here\nBut I I Andrew set for the folks what you were how long you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nWell we were there for twenty four years before I was arrested\nAnd our main goal was to go and preach to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in with church planting we're involved in several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attack Syria a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity\nNot only to show the other two this by helping them a humanitarian aid but also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurtz have never met a Christian\nOr in their lives and in Syria you're kind of preach the gospel it was forbidden so we got involved with a Syrian refugees and we're a started a meeting among them and we're doing evangelists and what's that\n[noise] so you were there as basically a missionary I mean we can safely say that no we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job wash\nWe did it and we did a very open lane we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... a mission work to Syria's what it's all done out of the open\nBut before we take costs pastor Brunson question over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local uh style regional government or the national government in Turkey and all\nWell there are cycles sometimes\nThey're more accommodating to churches enter Chris centers sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up\nUh we had a they're often rather than from the government it's from a a a there are people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats or we were attacked once in our church with a man came with a shotgun\nSo that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a Turk\nYou can have those kinds of dangerous but it's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to uh arrest you and try and one of the one of the charges was ... so nothing nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that and that part of the world but but what happened to you was something that has not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing yes\nSo you there's one follow up thing we're doing you know I said you cases close and that's a great thing 'cause you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but you've got to we still one legal issue where you got to finish up with and that was\nThe un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah being engaged in the\nWorking group on arbitrary detention on engaged and pay a ... percent of the whole case he then\nThey're still making their decision and said I have to know finalized with than what the decision was went to court that he's back um update family with actually that decision and the conviction and and what can release conditions where\nHere's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally Jim Facebook comments coming in Allen says God is so good so happy to pastor Brunson is free Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly here due to answered prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving the gun and I said that the beginning to broadcast\nA Andromeda ... and I said this and I I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work\nThat was done by a team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that they invented in Washington and government affairs shop and Gregoire ... who runs for office in ... and it just a great job in the end and the circumstances of that I was representing you and then ended up representing the president\nI mean you'd none of nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day\nThese though I I Believe that with ... to take nothing away from any one\nThat uh the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to give credit where credit's also do you not just the way we feel as a institutionally\nBut let me do this we we've Andrew we've gotten a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that phone and we're going to start taking calls yes Karen is calling in from New York\nOn line to Karen welcome to Jay sexual alive\nHungarian you're on the mastermind\nThank you for taking my call and I did sign a cow pasture Branson I pray for him daily I'm so thankful for prayers to answer that he's home and I wanted to let them know\nWhat an inspiration ... testimony as a Christian to other Christians throughout the world and um the light that he was in darkness and I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian\nToo uh the mold\nAnd preach the gospel time there's that's what were called to do so I Want to thank him and tell them how happy I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWill do well you're talking right to um Andrew where where do you what do you say to Karen\n... we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who create for us and we believe a obviously a guy that the people\nAre but I think that uh what was moving that so what brought our name up to this level or with the president uh was was periods of God's people and but I also think that as\nWe look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to rise a for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as a almost like we're looking at a puzzle but from the bottom side\nAnd someday we will look from the top and all actually see the picture\nRight now we don't see the full picture but God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from print prison a I think there was he was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey in into the middle east and that there's going to be\nA great harvest from this we haven't seen all of what all of the results yet but I think there there was much bigger than us\nI think you're right and again I I think the confluence of events that took place here was was pretty unprecedented I say that\nI mean because when we representing you as I said I didn't want to be written up representing the president of the United states and then you had the ability to use this platform to and that we're doing right now we're talking to millions of people in on Facebook compare scoping all these social media platforms\nAnd you're right at the end of the day that your your goal was to proclaim the gospel and you you you're doing that you've done that and I'm sure you will continue to do that but we have a lot of people don't want to talk to you is we're going to keep going back to these ...\nYeah let's go to Scott in Colorado on line one Scott welcome to Jay says yo alive you're talking to pass the Bronx Scott\nHey guys thank you for taking thank you to Jay and you're paying\nFor your your focus on religious freedom not just domestically\nBut also internationally it's a great statement that this was making five to two questions are first of all pastor Brunson how you treated in the prison because you seem like a fairly healthy when you got released I had no idea what to expect since you were there that long and number two\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the pastor Brunson or Julie\nI'm gay and Oregon topped current current law that's why I'm a member of the hail today ... ... they care about one individual and they care about that since the ... the whole world\nAnd passed up on her question is taking care of her people around the world prank Cleveland curse and\nIt's hard to live up there for him to court ...\nOkay so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day go through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for him in one of the fear that I had a son irrational think perhaps\nBut when when one is isolated the way I was is it would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that for because I I felt very weak and so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one guard was rebuilding may\nI did it feel God's presence very much\nBut uh I I Know very well that it was a ... ... people that was a\nThere was a grave coming to me that often was not felt it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra passwords runs in the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people said exactly the same exact they feel even though it's irrational they know it's a rational did those situations there can there be completely forgot I Will be back with more Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president of the United states you know\nFBI agents behind the scenes to stop by any means necessary this was this was a result of not acceptable to these young ages they promise to stop him\nLike they were just going on this issue and this was repeated these stations stations am Seventy the answer live\nWashington DC\nComes with the American Center for Law Justice\nCertainly your joints occasion for us with this is not something we get to do often we cases you know it's it's interesting we've been on a number\nOf these over the years uh and which the success in but sometimes it takes I mean this was actually number Andrew ... like a lifetime but in our work is just one thing to point out\nWe've had him take four years we've got one right now with the C it'd be going on six year nine nine okay it's in Seattle and since the since came down almost a decade so in one sense this was quick although when you're the one in prison it sure doesn't people quit\nBut Andrew Brunson of course is now home in the United states and a lot of people\nWant to talk and before we get more calls and that's what we're going to do we want you to be able to talk to a pastor Brunson um for the next half hour this broadcast as we've done the first half hour but I Want to ask you something here I mean I Know this was on people's minds and that is what's next what what are you thinking next what do you pray and throw\nA ball we want to spend two or three months just seeking the lord and uh what he has for us but are we also need to go through some healing process or the lord has already done a lot of healing in our lives\nEspecially over the second year but but we still need to\nWork through some things I think uh I Want to be a seeking a refreshment and the lord and his presence and our hearts and then it makes sense for years is I haven't missions calling and it still and missions so in some way a ...\nIt will continue so we're waiting for God to show us how and where but that is where heart is\nAndrew let me introduce you to somebody about another person from ... studios right now in Washington DC who worked on your case tirelessly with members of the United States Congress and that is Ben Ben he's our director of governmental parents were audience knows him you haven't had the chance\nUh to me him yet he's ... he's met your family over the course of the last couple of years and representation than what's your reaction when you want to say the bouncer\nWell past runs in just an honor to be with you and I just wanted to first of all say welcome home I I guess J just just real briefly I uh I Would tell this story to pastor Brunson yesterday I was on here with Jordan we were talking about pastor Brunson caged in I was running late to a meeting when we got off the air when I walked into the meeting\nWhich was a dozens of of uh senators and congressmen officers were represented there\nAre they actually stop the meeting and the house leadership was on the agenda to talk about their priorities they stop the meeting and they said actually we want to use our time to than from the east you all day you just got here because we want to hear about pastor Brunson and how he's doing and how he has returned home so\nA pastor I just wanted to convey to you that is going to the United states government is on the legislative level to your case it was inspiring to me that they wanted to hear from you are so badly I knew a lot of them are looking forward to to meeting you and welcome you home\nI Would just say a an honor to honor to hear from you an honor to speak with you and welcome home\nBut thank you and for us is very surreal because we are not very important people and as we we as I said we've been working in a corner of turkey for many years and to see this level of interest or we can say is it is God who did this\nIt isn't just a natural thing and uh I Believe God did this because of the purposes far beyond us that he thinks he plans to accomplish\nWith Barbara in New Jersey on line three you were talking to pastor Brunson Hi Barbara\nHi welcome back to the United states I Am so happy you're safe I think crying for you I
