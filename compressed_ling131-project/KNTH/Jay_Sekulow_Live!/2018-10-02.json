six seven hundred six [noise]\nIt\nWasn't measure broadcasts everyone if there is a I just had Sandy come during their break I'm going to do this for a radio on his to cause your former U.S attorney work a lot with the FBI walk through what this investigation looks like\nWell the ... the FBI is given a directive by the White House to investigate the ... the individuals are people who have these ah the lead knowledge of what happened was\nKavanaugh ... that these other places and they go and they talk to them they're not under oath but it's still a felony to lie to the FBI\nAnd they get granular very detail about what it is that happened in the allegations they do a report on a form three oh two that's just a number of of form a good ten forty and the Treasury Department Jay that you're familiar with\nAnd they do form and then they the cold cold late the forms and they give them to the justice to the White House in the White House makes a decision as to whether they're going to continue with this nomination or not\nThe way it has to make that decision would actually ... will also go to the Judiciary Committee so it could go to the judiciary and the White House to pull it I mean right right\nRight the White House could make a decision based on bringing evidence that that there's sufficient evidence there that it's the nomination\nYou think they'd be alligator and a harried the allegation on the uh I Want to get into the specifics of what that allegation are but everybody saw him last week the allegation at the Yale University\nA event party if those allegations proved to be true which there's no evidence of and other than the one witness I mean that's one if that's if that ends up being cooperated subject to review and still\nAnd is credible what do you think that does to the nomination\nWell I think the nomination is in deep trouble and I think at this point in time it's very possible to speculate\nThat that allegation remains a the most serious hurdles to his confirmation uh it's important to realize that Rebecca Mitchell the prosecutor who ask questions after hearing suggested that no reasonable prosecutor\nWould bring a case against judge Kavanaugh based on the testimony of the two witnesses last week so I think if there is some ... corporation with respect to the second allegation and\nUh that could pose a a real hurdle for judge Kavanaugh that if in fact there's cooperation absolutely\nAbsolutely huge crushed yeah and I think one of the most interesting things about Mitchell's report to the Republican Senate and she sent all the Republican senators is she said that this is a matter of he said she said but\nThis case is even weaker than that in her report that's a very telling statement about how she views of the witnesses that have come forward\nBut here when you got that the Democrats are looking to stop this nomination let's be clear none of these ... none of the Democrats maybe but on the committee ... especially when you're talking about an individual Democrats than a minute and on the Senate but nobody on this committee was going to be voting for cabinet before this happened\nAbsolutely not they'd already announced their opposition to him so uh and they were going to vote no on the committee that we're going to vote no on the for the U.S Senate and there's a handful of Democrats left I think ... basically it's Joe mansion\nHeidi Heitkamp I mean I I'm not even sure who else pass that I mean because yeah Joe Donnelly come out and say no no I don't know if the FBI change\nIt's possible that this FBI investigation has changed the mind to reopen of a few of those uh a moderate Democrats or read the I ... I called him red state Democrats in a moderate like Doug Jones in Alabama it does this change his mind if the FBI comes back\nAfter the potential to vote or we will see\nBut so far I think it comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins maybe Joe mansion thing is I I don't think you get\nSusan Collins without Lisa Murkowski and vice versa I I Can't imagine one of the voting yes one voting no so yes Joe ... could be important to get a kind of over the line with a Democrat and I'd have to have\nMy you see any democratic support right now do you think the Joe mentioned doing it\nOnly if this report comes back critically and that would be a ... and because of internal pressure and he would do it only if Murkowski and talents were there so it was already over the line so\nHe's not doing anything to get the nominee there I don't\nThink he would be devoted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh let me say if if it came out to him no but he's not going to make the calculation that way\nAnd he had he said I agree with Jordan mentioned is going to be the one that pulls the trigger for Kavanaugh I think if he sees that the Republican senators Murkowski ... and ... are going for him then\nYou'll throw his hat in that direction\nIt's going to take a phone call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you want to talk to you\nWell there yeah let's go to Phil in New York are you talking about a little bit but we can talk about sort of fill in New York on line one feel welcome to Jay secular life I feel\nLike it very much appreciate it you're very much anticipated my question my question was going to be I think there's any chance whatsoever that even one democratic votes for confirmation\nI think what they did what we just said is right I mean if they mention if he was the deciding vote probably not if it's already fifty one votes there may because it helps them in the Senate seat how close is that set of seeing Virginia West Virginia right now I Know\nIt was I think he's looking to rock the boat there I think he's got an okay lead and okay lead a similar but let me tell you so you probably get your vote against a reward nominees for President Trump and um [noise] the Trump voters combat highly HAMP\nSame thing you think are saying but I think not maybe not a\nIt's a I think now they can all rely on this report it but they will not be the votes to get him across the line so it's not like Heidi Heitkamp and Joe mentioning come saving this if Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski vote no\nYou know again I going to be the the ... the the fiftieth and fifty first vote 'em or even the the forty nine fifty votes so that a vice president Pence could be the fifty first vote\nI'm Jim and she's got a nine percent lead right now he says it so he's not going to do is he the rock that you don't want to get into five percent\nSo because it becomes a whole different issue for the national parties when you start dropping lower than that he's right on the line of it should be a pretty easy race unless you awake in some Trump\nBase there they get so upset with you I don't know but if something comes back about him\nWhich is why the job and she was looking at I don't think that it was an awakening face I think that the nomination get spoiled right now matches up by nine percent but I'll tell you something that could swing\nDown to five percent pretty quick and I got a real race All right let's take another phone call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time yeah Mary Ellen in Illinois on line for Mary Ellen welcome to Jason ...\nEveryone yeah I have a question that this whole thing on we've evolved in saying this to let him keep that the FBI jurisdiction so why are we wasting time money and going through this again with the Democrats [noise]\nWell I the first of all this and you understand something they don't have the authority to investigate it as a crime but any they do have an authority to investigate it as a background check\nThat emphasis that's exactly what it is this is not a federal crime this is a state crime in other words it as a state based if in fact he is a has committed in the fans then it's under the laws of the state in which he committed these offenses allegedly\nBut this is being done not as an investigation of a federal crime which it is not and cannot be but as a background investigation of a nominee to the Supreme Court and that's how he the FBI gets there a presence in to this case\nNow ... which means that this is not a criminal investigation no so this is not a situation where a file as an open at the U.S attorney's office and the case moved to determine whether he qualifies for background to be on the court\nAnd I think what's happening right now you've got allegations you've got to that they're considering they're not reviewing the one raised by my carbon out each client\nThe reviewing the two now you've got Dianne Feinstein saying the White House and the FBI should release details on the scope of the cabinet background investigation keep Congress and foreign run any changes this needs to be a real investigation must get all the facts the president's just end the president said wow\nJust starting to hear Democrats who are only thinking obstructing delaying are starting to put out the word that the time and scope of the FBI looking to judge Kavanaugh witnesses is not enough\nHow low for them it will never be enough stay tuned and watch what's your ... be a way\nI Would just say that she said well how do you think that if I'd seen him in and her own are going to react when I I think it's likely that in the doctor format or they're going to come back and say they got nothing right so the prosecutor who asks a question last week is right everyone's right it is a he said she said she said ... is full of holes\nIncluding the fact that she never named him and to anybody until now\nI'm even when she brought this up years ago um ah the for the first time in twenty twelve did not name the person uh that doesn't know how they got there doesn't know where it was has no idea has a friend saying that it didn't happen so\nUm I think they are never going to be convinced\nThat they never were going to be convinced they were always a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh they're doing everything they can to buy time to find more dirt to throw more dirty I what I expect is not so much what comes to this investigation even a because at this point that South to the FBI is what else is going to come out these next they've just Monday\nSo what comes to that between what happened friday\nAnd uh and and this idea I mean uh Debbie said are they trying to get the judge to go through another hearing a publicly I think they say sure\nIf it delays it I mean that's what I'm saying they will take anything to delay this because they lay it to make it a political issue of the midterms\nUm they think that that's a benefit to them they're making their calculation is this is a political benefit for Democrats to continue this process on I I think that it's the FBI's has to an extent that does that put do not expect whatever they find even if it's positive for Brett Kavanaugh to influence a single Democrat\nBut we also process wise if that's what it is his nomination goes is that the Florida Senate now yeah it's just the for the ... FBI report could come out you've got but you've got to have at least the vote could be\n\nYeah so governed by Thursday I mean this is where it's ... territory said during the break but for everybody was on the air right now I mean as if he finished our first half hour this is this is not like there's some rule book for this exactly is the president just said in a press conference literally while we're on the air um you know they're they're handling this wow this is what the ... is requesting\nUh and then the White House has ordered and so it's it's not what Dianne Feinstein is requesting that was what the Republican leaders they leave the Senate\nIt's what they requested yeah we've got a lot more head we're going to be here for thirty minutes if you don't get the full hour the broadcasters go over to Facebook periscope a or a C. O. J. dental were screaming and live their television version of his broadcast and if you're on Facebook periscope and our other device and other social\nMedia platforms we don't take any breaks we're gonna be talking about this during the break our radio audience horse serious X number of other states as you got the full hour of the broadcast [noise] hey we appreciate your support for the ACL Jay last month we met our month before she ate that again you're more the ACL Jay makes a huge difference of a C. L. J.\nThat one a C. L. J. down or when we come back with a break you were to take more of your calls we've got one line open that's it [noise]\nKeep from getting to your hundred sixty four thirty one tenth back more just a moment\nHe's coming November six\nPerhaps the most important midterm election in our history\nDo we have the momentum the mainstream media\nIs president Donald Trump with everything they have they want to destroy this President Bush came from it so far\nCan you do is with us to find out how\nThey intend Seventy the answer [noise]\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow\nShe's counsel for the American Center for law and justice ...\nWasn't the broadcasts everyone and welcome back to the broadcast for joining us here for the second half hour let me tell you a couple of\nThings we are following very closely to Brett Kavanaugh matter since we went off the air on friday the White House did order an FBI investigation that FBI investigation is already being met with not surprisingly here\nChallenges they don't like the scope of it they don't like the nature of it they don't like the duration up and down the FBI is moving expeditiously they're focusing on Dr Ford and Mrs\nRamirez that's the Yale University allegation I'm not going to get into the\nTawdry details of that investigation but that's the two they're looking at\nThey will either find cooperating evidence for those witnesses dust\nAh cooperating their stories or they will not if they do not they're not going to say either one of these are lying you know what they're going to say where we have not been able to cooperate that testimony\nLast Brett Kavanaugh also in that case would not have been there's nothing to prove that he was making a misstatement or a false statement for the um Senate Judiciary committee and it would be drawn to be a boat on the floor of the Senate this week\nThe FBI could be done as early as today with that examination with that inspection or investigation but I think it's important for any kind of more former U.S attorney or the set out what this investigation is and is not the investigation\nIs due to is intended to do make granular fine details from these\nPeople who are making these allegations with respect to\nA judge Kavanaugh it the F. B. I. investigations three oh two sets the name of the form number do not reach conclusions they don't say and therefore we believe that or we recommend that that's not what it does it simply sets out facts\nAs they ... as the agent and they're usually two agents by the way who interview these witnesses not just one but two agents who go in an interview these witnesses and come up with a three oh two that they then give to their supervisor is reviewed and then it is set up the channels and eventually will reach the White House\nBut that's what they're supposed to do and I hope these field agents who are doing this do the right job\nAnd and our faithful to their task of finding facts as they are and don't do the things that FBI agents in the past on this program we've talked about doing\nAll right let's go right to the phones Jennifer calling from California on line one Jennifer welcome to Jay Sekulow lot Jennifer go ahead you're on the air\nThank you for keeping that you're on the process by which I think it's going to have kids that I have is any of that ... ... S C I bring out for their allegations there still are there are there and I guess\nThat's right so he's already cleared committee so that was part of the deal they will continue the investigation but he cleared committee so he's out of committee to the floor of the Senate\nThe question will be if there is no cooperating evidence of the allegations I think he goes to the floor and I think he's confirmed if they're cooperating evidence of the others I think then and that that's a credible credible cooperative evidence\nThen I think it raises a different issue wouldn't go back to the committee or it's still on the floor of the Senate yeah that's right I mean the the comedian really work is done although reporter\nProbably go to the committee Mitch McConnell could I mean this was a he had it bad for her but I I think if you're at that\nPoint the nomination is port um that's not up to the Senate now they can inform the White House White House would make that decision ultimately\nUm uh we we got to a well we'll take this we come back causes it about you know how the vote to work with explain all that we come back\nFrom the break if you talk to us on the air to one hundred sixty eight four thirty one twenty a hundred and sixty four three one zero but this this will drag out at least through the week yeah I think we're going to be covering this most of the week I mean it'll be on the other news will cover it all the report\nMay get Reno nevada report finish ... there's a chance is released to the committees are and to the Senate and it's a relief to the public and if there is no cooperating evidence I think he goes vote on a boat now whether they'll do the vote Thursday or friday or Wednesday that the Senate will decide what to look that\nThat investigation is winding down Clarence Thomas who took getting two or three days what kind of in the same point here I'm going to go quickly around here to get everybody's ten second assessment accident cooperation of these witnesses he's confirmed\nI think yes [noise] yes absolutely yes\nOr no I think is a very good chance of confirmation of if there's nothing in the FBI till robbery anything you know what race I think changes as well I think it'd be ... operating evidence I think Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed as the justice system for social justice to the Supreme Court or the United states\nThe investigation is ongoing so we'll see what happens when we come back we'll take your calls eight hundred and sixty four thirty one said we've got a video coming up so well for those and Facebooking periscope share this with your friends back with\nAt the American Center for law and justice we focus on the critical issues that matter most to you and your family\nA C.
