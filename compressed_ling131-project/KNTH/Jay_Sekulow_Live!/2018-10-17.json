J\nUh took this on and we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous uh uh help this was and and I'm grateful we are too\nWell look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we got\nAnother case right now where do we have an ad that result right now and that is a representing us are helping them see a Bebe and our office in Pakistan but do your case ended successfully but\nYou were there in prison in Turkey and very difficult circumstances but I think is I'll take a call in a minute here but Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long have you been there and what you were doing in Turkey what was your call to go there\nBut we were there for twenty four years before I was arrested and our main goal was to go and priests to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in with church planting we're involved with several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attack Syria a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid\nBut also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurtz have never met a Christian or in their lives and in Syria you're kind of preach the gospel it was forbidden\nSo we got involved with a Syrian refugees and we're a started a meeting among them that we're doing evangelist and what's that\n[noise] so you were there as basically it's a missionary I mean we can safely say that no we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did a very openly we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... a mission work to Syria's what it's all done out of the open\nBut before we take costs has to run to the question that over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local uh style regional government or the national government in Turkey at all\nWell there are cycles sometimes are there more accommodating to churches and to Christ centered sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up uh we had\nA there are often rather than from the government it's from a uh other people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats oh we were attacked once in our church with a man came with a shotgun\nSo that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but\nIt's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to uh arrest you and try and one of the one of the charges was Christian station so nothing nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that in that part of the world but but what happened to you was something that has not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing yes so you there's one follow up thing we're doing\nDid your case was closed and that's a great thing 'cause you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but she she you've gone and we still one legal issue we're going to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah they engaged\nIn the working group on arbitrary detention on engaged and pay our we presented the whole case she than\nThey're still making their decision and said that I have the now finalized with than what the decision went to court that he's back on a family with actually that decision and conviction and and what can release conditions where\nOh here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally jammed Facebook comments coming in Allen says God is so good so happy the pastor Brunson history Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you truly here due to answered prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving the gun and I said that the beginning of the broadcast\nA Andromeda ... and I said this and I I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work that was done by a team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that they invented in Washington and government affairs shop and Greg ...\nWho runs for office in ... and it's just a great job in the end and the circumstances of that I was representing you and then ended up representing the president I mean you know nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day\nThese though I I Believe that with and you got to take nothing away from any one\nThat the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to give credit where credit's is also do you not just the way we feel is the inland it's usually\nBut let me do this we we've Andrew we've got a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that phone and we're going to start taking calls yes Karen is calling in from New York\nOn line to Karen welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHi Karen you're on the past right ...\nThank you for taking my call and I did find that ... and I pray for him to LA I'm so thankful for prayers to answer that he's home and I wanted to let them know\nWhat an inspiration his testimony as a Christian to other Christians throughout the world and on the light that he was in the darkness and I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian to um the mole\nAnd preach the gospel to others that's what we call to do so I Want to thank him and tell him how happy I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWill do what you're talking right to um Andrew ... what do you what do you say to Karen\n... we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who prayed for us and we believe a obviously a God is that people\nAre but I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level or with the president uh was was periods of God's people and but I also think that\nAs we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to rise for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as a matter of fact we're looking at a puzzle ... from the bottom side\nAnd someday we will look from the top and all actually see the picture right now we don't see the full picture but God was\nDoing much more than just using ... to release me from print prison a I think there was he was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey\nAnd then to the middle east and that there's going to be a great harvest from this we haven't seen all of what all of the results yet but I think there there was much bigger than us\nI think you're right and again I I think the confluence of events that took place here was was pretty unprecedented I say that\nI mean because when we represent US Senate did know it'd be written a representing the president of the United states and then you had the ability to use this platform and that we're doing right now we're talking to millions of people and on Facebook compare scope and all these social media platforms\nAnd you're right at the end of the day that your your goal was to proclaim the gospel and you you you're doing that you've done that and I'm sure you will continue to do that but we have a lot of people don't want to talk to you is we're going to keep going back to these ... yeah let's go to Scott\nIn Colorado on line one Scott welcome to Jason show live you're talking to pastor Brunson Scott\nHey guys thank you for taking thank you to Jay and you're paying for your\nYour focus on religious freedom not just domestically but also internationally it's a great statement that this was making five to two questions are first of all pastor Brunson\nHow are you treated in the prison because you seem like a fairly healthy when you've got released I had no idea what to expect since you were there that long and number two\nAre you going to write a book on your experience has got to be fascinated to to see what this was like from the inside of Turkish prison and were you able to history in that\nEncountered in South Korea because of all that's why I'm a member of the hail today\n... ... per se clear about one individual and they care about us and for the whole world and passed up on her like question if they can feel occur are so people around the world prank Cleveland concern on how to live up there for him the court\nOkay so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so\nMy wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day goes through a whole day at work and just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had a son irrational think perhaps\nBut when one one it's isolated the way I was is it would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak and so uh as I look back\nUh on my second year of one guy who was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much but uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a\nThere was a great coming to me that often was not felt it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was very\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people said exactly the thing was that they feel even though it's irrational they have no into rational need those situations there can there be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president of the United states you know\nFBI agents was behind the scenes to stuff by any means necessary this was this was the result is not acceptable to these young ages they promise to stop it\nWhich is like they were discovered on this issue in this episode of these stations stations ... and the answer live from\nWashington DC you\nComes to the American Center for Law Justice\nWhat does this earlier joined the Cajun for us this is not something we get to do often we cases you know it's it's interesting we've been on a number of these over the years\nUh and which the ... but sometimes it takes I mean this was actually never Andrew ... felt like a lifetime but in our work is just born thing to point out\nWe've had him take four years we've got one right now with the ... going on six year nine nine okay since yeah and since came down almost a decade so in one sense this was quick although when you're the one in prison to journalism ...\nBut Andrew Brunson of course is now home in the United states and a lot of people all want to talk and before we get more calls and that's what we're going to do we want you to be able to talk to pastor Brunson\nUm for the next half hour this broadcast as we've done the first half hour but I Want to ask you something here but I Know this is on people's minds and that is what's next what what are you thinking next what are you bringing through\nWell we want to spend two or three months just seeking the lord and uh what he has for us but are we also need to go through some healing process or the lord has already done a lot of healing in our lives\nEspecially over the second year but but we still need to\nWork through some things I think\nUh I Want to be a seeking a refreshment\nAnd the lord and as presents a and our hearts and then it makes sense for years is I have a mission is calling and it's still an missions so in some way a ... it will continue so we're waiting for God to show us how and where\nBut that is where heart is\nSandra let me introduce you to somebody about another person from our Sam prisoner on cities right now in Washington DC you worked on your case tirelessly with members of the United States Congress and that is Ben Ben he's our director of governmental parents were audience knows him you haven't had the chance\nTo meet him yet he's ... your family all over the course of the last couple

off the air when I walked into the meeting\nWhich was a dozens of of uh senators and congressmen officers were represented there\nAre they actually stop the meeting and the house leadership was on the agenda to talk about their priorities they stopped the meeting\nAnd they should actually we want to use our time to than from these your day you just got here\nBecause we want to hear about pastor

and honored to speak with you and welcome home\nBut thank you and for us this very surreal because we are not very important people and as we we as I said we've been working at a corner of turkey for
