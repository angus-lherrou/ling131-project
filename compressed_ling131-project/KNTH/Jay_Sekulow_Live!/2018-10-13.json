I'm On the road obviously but I repeat the call this morning from the president of\nThe United states President Trump who told me to have\nGood news um looks like your pastor pastor Andrew Brunson will be coming home to the United states he gave me some of the details about that that that government been obviously working on their release but that was the process would be going\nTo to military bases that's how these things are handled but I express for the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member of course the family\n... for his unyielding unyielding a effort\nTo obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers and support for the past and let me also say there are I have a lot of idea what the media lot\nAs you know a ... in several different capacities outside the kill Jay but I Need to say this to my friends in the media these reporters a for these newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matter of fact but Barry ... in covering pastor Brunson case and the story\nAnd that help keep them alive as part of the process when you got\nPeople held like this and I'm a I'm a huge thank you and I told us to a couple of reporters today I appreciate them covering it and continuing to cover it and uh and that and that's across the board here a ... and it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN\nOr at covered extensively ab seniors are discovered it I mean I even talked about it with George Stephanopoulos on ABC this week a couple of weeks back so a good news on that front and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining us ... are now being processed out\nOf turkey and what that means is he's they're removing the ankle bracelet which was his monitor that it was at a house arrest\nThey will be taken to a military transport aircraft uh them probably flown directly to Germany or be evaluated may return to the United states I don't know exactly when that law that will be yet we're ... into that but I'm up we'll keep everybody posted as this progress progress over the next several hours\nBut a great day uh on any time you get these releases like this door to a great day we're still waiting for the one on the baby that case was earlier this week you know this way way up to the others but yeah ... are there were reports warning that that could be coming at any moment I'm Out of the package and it was a great day go ahead now\nTo the Pakistani U.S Supreme court that that case here or what happened pastor Brunson\nUltimately was ordered is that is unique it's similar to the situation as time served all the witnesses or against pastor Brunson basically drop their\nStories this morning in court in Turkey um instead they were that was they were not accurately reported as as what they had accused pastor Brunson of\nAnd uh and then ultimately the prosecutor a recommended in Turkey that he be allowed to travel or the ... no longer under judicial order and so that's why the ankle brace it will be coming off or is coming off as we speak right now his house release a house arrest\nOr will be released and ultimately he'll be given his passport\nAnd able to travel and and we he plans on doing that um later on today\nA in Turkey I just to remind you this is someone who spent two years and containment a year and a half of that in prison\nBecause of his Christian faith I pastor been there for twenty three years in Turkey in American\nI raised his family has three children he'll be reunited with the United states ah two sons and one daughter whose daughter's spoken out a very publicly for her father even going to the United nations in Geneva a show again I I've heard of his or as a sister on a as well so there's a family\nWhich is very excited to uh to see pastor Bronx is released it was a long and difficult process more difficult than it should have been with the NATO ally like turkey these and that was not like a situation\nI'm In Iran or North Korea right much uh with how complicated it got 'em an because an American citizen dead I figure it's just as big of a deal or to see his freedom ... everybody's\nA ... who was innocent and persecuted because their face it doesn't matter what countries doing it what relationship to us may have heard that country or their release is something to celebrate\nWhat look absolutely and we're thrilled with the outcome here and I hope this also goes a long way in restoring relations between the United states and turkey Turkey's been an important ally of NATO ally and they play up strategic role in the region and it would be good to see those relations are stored\nAnd this was a positive step is a secretary bump bail set it very positive step it met restoration process having said that also let me just say that this also gives you a glimpse and I'm going to go to bed on this gives you a glimpse of that nature which we have\nThese cases that was a unique situation here in that\nUh we had a situation where we had a NATO allies to it and said that took custody of an American so a NATO ally taken custody of an American pastor it happened to be also at the very same time but that fast or it was a ... jail\nHis family contacted us we immediately began a representation of him that predated my representation of the president but then of course not represent and and that but for over a year and a half now about a year now representing the president the United states and so it gave us a unique perspective on it and\nUh I think it was helpful for the pastor or to to have an advocate that could obviously a speak with the president but having said that this president but very very assertive on regarding\nSausages that are Americans back to the United states and is that a great track record there but it was a unique perspective for me it we've had a lot of these over the years but this was a little bit unique in that sense but again I when I got back off with the predator this morning I was just\nA really delighted with the with the news that we wanted it conveyed I we set up a a video on Facebook immediately\nThat we sent out a report courts or social media outlets as well but we're glad now that we're talking with our our radio audience\nThan I think it's important for you to state the nature of the bipartisan ship that was involved with this and what we were able to accomplish on a legislative level that help move this all\nWell I think it was particularly important given the fact that you just pointed out that this was an ally of the United states that we had a vested interest in maintaining a good relationship with so today we're grateful to both countries but you're right Jay this was a little bit different in that regard first of all it was important for the administration\nTo speak with one voice the vice president and the president the secretary state ambassador Brownback being in the courtroom Jay but then in Congress I mean\nI I I Would first give a it gave me a tip of the hat to senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrat from New Hampshire who went over to turkey herself and J I Will tell you was extremely engage behind the scenes\nBoth on putting pressure on turkey when when it was appropriate but then also engaging diplomatically with turkey and reassuring turkey did the United states wanted a strong relationship with him and and freeing pastor Andrew Brunson was the best way to accomplish that and so\nYou know there was sort of a a team of four senator Lankford senator tell us who went down to the floor of the United States Senate every single week for the past several months to speak on behalf of the pastor\nAnd Senator Graham but Jay a multiple letters multiple congressional testimony a pastor Brunson daughter came\nTo Congress to testify visits to turkey engaging diplomatically and also to pressure means up by camera all bipartisan and all of them gay speaking with one voice from the half the United states government a behind the president\nAnd at the same time you say to my uh came our team your teeth are that are listening and members of the AC okay\nYou're the ACL Jay bad bet it is team in DC uh Greg ... a team at the European set up a lawn justice engage at the un on multiple occasions uh so we're very happy that are very happy with the way this tape\nCame out a Logan team that was in charge of the media and social media operation a year stake here to our entire team we want where we say we utilize all the lawyers\nOr government affairs professionals\nAre mediate professionals social media professionals video media proposals everyone engaged in this top to bottom\nA sacred toward tired they literally are steps in all those I Would say every office that we have around the globe was involved in one way or another with is a effort so I'm a great great result\nYeah that's right and we have our one of our lead attorneys here in the United states other matters cc has been very busy today on the phone with the with the family coordinating everything now that they have gotten to this day that they were waiting for hoping foreign praying for as we know so many of you were praying for\nIncluding let me think the five hundred thousand a six hundred and seven people almost six hundred thousand people who sign on to the partition\nAh to free uh American pastor Andrew Brunson or at our our team again all of those efforts to grassroots efforts here in our country\nOr the legal efforts the efforts abroad by our European and uh other affiliates of the American Center for law and justice this was all because of a your support of the A. C. O. J.\nThat we're able to do these kinds of cases of this kind of scale and help the family and represent the Brunson Brunson or in this manner\nAnd it would no charge to them and to take this again and ultimately again we were able to work with our government in a way that his was more difficult with the previous administration\nBut the current the Trump Administration doing an excellent job in keeping this a priority for two years I mean think about that for a White House for a State Department\nOn Turkish officials to see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough\nUm how important it is that all of you stood by for those two years I'm a pastor Brunson I Know he thinks shoe and his family things shoe and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story\nUm I think he will come to realize even more so over the next twenty four forty eight hours how many people were following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states is certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows\nAre some that will be doing later today who stood with this story I
