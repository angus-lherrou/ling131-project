assuming the FBI report corroborate stuck to forge allegation\nOf a sexual party of a sexual assault and you're thirty five years ago but you still want Brett Kavanaugh to confirm to the Supreme Court do you still want him confirmed even if the report corroborate a doctor for the allegation\nGuys if you'd like to lose belly fat gain energy and feel great try and grow for hungry the safe natural and

the FBI report has been delivered from the FBI\nTo the White House to the U.S Senate senators are reviewing it right now some already have the word out a from both sides is that there is no information to operate any of the allegations against red capital what does that mean\nLet me as as of now as of everyone they distributed so far in the public has not been able to we have not been able to review that yet I'm this information has at least it's being kept a very close to the best uh by the U.S\nIs that this will now interface three of the attack on Brett Kavanaugh is it do all this doesn't matter\nWe don't like his temperament we don't like the fact that he was tough on us because we made allegations that we now though could not be cooperative by our nation's top law enforcement agency the FBI and a ... and uh and they didn't like how Brett Kavanaugh active when he was being accused of that\nBy those Democratic senators who made this extremely partisan process\nBeverly on Facebook writes this though now the culture the vote that motion has been a a filed\nThat should happen tomorrow the confirmation votes should happen on Saturday the\nBeverly on Facebook Rice's we're getting the phone calls ready to go what can the Democrats do now to obstruct or has their game run out there and I think there there are games close but I stayed very guarded ... vigilant if your eye Brett Kavanaugh supporter because I'm\nThough Susan colleges made what could be interpreted as positive comments after reviewing a report saying you know it's just seems to be very thorough I'm incomplete that's the opposite of what Democrats what a ... are saying so she's not calling for more investigations I'm Jeff Flake same that they are nothing there\nBut but this war is not yet over we talked about this phase three which is already happening this will still face to the the sexual allegations base three is temperament and they're still focusing on that I think that we'll see that shift happened in the next few hours\nYeah and and look the the the Senate Democrats aren't going to be convinced on this door and so they're not going to stop the targeting and they know they know just as well as as as you and I do that the three Republican senators that they need to convince they need to go to the three there Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski\nOr Jeff Flake and Jordan I don't think it's going to stop all the way through Saturday and here's why I think they will make an argument to those three centers that even if you vote for cloture tomorrow you think there's enough information out there you think there's FBI investigation was Thoreau that's reason enough to stop debate\nBut we want to convince you that this is not the right nominee for the court and and I think they will still continue making those arguments\nTo those three senators all the way up until Saturday but Jordan\nAt some point those three senators have to step into the well the Senate and do the job to their constituents elected them do and by the way the job that the constitution requires them it doesn't require a yes vote or a no vote but it does require that they provide advice and consent so at some point or come Saturday they're going to have to come down\nAnd put their money where their mouth is yeah\nAdults who writes on Facebook will McCaskill vote for Kavanaugh she's a close race that's right but the real clear politics average has her down a\nHalf a point somebody in a very close race in Missouri [noise] that being said than\n[noise] we don't believe that that like Claire McCaskill would be the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh a little to get it to piece of the vice president can be the vote confirming what we do believe is that if you get flake\nCollege Murkowski that it's very likely that you'll get maybe a job at should and Claire McCaskill because they will be the deciding vote but it will make their constituents back in a better vote for them to take in a red state like West Virginia and Missouri\nPolitically speaking Jordan all three of those states I I think the constituents of those states would prefer there senators to vote yes I mean the polling we have out of\nNorth Dakota in West Virginia is overwhelming a judge Kavanaugh has a plus thirty favorability there which is almost unheard of you know you've got Joe Manchin probably up by six or eight point you've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWho's racist really falling away from her feet in the last poll I saw a she was down twelve points are there in North Dakota she would really like to be a yes vote or Claire McCaskill the same way\nThe races running towards a Josh Holly there I think she would politically benefit from a yes vote but here's just the reality you set it and I think it's basically an ironclad truth none of them are going to provide the forty ninth or the fiftieth vote for judge Kavanaugh all\nOf them might be willing to provide the fifty first the first fifty second or the fifty third but ultimately Senate Republicans are going to have to deliver fifty votes on judge Kavanaugh if he's going to become justice Kavanaugh\nAlright one hundred sixty four thirty one to the talk to us on the air that one eight hundred six eight for three one zero I the the breaking news here is that we are moving very close\nTo actual votes on bread capital votes to better the cloture vote to matter stand that vote is is it let's explain to people get a we won't do it throughout the show but a couple of types of people that are state what's happening\nThis cloture vote that will happen tomorrow or how many votes required to move forward and and what happens in the meantime between the cloture vote and the actual final vote to get Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nShould the only way you can in debate on any measuring the United States Senate or Jordan he's either by unanimous consent or by taking a cloture vote which is a vote to agree to end debate now clearly there's not unanimous consent to end debate on this nomination there never would be so leader McConnell had to file a cloture motion last night\nUnder route twenty two of the Senate there has to be an intervening day which is today before he can take that vote on the cloture motion so tomorrow at any point and he has said it will be before\nOne o'clock he will call the roll on that cloture motion sinners will go down to the floor and a yes vote would mean yes we are ready to end debate on this nomination a no vote would be we want to keep debating this nomination so it takes fifty votes\nYou have a tie breaker from the vice presidents do you really only need fifty votes to end debate\nOn that cloture motion if it's approved Jordan it immediately sets the clock to thirty hours you can have thirty hours of post cloture today before you take the final vote so you know hypothetical if that vote was at noon tomorrow in theory\nOr the Democrats could continue debating until six pm on Saturday Night or they could use some of that time back but at the bottom line of vote tomorrow morning or up to one o'clock on the cloture motion which will set a thirty our time clock in motion before the final vote\nGood question coming in from Mike in Pennsylvania on lied five talking about the process here we all sort of talk about what do you think is\nComing next I don't think the Democrats are ready to back to uh get Chris crew codes kinda sounded like that that he expects the confirmation by slim majority but I think again they would like you just to put your guard down there like Brett Kavanaugh see the ... bike or for Pennsylvania you're on the air [noise]\nThey might [noise] you're like oh it's great I can add that I think this way but I Would get curious if they\nGet they tried to figure it out and act like they were actually going to change their mind is the last man to it but not the confirmation that legally what could they do that\nYou could absolutely have more votes for cloture the confirmation than I mean uh\nIt's unusual ah but ah but I I think that would be unusual that so it gets through and\nEnough would drop drop through a but there are there is always heard that argument that you should have up or down votes that would be that vote to cloture vote to allow the up or down vote of but things have changed as we went from sixty votes threshold and the filibuster to a fifty one vote threshold\nYeah this is a conversation I've had with a bunch of people today Jordan and typically you're writing cloture vote or the ... the tally on that's going to look very much like the final confirmation that is not necessarily the case on this because I can see a Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Manchin saying look\nI really wanted a thorough investigation the FBI gave us that so I did think it was time to wrap up to date but ultimately I couldn't just I couldn't get there and I think the same thing is through a true for someone like Jeff Flake you might say I got the investigation I wanted so I'm good for\nFor cloture don't assume that means he's good on a final I think both of those hurdles or wants to watch on this one Jordan\nOr I mean so there you go Mike I mean I think very good question and as Ted said I like the past very possible that this is a one where you could see people voting different ways on the first vote for culture so don't take things for granted right now\nThe yes this was the best case scenario for Brett Kavanaugh nomination to move forward for him to be confirmed was it the FBI report came back and there was nothing to corroborate nothing to re suspicious of any of the allegations against him that has occurred\nThe Senate is reviewing it now but all reports from both sides the out indicate that\nDisagree with judicial philosophy but are qualified to be adjusted Supreme Court which all indications ... capital but yes so they could really do that had to be very part is we don't like his judicial philosophy that doesn't sell well with American voters so\nSo what they do ... he's a criminal except for care corroborate that\nSo what's next by like his temper I don't like the way he he responded to to me typical us there's I think the kids are screaming people all the time ... to people all the time but you've got to treat them with kid gloves that's uh that's just not the case they're ... they're they're politicians\nDon't forget that there Paola ... statewide elected office holders um I I think again one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to the people to talk to us on the air there is a lot to go through about how how this moves forward\nUm there'll be a lot of debate in America I don't think there's going to be so much for the FBI report honestly I think that it's\nA no cooperation there may be some tidbits here there that are unique but they don't think there would be those kind of blanket statements coming out of both sides of the aisle\nIf there was anything there\nThat is the best case let me repeat that again for Brett Kavanaugh\nThey were not going to come out say doctor for his ally or these other people liars they could have come out and found people who agree with the story no what did that\nNot a single person no core operation of the serious criminal accusations against Brett Kavanaugh so now the line of attack for Democrats is we don't like the way he acts or we don't like the way he sounds\nDon't like the way he responded this is again just listed for temperament and temperament to permit over and over again from the left and the next twenty four hours they're going to have time to take to for the U.S didn't talk they're going to do the cable news interviews\nAre but I think what is so telling Diane Feinstein said\nWhich is that what is a was most interested in or was it was not there because there was nothing there to report about Brett Kavanaugh and these are horrendous allegations we come back and the second half hour of the broadcast [noise] do you take your phone calls I brought up the discussion is well\nWe could continue to explain what will happen next which is so important I think people are ready for this would to wrap up [noise] um and we're moving that way and positive direction\nOne eight hundred sixty four thirty one to talk to us on the air it's one eight hundred and sixty four\nThree one zero follow the workday seal J. A. C. L. J. or there's a lot going on\nOutside of the south and they should vote that certainly it's going to be the focus for broadcast through the week we'll be right back I'll tell you suck you a lot\nHe's coming November six\nPerhaps the most important midterm election in our history\nDo we have the momentum the mainstream\nMedia is president Donald Trump with everything they have they want to destroy this president she came from and so far\nTo change things can you do with us to find out how\nAm ten Seventy the answer [noise]\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie ...
