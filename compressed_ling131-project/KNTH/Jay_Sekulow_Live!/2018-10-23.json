J. he\nSaid going forward we will only give to our friends what a novel idea we're going to support those people\nRent and to Jordan's point J I don't think Europe better go down this line of that has the United states resolve on that point\nHuge mistake now interestingly I like this line I'm going to read it first and I'm going to play at\nThe president said that image advance not harmed by acknowledging the obvious facts America's policy of principle realism means we will not be held hostage to old dog was discredited ideology isn't so called experts who have been proven wrong over the years time and time again let's listen to it\nThat ... not harmed\nBy acknowledging the obvious fast America's policy of ... ...\nMeans we will not be held hostage\nTo hold off on this this letter that ideologies and so called experts who have been proven wrong\nOver a year's\nTime again you know\nAnd the time and time again is important because let me give you a for instance when talking to play despite the moment and this is about Jerusalem the president made a very bold move in May of this year\nMoving to recognize the embassy of the United states from Tel Aviv\nTo Israel's eternal capital Jerusalem\nNow there were a lot of advisors previous advisors in previous administrations saying this was disastrous this was going to start a third intifada there's gonna be a new war in the middle east\nThe our allies will be angry you cannot move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with out reshaping the world order I mean it was it was that significant the way people are going to impact the entire Arab world the entire Muslim world and there'll be no way that this could be reconciled\nAll right so what happens to president moves the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and did they\nDid in the world collapse did\nThe middle east realignment get injured know who are the allies of Israel right now in the region who are thought this Jordan Egypt Saudi Arabia and a number of the Gulf states so taking Jerusalem off the table as a negotiating ship actually was really smart\nSo when the president engage that issue he knew exactly what it was going to do it didn't match the ball forward\nGoing out and also those are ... or so called experts thought that the best way to move forward palaces was throwing money\nHundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion dollars a year and all their program so you know what it's gotten us nowhere over decades like the president said so we're not going to go by just the the so called experts were going to cut that funding\nWe recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was cut off the front of the Palestinians and then we see what changes we ... it's all about taking new approaches you don't always know exactly how things will turn out I think would Jerusalem that was a long term decision all the funding of the Palestinians is because what has happened in the past has failed\nAnd how many times how many decades of failure do you need on record before you tell the state department we're not letting you do\nBusiness as usual elevate let me let me play the Jerusalem will because I think this is very important number thirty seven\nThis year we also took another significant step forward in the middle east\nAnd recognition of\nTo determine his own capital I Move the U.S embassy in Israel\nThe United states has committed to a future race and civility in the region including peace between\nIsraelis and the Palestinians the president\nDid do and I think this is very significant by moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAll we recognize was the obvious sovereign nation gets to determine its capital ... states is the district of Columbia in Jerusalem, Israel is tourism so we simply recognize what was under the law the right of the Israelis to do and that they didn't do through their process they\nDetermine where their capital was going to be now you take it to the next step in Jordan mentioned to the United nations relief agency which we think it's been a scam on the un and the American people billions of dollars for what is we and we we went to court on this against the state department in one and started getting the reports\nAnd saw the fraud that was involved in this and again the president to carry decisive action counter two decades of policy advice\nAbsolutely so the president's policy in Concord distinction to the prior administrations approach in the middle east\nHas produced results today if you look at the middle east it is quite different than it was even two or three years ago it's important to note that many Arab nations are now working either covertly or directly with Israel\nThey face and a ... threat from the Iranian Revolutionary republic\nHum in addition to the United states has placed pressure on the Palestinians we will no longer fund their terror campaign their pay for slate campaign this is placing direct and unmistakable pressure on the Palestinian authority and on Hamas\nThat is the way he has backed up the word he gave to Jay Jay with action on the ground so as it relates to China if they don't come to the table and contribute in any like fashion the president will just keep pulling the United states dollars back and allocating indirectly\nWhen we come back from the break I Want to get into the issue of the international criminal court the president mentioned that and I've appeared there I Know that one\nUh so they were able to talk to you about a lot of these issues and said I I've had the privilege of being at that podium at the general assembly I've been here before the office of the prosecutor at the uh UN at the international criminal court in the Hague are presenting Israel's interests before the I. C. C. so I've done this\nOr we're going to talk about that we're talking about the president's comments on globalism and take more of your phone calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one ones here that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten it was interesting that the president had this statement\nThe Iranian people again this this is drawing a distinction between the Iranian regime and the Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran's treasury let me play for you sound bite thirty one\nUranium people are rightly outraged\nThey're leaders have embezzled millions of dollars from Iran's fresh [noise]\nSees value ... of the [noise]\nLooted and people's religious and down this\nWall to line their own rockets and send their promises to wage war not\nThat is from the president the United states speaking at\nThe United nations strong words on the Iranian regime if we've got thirty more minutes ahead of this broadcast if you don't get the full hour discovered ACL J died or were screaming at their course on Facebook at Facebook dot com slash secular were periscope\nYou could run it that you can get it there as well and we encourage that course a lot of states now carry the full hour for those of you that are going to be staying with us we've got um coming up [noise]\nI really want to get into this issue of the global is issue the whole international criminal court and how that plays into this and we're taking your calls at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tent don't forget to work at an ACL Jay you do that at a C. O. J. down or back with more than just a moment [noise]\nWe have no figured out that it's really impossible for Democrats to compromise he said do this means the Travolta will pass so they shut down the government they block immigration reform even sacrifices citizenship at one point eight million dreamers just to block Trump\nVery little is going to get done without a flight so this is what you do in this situation you fight and you tell those on your\nSide of like for you that's what we do\nHave a um ten Seventy the answer [noise] live\nWashington DC\nSo for the American Center for law and justice secular everybody\nWalking back to the broadcast the president gives a major address to the United nations I joined it said this during the break through the\nTwo that are always the most anticipated at least for the media or the presidents and the prime minister of Israel\nThat's usually it for me to hear the United states that's where the focus goes ah because you will see a lot of controversy surrounding the prime minister of Israel from ... in the crowd\nThat the United Nations General assembly inside the building\nAnd then of course we want to see our president\nKind of lay out the foreign policy issues that are the most important but also what we're doing is seeing our presidents speak to the world this is a a unique time when it's not the president just addressing the nation he does that you know he addresses our nation regularly for this was an address to the world and world leaders that's his audience there\nAnd of course there are there are things for everybody to pay attention to our Americans\nTo understand the thought process going behind a our foreign policy but\nThis is really a statement to the world on where America's going into the Eighteen twenty Nineteen and where are they focused and we're seeing a lot of focus on Iran\nWe're seeing a again I'm the focus on the middle east or the ... of the world that is again still the most uh turmoil I'm ... and then obviously a lot of economics or we haven't gotten into that there's a lot of economic focus in this speech as well and the idea of the America First idea\nBut also saying you should be doing this in your own country to yeah should be looking up your own people's interest stop just joining these global institutions and letting them decide for you your trade deal\nHarry what would you say that you took is the biggest takeaway from the speech\nWell among other things uh one of the biggest pick a ways but I took his the rejection by President Trump of the advice and the approach taken by global is\nGlobal is are quite willing to prop up horrendous regimes for instance like the Iranian regime the number one state sponsor of terror\nAnd so the question then becomes how does that approach advance human rights\nCoup by ya he's not a solution maximum pressure in principle realism is a solution\nSo the president offered a clear message to global elites who are often willing to trade\nHuman lives in pursuit of the illusion that all of the world's leaders are actually interested in peace rather than expanding terror and so one of the messages that was clear\nOr to the world and to\nGlobal leaders was we are rejecting past approaches that have failed\nWith respect to Iran with respect to Syria and with respect to any ... regime that ... it's um people's hopes and dreams instead of advancing\nA true peace going forward\nAmerica is governed by Americans that's where the president said listen to this\nAmerica is governed\nBy America [noise]\nWe're in jak any ideology of globalism\nAnd we embrace it died I\nHate to\nI mean this isn't contradict takes you I mean this is the complete opposite man of the way the previous administration address the world we were all part of this you know global ... a world which of course we are part of a global world but we are protecting here our sovereignty and our ability to\nOur own fake it was very strong and very much in distinction to previous administration\nWilling quite frankly Jay that approach is necessary if you want to restore American leadership around the world I mean the president I thought\nAh you know he back that up by saying if their program is not helpful not only to the world but to American interests like unreal like the human rights council\nWe are not going to go along with it just because decades or tradition said that we have to\nAt the same time Jay he issued the red lines for Syria we've heard red lines before but I think the rest of the world knows that this president or now means and won't dare cross it so again American leadership in the world Jay if you can be resolved to restore that but unless you're committed to back it up with words it won't go very far this president\nWill back it up and I think the world knows it [noise] I we're taking your phone calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one hundred sixty four three one two one zero your reaction
