S.\nVote against our interests and then assume that we're going to give you a millions upon millions of dollars so I think that change uh American leadership it's a total shift\nFrom how the state department in from about diplomacy in the U.S has has existed for decades it was we used to have the idea of kind of placate everybody with cash now it now the new strategy is we take that cash from you and you can come begging to us when you change your policy\nI think that's exactly right is number one I think that there is that relates to all of those issues\nAll right so we're taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one town we want to know your thoughts on what do you think the main issue that we should be focusing on view in the United states and I buy I start with Israel but I Want to get other people's and North Korea certainly in there as well\nIran another one I mean you're talking about hotspots the UN ambassador ship ban you you are un representative\nFor the ACL Jay ... is a big role I mean and look through years is a long time it service or in that role she's worked very very hard I we had a chance to work with her a closely last year and I've been an obscene or a on and off during the last a year and a half and I would actually you know you could tell she is working on it I think she did a great a just a fantastic job\nYeah it's a huge role Jay because of how many leverage point to exist inside that chamber and in Jordan talked about the financial aid when I totally agree with that I also think\nAh in in terms of foreign policy team everything comes back to that signature move of moving the embassy\nBut think about the other leverage points Jamie no longer has the United states deferred other caucuses inside the un I mean the organization for the Islamic cooperation do you think they're driving the agenda now know the United states is no longer have they declined to use their leverage to things like vetoes and the Security Council which the last administration\nDeclined to do a no longer had they been afraid to withdraw from ineffective un bodies think about unrest\nAnd then again back to the financial support both dollars to the United nations and two countries who don't align with the United states to get all of those ... points that essentially the last administration had laid down a President Trump and bats are Haley pick them back up and use them over the last two years yeah I think that you know you're exactly correct\nAnd you know I I think very effectively as I said well taking your calls and comments eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten let's go ahead and take a vocal\nYet right to the phones we go Jerry in Rhode Island on line three Jerry welcome to the United states welcome [laughter] I was reading something about that are getting welcome to their age\nI think I think you partially answered the question like I mentioned the producer when\nWhen you put an ambassador in I'm assuming that even the agenda by the ... president ... or like I said so what part of it is a reactionary or the rest of the world so when you ask us what we think whatever we're just now with ...\nYou're not broke don't fix it keeps going that way but it comes from a leader and the president\nOnce you're so here's what happened to the United nations sometimes is a cabinet level but not always under this administration it has been a cabinet level I think under Brock Obama's it was not\nUm so independent she was a cabinet members that meant you had to go through the confirmation ... investors do anyways but she didn't go through a confirmation process but the agenda is set by the administration she works closely with the president the secretary say where she was extremely effective is her advocacy at the United nations itself both publicly and behind the scenes\nYeah that's right I mean she just she again I think that she showed this idea of strength\nShe changed the way the U.S foreign policy was going to move forward or from the past administration to the Trump Administration and she put it into action so she called the un out for what it was she called the Russians out for what they were doing the Chinese what they were\nDoing the Iranians stood with Israel and when the administration decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move our embassy to ah to is to Jerusalem the remember there was a voted to you and have all these countries condemning that\nAfter that even before she said you better what we're watching how you vote after that she announced the new U.S plan which is that you would no longer receive aid if you regularly voted against us interest at the United nations anywhere you want to get that if you're a country that came to the un\nAnd bashed the U.S and and then voted against her interest but you received all this a humanitarian aid right or more humanitarian aid for you if you continue to vote that way and act that way\nBut when you say than a from your experience in dealing with the state department on this issue I actually she's a very effective advocates both publicly and behind the scenes what's your sense\nI think the most effective we've seen in recent times she and look at it comes back to the ambition level of the ... the ... the engine is not very ambitious the position is not that important but this agenda was incredibly ambitious all the way from the embassy moved to the financial aid to withdrawing from bodies\nAnd back to the last caller's point I think it really answer this question Jay the president determines the agenda but then the ambassador has to implement I'll just give you one example\nWithdrawing from the human rights council that is a decision that has made it to presidential at a level but then ambassador Haley had to actually go down to the human rights council and implemented in and I'll tell you the fallout was tremendous around the world and I would say in an extremely important in a positive way\nBecause that council has has has ceased to further a human rights agenda for a long time now but\nThe president decides investor Haley has to actually go into the well into the chamber and implement that agenda\nLet me play for you what a Nikki Haley said this is a former announcement yesterday\nWhen he and I both on foreign policy now than I\n\nWe were going to gain from ... certainly private whether it was the chemical\nWhether it was saying that our country\nWhether ... is an amazing both towers\nSo I think the legacy that Nikki Haley creates is a very positive one but look it's an important role I Know there's a lot of people complain about the UN and believe me we are critical because they they their policies on Israel and others have been ridiculous and they're fake red lines and and you can go on and on\nThe back of the matter is that we need effective advocates there and we've had that with Nikki Haley so again we want to know kind of your view on what you think the top aspects topics you should be that we're addressing it to you and I mean what does this way it's the middle east and this isn't it a particular order I I think these are the big\nIssue points it's the middle east which the it's the it's the Israel Palestinian conflict the greater Middle East that would include Iran because you have to look at the Iranian situation that's part of that then you've got the whole Russia\nIssues with the Ukraine then you go over to China you've got the issues with China and then particularly been into the Korean Peninsula as you look at that agenda you understand that that UN ambassador has got a broad swath of\nWhat they're dealing with yeah when you deal with the an expert in a lot of Russian you\nDeal with Iran you're also dealing with Syria and the conflict there um and then of course the broader issue Russia's reforming corrupt United Nations\nSo we looked at the uh defunding of unrest and those other kind of a un programs that have been a a so so poorly run and uh again so this out of control you\nAnd I think all of that is very important but I Love to hear for everybody out there one eight hundred six eight four thirty one to ... hundred six eight for three one two one zero and then you said that you thought that um\nThe fact that that the situation in North Korea and the sanctions there and Nikki Haley's aggressiveness on behalf of the president in ... in the United states served us very well [noise]\nYeah and you mentioned it earlier in the broadcast day but I think it belongs in that list that you and Jordan just rattled through because North Korea has no doubt move in a positive direction now we're not all the way where we need to be but the reason that that dialogue is happening in the region that progress has been made\nIs because the United states led the international community and putting sanctions in place on North Korea to actually bring them back to the table investor Haley was the main spokesman in the United nations chamber for those sanctions so I think you know going forward certainly in the middle east is always the epicenter I mean he ... he always has to hostility toward Israel front and center on their agenda\nBut I think right or in the next year is that North Korea a front\nI think that's right and uh so what's going to happen is the president's going to make a an announcement in the days ahead of who is nominee will be that it will talk about that process there'll be a confirmation process there\nThere's a lot of talk onto it might be but I think the president's narrowed down his list\nOnce the confirmation because they've just been through the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process what this confirmation going to look like well\nIt obviously depending on who it is gay but look I think you need expected to be contentious I think you're going to have to appoint somebody that is is qualified ready for the job so that they can get through look I I think this is one of the reasons jade that you're not going to see somebody who is already in a spot that require confirmation because then all of a sudden you have two people that you've got to get through the confirmation process\nI think those are probably going to be somebody that's not in a confirmed spot already and Jay I'll predict that\nThere's two qualities that Nikki Haley had that the next candidate will have to got to be somebody that's tough as nails because they've got to go into this venue and be prepared for people to walk out when they're ... you know gender\nOr but then they're going to also have to have that diplomatic characteristic that Jordan's talking about Nikki Haley leaves it very well liked inside the United nations and that's tough to do when you're advancing it engendered as aggressive as she has she's\nBeen very effective uh Elena Facebook said Nikki Haley's resolving stripped change the position of the UN ambassador when someone like that to fill that role I think I think it was actually right here\nI think that's precisely correct so we need someone like Nikki Haley someone who is a clear coherent advocate of tough American policies someone who demands respect on the world stage\nAnd someone that advanced lose power interest how hard do you think the confirmation fight for this one could be [noise]\nDepends on the person but it's very hard I could be very hard difficult in this whole like this will be ... [noise] yeah so I think some of them to tournaments or that's what happened another impact and they let me see if can can control the U.S Senate though may be a tough confirmation but not as tough\nSupreme Court one which is what we're taking your calls the one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tennis 'cause we're here for another thirty minutes if we're not getting out of the\nJust ... down over audio and video streaming at their same on Facebook and parents go open our social media platforms\nIt's another way for you to hear the broadcast we encourage you to do that\nAs well at a a seal jaded or Facebooking periscope I mean if you want to talk to us eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten back with\nYou might have to do this you're locked in a culture war in this country there were a powerful figures on the far left who wants to destroy everything this country stands for religious freedom strong border family values they have a different idea this radio station eggs is\nJust like the culture war\nThough some mistakes you believe in American exceptionalism freedom and liberty here when this war [noise] am ten Seventy the answer\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie\nThan having ... from out from our when you walk following around someone out of town\nAnd now she's come so for the American Center for law and justice secular\nNikki Haley announces that she will be resigning at the end of the year as her position as US ambassador to search for two years\nAnd that's a that's a significant amount of service it's a big sacrifice for the government officials when they go into government service like this financially uh it's it's you know it's an expensive undertaking as you can imagine\nBut she's been a very effective one of her most effective advocates in us history I think Nikki Haley will go down as one of those effective un ambassadors in us history I I've no hesitation and saying that\nThe I mean think about what we've done I mean the U.S has accomplished under ambassador Haley we recognize a Jerusalem as the capital of Israel finally and we take it to the world and say you know what are you can condemn is do you want\nA you better watch or aid money uh we've changed the u._s. foreign policy approach to diplomacy where we used to just throw money out I'm even countries that would oppose the city you wind up pose our foreign policy and to throw money out to try to appease them in that it's been changed\nA show the the tone or it's been ... I Would say it's not just the tone change\nFrom the Obama administration it is a complete\nLee new approach to diplomacy at at the United nations that has been done by any previous administration in modern history what do you think Harry well\nUm I think that's absolutely correct I think it's important to recognize that during a Nikki Haley's tenure the United states has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal we have responded with top rhetoric to North Korea and that has drawn\nI'm a real see us there ... ... ... we have continued to impose sanctions on for many regimes including Russia Iran and North Korea and I think that has drawn a real response of throughout the world\nHow the level of respect for the United states has risen immeasurably\nWe are getting a lot of calls are a lot of ... notes posted on Facebook and periscope a than about what's going to happen let's walk people through um\nThe what the process looks like the this was another one that I mean we just came out of a compromise for Supreme Court justice ambassadors are also confirmed and this is the president nominates actually already Senate advice and consent\nWell and we already heard from the president on this day that he expects to give us a name and the next two or three weeks you said maybe sooner he said he's down to a handful of named already but once he decides\nUh yes it will be sent to the Senate or there will be there'll be confirmation hearings it will go to the floor I think Jordan is correct that it's not going to follow the protracted timeline of the Supreme Court nomination uh but yeah I Do expect to just to just because of the nature of the Senate right now I expected to vote margin\nOr will be slim I think that whoever is nominated will probably get all of the Republican support and probably a handful of Democrats so it probably won't be as razor closes the Supreme Court but look I think he saw the play by play book from the minority in the United States Senate right now\nUp until the elections and maybe even following Jay they plan to oppose any one significant who's nominated regardless of who they are\nI mean during that were just a minute I think that look we can it can be a bruising process and it's going to depend on who it is now the president is going to\nHe he picks people that are going to carry the agenda administration forward of course you're almost starting with forty eight objects as before you start yes I think the votes going to be\nClose I think we just went through a really horrendous process for the Supreme Court and and so a comparing it to that is is it's probably not fair ... it to get ... as long as the person is ... is qualified\nThey will be confirmed um you know let's just let's just issues you know about um that that uh again it appears that the ... or Maine Republican hands that'll be the key 'cause that's when this will happen is after the midterm elections and after\nThose people are in place so it's because she's staying until\nThe end of the year so that that means it will be the next Congress that will be confirming or this or this mess or to the ...\nI think that to look I I spent one of the fight but a real probably worth having 'cause it's a very very important role All right we're gonna take more calls me come back from breaks up your online hang on we're duty right after the break you want to talk to us when or what do you think about the UN would be important issues are what do you think about Nikki Haley center one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten\nPraying for our friends in the panhandle of Florida it's a monster storm coming on for about an hour and a half again we'll take your calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero Dover gets more work in the ACL Jay you could do that an ACL Jay dot org but boy we are praying for you and winds of a hundred and fifty miles an hour [noise] going to the Panama City back for more than a moment [noise]\nGot to be\nVery careful lifelike is warning new and they want you to know about the FBI warning financial institutions rather scheme known as an ATM\nCash out attackers could hack a banker payment card processor and then use stolen information to withdraw huge sums of money and aid GM's worldwide this alert called a private industry notification was that to a group of cyber security professionals and system administrators at financial firms that had\nAssets at risk their lives and it's a dangerous world out there good thing new life lock identity theft protection as the power of Norton Security to help protect us against threats to our identity and our devices\nThat no one can stop every cyber threat prevent all identity theft or monitor transactions all businesses but new life like with Norton Security can see threats you might miss on your own life lock dot com or call eight hundred lifelike\nWe sure to use the ...
