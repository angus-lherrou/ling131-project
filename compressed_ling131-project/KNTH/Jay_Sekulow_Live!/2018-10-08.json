Yeah Richard John new house\nSo that the the idea that that even at the Lowes we get the idea of some times that things are the most\nImportant decision in the world yeah but in fact I think his father in law was that there's something greater than something more than something better that and that is for a\nCritical thinking God and thinking for the sake of course the kingdom of God\nAnd and the things that you're you're leading wanting a field that you're required to have a lot at all those things to you and that's why I so I I I keep coming back to that but at whatever dignity there isn't politics it's ... it's all to let this year on what you\nWould go to the mall or a you know ultimately that's what that's what I had to take refuge in because I found myself that I I always ... I just ask myself is this really\nSomething that I should um be upset about and yeah to some degree but it's not the ultimate\nAnd so that's where also I I couldn't do anything if I could have done something maybe but I couldn't do anything and so I just remind myself of that I think the way new house said it that a\nPolitics a shares in the modest dignity of the penultimate right now and uh yeah that's correct and that has helped me\nYou want to train them we bend English shares in the modern in the ... D modesty dignity of ... what is the penultimate deep uh nothing that is not quite ultimate right which comes before what is it is the modest dignity ride\nHis hands dignity but there is a modest dignity of that which is not the most important right exactly you know and and I think\nThat we we are as religious people really need to remind ourselves that it is it is is that and also ultimately to\n... and and especially for us as Christians probably you guys are the same thing as Jews and that ... the kingdom of God he's not quite yeah\nAnd not quite yet yes yes it's not it's not here yet and we live is enjoy hope but we should not ever be a totally and shall we say astounded that we're disappointed in this world a whole and so you're a\nBit but we should still go as hard as we all know cheddar and improve it no question and I will tell you and I worry about this\nDeeply is that\nWhat's gonna happen a month from now when the November elections as a result of Kavanaugh\nPlacement on the Supreme Court and everything they said and how they portray be you know well you know the Democratic Republican yeah but the\nDemocrats said OK let's say if they gain the house first of all you're not going to get the Senate and that's not ... not going to happen the Senate is just way out of their reach\nSo let's say the house so they go impeachment well what does the house to do hands over the Senate and in the Senate this technical anywhere that's what happened to ...\nIt's just going to be an exercise and utility can futility you know and and let me tell you the more I was thinking about this if I were Kavanaugh man I Would be pissed off\nThat's why he got angry white why are they upset with him getting angry actually has the moral character who should they should\nBe angry and that but I think I think it's going to teach him a lesson about how you interpret so long I I think he's going to be even more conservative given this\nUm ... are are\nThere there's a reason why I don't answer questions about the issue\nIsn't as soon as as we say on the issue is the issue the issue is how does it compare the ... the the the case in front of them has does it compare with the constitution that's ... that's what the deal with not whether the\nBelieve it or not and I wonder is right or wrong whatever it's about is how does it mean region you're going to say\nYeah but yeah but you have to also take into consideration or whatever the press that's all right\nUh you you have you have to ... and here's the thing I'm hoping that all this probably it clearly had to teach the capital a great deal about the opposition others they get them but I'm hoping that he is still able to cover the cost to shoot at today's\nNews station that they made it an impartial white like have you\nOn and I ... I when I was in his\nOwn not taking his own experience and the into consideration right at the at least when it comes to like it was ... it was\nDavid the way in which the Supreme Court is set up it's all about the case itself and how it compares contrast with what the constitution says so I think it's kind of embedded in the system that he will in fact be\nNeutral be you know just reacting as a as a judge and not putting his emotions in what's going on yeah [noise] yeah\nVery always remember though there is that two schools of constitutional interpretation\nWhich is the school as a\nThe a ... school and a living constitution which right you know which says that the constitution should be revised for every age and a ... with all the many union ... but I look at like people like Ruth Bader Ginsburg I mean you talking about\nO remember there was something that you were saying something about how long are they going to continue this protest says yeah you guys were doing this right over here\n[laughter] at all I'm thinking about it and I wrote is that while I'm thinking about or do you both here I'm\nGetting new cards business cards for shows there's really no good okay cool the same you know yeah so you know say\nHey you guys had a touch of fall down there yet\nNo not that I see no I don't know what I'm saying this rain although terrain yesterday was beautiful yeah yeah yeah\nYeah all of the fall and you know the trees are starting to her up here uh to turn colors hear ads and yellow orange is so have you been in school and and what is going down to thirty four degrees morally or get getting it's getting cold starting to get cold here and I read a that it\nYeah yeah I mean that it's like winter used or there's thirty four right but here here it's early fall so uh where I got a ... uh I don't want to get the snow but it's out quite yet\n[laughter] yes or even ... I remember scraping like quarter inch ice off the car windows or if it's a horrible\nOr one of the best pieces of advice I got what were we were living up here and people said make sure you park in a garage or because you don't want to be doing that and so we have your a place where like in your garage at our apartment where we are living and it's part of the\n... that makes a big difference too\nOh it does yeah because you're\nA I've had described eyes off of the car but only after it's been out in the middle of the day you know not after not after a night of four to eight inches of snow\n[noise] [noise] right it's common though we got our walther another's joy though you know so we get to those goes right\nSo Howard welcome to wish will face thrown into the answer\nTo start before with what I wanted to talk about number one mission there are ... are just as Karen has got to be aware that the Democrats if God Forbid they take the house\nAre going to start impeachment against him a wide looking into every bit of dirt that they can possibly find and it excuse to impeach him and that has got to be caught me and everybody in March how\nThe yeah but you see even with the impeach it has to go to the Senate and it's never going to get out and saying\nWell let's hope do you realize that that brilliantly impartial Houston Chronicle has just in it you know they're going to do with\nThe Democratic candidate for the Senate and the only thing they haven't endorsed to the same reason maybe Obama has endorsed it and that's because they think they may hurt by their endorsement they've certainly endorsed\nThe ... the Congress or ... or who's who's who's running against the really solid\nLast time I saw the polls were saying that Cruz was very very solidly or\nIs it is very wide receiver yeah they're very widely Cruz was head of the yeah that's how I heard right into\n... and the real reason I call it more things change the more they stay the same the leader of the Labour Party in English isn't the vow to anti Semite makes no bones about it\nAs and and and that he he's evolved from being anti Israel the anti Semitic and even in even as a solid said as soon as the as the head rabbi of of of England\nWho's retired has gray\nHairs on insects yes more ... more Jonathan Sacks yeah\nYes has said demands that anti Semite God Forbid this man because it may or may seems to be so weak\nOr could well be calm Theresa May ... you could well become the prime minister of England and and um\nYou know with all the evils of anti Semitism who has led to especially in the last ... you know the twentieth century I just don't understand how people can see the claiming themselves to be an anti Semite would be seen as a good thing I mean don't they realize it should at least come up with a different word\nLet's do the pay isn't used that word anti allied against him\nOh yes or religious branded that by a by opponents\nDebate and basically number one\nEven the Jews who have played a major role in the labor party and we would consider is left wing or almost social as they are leaving the party for the most part over his behavior and some of the Christian members of the labor right party\nLevy over ... over his lack of subtlety and being in ... and be expressing grossly anti Semitic views\nAs a throughout England so yeah there's\nAbsolutely no question no I won't go so far says these are the next Hitler vaguely and that's a wrong they meant by that but certainly\nThis man is a vicious\nAnti Jewish individual in ... in England\nAnd and it's the only question is going back to the England of Shakespeare's period where he gives me how to go out and we'll never something Shakespeare would even though he had Jews in his plays like Shylock in merchant of Venice she shakes her would never admitted you\nHad they haven't been in the in England in the United kingdom they were outlawed they were kicked out ...\nBy ... and and twelve hundred or something\nI say twelve hundred to sixteen suffer and what it is already but um yeah ...\nYeah ... and yeah they weren't allowed I I don't remember when they permitted to come back but it but it certainly Churchill is rolling in his grave over the behavior of of of of a member of who could become prime minister in in the in this whole action to\nWhat we've been seeing a rising tide of anti Semitism on the continent for years I was hoping uh England would not succumb to that itself or England Scotland Darla wouldn't come come to that so well let's hope that a cooler heads and well into the very last\nMade this possible is Merkel by by a rally I don't know millions of of people mostly moslem into the country who have no intention of is similar lady into European culture\nAnd then you not only have they are anti Semitic behavior but you have now are a variety of the fascist right in opposition to what they see is the weakness of the government\nThe press and the military and the police to oppose these individuals\nAnd this is the kind of thing that can lead to a very very upsetting behavior\nDark dark future yeah I've been a bride and groom around Howard got to go to the bank you know our thank you\nYes the world is going backwards in a lot of respects yeah have you know what I mean\nThe new normal normal and permitted yeah permitted almost\nAlmost respected\nYeah almost applauded yeah\nYou know college campuses knocked wheat and of course because you sample sales you know rebel in shutting down the opposition not letting them speak\n... ... it's it's a funny funny sad time that we're going through I don't know where we're whom\nWhen Sunday or soon it's it's just it's scary\nOh let's see well funny funny you don't mean funny ha ha ha no money are not allowed a rod odd yeah I don't know very odd that I don't know where\nIt's going to go because the way I see it is a to Trump's going to run again of course and I think he's going to win\nA be it'll be interesting to me to see who he runs against I use I don't know who the Democrats are going to put up almost ... Michelle Obama\nOr a ... I don't know what your hunters\n[laughter] no seriously she might well why no but I Will be willing to bet almost not quite but almost anything that whoever the Democrats but it will be female ... probably ... you know they certainly couldn't choose the old\nWhite man yeah that would be against Democrats you know policy in philosophy so you'll have to be on I'm telling you will have a woman\nIt's going to be interesting to see who they put up to run\nWith it regardless or let's go but regardless of who they put a blister remember the politics or they participate to the modern state that to the\nWill Okay Tom welcome to shore face or in the instance of the answer\nI haven't lamenting something lately but then again I'm an old white man so maybe I should just shut up [laughter] um\nI I Wonder if given the chance if everybody had a crystal ball six years ago a if everybody would have said you know in in twenty Eighteen things are going to be a tense the parties are going to be the population is going to be divided\nWould ever would people have been more likely to vote for Mitt Romney and stood up having a second term of Obama\nSo that this would actually probably be a second term of Mitt Romney so in other words I'm I'm saying I'm Wondering what your opinions are if all the Democrats who voted for Obama knew what was going to happen now with a instead have voted for Mitt Romney and\nSaid don't around yeah\nYeah I I don't want or independence or whoever it was that a put him over the top\nBecause I Know it at some points during his his uh twenty six twenty twelve campaign right or the prediction was that Romney was going to win and some of the some of the predictions were anyway and turned out that he wasn't really that close\nTom I I don't think\nThat the long march to splitting the country and raising raises an issue on every single item has started long before twenty twelve started and away oh I Know that so I don't think the Democrats\nWere in a uh what's the word\nI don't think the Democrats will never ever voted for Republican even that far back I don't think they'll ever crossed party lines\nBut I guess what I'm ... not that they would have voted or would they trade it I guess the oh what would they accepted a defeat in twenty twelve for a um who may have been more civilized\nTwenty eight teams I don't think anybody ever imagined we would be where we are\nNo I think that's right now just overdo body that's\nThe problem with hypothetical questions right in the sand [laughter] 'cause I don't know anybody could have said forty\nToil okay where where the country be fully be divided\nOr without it without a second term yet Obama we would not have had Trump\nOr a bad I think you might be right because I think the country continued in the direction it was put on for two thousand and eight and it took it even so much further afield\nThen you had a kind of a you know in sixteen you had a um\n[noise] I don't know what to call in reaction to it and that put a Trump in the White House\nWell I think I think that um you know if if there is\nSo much traction for Bernie Sanders\nOr on the left and if he had been running against Trump he might have one I think that the the basic premise was that people were sick of the way that the establishment was running things\nAnd I agree which is why the establishment the Democratic stabbed Richmond itself had to squash Sanders\nRight then and they knew they knew that\nI I I don't think Sanders were talking earlier about who could run in the next election I don't think Sanders is probably a viable candidate moving forward you know I don't really make crafts um you know you may be right that that a woman as a ... a person of color might end up being\nCrowded because they're not going to proceed forward a white male or a\nBook or income like Harris and they were kind of on display at the end the hearing\nYou know as a as a matter of fact it's always interesting to me to see who either party puts forward\nSituations like that or for example who is given the honor to actually do the nominee for the party of\nThe candidate they already know who's going to win because in a\n[noise]\nI'm trying to get the numbers correct I guess it would have been over for\nObama\n... ... ... I I have to reach back into my memory but I'm pretty sure it was Obama who was put on the stage you know the Democratic national convention\n... already already mentioned and and if you remember correctly\nA a and I I my timing is all bad and I can't remember names but Clinton a ... a Mr\nClinton was the one who actually did the nominating of be a democratic candidate before a\nA Clinton ran you know what I'm saying\nI I I remember that over my remembered this as clear as the bell because ah Clinton's a speech was like four hundred hours long was outrageously long and they couldn't\nGet him to shut up because we want to because they wanted to bring the candidate out on the podium was that Dukakis\nIt could have been Dukakis I don't remember who was with whoever was it was just interesting to me to see who they put forward because that's who they're looking to be the candidate for years after that\nYou know I think what you're saying about the uh is correct\nSleep putting these people forward now\nOr in the Democratic probably because they're sending them up two hundred and twenty twenty\nWhere you want to put on the stage and you want to see how they do in front of a big audience that point there's no way to know how they will kill that do it\nAnd I would have been in politics long enough to do pretty well know how they're going to do and that's why they're putting them up there\nYeah I I I'm not sure I mean when you take a person from a a local our our lady of state kind of a a you know election and move on to a a national I think I think they're very few people that can make that job\nThat's why you only have one person who emerges as the candidate and there's very few very few people who can make that child and I think those kinds of four grounding of these people at a time is a way of just seeing how do they do our national stage\nAnd that and that may be true because the ... let's see how they work under pressure because\nYou know yeah yeah and see how people respond to them ... and people people people do respond people are in the mid west are different than people in the south people in the west are different than people in the east coast so you have to see how people respond to them all over the country and not just how they how they do in local ordinary or state why\nVery true but the people that push for her to the people that are grooming all ready for the candidate\n... go All right thank you Tom appreciate it and things are listening\nTo a show of the this is a show of the name of the answer we'll be right back\nAre you concerned about America is losing her Christian heritage didn't come and meet with people were doing something about\nJoy final Cheech red Fox news confirm editor Dr Robert Jeffress riding I talked to him on the twenty six for restoring America's foundation\nDo miss start to Jefferson as the science books of sodium followed by a seven thirty PM complication with\nQuestions than answers ...
