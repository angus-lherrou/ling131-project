set a very well Richard let's go you know Claire Wisconsin to Ken Ken you're on was mark\n[noise] um yes I voted for President Trump simply because he said he was going to drain the swamp it even if you were a Democrat or Republican\nYou were banned the restaurant and you're you're out and make America great again [laughter] and it didn't matter what side you're on but if you were bad and all these people that are against them or running like little dogs are dealing with three or like\nThat and I think the Democrats\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience go wackos or want to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but she's on the other side you can say anything she wants\n[laughter] right [laughter] I you know what it it made the other day as far as that ... concern out how\nTo eliminate all media coverage or say hey we're going to let them in the after registered Republican and\nThey have to tell you not hear anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're\nA great point in fact a ... you know I I agree with you if there was any thought that illegal immigrants who are voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even in a majority\nWhy do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from buying into um Clinton uh to Hillary Clinton all of them were against illegal immigration but now that it's convenient and they need the vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump is seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Ninety Ninety five percent of the voting Obama's case if it ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble\nBecause that's what they count on that count as I mentioned the store with a ... month that they cannot just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they have and help the poor the fact that if you looked at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like in the inner cities none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side and they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from among minorities because they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listening to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they hate you there for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business vote last time most of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly it wasn't a Trump fault and for Hillary Clinton\nSo this idea that Republicans for for of our big business and the Democrats or the poor and the people who and we had a court challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised each not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to so many people because one of the things that gets him in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps and they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this spin and all the stuff the politicians usually do would you say one thing and then live another way\nTo do with a different way\nThis guy is different he surprised me he said some things on Twitter and do you know treat some things you wish she wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds everybody up\nThis is what makes America special it was an exceptional experiment in the course of human history and pro Donald Trump in his own way gets that let me know what you think at eight eight eight nine seven one sage mark Iceland\nAll true all of us do [laughter] [noise]\n\nI'm going to say something about relief factor here's the key eighty percent of the people who try to release factor quick start by again\nTake David from Pennsylvania he's what he said I tried relief factor for hip pain and I was surprised that it also help relieve my shoulder and foot discomfort\nNow after taking a for a month I stopped and sure enough the pain returned my foot discomfort came back to where I started taking relief factor again and within a week the pain was relieved I now understand it I get it I'm now taking relief factor daily [noise]\nNow your body is already fighting inflammation also known as the silent killer a hundred million Americans suffer from information to try and do something about it tried to three week quick start Nineteen dollars in Ninety five cent Ninety five cents a day less than a cup of coffee a day for pain relief\nJust go to release factor dot com relief factor dot com that relief factor dot com\n[noise] am ten Seventy\nBut no thanks a lot to get excited about it back but most vexed can't say

incredible work of Sean McConnell are just terrific job Sean and Christians screening the calls it all worked together as a team\nOr so I wanted to just make sure I mentioned that I also want to mention that you can pre order your copy now of ... death of a nation and that's just back\nAnd better than ever with his explosive new film it's a must see movie for everyone to watch before the midterm elections this was a story you won't hear anywhere else death of a nation available on DVD and Blu ray October thirty\nOrder your topic today at death of a nation movie dot com\nThat's death of a nation movie dot com now I don't know if I get the fear [laughter] vintage we've got someone disagreeing with me in Inglewood can you said real quickly events so you get me upset like Obama does\nIn my book why we find\nLines of the Obama look how we can bank\nSebastian Gorka his new book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies is available now from Amazon had Barnes and noble [noise]\nIf you were just joining\nUs we have breaking news the suspect has been arrested in these pipe\nBombings and we have a name now or this or name it saves are say Iraq I think I press that right ah in Florida someone with a ... criminal history or for grand theft back in twenty Thirteen or he's been arrested as the main suspect\nIn these twelve pipe bombs had been delivered so far\nThere were two more devices delivered a this morning I attempted to be delivered they were all you know intercepted or those who are going to Cory Booker or the senator and James Clapper a scene in contributor and former director of national tells you that went to CNN again\nUm the the so far this started on Monday with a pipe bomb it did Soros home\nUm none of these have exploded no one has been injured but it has caused a lot of tear member the\nEvacuation of the time we're talking about the significance that with the\nHotel with the office buildings with the apartment buildings with the grocery store shopping\nUm which CNN located there I mean the effect has caused terror\nEven if these devices were phony\nOr just weren't built correctly a and that would be a good thing that thankfully no one was injured there's no place for the start politics eleven days out from mid term elections it's certainly a puts things into perspective\nUm but it does not mean we can't have vigorous debates and disagreements in our country or without resorting to not just violence but tear\nWhich is what this is is that acts as a domestic terror and the tempted uh to to terrorize people and to get we condemn it to the fullest extent how should we have a name now a again of the suspect we know the location in Florida sunrise implantation Florida\nAnd if you're a vehicle was in one of those locations homeless and the other location a such a north of Miami kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale\nAnd uh and we don't know yet or if there were other people involved this is the suspect\nSo I get it may not be over the president is planning to address this if that happens while we live on the air we will certainly cover it I Want to take a your your comments a Nancy on Facebook him and we're taking your phone calls as well at one hundred sixty four thirty one ten\nNancy on Facebook writes in what kind of consequences does a person like this face Andy well\nOf course the obvious ... and then most appropriate and prudent and proper consequences has it he put in prison because someone like this is not fit to live in the society of human beings and they're locked away\nFor a period of time because they've obviously committed or attempted to commit the the most terrible crimes are and and then the worst scenario this could be considered an attempted murder\nBecause you're doing everything you can to to ah eradicate the life of a human being by means of an explosive device if in fact that's what it was and even if it didn't ah explode the the fact that the perception of the recipient is what counts so the ultimate penalty here\nHis jail yeah I mean this is again what we hope is that this will bring an end\nTo this time period after this week in the United states of uh these devices being delivered even as early this morning with two more devices so a total count at twelve but the postal service law enforcement said that they have\nNo reason to believe that's all the devices um and I buy apprehending the person that will stop them from sending more but how many more out in the postal system is is still the question so you have to remain vigilant uh listen we have listeners on both sides yeah this is obviously a focused on a lot of uh left uh those on the left\nUm if you work in those kind of offices in in Capitol Hill or in regional offices for members of Congress or be vigilant you know it was going through mail M. if you were the postal service\nBe vigilant as well or we want you to be safe because while some of these individuals are so high profile their mail to get screened at special facilities others are not\nAnd they're going through the regular postal service so again I we've got to remind all of the people who could be in the light of danger\nBecause of an individual like this we condemn it to the fullest extent I think you put the politics aside because that may be their purpose or their ideological purpose behind it but obviously a something seriously wrong with a person whether it's they are criminal or or or just insane\nIn or criminally insane I used to put it altogether or they should be facing serious law enforcement penalties that they'll go through the process but again this because the disruption the use of the mail service or the people who were targeted a very serious and now we expect that President Trump\nWill address that as well as ... will cover that on the broadcast if it happens while we're on the air department of justice is also going to speak to it later on today a show or taking your phone calls running hundred six eight four thirty one to the one eight hundred sixty four\nThree one one zero we're going to get into a little bit\nOf this caravan issue out got Andy here as well or the caravan of migrants heading towards the border or are they are in Mexico now their looks like they're heading towards either a Texas border or a California border Texas border crossing it's closer\nThe president Andy I yesterday is authorized\nEight hundred additional troops through a a General Mattis a Secretary Mattis the department of fence\nThat includes that would then up the number two ah they're already Twenty one hundred National Guard troops there that could increase to four thousand this eight hundred could be more as well so the U.S is preparing for for a border\nEffort for this to happen at our border if it is not\nAble to be stopped before in Mexico but that is the hope is that we work with the Mexican government and get this stopped and dissipated because the numbers are still in the thousands I mean estimates anywhere between three\nTo fourteen thousand people that is a lot more than the last Caribbean we experienced in April twenty Eighteen so and so again and I mean it appears that the Trump Administration preparing for two things one\nPossibly uh having to deal with this or their own into trying to get Mexico to work with us to deal with it together\nRight as we said the position of the sale Jay has always been that we want to have an intervention prior to the arrival of this a heat wave of humanity at the border and by that I mean the intervening with Mexican authorities to stop them to turn them back\nTo put them into a category is perhaps of those who are\nLegitimately seeking asylum which says really available in the first state in which you feel safe in the first nation who is you feel safe which should be Mexico in this case and then faring out those who are here to do ill to the United states\nUh people who are not here seeking asylum but to do danger those who are engaged in human trafficking and so forth and we're working with the Mexican authorities to do that\nOn of course as you said Jordan we're sending troops to the border but the ... they're they're only to support the civil authorities and they are not expected to come into regular contact with some migrants if they carry arms is solely for purposes of self defense\nAnd of course the law the United states currently prohibits the routine use of troops in law enforcement routine law enforcement activities I don't expect that that will happen I anticipate and hope that they will not be confrontations at the border between this wave of humanity and the United states troops you never know I Hope it doesn't happen\nLet me remind you the president's executive order that was ultimately okayed by the U.S Supreme Court after many legal battles on a a immigration and in preventing a certain individuals certain from certain countries\nUh for periods of time off from immigrating are being granted visas to the United states there's discussion now being reported\nThat President Trump a one idea is to use that executive order\nBecause it can be expanded on the list of countries that use that executive order to actually shut down the crossing point so that our offices are closed there so that people who make it don't even have the opportunity to apply um that again\nWill caught that will cause legal issues in legal battles but I I Do believe that under that executive order the powers there for the president to do it it would be unique way a CIA plot because it'd be happening at the border instead of somebody applying for a visa\nRun and I think that that would be an excellent thing to do the president clearly\nHas the authority under the executive order that he issued modified is you another executive order that deals with the same thing but stop to portals stop the ports of entry stop those\nAre places where you come in McAllen, Texas was one the one who was the other if they win in either direction but he could stop that is the point of entry there would be no question here of anti discrimination because of Islamic\nA or a Middle Eastern origin we're talking about invaders to the United states potentially which the president has exclusive authority is the head of the advanced executive branch of government to protect the country to do\nYou talked about the troops power on the border down on Facebook rights and can the troops help make sure the situation doesn't escalate dangerously once this caravan if it does reach our southern border that is what they're they're just to make sure it does not reach a dangerous situation for citizens\nWe're talking all midterms are so ... and your calls about that as well eleven days out from the mid term elections will give you updates on the key Senate races house races how things are looking one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten that's running hundred sixty four three one zero let's go to Roger in Virginia\nOn life for Raj welcome to Jay secular life\nThank you man\nTakes rush\nOr you're doing it to the things they kept comments on it because this is the\nHorse and writers\nYeah well we we know that there are a lot of our department of homeland security\nHas reported that there are known criminals gang elements middle Easterners or people who are not from Central American descent and obviously those who would use a caravan like this to take advantage of it for bad any legal purposes and you're talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face\nIf it makes it to your border and you decide to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before we go into our our next break Laurie in Arkansas on line one Lorrie welcome to Jay secular life\nAll right thanks for taking my call scale Hitler is there any opportunity for the United nations to get involved kept protector border [noise]\nI don't think we want the un involved on protecting our borders they they get involved with their regional military conflicts\nLike between two countries are not when the country should be able to work together\nTo us and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in Lebanon Israel border\nIsrael is places like that\nWhere it's two allies [noise] we're together so let's not get the UN involved\nLet's handled this between us and Mexico working together [noise] hopefully long before this caravan reaches our southern border we come back mid term elections eleven days away politics get your calls in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten [noise]\nWhatever six who's going to be the most important midterm election in American history type Mike Gallagher cheat on me all the resources that sarin news channel as we watch the returns come in the nation wide\nMidterm election night wanting a walking by my fellow joined\nUs from term election coverage that his second Tuesday November ...\nCoverage begins at six am ten Seventy the answer [noise] live\nWashington DC\nGoing to get right into the mid term elections but since ... some people joined us or just the\nBeginning of the second half hour Jay sexual alive but me up to the biggest breaking news the day and that is that they suspect has been arrested\nIn these pipe bombings the twelve that have been intercepted\nOr to some high profile individuals occurred and former\nGovernment officials well some celebrities are suspect has been arrested or they again does that mean there's not other devices that can be out there still remain vigilant or the president is likely to address this if it happens while we're on the air we will go to the president's comments\nBut we do want to focus in and give you an update on the mid term elections right now we're only eleven days out there is a you know we covered the caravan a which obviously has an impact on the election or we covered the devices\nObviously has an impact because the entire week of news has been on these devices are but now we want to look right into the mid term elections were eleven days out\nFrom election day but let me remind you of many places including my home state can already vote\nMany people are I'm actually planning to vote in the next few days um show you people are already making up their mind cast their ballots a lot of votes will be in before election day so we're at a time period now in America where we have election day but it really is like a two week period where you can go and vote and convince people to get out there to actually cast their\nFinal vote for candidates so they don't want to start off in the U.S Senate ah because that is where it looks like Republicans are having to potential for the most games and there's pretty shocking news\nOut of New Jersey a Senate race there are pretty blue states don't selected you know people like Chris Christie there's been Christie Todd Whitman types and in ah in New Jersey the Senate race there Bob Menendez is in some trouble and the race has been moved by the cook Political Report to a toss up that would be a huge victory for Republicans\nIt be monumental Jordan I mean this is one of the races that you and I have talked about several times on this broadcast and keeping an eye on it because if they did move into a competitive territory it was going to be a clear sign that not only the we're the Republicans are going to keep the majority\nIn the United States Senate but it might be a significant majority now pulling inside that state\nHas it in some cases within the margin of error with Bob Cuban closing to within five five points a button and then ended it Monday and as of course during a bomb and then this has been plagued with scandal over the last couple of years ... has run a very good campaign he's a businessman he\nAppeals to people that are maybe a little tired of the political process\nBut the fact that New Jersey is on the map tells me that the Republicans are are in a very strong position in the United States Senate Jordan as we've talked about most of the political battlefield in the United States Senate is in Trump or states that were carried by Donald Trump in Republican states as a ... point\nNew Jersey would certainly not be one of them and yet it's impolite\nLet's go to the president right now he I Believe is addressing the issue involved with the type\nOf that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nIncredible job by law for\nWe've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find that person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nI've instructed authorities to spare no resource or expense and finding does responsible and bringing them to swift ten certain justice [laughter]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever made me a\nSense of the law must never\nAllow political violence to take in America cannot put a hat and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nJust like we've echoed the president waited to suspect was apprehended to say we will not accept\nPolitical violence in America to do everything possible\nMake sure it's this individual and not a ... additional individuals as well prosecute them\nThe fullest extent of the wall so there you heard from President Trump the announcement of this suspect being arrested but still law enforcement activities ongoing he's taken very seriously also taking the mid term elections very seriously as well or we will continue to talk about those we come back in ... New Jersey has now we toss up\nBetween incumbent democratic Senator Bob Menendez a again a folks and this was a race that people were not watching that closely\nOperation over lord rebuke Richard here you know I Love history so to use so I Hope you'll join me next spring on the D Day beaches in ...
