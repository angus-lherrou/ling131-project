as a reminder pastor Andrew Brunson will be joining us live here on the broadcast on Jay Sekulow alive right now see see how a senior attorney with the ACL Jay and the lead attorney on the brunch in case a is joining us in Studio and she was with\nThe family that actually in at joint base Andrews when the plane landed with a brunch since uh arrived in the United states I was with him at the White House in the oval office when uh the Bronx and uh met with the president and and other major leaders of the United states as well as wouldn't pastor Brunson\nDealt in prayer but they were private moments as well ah\nSo cc let me go first you and just to explain to people what it was life or the Bronx who's to finally touched down on us soil\nAnd it was overwhelming and there's a very emotional numb and I was on NBC the night before what the children on the ... making the ranch meant for Andrews Air force base and um you know when they first announced that the plane was arriving we all went out to greet the plane and\nAt the door open and we watched a pastor Brunson and his wife Noreen walk off a plane um at least I don't think there was dry there between and obviously the children it myself um it was it was extremely emotional that's two years had a hard fought battle coming to an end\nThen he comes off the plane and and what was that experience like who was at the who was there at joint base Sanders\nIt was just literally has a three children and and jak one is married so than in law myself and then on Marines brother ...\nAnd then you make your way to the White House\nThe day that we had just a little bit of time at injuries and then we went for the meeting on in the oval office with\nThe president fairly overwhelming that when media that we saw on TV [noise] uh I've I've gotten out and meet with President Trump in the oval office it's a it's a it's a unique experience for for any one and then the American but what for what we saw me walking in there was quite a quite a group of leaders in that room edited started that way to the meeting start that\nWay actually dead and actually Noreen patch trained her and the rain had a chance to meet with the president did separately yes important to note right and so they had a separate meeting and the children and I met with 'em all the congressman says Senate and represented as that had worked so hard on that and now it's a great time to just ended and for all of their efforts\n... stare on hold pending list there so all those people had a chance to interact with and then they all went into the oval office and that's when the president interact with an answer and ...\nAnd we have some some of the exchange sure but I thought what was most powerful and I see see about it was\nWhen pastor Brunson asked to pray for President Trump and actually a nail down that this is twenty four hours after he has released\nA from captivity and turkey is under house arrest ultimately at the end where there's a bracelet on could have gone back to prison friday\nOr could have been a taken out of house arrest them back at a Turkish jail is that he's at the oval office and he thinks a to do and humble himself as as Dave said a to kneel and pray for our president who did so much for his release take a listen here's the prayer but God\n\nTrump's supernatural wisdom accomplish\nFor this country and [noise] I have said you know leave [laughter] right [laughter] you'll get some perseverance and insurance thing for\nEnemies from\nYour mind [noise] passing you make him a great deal I\nWas here with some friends and we left [noise] maybe less [laughter] she was saying [noise]\nThat was so cc you were there at the oval office already a powerful place to be witnessing a this experiencing it what was that moment like\n... it really I think the whole ram a like a not at that moment that here\nAnd it's ... like you said he's standing pressing for almost two years just last month or so and ... but that his first concern last ten years down and pray for the president everyone in that room was patched in and you could see it they ...\nThe a poll on Facebook writes in at this outcome encourages me even more before to pray for those persecuted legacy of baby I wanted to ask a SEC\nHow are the Bronx is doing I mean there was a world where they are probably a lot of adrenalin flowing but he was under house arrest used for a few months so things much better than being imprisoned in Turkey above so that uncertainty and other ... inability to leave the house have the\nThe ah ankle bracelet on have just having that removed on friday and but uh what is what is it this experience ah been like and how is their their mood and what was it like to be with him\nI obviously there are ... to be reunited with their family yeah and he looks very healthy\nI'm very ... ... and you know when asked about that he's he said I I feel that obviously because he's back on us soil and and with his children cell and and I would say he would absolutely get all credit to the prayers for people all over the world that have been praying for him for these two years and that's how he's been sustained\nOn and been able to just returned to his family and such good condition\nMarry an Facebook right since she's emotional just listening to the description of his homecoming I Know he plans to do some interviews I'm a ... be on our broadcast march from others as well and people will get that information out for people but I Would suspect that for that the family will want some time together\nYeah I think it's just you know they want they want to be with their kids and they went just some downtime to\nBe a family and and be alone so and I think they'll they'll pay these interviews and and then they're going to try to go back to just kind of normal lending and and I know he had had multiple times you know they're praying about what what's the next step that to learn what happened to him\nYeah because it had been a twenty three years they had served I Know that they would take sabbaticals in time back in the United states for twenty three years their children were in the United states but were raised their\nOf it now living the United states but after spending twenty three years your life\nWorking in another country um and that being your primary home I'm though the U.S is is was will always be you know their home uh it's it's got to be a unique I mean ... is Debbie rights and continue praying we've always said this before for these other cases individuals in these kinds of situations\nThat we often celebrate and that is right to do\nAnd it's the right thing to celebrate their release but then we kind of move on and you don't realize that there is a lot going on emotionally and psychologically after you've been imprisoned and gone through this experience of house arrest and persecution and um you know they'd have to come to a new place in a sense that you were not expecting to make your permanent home\nAfter ... after living in another country for twenty three years\nOr so a praying for the family now is probably more important than ever before especially once the interviews are done and and uh the the the uh the meetings are over with and uh and life has to try and go back to figure out what normal is\nRight and and he has requested that you know his parents for direction that that's really like town that's ... what they should do you know how like on the stand and obviously his heart is still for ministry and you know he has a pastor's heart and and that's what he wants to continue down\nYeah I mean he's only fifty years old fifty years old right I mean is it ... ... young man and and uh has a lot to accomplish with a young children twenty to twenty Seventeen years old if you want to talk to us on the one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenant\nThat just reminded the pastor Brunson will be joining us Tamara live on the broadcast or to discuss uh this uh this whole\nPast two years and then of course what it was like a two to come home as well when we come back to a shift in the discussion a little bit I wanted to give you this update this unique first hand account of what our senior attorneys because of you\nAre who was able to spend these two years as the lead attorney on the case working with the Bronx since working with the family and then of course ultimately this culminated in this homecoming\nAnd meeting at the oval office I wanted to make sure you got that inside or something unique for our audience because it was our case and I wanted to remind people that at the ... for all of you who support the American Center for Law Justice and the ACL J. when we come back we're going to start getting into\nA ... a little bit different but very newsworthy is twenty two days out which is the elections so will spend more time with pastor Brunson tomorrow on the broadcast we're not done\nTalking about his uh his release and his homecoming the United states he'll be joining us live tomorrow but we do want to get into politics as well so if you got questions about the upcoming midterm elections\nYou could start calling now one hundred sixty eight four thirty one time we will get those numbers will start to see those numbers out to you a C C I F a final question for you just that the entire\nThe polling data we just talked about in the United states that that's actually proven true on the house side as well now obviously it's a lot more granular you're talking about districts instead of states candidates really really matter and I would say a national wave is probably less impactful in the house than it is and some other places\nAre but I I think if you're the Republican Party in Washington DC a month ago you probably would have conceded that the Democrats were most likely maybe in a private moment you would have conceded to the Democrats were most likely to take over the house or Jordan I think most both parties would now tell you if they were being honest that there's a real fight on your hand this one could really go either direction\nElizabeth on Facebook writes in Jordan or polls dependable\nSome more than others I like how real real clear politics does if they do an average of polls ah she could see the latest polls but also you know what came out of four days before that\nAnd different polling groups um ultimately they just kind of give you a sense of a race is there a total blowout happening in a race and then I should should resources be shifted somewhere else has something significantly changed\nObviously if three more polls come out Marsha Blackburn with a forty point leads instead of five or six point at least something significantly change in the voters that are being contacted by the polls\nBut let me remind everybody out there that mid term elections are all about turnout it it is very different than trying to pull 'em a presidential election\nUh and and saying you mentioned just in North Dakota for instance that Heidi Heitkamp may be down twelve points in the latest poll and it might not be moved to a lean GOP re she's the incumbent Democrat\nSenator voted against Brett Kavanaugh a lot of people thought that may be the end of her political career you said just a few hundred thousand votes that will be cast that day\n... yeah twelve percent is not the same in North Dakota as it is said California only going to be three hundred and twenty five thousand votes cast or so in the entire state of North Dakota during the ... or just a few thousand votes can eat into that twelve percent lead\nVery very quickly yes you see how [noise]\nGet out the vote efforts to take your ... from down ten in a state like North Dakota to to victory [noise]\nIf you if you got the people on the ground and the resources to do it\nThe second half hour coming up got one phone line open we're talking politics one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to one hundred sixty four three one zero we'll be right back on Jay secular life for all the information about pastor Andrew Brunson go to a C. O. J. dot org\nWe'll be right back\n\nHe's now a matter of days before America decide who will run the country for the next two years Republicans have benefited from having a Republican in the White House was losing the house or Senate the\nCountry back to the left wing lunatics can you see this booming economy we need to keep up the jumps room do we need to keep adding the rank judges to the

of the first half hour updating you on a pastor Brunson\nHis meeting with President Trump in the oval office was twenty four hours after\nBeing freed and turkey the prayer the pastor Brunson gave a knelt down and prayed\nFor President Trump our senior counsel see see how it was with the Bronx and family from the time they landed at joint base Andrews through uh the oval office of their time in the White House joined us so if you miss that earlier the broadcast to be really encouraged you go back and listen to that account of what it was like\nFrom one of our senior attorneys and then shifting now into politics passive Russia will be joining us\nOn the air or tomorrow to discuss the experience ah again so he'll be joining us live tomorrow but I Do want to get into politics and take your calls one hundred sixty eight four thirty one ten oh let's go to Rick in California on live for Rick welcome to Jay sexual alive\nYou're on the air ...\nGreat thank you very much for taking my call I really appreciate it thanks very\nHe might concern with comments about the Republican shaking a more aggressive about cash in the polls is is that they're going to become lazy and lacks a day in terms of their approach to getting to the polls [noise] I'm more concerned with what we do to get people out what can we do is local guys I'm a guy that drives a scooter [noise]\nBecause I have MS and I don't I don't pass anybody anywhere\nBefore I ask them what their stances and why is it the case\nSo who do they like in the election outta the like and the judge Kavanaugh situation um than in trying to ah necessarily preached to them but certainly want to get into a dialogue with everybody I mean on the street but it seems like there's just not enough should be doing just a little bit more [noise]\nYou know it ... all the ... a lot of these depend on where you live so California's state wide very difficult for Republicans\nAnd there's a gubernatorial race their eyes that is contested I'm not saying that it's not money being spent there is but it is very difficult for Republicans federally statewide um and then uh so you look at congressional districts there's plenty of congressional districts it really depends on where you live but uh just to give you a a a an indication wreck\nA tossup races\nIn the house include let me just count one two or three four or five five different California uh seats\nThen if you actually six that if you move into leaning a Republican it includes a few more well leading democratic who's a few more I mean is there a lot it just depends on what district you live in\nA if you are seeing those kind of efforts um ad run by those campaigns because it is these are turnout\nElections I don't say this on the air to to uh listen I I think you always want to run a campaign like you're down ten um uh but you've got also got you have to be able to encourage people to vote they don't want to feel like they have no chance of winning and the big picture to say it's a balance between ... between\nAlways feel like you're in the fight but also the idea that you can win the fight\nYeah I'm In California is a good example of this Jordan I Would say a couple things first of all I mean I think you're right that you could probably look at more than a dozen races there is being at least somewhat competitive but if you're going to if you're going to paint them all with one broad stroke he would paint them\nAs seats that are currently occupied by a Republican but in traditionally Democrat territory and I I Would wager that probably eight or ten of those districts that you rattled off\nMeat that criteria to get a Republican that either running for reelection or Republican that's running for election is currently held by Republican but it's a district that is usually won by Democrats that's the dichotomy are that's going to be decided in this midterm election and just to the caller's question Jordan whether you're a Republican or Democrat\nAnd the reason that a mid term is typically one by the party out of power is big it is much easier to motivate that voter to go and make a change in the seat that they are casting a vote for so I think it's natural\nThat Republican voters us started behind in the enthusiasm gap but I Do think that the Brett Kavanaugh thing really close that gap but the colors correct\nThere's always going to be a disadvantage as far as the enthusiasm goes for the party that is in power if the party in power though Jordan closes that gap and the enthusiasm gap is essentially equal going in the party in power is going to win that seat then you know folks who got a lot to talk about\nHow we're going to take your phone calls one hundred sixty four thirty one time we got a couple of lines open 'cause we have some calls already on politics on the mid term elections\nYou since Republicans\nWhat many pundits believe [noise]\nThat would be the case of the house representatives\nEven keeping the majority
