host can rewrite\n[noise]\nBecky jak I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients and we're not work with over a thousand families into\nInfinity found beyond absolutely\nAnd we work with clients and forty three states\nAnd all the ideas we talk about on the show these are the same ideas we talked about what our beloved and those valued clients as I mentioned Forbes named our financial advisory firm money matters one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states and without our clients we'd be nowhere so thank you\nAnd I don't know if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff\nThat if you're over fifty retired are retiring soon is important and uh so we we talk about the estate planning which we are going to do here and just a moment but\nWe also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes\nAre diversification four one K. we talk about the whole ... a whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is probably shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean\nAir of yours and that would be your spouse [laughter] there you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind\nOf trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing is sticking your ear\nAnd a Q tip stance for qualified terminal interest property but we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trust that is designed to benefit your spouse so if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that ... can you play it\nI Know I\n\nWould always say you you\nKnow my log in may a medium\n\n[noise]\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the theme of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago we were not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have a national security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in art from what we called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today [laughter]\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning in passing on to the next generation and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserve love you give love always okay\n... it's not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you'd give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life because then your happiness\nIs not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love then somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will continue to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a ... as a person and our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so a state planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you lead the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in and cannot come out no in fact just the opposite ... therefore your spouse to be able to have access to the money for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the cutest trust okay so\nThink about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to think about so this show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOn our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but uh I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way you

number to call is one eight hundred\nFor nine eight one two three four nine I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for nine eight one two three four nine\nIf you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael paint is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr pain 'cause you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress and how your kill max formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nFor we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium gets probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that many of them is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example with with low levels of magnesium your heart beat\nWho are very important factor in life yeah I Would say though [laughter]\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay you have um attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patients diabetes five on my job high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps carcasses past due process and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with that what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nRight they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping and friendly because it relaxes your body needs to actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after\nFormula interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and that case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas that like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's their link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss\nWhat happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spending the gleaming museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know that it might be over time just starting to feel more tired tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nWhen that and that starts to take the count them out of the bones to start getting on life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest it\nWill all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a taste of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink this top down this great absorption rate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAll right and this was probably a

can find us on am Seventy the answer\nWelcome to the impacts used in a weekly public presentation of Salem Radio Houston focusing on people in issues affecting our community here's your host news and public affairs director Jay\nZ Richard first free to arrive through America's during history with the gun is on our radar right now since gun control could be a little issue surrounding the midterms\nEvery time there's an effort to weaken the protection of the second amendment there is a resurgence both in gun ownership\nAnd the idealism surrounding it and whenever there's an effort to dismiss the vibrant Bambi important role gun is played in American history a movement rises to reclaim it according to the latest polls that are actually more guns in America today than there\nAre people a lot more to first freedom nationally syndicated columnist and senior editor at the federal or state but her son you dissect sand explains why the gun will forever play a role in American culture\nOur son you expertly tells the story of a gun and American Life and how firearms have helped preserve our religious economic and cultural institutions for more than two centuries the right to bear arms is the birthright of a free citizenry but it is also directly correlated do are exceptional rise as a nation\nDavid thank you so much for joining us here welcome were really glad to have you\nFor having me thank you so clearly\nGuns have literally been an essential part of American history starting with the earliest simpler is facing the challenges of living in a remote wilderness I guess that's where the story starts or am I wrong\nAnd actually starts before because people might not understand this natural writers people sought to own a gun and defend themselves and protect their property and their families actually goes back\nAnd British and English law farther than you're in the right to religion certainly have freedom of religion certainly but also a freedom of speech so it's it's one of the oldest rights that were brought over to a colony is or two world by the British settlers waste\nIronic that the British have lost their rights did\nWell I don't know how you could settle a wilderness without having guns especially when you've got wild animals there who might see you as part of their lunch menu and and the natives the indigenous people who weren't too happy about these invaders but\nCertainly the most unique aspect of our gun culture which I think is a continuing from those days comes from\nFrom just the reality of living in a in a place in the wilderness is populated by people who are often times aggressive at one to Hershey so um but more than that even you know the the the initial people who came here a lot of subtle here but they also have to deal with the French\nAnd Spanish and others who were sort of infringing on their own\nA settlement and so forth so they so\nPutting together the the the idiot logical philosophical understanding of what it meant with the with the just the everyday practical necessity of having a gun is for individual that they kept moving west probably until the Nineteen fifties event ah\nThe gun with an entire all part of their toolkit as it were and and almost every family had one\n[noise] yeah it really has become a a I Would say a part of the folklore of American history uh when I was growing up in the Nineteen fifties early sixties\nUh my youth was dominated by television shows and movies that were all about the gun swingers and having a gun to get through life that had a huge part of ... of the American consciousness\nFor for me as well even today in movies with the guns used to watch it all in all the time you know most of that is without you know you know I mean in the sense that\nOf course people needed guns and they use them to protect themselves but a for instance when we talk about the west the sorts of violence that we see in movies is rarely actually happen that way they look on swingers who who teachers guns were off and just sort of really just psychopath and not any sort of anti hero\nAnd um because when lots of people have to take a step back dodge city which we we all know about I think er during the gun slinging error the murder rate was around a little over one person per year wasn't as if people were shooting each other out all the time\nBut I'm certainly people needed those weapons and the reason probably that crime wasn't as high as because you know you're going to pick out a gun it ever has one as well it's it's probably going to go a little bit more difficult we would as criminals today who have guns and don't fear any retribution\nYeah I think about my my own grandmother who was a homes that are out in northwestern Nebraska a hundred years ago more than a hundred years ago and she talked about being afraid about her husband would go on a cattle drives and my grandfather and uh she would be left alone with a baby there on out in the middle of literally in the middle of nowhere\nShe didn't if she knew she had a gun but I I don't think she it never occurred to her she was worried about people\nComing to the door in the middle of the night that was in an era when you didn't lock your doors and all that so she was scared to death of those experiences but she never talked about thinking about pulling the gum out in those days so I think you're right about the mythology of the Old West", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jay Sekulow Live!", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
