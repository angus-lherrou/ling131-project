Indiana on line to David welcome to Jay sexual alive I did\nI really appreciate all the work you're doing great work um my question was once I was talking about and I don't see that she could possibly be saved her or her family in Pakistan so but in the world can they do to get them\nOut of it can be ... but I think some of her family if I'm not I think I'm correct English scarier isn't some of her family already out of Pakistan\nYes they are a couple of weeks ago her family one daughter and her husband had a given an interview in England so there were ... in England a couple of weeks ago\nAnd that's the likely place they should have been very outspoken on this the parliament as there are and the BBC has given it a lot of coverage as well so I think that's probably the likely place that they go and I I think that's that would make absolute sense so that's part of what happened\nI get Puerto these in these situations\nAre especially so like we talked about the ... situation but it is the baby's\nSituation as well it is not over until she is out of Pakistan and that means it will be\nPakistani security officials were you likely with other government officials happening right that they need to make this happen very quickly because it's a volatile situation in the streets much worse so that even in Turkey with Andrew Brunson situation she's well known in Pakistan has the story reported on by extremists they utilize it\nAnd we saw that I went out on social media but they are taking to the streets as well so it's it's ... it's become real so understanding the situation's a greater period a great decision and then I Hope that you know we freaked out she emerges I'm In another country safe it's out\nThere what do you think the message from the ... this was a very bull I'm going to say this again this was a very bold move on the justices of the Pakistan's Supreme Court\nA very very bold there there was a lot of a reason that they could have politically decided not to have done nothing but they took it very well but what do you think the message is for the rest of the world from the Pakistani springboard well I think the message from the ... the Supreme\nCourt is this the rule of law will and show prevail going forward\nIn ... or ... cents an hour and the United states yes and so I think this was to help pull development in terms of strengthening a U.S Pakistani relations are going forward a barter lastly I Would point out\nWe should pray for all Christians who remain in\nStone because of their behavior or at least the past behavior of unruly moms who have been unleashed a to take out vengeance if you will\nAgainst the Christian Community in Pakistan no absolutely correct let's go ahead and take another phone call gift Shay is calling from Florida on line what Shay well could have Jay sexual live ...\n\nBecause they always say to get somebody from another country we're stopping three hundred million dollars to get this lady free\nFree and I respect their culture don't get me wrong but they need to respect ours too you know what\nThe Americans don't hit because\nThere's no but we're a country that believes the religious freedom and we don't condemn people because of who they what their religion is we condemn people if their acts that they'd taken the name of religion are wrong sure but we don't do that and that's the group but we we don't say we don't want Muslims to the United we were different than that\nUh uh Pakistan is Islamic country I mean it is there an ally of the United states and and do our nuclear power and let's talk about what how that\nInterplay of the government didn't and work here when you're dealing with an out it's not an American citizen it went through the court system took to a almost a decade er which is a great result but she's lost nine years of her life in prison in Pakistan but let's talk about the political side of what it was not was handled it was I think appropriately done\nYeah I think appropriately so I mean keep in mind just as we started this gay Pakistan is one of the most significant allies of the United states in the world to the tune of twenty two billion dollars over the last decade about two billion dollars a year now\nHere's where the shift in foreign policy under the Trump Administration really has paid off though\nThe Trump Administration has said look we want to be partners with you we want to engage in security partnerships but we're going to be really serious about making sure that you follow through on your obligations\nJay in both fiscal year two thousand Seventeen and fiscal year two thousand Eighteen there has been a dramatic drop down on that financial aid that had gone to Pakistan\nBecause Pakistan hasn't cooperated in several guards not just the city of be the case but also the combating terrorism combating militants but again Jay it's an important alliance for the United states one that we need but you know what it's even more important for Pakistan so when President Trump and secretary palm pale\nHave gone to them and said look you will start delivering results otherwise you're going to see a drawdown in us aid to Pakistan the difference between that and previous administrations is when Pakistan didn't meet its obligations the\nUnited States did withhold the funding you know go to Jerry calling from Rhode Island on line three Jerry\nWelcome to Jay sexual live ... ...\nI Know a great Thanksgiving news not only Bronx and and so on and I think I think Jordan and professor at John attorney to pray for\nOngoing not only the clocks that would take me there were already heard about the safety of her family hopefully but the judges and lawyers involved in here I guess we need to pay for this and and the last caller\nThat just the money the players involved the Iranians involving they work together carrot and stick\nAbsolutely social Harry R let's talk about these judges this was a bold move for them and a bold move for the government we don't really understand it that way we're going to sprinkle it makes the decision if you don't like it that's the way it is it'd be like it that's good but you know we don't have this kind of activity but there's a whole ... this was a very bold move on their part\nThat that's absolutely correct It's a very bold move I mean the way they have written opinion and especially the concurring opinion I mean they have the justice ... he he's very very smart and he his opinions or\n... I mean are they are full of wisdom and on page fifty five he says that it is ironic called that in the Arabic language the F ... ... a parent's name I'll see a mean sinful\nBut in the circumstances of the president case she appears to be a person in the words of ... a Shakespeare's king king Lear more sand against than sending\nOne training in case is that as being\nA Christian mother of five who was convicted of\nBest semi for offering her coworkers water from her kept the court has told us he had that she had met the cup and say among elite team by drinking from it they ordered to convert to Islam but have you ever used and express have faith in Jesus Christ church out to his best semi convicted\nAnd sentenced to death she has been in prison for the last nine years waiting for the Supreme Court to Pakistan to hear had peel therefore we're just this kind of silly to investigate cases of best sent me an extrajudicial killings entry cry Pakistan to repeal or mandates that sending those\nDirty habit and this is the first step in that process in your view of the opinion itself well\nMy view is that the opinion is detailed it's substantive it goes to the heart of the issue\nAnd one of the um shortcomings of the lower court decision was the failure to deal with the actual facts on the ground there is no a sustainable evidence suggesting that or see a baby actually engaged in blasphemy\nAnd so the charge in my opinion was baseless the Supreme Court of Pakistan saw that\nAnd they have the altar of any culpability in this case\nAnd certainly we look forward to evidence that she has been safely released and return to her family much at stake in this particular case mobilizing the Christian Community and the international community was very very helpful\nThis is where our work overseas makes a huge difference in the lives of domestic as well I mean all the way round right let's go into your\nCall if you want to talk to us on the air twenty eight hundred six eight four thirty one time we have another segment company after twenty eight hundred sixty eight for three one one zero we celebrate this tremendous victory foresee a baby and her family and for all Christians really as she is acquitted\nOffer the splashed recharge with two which carried a sentence of death by\nHanging that's what she was appealing to the Supreme Court and Pakistan and she was acquitted I'm In the early as today in Pakistan early hours\nWe found out about it I'm a last night here in the United states Tim is calling from California online five Tim welcome to Jay sexual alive I did\nA ah Jay thank you for all the work you're doing a pastor Brunson with us here baby a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving I was wondering as far as there are present administration what impact you think President Trump Nikki Haley being or you end up faster a\nMade with the decision the Pakistani Supreme Court\nI think a lot I mean I'll I'll defer here to promote the let me just say a couple of things in one of the president's policy on this is your an ally bars you got to act like it I mean remember what Nikki Haley said I don't know if we can find that the sound but maybe we can and but she said basically if you don't act like it was in another context but I figured it was very relevant here you don't act like I guess what you don't get our money\nAnd um the Pakistan is an important ally the United states a billion dollar relationship multi billion dollar relationship but I think the presidents and ... look this is another woman's life has been saved a and I think the international outcry here made a huge difference in sort of the president's policies and diminished rations and again Nikki Haley as well what do you think on that than\nJay made all the difference in the world and I would boil it down to this consistency across the foreign policies he had Nikki Haley go to the United nations and say you actually have to support the initiatives or the United states you have to be our ally if your want our money and then they followed through through the un accounts but yet they also did it directly from the dollars to the United states sends to countries I mean\nPakistan that average two billion dollars a year over the last decade there's been a significant drawdown on each in the last two years\nBecause Pakistan hasn't been meeting hall it's obligations as well as the three hundred million dollars that isn't on hold on security assistance but again Jay\nWe've talked about this is a lot it's not a one size fits all United States wants that partnership with Pakistan but the difference in the Trump Administration they have engaged strategically and when an ally has not a operated as they should there's been a price to pay and it's been a consistent theme across their entire foreign policy\nHere's what Nikki Haley had to say it was involved in the context of Iran and some of these other regimes but this is a message for the rest of the world\nBully I no longer than ... five ... ... ... ... they are now going to start to work with our friends\nAre we are no longer available ... ... what\nDoes that sentiment in your area or what is the sense of what you're picking up from our colleagues in Pakistan right now about the impact of this decision\nOr the impact is as he is huge I mean it's throughout the country from Karachi to Islamic law to shower ... it's the riots started going on there are protests the highways that shut down\nUm in fact the government had to actually provide a rangers up a paramilitary force around the Supreme Court and parts of the ... of the city\nUm they had to put snipers that an places so so the impact is is just huge and and the boldness of of this this this decision kind of a shows itself\nI'm holding in my hand I don't know if you could see it very well on TV try to get this you'll see some of it is a in an era but um\nThis is it I mean this is the uh this is the ... decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan which results in the a C B be found not guilty and her conviction reverse let's go ahead take another phone call yeah Williams called in Georgia on line one William welcome to Jay so Hugh alive highway hey\nHey Jordan first of all ... to ... your ... your boss here maybe you're on a show that you're not at war or ... I\nAm I'm at my hands on a warhead I Wish they had the cat here in the bottom welfare to come right way and that will cause before the break while\nWhile you're right William and are we ... we well we think all the ... the ministry should we think the international partners on this and a number of other organization a lot of organizations weighed in on this uh ultimately we thank God for the release your Nancy on Facebook just wrote or their fears for the rest of the Christian Community being retaliated against\nIn Pakistan it's your hair is that a a fear that we have to be concerned some of the way to be concerned with right now\nThat's absolutely correct of uh in in the past or even one allegation of blasphemy had led to mob violence against entire Christian communities people's homes have been burned down people have been killed\nSo so that even before the decision was announced of weeks before that after the appeal was heard the Christian Community was concerned that if a ... eh quid\nOr there will be repercussions are against the entire Christian Community that's a very big possibility so hopefully the government will take some action and and stop these these mobs to carry out any attacks\nAgainst Christians what what's your sense of that you're not obviously it elevates other Christian targets said see babies in this secure location may already be outside of the country\nOn her way to join her family so it elevates their churches there's Christian communities in Pakistan that are um that you can point to as extremists who say okay there's a there's where we target that's where the extremist would target too and so again there's kind of two fold I seek outrageous outrage amongst\nUh with with extremist Muslims against other Muslims yes it governs inside the country saying well this is the district court justices or the government there are Christians and the government so\nThat that is the one hand but by the second is the weaker community the Christian Community\nWho could face the rest of these mobs who has in the past face the wrath of these mob so as she said it is really up to the Pakistani government nationally local governments as well to protect Christian communities\nFrom these mobs while this is a still firing of people the streets\nYeah you know we had filed a multiple appearances if the UN and then we also move legislation forward or we've dealt with the blasphemy laws that there was a lot of play here\nYeah well if you listen to the end of the sound you played about that the crust off present in the United nations the last part of that was him advocating for\nPakistan to repeal reform its blasphemy laws\nIf you look at S. resolution one oh nine which Senator Rand Paul Put forward that was the second part of this the first part of it was that Pakistan release a sea of be the second part really relates to the caller's question what is the risk of the Christian Community still in Pakistan it's quite great because the blasphemy laws still are not where they need to be\nA frankly Jay that's where the United states which comes in they've been very good on this in recent out of the last couple of years and frankly that's where this fight news now in Pakistan\nIs very very bold opinion by the Pakistani before we can't underscored that enough absolutely\nParticularly in light of the fact that Meyer brand ... clerics are stirring up the Pakistani people moms are already on the street and they are going after the weekend the disenfranchised in Pakistan\nAll right we'll take your calls last night we coming up one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to talk about writing topics to see maybe one eight hundred sixty four three one wonder we've over the phone lines for you got a special video coming up we'll talk about the moment but again you want to talk to us an eight hundred and sixty four thirty one how much land\nSome very positive end of this month\nA if you go to a C.
