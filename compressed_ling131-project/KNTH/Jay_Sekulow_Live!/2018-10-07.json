E. N. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that yourself needs for their health\nFor their education their maintenance and their support they can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle they\nCan't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to they have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their debt you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the cutest trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called de Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property a cue tips easier to say\nAnyway if you would like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website it does money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor and what we'll do is scheduled time to visit now when we visit this is for those of you are over

alternative health we've been talking about how critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow Dr Prentice I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've got to talk a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough item and see but you know the reality is that I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I I I'm not arguing that point\nBut the reality is that I'm Still standing I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here I mean it hasn't\nThe government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy\nWhen you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a deemed minus because they're already a for vitamin C is sixteen milligrams sixty military ... early inadequate they already have for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. when you and you need vitamin C. the writer mouse and the right form in order to get yourself\nInto a high level house for why it why is that so critical though why is getting enough vitamin C. so critical while\nJust to recap number one your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least\nThree thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day ... of vitamin C. you're going to be someone who is on multiple medications\nYou run into doctors you're got blood pressure problems you don't make the good cholesterol triglycerides are high you might be diagnosed with diabetes you have pain in your body you're looking at old and you're feeling old before you should be all\nRight well let's let's get into this a little bit then I mean I mean can you talk about what's in your super see twenty two formula\nYeah well what I have is first of all it's a powder that you mix into cold water okay and each surveying is Fifteen hundred milligrams of vitamin C.\nOkay and it has twenty two different sources of vitamin C. which is very very important for your body what's the benefit of having those twenty two different sources for the benefit is is is that your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli\nCertain type of cherry called an asteroid cherry lemons lines grapefruit with the supersede twenty two and I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it into one form I see okay well speaking English can we can we make something yeah a lot of trial right here yeah okay\nAll right now why why of powder instead of let's say a a pill or a capsule or something like that well\nC. it's it's necessary to get it in your system not just in your blood but down to the tissues so when you put a powder and you put water in it it activates it absorbs quickly this is the best way to get in your body\nIt's busy because this most of his yeah the ... is showing that is activated the minerals and all the

always thought about vitamin C. um you know with respect to cold and flu and building up your immunity but you know you're talking about things that go way way beyond that so what about cardiovascular

D. so I really believe these memories and it's very scary because they're they're doing studies and they've been doing studies since the seventies about how\nMemories as the eye witness says you can't really count on eyewitness testimony\n[noise] yeah I think that's especially true or when it's a bar across racial kind of eyewitness testimony I saw this prime Rob the bank and a lot of times people don't do very well with people have a different race and that's not necessarily prejudiced it's just the way we're wired I think\nIt's the it's the way we're wired it also has to do with our upbringing it has to do with uh our our culture and it has to do with our our bully\nAnd so everybody's perception and it was just talking this morning about that so if I saw something happened\nMy memory is going to be different than your memory J. P. when you're a guy [laughter] you know men think different than women and your your background my background is going to be different the way my parents raised me my moral character is going to be different all that it's going to affect\nHow I perceive something and then to remember it is just going to depend on how my brain as compared to yours and miss memories\nThe longer that you have had something happen but once you get it right now I mean if I asked you\nHey Jay peak do you remember when you were in first grade and you had a teacher and I could I your first grade teacher do you remember what her name was there was a member of the classes that you took your probably say no you might remember her name\nBut you know I look back in my past just exactly as you're saying\nAnd I remember something in my wife who sometimes shows are very clear memory you know that isn't what happened at all your dog and you know we'll pursue it a little bit more ... and yeah my memory was wrong and I I think that happens all the you know go back to the or maybe it was in the eighties or nineties when", "show_name": "Jay Sekulow Live!", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
