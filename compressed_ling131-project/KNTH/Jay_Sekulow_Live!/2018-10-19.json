heard a Jamal 'cause show the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi Government living in self imposed exile looks like when he went to the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul, Turkey\nUm we just dealt with turkey on the Brunson matter so and this is all fresh for us to obtain a document he would need for upcoming wedding he did not leave that conflict and the reports are that he was killed inside that conflict\nThat's raised a whole host of issues we did have Bruce on Facebook say why are we involved with this at all he was a Saudi national not a U.S citizen\nWell let me tell you why because Saudi Arabia is a critical ally of the United states by the way that does not excuses ... but my compare the secretary of state has said that they give it a few days for the Saudis to investigate there's going to have to be action taken here on some level or either internally or I'm sure that the world opinion years going to be very very bad for the Saudis\nBut let me give me the relationship of the United states with Saudi Arabia we have full diplomatic relations\nWith Saudi Arabia in Nineteen thirty three and that is when oil exploration began in the kingdom 'em by a and by the way I talk about some of this actually in our book on 'em or Syria\nOr when we we have the uh unholy alliance book because it's got the Syria you know Iran Russia thing and and and some of that's discussed in there about the oil exploration that was going on at the time since and the United states and Saudi Arabia and maintain a baseline of economic and security cooperation\nThat has kept up the relationship pretty strong\nBoth countries have been an ally and opposition to communism in support of stable oil prices and instability in western economies where the Saudis have invested both countries were also allies against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the Nineteen eighties now the Israelis have a a diplomatic absorb relationship with\nThe Saudis which is was that would've been on think about five or ten years ago but they do 'em\nBoth countries have said been allied into variety of issues in the U.S Saudi Arabia were also allies in the explosion of Iraq from Kuwait in Nineteen Ninety One that was the Gulf War than us defended Saudi Arabia against the threat from Saddam Hussein\nMore recently there's been a robust defense cooperation between\nThe United states and Saudi Arabia including arms sales of Saudi Arabia as the U.S largest foreign military sales customer President Trump authorize a one hundred and ten billion dollar deal and twenty Seventeen I'm so very very significant bear\nThe deal a included sign documents with letters adventures intent but it's not actually a contract to this point so some people have been saying that this was already done it's not the U.S had a long physical presence an advisor military role in Saudi Arabia we trained Saudi pilots\nSo you've got all of this cooperation and increase even more so a when ISIS situation came up to Saudi Arabia is a tried to balance between his role as a leader in the Arab world and strong ties to the United states that allows us to get answers to what happened\nHere so that's part of what has to happen then what action is taken is a separate issue and you've got to balance the entire geopolitical situation and balance at the same time it's just not easy balance the interest in the region\nBut also you got to get you know the idea that the knowledge the bars what would be complicit in doing something like this has to raise serious serious concerns gave me I Know Senator Graham and others have been very strong on this already banned I Want to go to our director of governmental affairs or let let's talk about that\nThe United States Senate I think probably the most vocal on this has been Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina Jay historically a Senator Graham has really put a lot of value in the alliance with Saudi Arabia for many of the reasons that you just describe but\nI Would sort of boil it down to three reasons one other one of the key players in limiting the reach of Iran or to Jay they'd be they're going to be a key base for the United states to push back against ISIS and other radical forces that emerge in the region\nAnd in three or you've got to have places in the region where you can provide support for for our allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia is probably the most important player in the region in that regard so that's why historically\nPeople like Senator Graham had been in favor of this alliance Jay ... he is very concerned about what just happened a which I'm all for show gay and he has said that if the facts bear out in the way that he thinks there are pointing to the United States Senate will act\nOf very strongly including sanctions now again I think if the United States Senate is going to do that Jay and they need to do it based on a set of facts and so I think what you'll hear from Senator Graham today is that he's in favor of secretary Pompeo statement of\nMaking sure that the United states draws its own conclusion Jay you can't take the word of the players in this region at face value the United states to look at the facts make its own assessment and come to its own conclusion\nIf if it's if it's poor conclusion J I think Lindsey Graham in the United States Senate will be ready to act\nYeah so again let me say this and do we have the statement from Mike Pompeo where he says let's give a couple of days here for them to give us a full report I Want to get that one ready 'cause I think sometimes in these we do have it let's go and listen\nBy told further from this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that we do\nHave a way that is ending up back surrounding that what we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nThe surrounding this show\nI think that is the right response we've got to get the facts and circumstances let's go ahead and take some phone calls we're taking your calls in common is one eight hundred six eight ... three one one zero let's go to Michael is calling from Cleveland, Ohio we like to I might go walking the broadcaster on\nA gentleman I was er I just wanted to see how far you folks have any information on a ... passed a possible connections with Saudi intelligence and or any other radical groups\nWell you know he's got an interesting past and that he had that showed some sympathies for Osama bin Laden ah in interviews that he had done and by the way this it's an excuse these actions or he also had some ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and so this is this is not someone that's coming to this without living in that world\nAnd when I say that understand the world you're living in in the middle east these kinds of things are unacceptable in our standards unfortunately this is you know the ... you saw with ice it this is the mindset of some of these these groups\nBut that does not any change these moderated his tones over the years he was in exile in the United states and said\nLook you don't want to go to the standards I don't want to say well I just did it so the Saudis did it so that's okay so I don't think that's because we've got one question came in from dead on\nFacebook it's just not America's bill is to get involved with is putting pressure on Saudi Arabia is wrong in my opinion I disagree\nI think sending Mike Pompeo over as the president did was exactly the right thing diplomatically we need to be addressing visited diplomatic framework and that is what is happening here it's a diplomatic framework that's being implemented because you got to get the facts\nBut you can ignore what has happened here and I don't think anybody that you're going to hear from on our broadcast today is going to say that at all and I think we can ignore the reality is what's taking place you know there's competing\nThrough the day I mean number one just pure and unequivocally he should not had been murdered if in fact that's what happened is should not have happened at the same time like with so many situations in this region J I mean there's a an extent to which there are no clean hands here I mean some of the association for him in the past have been troubling and you need to look at it so again when you say look it's a fascinating\nI I just want to say something about this uh because Washington Post reporter disobeying yes that's true ah he's had some some you know I Would call troubling relations in the past none of that justifies\nThe action is what kind of corn wasn't a decision this wasn't a you know this was apparently we don't have all the facts until we get we don't know but there was more to it go ahead\nWell and that's why I started there because I think that's absolutely where you have to start and finish any conversation on this it's a very troubling instant incident and that's why I'm Glad that President Trump and secretary Pompeo\nHad committed to getting to the bottom of it but I think the larger point though is that\nThe facts here don't involve just what happened inside the constant litter the embassy a few days ago they are also ah have you have to look back in history you look at look at the interplay between the United states and Saudi Arabia have to look at the interplay between turkey and Saudi Arabia frankly you've got to look at the interplay between Saudi Arabia\nAnd other powers in the region like the Shia Iran so Jay when you talk about getting the facts the reading you don't have them in a period of twenty four hours is because the facts are not confined to just what happened inside the sport Walt ... rounds of all involved are important\nIt is I mean taxes circumstances matter of days and we got to get a complete knowledge and the fact now again it doesn't justify the actions if they did happen that apparently happened here but you got turkey involved you've got Saudi Arabia\nBoth allies of the United states and we just had the situation with Bronx his release or relationship we are getting better with turkey but as I say that I mean the Turks are concerned the United states is concerned world opinion is going to be concern Lindsey Graham is very concerned let me play what he had to say\nI'm In their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate disguise wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered in a conflict and turkey and take stagnated north ... hours on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good ally there's a difference between a country and an individual thing NBS thing here is to me toxic he can never be a world later on the world\n[noise] so that is the crown prince they're talking about there and a Lindsey Graham's it is very concerned we want to get the facts and you can't just rely on the Saudis for those facts either they need to do an investigation\nBut they're going to have to come clean on this I mean something's going to have to transpire here are we're taking your phone calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth or phone lines are open for ya we've got comments coming and also on Facebook and ... we encourage you to get those in as well we come back from Gregory going to have a colonel Smith\nHappy had he had a criticized the Saudi Government extensively in in in articles so I mean yes um I think that yeah that is no question but that was he had reason to be concerned but but he took these acts and he told his fiance to wait for him and call friends have been in return\nThat's what he told the fiance I okay All right well that pretty well after\nNow tells me you know I Want to go back to to to thin on this and then let's stay on with us for the second half hour here began to talk to us he began he's traveling today but we want to see if we can keep ... or ... and that's why I think Congress I understand that concern but we've got to be measured in getting to the bottom of all this\nWe've got to get all the facts Jamie look like I I think there is inappropriate role for both the executive branch in the legislative branch I think it's probably good that legislative branches spun up so that that that Saudi Arabia take this seriously and so that it fully equipped to handle the president doing do you deal with Foreign Relations\nBut at the same time the constitution gives the president their responsibility to balance all of these measures so I actually think it's good right now that you have Lindsey Graham and others in the Congress or just sounding the alarm and how serious this is and then at the end of the day the secretary of state in the president's ... they have to balance all the things we're talking about income to a conclusion I think\nIt was and I think dispatching Mike Pompeo to meet with them was absolutely appropriate and correct thing to do it been canceling\nA secretary of nutrients participation in the uh Saudi Arabia investment forum for some it was the right thing to do as well and I think giving them a few more days to respond is fine but understand or something happened and something bad happened here uh west you me Fifteen seconds on the importance of the ally here we got to remember that too [noise]\nYeah they are they are they're the leader of the Gulf states there in the Persian Gulf and standing you have to malign influence of Iran and and they're radical Shia Islam a slob city and we need Saudi Arabia or to to help us with Israel and taking that's now\nAll right we'll be back with more in just about a minute here at a a seal at one hundred sixty four thirty one said if you want to talk to a C. L. J. down or does work to work at the ACL Jay\nHe's coming November ...\nPerhaps the most important midterm election in our history\nDo we have the momentum the mainstream media\nIs president Donald Trump with everything they have they want to destroy this president every game from it so far\nChanged things can you do is with us to find out how\nThey intend seven the answer\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie\nFor the American Center for law and justice ...\nEverybody was in the broadcast one eight hundred and she said for thirty wouldn't let me tell you what we're talking about\nJamal could show the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi Government went into I Lived in Washington she basically self imposed exile\nA went into the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to obtain a documentary needed for his upcoming marriage or he did not come out he had his fiance wait outside he told his fiance a that and he was very clear on this that a\n... wait for them to call friends if he did not return and he did not return\nSo he may have had a a concerned the console was going to be issuing marriage certificate that he needed\nA marriage or marriage Turkish citizen having said all of that here's what we know a week after the disappearance Saudi Arabia said they would allow Turkish investigators to search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to investigate the disappearance of Mr ... however the search to not take place until October sixtieth\nAnd then we find out that the walls to the buildings on the inside were completely repainted\nSo it looks like something awful has happened which I think there's no question that something awful happen the president spoke with uh the king king Solomon of Saudi Arabia but then dispatch Mike Pompeo here's what Mike Pompeo said once he left meeting with the president this morning\nI told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that we do have some understanding of the facts surrounding that was why we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nSurrounding this show again\nWe want to get to the bottom of this because an extrajudicial killing and that's what it is that's what's called a colonel Smith called that is exactly what looks like the place you're having said that this is very ... I don't want anybody to think you just say we're cutting off Saudi Arabia and that's it because you're not the way it works\nThis is a very complex geopolitical situation I always say in the middle east you gotta think nine dimensional here\nColonel Smith there are complicating this does not justify what they did and there should be repercussions for that and there will be world repercussions for the beers and it may be that this crown prince has to go is that you cannot be the new leader of the modern Saudi Arabia but I Want to defer to colonel Smith I met you served in the region\nYeah I think you're right I think if if it if his proven that he was involved in this that perhaps he ordered this hit\nAnd the idea of him being a legitimate leader Saudi Arabia or that that simply cannot be he does have Thirteen other brothers some of which are older than him he was elevated to this position and even though he will take off her brother and in some ways he's tried to do some good things\nYou know Saudi Arabia part of the reason that they have they have a they have such\nA cultural norms and the religious police are so strict and up until recently women couldn't drive women basically have the rights there is because of the concern\nConcerning the hobby a strain of Islam that is there the religious leaders we'll do a lot of political power one of the things is crown prince did is he stood against their religious leaders he's trying to modernize Saudi Arabia bring them morally and culturally more to the twenty first century but\nIf he's involved in this in any sense of legitimacy that he had is absolutely gone and the United states needs to be measured very strong enforceable but measured in their response to this uh these allegations\nProve true in a part of that will be the that the king needs to select another successor 'cause I\nMean that's the kind of repercussions that could come into play on this\nAnd I when I Want to say are going to the break here is that understand the scope of nature what's going on here nine dimensional thinking multi dimensional thinking here because what you have is an extrajudicial killing that's what we're going to call it took place evidently at the consulate Saudi Arabia and its tumbled turkey\nThe Turks certainly have the right to investigate a crime that took place in their country but there's more to it than that\nThe Saudis cannot get away with it with impunity that's for sure\nBut we can't be ever rush to judgment on what our reaction will be other than a terrific and condemn been what actions we take and\nIt may be the removal of this crown prince if he was involved who is the heir apparent\nTo the throne of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that would be a big result [noise]\nAnd I think the world pressure is going to be on at this point that's what I think our here's what we're going to do when you take your calls coming up at one eight hundred sixty four three one zero remember we've got a lot of expertise in this area and I've traveled to this ... we have officers in this region I've traveled all over that region\nAnd colonel Smith I served in that region so we want to give you our analysis on this and I think the president's tone on this right now it's correct that big dispatching Mike Pompeo secretary's day was the right thing to we come back and break we'll take your calls one eight hundred sixty eight more three one one zero that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one time\nI had a confession I Want to be eighty million people in the U.S from Benghazi instead of seeing
