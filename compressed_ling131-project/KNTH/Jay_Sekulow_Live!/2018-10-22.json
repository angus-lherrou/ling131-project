Seventy is our is our number right now we're kind of taking things on the topic which we've only had a couple of topics so far\nAway Mario for whom we're waiting is the past six year old Alexandria in the ten thousand block was timer Sharon is our producer and engineers ... is our freedom your phone calls cruises or a trip to the producer and together sharing and ... and ...\nThey they have a lot of work to do to make that happen [laughter] yeah it's it's it's it's a chore but I think it's I think for at least for Sharon in gym and do you need is a labor of love because you know they they love this place right well was ringing and all of a sudden it where you live in\nOne of the I mean while we're waiting yes how about this for waiting on file tomorrow on TALK a little bit up uh have you ever heard of the Mandiant\nSo the Mandiant no small religious minority most of whom have lived in Iraq\nUh uh for you know until recently for all of the persecution and things have caused him as sort of after ... ... you know right away\nBut a demand demands are actually a spiritual descendants of John the Baptist\nThey felt that John the Baptist was out of Iraq no not that he visited react but that they they owe their spirituality to John the Baptist and that they really are followers more of John the Baptist New York Jesus\nAnd so they have this these rituals immersion that they do but once every week and the Tigris and Euphrates River\nAnd the story that I read is that this is the water pollution in the Tigris right now is so bad that they are not able to do many of their\nA ritual ab ... is the one that east west ... on the north side of of\nI'd have to go back and look at it that they kind of converged together in the south or the part of Iraq\nBut but every Sunday in in Iraq this this group or gets together at the Tigris River to to baptize and its self uh self ... three times they go into the water and they ... themselves in the water so I don't know if it's like the mix or not I don't know\nIs it that are well it'd be origins of baptism we're probably the safest stolen perverted from the original intent of Mitt Romney yeah but it probably has its origins\nYeah you're in it but in the mix but self what happens ... is a immersion pool right that to them\nIs just earlier pool and you can do with me in leaving water is going to\nBe moving water though and that's the thing with the ... they can't have just a pool of water is going to be moving water living living water as long as it\nIs to travel other translations but the water has become so bad with human waste and chemical ah dumping dumping that they are no other ... they're having a hard time tiny times that they can actually get in the water to go through their religious rituals and it's something they do every week\n[noise] ms or something they do once in a lifetime and Christian baptism you watch it over with but it's something they do weekly\nDavid would they have anything to trace back to John the Baptist outside of New Testament where is it all from\nYeah that's a good I don't know that I don't know that I mean I Know I have friends like Jim ... who's a University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\nThat studies the Mandy and that has been there and and this is ... ... they still speak care Meg the same language that Jesus or\nA and when they do their rituals they use the ... uh to do that I'm not sure if it happened that when with with a week you know when the movie was made the passion of the Christ a lot of it was done an airbag I don't know if they had Mandy and it helps with that or not because they are probably the\nThose who have the most ancient take arrived to your language that point\nRight so Marty oil back back with his father Mario on line five father Matteo\nYes I'm back guide sorry about that the fire department said OK guys can go back and I was using my sister's fall so I had to hang up and move\nUp here I guess we're going to be one of\nThe questions that we

experience like for you\nOkay you're going to be disappointed\nOkay shut off and disappointed but go ahead\nYeah um it was a not a big event for me\nI'm a\nAnd the reason is that you know I stood there and I loved it was a long church it's kind of a\nColonial churches you might imagine yeah and uh the whole congregation had you know kind of tears in their eyes I\nI've preached of course I preach the holiday it wasn't about to look at our fraternity life and uh I spoke in Spanish first because I was really focusing on the drivers\nUh uh I got to be down because they're not outlook drivers of the cars right oh okay\nAnd yet you had your heavy Cuban accent onto right oh God yeah [laughter] I got I Want to hear that I got\nA I've got very animated and then of course chose my sister had interior there on a trip to hold the rest of the family but here's why David it's really interesting a long time ago I read an article\nOn that one had a curious title and the curious title was the sin of nostalgia\nDo ... ... that's right huh um\nAnd the author was talking about not any regular nostalgia is it shouldn't talk that's not the shooting a lot of times just when you exaggerate ... and and it becomes more than it is supposed to be\nIf a share it does it stops sharing in the I'm humbled dignity of the penalty for that [noise] and uh uh of course it to me\nUm I look and I am not a person who had fuses stealing says you know story [laughter] and I thought about it and it was meaningful from a perspective of memory and the perspective of [noise]\nHuh this is where my mom and dad's to Seventy two years ago and but you know feeling\nA company that no tears you know doing anything like that and and you know and I don't want to get into this too much but ah\nI Do not by a long time ago I think it has something to do with my can re conversion to being at the Catholic Christian but the experience was so deep of being rescued\nAnd that's the only thing that ultimately mattered\nTo me was the fact that there was a God who was there to rescue me and there was a future\nIf my life is not in the past the past is is a nice if there is a Ricky Nelson a song and garden party right\nAnd when he says in that song if memories are all I sang I'd rather drive a truck and and and it was good but I ...
