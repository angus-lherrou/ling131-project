thirty one ten is we\nAcknowledge pray for and uh those affected by the at the tree of life to the value of the shooting a condemning anti Semitism in and understanding that as an organization\nUm we do a lot to condemn the other boycott divested sanction movement in the United states\nA lot of this anti Semitism on college campuses which is exactly what it is in the form of being anti Israel I ... and these distinctions that that these groups try to make which are just absurd um is getting something as organization we combat some of these individuals we should all combat\nAnd acknowledge that it is an issue that's been in the United states as it is in most of the world unfortunately\nI'm as just the beginning of time and ah today on the broadcast or actually focusing in on what Israel has been doing in response to the tax on the Jewish state\nOf Israel I think it's a unique time to point out there has been an escalation over the weekend in fact just this weekend\nIn Israel out of the Gaza Strip so targeted Israel thirty rockets were fired by God's up based militants have this group is called Palestinian Islamic jihad or sometimes just referred to as Islamic jihad to Israel as a government holds a mosque responsible\nFor Islamic jihad activities at ... ... an Islamic jihad work together often but there are times when ah they are separate\nAnd so you'll see that Islamic jihad is also based in a Damascus is where a lot of their leaders are headquartered to get protection a so that they are not actually in harm's way directly I so I ... their leadership there the mosques leadership\nMuslim Brotherhood leadership both groups emulating by the way from the Muslim Brotherhood out from my boss but interesting enough even though it's coming out of the ... world\nGetting a lot of its funding from the sheer world in Iran so first let's talk about this weekend I'll go to Henry Hudson Harry\nThis weekend we saw really escalation ... just specifically between a Islamic jihad and Israel says comes out of the Gaza Strip but thirty rockets being fired at the state of Israel and Israel responding back with that specific attacks on\nEighty targets absolutely so this is an important ... an ominous development\nOr these attacks are coming from gossip suggest the tomato sauce is working with the Islamic jihad it's working with Syria and ultimately it's working with all wrong which is the source of much of them is just\nA in the middle east so in response to provocation\nEssentially by Iran and its surrogates including the Islamic jihad Hezbollah\nMilitants are in Syria\nIsrael has conducted an aggressive military campaign across\nA Syria against Iran backed militia groups and in ... this is highly necessary Israel cannot allow a these militants to build up an arsenal a as a basis of continued attacks on Israel\nAnd it could lead ultimately to another outbreak of a small or perhaps a large war\nYeah I mean you're talking about a ... again organizations that it made out of again the God primarily here you've got the Gaza Strip though the Islamic jihad group unlike Hamas operates pretty heavily in the west bank as well so that is why they are a do a mosque because they are the governing power\nIn the Gaza Strip so if these uh rockets are launched Israel holds for mosh responsible for not preventing the rockets from being launched by these or other groups and sometimes working in tandem ... again it's the middle east things get complicated but I understand Islamic jihad group\nAlso operates in the west bank are controlled by the PLO or the Palestinian authority and so the date but what is unique to uh to what kind of ties them all together\nIs the funding that they receive from Iran and specifically Iran's revolutionary guard forces where those funds flow through they flow through Damascus now even at a time when you would imagine that Syria\nIs extremely unstable that has been one of the headquarters for these Islamic ah a Palestinian Islamic terror groups SOS we're seeing an increase not just between the attacks in the Gaza Strip\nAnd Israel but specifically over just the past Eighteen months of the really an escalation what Israel is doing in Syria and and targeting ... Iranian forces there I mean one of their primary goals is to prevent Iran from having a him an occupying force inside Syria\nYeah exactly I over the last Eighteen months uh Israel has lost they think about two hundred airstrikes in Syria\nOr in what really Israel is trying to do they're trying to to head off what would be a major major war in the middle east\nAnd they're doing that or do these air attacks first of all they're trying to stop Iran from having a permanent military base near the Israeli border they're trying to to head off the major war because they realize\nThat if Iran had a permanent presence there and they vowed to destroy Israel or if they hit the increase weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon that again could lead to a major war\nAnd uh they're trying to block weapon shipments coming to Lebanon\nAh there are a lot of ground convoys going through Iraq across Syria into Lebanon to arm Hezbollah\nAnd also to the army rainy and build backed militias so he was trying to stop that but the frightening thing you're talking about the the missiles being fired from from the Gaza Strip or just last week Israeli intelligence or released a report\nThat once again around is using civilian airliners to ship weapons in weapons components the missiles that have been fired from Gaza and Israel and from Lebanon in Israel\nThey have nothing guided missiles there sort of blob into the territory hoping that they will hit something however last week\nIt was revealed that some of the civilian planes are now delivering sophisticated guidance systems to Hezbollah so they can take these guidance systems install it in the missiles so that they can actually pinpoint specific targets in Israel that is a major game changer in this conflict\nIran is really a behaving in a dangerous in reckless fashion\nAnd uh the terror groups in that you and here he talked about\nThey could not do what they do without the financial support of Iran and also the weapons that are supplied to these groups by her on a Iran they they try to use their proxies so they can have plausible deniability correct but their goal is the destruction of the nation of Israel\nYeah and they receive guy to show so I could just give all these resources if it's if you do what you want their ... coming with that that kind of the terrorists so that Iran is able to control these groups whether it's Hezbollah\nOr you're talking about a group like Islamic jihad or even a boss I they want to be able to control them and their actions so they do this at the ... you talked about the weapons as incentives\nBut understand Iran's role of this I think just to underscore what West is talking about using the civilian aircraft\nA as a military ... way of a delivery military goods to recognize terror organizations take us General Jack Keane as well he was discussing how this has been uncovered and\nThis is something newly uncovered that Iran has started to do what's happening\nIs Iran has been very aggressive because Syria means so much to them so they fly on charted airplanes or their military aircraft in in the ... as a missiles ammunition commodities they also use commercial airlines to do the very same thing and then they're driving through Iraq and to\nEastern Syria and bringing also ammunition supplies to that the\nWhite House has said that quote Iran and Hezbollah cannot be allowed to build an arsenal of weapons on Israel's border\nThat threatens the region yeah we have this question that came in so interesting what Harry on Facebook and we will get your phone calls as well we've got callers hold on his well one hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you want to talk to us on air that's one eight hundred six eight for three one two one zero\nBut a car recall there said besides the United states which countries in the middle east back is against terror groups supported by Iran it's a complicated question because many of countries that do not support Israel would would also do support Iran and the Gulf states that some have\nMore behind the scenes been supportive of Israel but certainly this again it shows you that this question or it could be an entire thesis on the on the middle east\nAbsolutely you could certainly write a number of books on ... politics I think it's clear beyond question but the public posture of most Middle Eastern countries is one of opposition to Israel and the other hand um based on real politic\nI think the black could support that the U.S provides whose hobby they be time to Israel has enabled them to caddy atrocities that will do that\nAt all to exist this package for like ...\nAnd Harry I'll go right to you there that is the Iranian foreign minister tying\nThese two groups that are two countries together as the U.S works with ... and different and unique ways but trying to tie publicly what is it not putting knowledge by Saudi Arabia publicly but that they are somehow a working together against Iraq that's why he's tried to go after them obviously\nYou're absolutely correct essentially what the Iranian foreign minister is trying to do he is trying to deflect attention away from the rainy and\nMalignancy the Iranian atrocities in the middle east by blaming the cross cities that are on ... in the middle east and Saudi Arabia\nAnd Israel also essentially it's outrageous so wrong is the number one state sponsor of terror in the world period\nAnd it's clear beyond question that Iran has a plan in mind they are attempting to master mind control of the middle east in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd in Gaza as a launch pad for future wars for control of the middle east or extending to Yemen him essentially to the Saudi Arabian peninsula\nBut a lot of people also started asking on Facebook and we've got a call about it as well we'll get to our second half hour of the Russian role in this [noise] how are they align\nWith Iran why are they aligned with Iran got a book out about that will take your calls wanting a hundred and six eight four\nThirty one tenth that one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten as we update you on the latest news out of the middle east evolving Israel how it affects U.S interests of course this is an eight days out from our mid term elections here\nIn the United states the second half hour Jay sexual I've come up a great time to get your phone calls in his right

news along with shut\nTaylor and Tom Fontaine morning information and entertainment starts at four AM weekdays on AM ten Seventy the answer [noise] live from\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie and now\nExtreme sexual live if you're just joining us the second half hour of the broadcast let us just now is once again and condemned the attack that occurred\nIn Pittsburgh on Saturday or gives the Jewish community there at the tree of life synagogue was eleven innocent people killed\nSix or ... injured some critical including law enforcement officials who bravely responded to a a lone gunman a who was fueled by anti Semitism something we must always condemn\nAnd uh we work on the American civil law and justice our work against the boycott divested sanctions moving in the United states and on college campuses as well and this idea ideological anti Semitism uh but that ... you could see how that again that ideal ideology can beat uttered\nUnfortunately into this horrendous a\nTo fuel this kind of horrendous attack so we condemn that er and condemned fight anti Semitism wherever we see it but also I must be praying for those who have who have been innocently are those people who were killed uh uh who were there to uh at their house of worship for various reasons that day\nUm and so I get a a thoughts and prayers with that a community and as we focus in on what is happening around the world but there's\nA we've seen you know whether that was the the Bobby incidents that occurred to you know explosives and thankfully no one was injured that person gets apprehended in Florida who was responsible for that there's been a lot going on in our own country that is taken away a rightfully so to some extent obviously you've got to focus on what's happening in your country\nBut to understand what's also happening around the world because we had a ship back into politics as well mid term elections but all of this affects us as Americans so what is happening inside Israel what is happening in the middle east very important has it gotten as much attention\nIn the last few weeks I think it deserves so today because of this increased by Israel and their response to uh the radical groups are operating out of the Gaza Strip many who are headquartered in\nSyria and also it increased their their Israeli actions inside Syria being backed by the White House be backed by the Trump Administration who want to go to the folks about this as well because there's another factor this\nWe haven't yet address are there are we bitch just during the break because we got coverage coming in from Jason on Facebook and also call coming in from Phil in New York on line to feel welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nYou're on the air very much for taking my call it means to me and my question my question is is close to Ninety percent they Christian nation why are they say it's a theocracy and\nYeah so what I Would say you've got to kind of divorce the people oftentimes from the government especially in\nOr we see this off the ties in countries like Russia or where the foreign policy of the government off the Dodgers don't match up to the views of the people so that that that the idea here again\nIt's not so much Russia's be anti Israel west it's rush or the Russian government because they work with the Israeli government when it's in their interest is the Russian government are working for their own interest there they like in China I Would see more and all these countries\nUm they they are not ideologically tied to a anymore this idea of spreading around this view of communism or they don't have that anymore so it's all about their own interest or fear that they don't have the other ties of a like A Rod's got the ideological tired to to why they want to support these groups it Russia's doing it for themselves\nAbsolutely ... their opportunistic you know they're looking for what will what will you forward their own national interest and rush of what they're looking for in Syria to the court to the caller's point first of all\nThe while the people of Russia or Ninety percent orthodox Christians the government is not a Christian government but in addition to that Russia they want to have a warm water port permanently in Syria on the Mediterranean so that's part of their strategic interest\nBut also Russia is supplying Syria they're trying to prop up the Assad government with anti aircraft missiles [noise]\nIt's a volatile part of the world and maybe we can talk about that in a moment but it's a tinderbox\nHuh it's it it's hard to predict exactly what will happen there\nYeah I mean she got a lot of different layers and he got a call his bring it up again you could do his\nPart but you also to build put the puzzle together as you are looking at what's happening inside Israel we can take your phone calls this\nImportant do you believe these foreign policy issues will be to the mid term elections or do you think everyone is focused on\nDomestic issues where they'll certainly vote on their pocketbooks\nOne eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten\nDays after the midterm elections
