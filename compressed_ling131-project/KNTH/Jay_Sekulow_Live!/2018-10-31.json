[noise]\nWe're one week out\nFrom the mid term elections and the president and just a piece of an interview\nThere'll be airy uh later on HBO\n... the idea of birthright citizenship he's asked a question about action to executive order when it comes to\nA those board or from illegal immigrants so we've got a question company and Christine on Facebook\nSure George what is the difference really illegal immigrants and undocumented immigrants it is a matter of choice of words the left typically likes to use the word\nUndocumented immigrants it's seen as more PC uh because uh again I documented the truth is what is a document beads at major illegally here so there's no difference I just try to use both terms because people\nAre sometimes hear one antique well maybe the other doesn't apply\nIt applies to both because they are they are in effect the same thing that take a listen to President Trump he he was asked have you spoken with as you plan on on on this executive order\n'em and again there's different ways to write this executive order I mean we're just getting the very ... general statements for President Trump\nHas he consulted council to elicit by to\nTalk about ... ... young I have to wear in the process in the process\nSo I mean they're saying it's in the process it'll happen I I Believe the focus will be\nA primarily on those who have no legal right to be the United states so called a documented called the illegal who didn't have children and I just to give you kind of sub statistics about that uh this is peaks but uh just\nBack and I see it was there's been three hundred and Seventy thousand of these children according to a ... a study\nShowed the numbers are kind of all over the place depending on how you define the term in twenty fourteen\nThere were about two hundred and Seventy five thousand babies were Seventy five thousand babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents so illegal immigrant parents that's about seven percent of the four billion birds that year US citizenship of course is a grant of ... is that that's a very important\nThe difference between getting birthright citizenship it'd be naturalized actually has long implications for what kind of office you can hold\nIn the United states can you be president of the United states but also the rights of responsibilities that come with that there are all human eggs from one part of the constitution\nIt is the fourteenth amendment which reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and if the state of where they reside\nThat is the big question West End Harry are you subject to the jurisdiction of the United states in a positive way\nWhen you are here illegally\nRight and you go back in and look at it and one can versus art to Eighteen Ninety a case where which was the last time the Supreme Court definitively dealt with this they put qualifications in their decision that the parents of this Chinese American they were here legally and we're doing legitimate business in the United states\nAnd so what we're looking at and I know a lot of people just assume that it's law\nThat if you were born here no matter the status of your parents you're automatically a citizen while that is settled practice Jordan it's really not civil law because the Supreme Court has not dealt with this directly since Eighteen Ninety eight\nYeah I mean you look at it it really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties till they started becoming acceptable that we just kind of said okay well\nYour parents were here legally that doesn't matter you were born here so you're a citizen we're not really I don't think the president's intended to change this for lawful permanent residents and even people who are here temporarily but lawful a but instead for those who are here\nThe illegally without any kind of proper paperwork\nThat they are not subject to the jurisdiction there of of the United states in a positive way you look at Harry the constitution the positives and negatives of law\nAnd and it says if you're here illegally if it it's the negative that you're facing as the jurisdiction and the jurisdiction is you can be deported but at the U.S government owes nothing to you other than the deportation proceedings itself\nI think your analysis is spot on birthright citizenship show is tied to the port team from him but\nThe fourteenth amendment codified the Eighteen sixties six civil rights act the Eighteen sixties six civil rights out quite clearly exempted from automatic citizenship\nOr children of parents who owed allegiance to a foreign power\nI eat those who were in the United states only temporarily and particularly those who were in the United states illegally consistent with that analysis in Eighteen eighty four\nIn the L. versus Wilkins case the Supreme Court rejected the citizenship claim mining American indian who was born on the reservation and subsequently moved to a non reservation territory because the one ... was not subject to the United states\nI'm a jurisdiction at birth\nSo the key question is\nAre the parents subject to the jurisdiction\nOf the United states if they are not then there's some doubt as to whether or not their children their offspring or indeed citizens of the United states and lastly let me add that the United states is one of only two developed countries according to the international Monetary Fund\nThat allow for birthright citizenship and also literally this policy is questionable\nAnd not only that Jordan a number of countries in the last ten or Fifteen Years have changed their laws to explicitly forbid what ... is projected to be called anchor babies in their country through so that you're not automatically a citizen if you're born there and that includes the United kingdom Australia New Zealand France in India\nThose five countries have said no longer are you automatically a citizen if you're born here\nIf you talk to us on the air what's your opinion of this the president doing it by executive order give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten and how does it could influence the mid term elections I mean with the caravan issue\nWith this issue or the executive order front and center one week out from the mid term elections as people are voting right now and early voting all across the country or how could this impacts the mid term elections as well I think you can't take that away when you're talking about this city on Facebook and gets his votes\nAsked is why I think it's a great question can individuals from another country come here to the U.S visit so based they've tourists FISA\nHave their child be bored here should they will be American citizens this is called birth tourism though the Obama administration has cracked down on this right now under the current laws yes you ... if you came here to a tourist visa happened to have the birth while you were all that tourists FISA\nUh you would did or your child would be or could be a few so choose a U.S citizen by birth\nAbsolutely so essentially what we've had is a deliberate pre meditative practice by some visitors to the United states to ensure that their child would indeed be born in the United states\nAnd then they would take the child back to the home country of the parents so that the individual could later claim the trial\nCitizenship and the United states and perhaps citizenship in China or Japan or some other country it's important to note that at least one of the nine eleven terrorists\nAh I was born in the United states in the state of Louisiana\nHis parents then moved abroad I believed to Saudi Arabia he was raised abroad and many came back to the United states to do what\nTo terrorize Americans in other words he did indeed owe allegiance to a foreign power yet he was a treat it as if he were a an American citizen I'm based on ... like that makes no sense at all\nLet's go right to the phones Linda calling from Colorado on line one Linda welcome to Jay sexual alive\nThank you for taking my call that he led to\nMake me\nWhen I sit back and I look at that in fact I fail at very black and white\nIf you are all legal United said type a measure that ... and you're pregnant you how to say I do not think that the ... the last thing because the parents are not I think it's black and white [noise] if I got attack\nAnd there's a proposal would as you correctly point out Jordan not affect those individuals who are already here the focal point\nHe's on ending the practice going forward yeah uh and so I think I'm there is perhaps some unwarranted\nFears that have come up with respect to individuals who are already here the president has also proposed a\n... ... legalizing Selma illegals\nOr overtime or in the ... with the cooperation of Congress or what we're talking about is a proposal uh that would look at new birth er and in this practice and I think at least\nBased on my legal research it's clear beyond question that the United States Supreme court has offered to various opinions on that particular question going back to Eighteen eighty four\nI think this is what we can answer very quickly Larry and Indiana has this uh a question for slavery welcome to Jay secular live you're on the air\nThank you I'm On the on the support of a changing correct in the immigration laws a summons part of it but I Believe it hey either have to be down through through a legislation and land or a a man that process for this reason [noise]\nYou know for for many years of it the the people that were born babies that were born even our possession states ... ... ... yeah\n'cause we're considered testified in the U.S code right\nRight second um [noise] it's so if someone comes in a way to take a scenario for male male illegal alien comes to the stage across any border and then does not marry but has children\nBy us his head of the child is a U.S citizen one parent is enough and that is to find also even if you were born abroad are there some time issues there but if it happened in the United states and the parent is a U.S citizen or one of the pairs that that child has the U.S is that is not an issue here\nOn on what President Trump is talking about through this executive order we're right back on Jay sexual alive\nSan mo lo J. D. project ... might get like Dennis ... Michael ... runs Samuels and Larry voices am ten Seventy the ads [noise]\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie\nIn racial someone will hopefully with a whole hit about ... anything more than you\nThought about this and now your host he\nSays he has thought about it yes and he's gone a step further well let's play it for everybody\nHis idea on this executive order he says consulted with counsel legal counsel I'll take a listen [noise]\nHave you talked about the ... young somewhere in the process in the process you know\nThere there you go from the president now ... I've focusing on illegal immigrants called the undocumented if you will both parents being illegal or documented having a child in the United states is that child automatically a U.S citizen by birth\nIt is now the question that has been settled by the court case\nIt is that a question that you could say is totally clear by the constitution or statutes because the statute on this issue where they took the constitution they put it said a U. S. C. section fourteen and one of the immigration naturalization act\nThey just quote that first part of the fourteenth vivid person born in the United states it's subject to the jurisdiction there of what does it mean to be subject to the jurisdiction of a sudden say or a uh it's it is a requirement\nThe were subject to the ... that means something that phrase so it's more than just be bored in the United states that phrase subject to the jurisdiction of is there for a reason both to the constitution the fourteenth amendment and in the statutes that followed that\nHas a meaty how far does is what is an issue here uh for let's say I I think history has already been clear if you were a lawful permanent resident have a child here or there US citizen right now if you were here legally ah those children are us citizens I mean even if you are here legally that is\nHow the U.S has been treaty those situations it's Nineteen sixties\nThe president looking at doing this uh by executive order appears to be limited way too limited group of of individuals that are here illegally there's also this idea of this birth tourism\nThe idea of these people who are planning birds around at companies that set this up\nThe Obama administration really fought down a fought back against those companies as well because those people would get tourist visas\nThat have the children I think that's the issue as well uh it's talking about here so we're going to get into all that one hundred sixty four thirty one tenant let's not forget we're a week out from the mid term elections we've got this caravan issue as well but people have a lot to say\nOn this topic and I want to go right to the phones Greg in South Carolina on line three Greg welcome to Jay sexual alive\nThank you for taking my call 'em ... but I'm the president in this country and um what I originally applied I accept why for a temporary visa while they were crossing like bring\n'em one of the things I could do was appear in front of a judge and agree to deportation processes all habit actually in place that I've been\nDeported should I write the laws of this country yep what question is how could anybody even it to that position of tiny citizenship\nWhen the laws already broken\nOr you know it gets to that issue of it is the child does being born breaking the law\nOr at what point did they make the decision now or is it so that's where it gets fuzzy Greg just to be honest with you legally that's why there will be battles over this discussion the heated discussions over it on both sides the out but I think what you brought up Greg what I hear too for so many people as those who came here legally\nThose who went through the process but to be either become ultimately maybe greatest play the ultimately it become a US citizen takes a long time we went through the ... the the ... to the permanent status ultimately to the citizenship status they are who are out there who are most affected\nBy these laws that that people could utilize this to jump for it I Will talk about we come back for the break but\nTo me it's always interesting to hear from those callers who've had to go through this the legal way\nRight right it's very unfair to to the the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people waiting to get permanent residency or citizenship that they are pushed to the back because of the legal people coming in in jumping in and then that is that is on the face of it's not fair\nWe keep taking phone calls so we keep opening up line for you there's two right now if you want to call in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one says the idea president well it'd birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants by executive order [noise]\nYou know plans to do that one eight hundred and sixty four thirty went to the talk to Saudi or it important to update punish the obesity as well we get back from this break [noise]\nThis is Dr\nSebastian Gorka President Obama's eight years of leading from behind the level of the world and play\nFrom Russia's invasion of Ukraine to North Korea's missile test how to grow and I just kind of\nOther presidents from American leadership is being restored\nBut that does not mean our enemies have this uh [noise]\nWhy I wrote my new book\nFeeding America's enemies with no her\nAs a former deputy assistant to president from the strategy I explained the threat posed by enemies like Russia China and the global jihadi movement we must know our enemies and have the will of the ...\nIn my book why we fight\nLines of the Obama ... and how we can bank where she\nSebastian Gorka his new book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies is available now from Amazon had\nEight to ... fall morning time for your daily ... as you wait for your copy you get a bind now it's not your boss wanting extra whipped cream but you're Eighteen the doorbell\nPackage your new latte machine no more five dollar P.
