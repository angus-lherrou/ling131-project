said Fifteen Percent actually Seventy three percent said even if the doctor for his allegation of sexual assault or if corroborated by the FBI Seventy three percent still want Kevin up on the Supreme Court\nTen Seventy the as [noise]\n\nBroadcast everyone I was out in a\nA Arizona over the weekend and spoke at a big crisis pregnancy\nCenter Bob banquet and uh it was the day of the confirmation there was a Saturday when Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed and that was very interesting to see the reaction of the folks there he's now hearing cases so every case it forward he will be a part of\nSo they will hear cases oral arguments close courts closed today they'll hear oral arguments tomorrow so uh that's moving forward having said that\nThere's already been up here but I Want to kind of set this up and we'll go take some phone calls and we want your comments about this there's been this pivot since his confirmation we told you went through the pages but couldn't get it into pays for baseball would have been run out the clock for three more weeks a politically\nThat was what they were trying to do but it just was not work but couldn't they got the phase one face too and that was stopped at bay stories that a fair way to say it banned\n[noise] yeah absolutely I think they tried every phase they could Jay but ultimately they the Republicans held in the Senate they only last Lisa Murkowski on the final vote and how many times and we said on this broadcast if the Republicans could deliver fifty votes\nThe Democrats could try anything they want it and it wasn't going to stop them only losing Lisa Murkowski ensured that did the judge Kavanaugh was going to be justice Kevin ... and then J I think it took about thirty seconds after the Republicans delivered that fiftieth vote and Susan Collins speech that Joe mansion said he was also a yes or it was essentially J uh fifty one to forty nine margin\nIs going to and I think it's important to actually I think this is a good call the tickets were while we're talking about this margin gym in New Hampshire as a direct question on line three Jim welcome to Jay Sekulow alive gym\nLike we still like to ski\nAlright so let's talk about that go ahead oh what happened was one of her or pop Republican colleagues\nSteve Danes who voted yes on culture and Murkowski voted no on cloture ... an ounce if she would be a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh uh her Republican colleagues Steve Danes was a yes vote\nAnd would have a bit of a yes vote on Kavanaugh his daughter was getting married and he's from Montana a senator from Montana on that Saturday if he had to he uh he was going to fly back\nTo vote a but out of a out of just the niceties there she knew that their votes would cancel each other out anyway so it would affect the nomination so she could vote present so she was still registering her opposition uh didn't but that is why she did not vote no she would have voted no Steve dangerous they're\nSo was it like she was doing a favor for Brett Kavanaugh she was doing a favor for her Republican colleague who was attending his daughter's wedding\nSo what happens so than what let's take that disagree was a great call from Jim we're taking your calls it a hundred sixty four thirty one tent but now let's take what does that play she's in their ... or more years before she's up for reelection they're already talking about Sarah Palin running for that a rope during a Republican opponent\nYeah politically speaking Jay this at the same effect as voting no on Brett Kavanaugh joined exactly right on this I think it was a nice senatorial courtesy but look if she'd have stayed a no and they had would've needed the Danes vote they would have just held the vote open while he flew back\nOr to cast that vote and in fact if people were watching\nUh either on cable news or on CSPAN you saw the first time they went through the roll call Lisa Murkowski voted no it was only when all the senators had voted in the outcome was clear that she stood and said\nOut of deference to see day and someone withdrawing my boat I'm going to be a president because it's not going to change the outcome and it will allow my friend to stay home in Montana but politically speaking Jay and we've got to be very clear about this uh she was opposed to Brett Kavanaugh she did not deliver one of the votes that was needed to get him over the line\nAnd so when she's up for reelection in Alaska that's the message she's going to have to take back to voters in Alaska and convince them one way or another that it was the writer the wrong thing to do yeah I'm big business issues\nHave a real fight on her hands and I think it it you know what do you think happened was well we'll get to go state by state in a minute but I think this is the interesting thing to me is I think the Republicans are going to pick up the house or Senate seats I thought that was I thought that was before that and I think it's definitely in that but now the question is\nDo there was a blue wave expected to be coming and normally during the ... after the ... midterms of the new president they lose control if they have the control of the the house that usually lose it I mean that's historically\nHow do you see it here but I see that in in the house specifically everybody's up for reelection so unlike the Senate is staggered or this is everybody every two years so everybody has to fit their seat\nThat they said they say there's about thirty to toss up so it's kind of the average or that changes though I'm regularly most of those tossup still right now are Republican just to be clear only a two are a Democrat or help seats or is that being said the lean ... that leads you appear all\nRepublican and the liens damn are a bit about mixed\nSo I'd say it's it's about this can Republicans are just kind of maintain if they lose a couple\nSeats I think that is a victory as he if they lose ... as long as they have witnessed keeping the house control in the head of enjoy these if they are still the majority party in the house even just by one or two votes\nThey want I mean that was a big victory for Republicans coming out of a coming into a tough election cycle and then the Senate what you'll see I think it certainly is an expansion of the Republican majority unless something very bizarre happen the next uh less than a month and what do you think [noise]\nI think that's right I mean ... the Republicans have two hundred and forty seats in the house right now is a Democrat who need to flip twenty three of them and you know history is on the side of the minority party so I think that the the goalposts for Republicans there is absolutely just that to Eighteen majority and I actually think gay right now they have a pretty decent shot to do it or in the Senate I really\nWould have been around for a second to let you finish but people need to understand if they will lose ... house seats Republicans house he told me there's no doubt but if they can still contain uh maintain control of the house\nThat would be a huge victory for both the Republican Party the members of Congress had those committees\nAnd the president I mean you know ...\nNo question about it both parties are only aiming for that to Eighteen number and the fact that Republicans currently have two hundred and forty Jay they hold a couple of dozen seats there really a Democrat a heavy seat so they're going to lose some of those but they're not even they're not name and for two forty they're aiming for two Eighteen\nAnd in the Senate Democrats essentially need a clean sweep jamming I think they've already conceded that they're going to lose that North Dakota see so they need to take the seats the Republicans hold and in Nevada and Arizona and then really sweep all of the tossup states that Jordan is talking about\nI don't see that happening J I think the Republicans are going to have somewhere between fifty and fifty four seats in the United States Senate yeah\nWell it would be quite an up tick All right let's go and do you think well we'll get into how much of that plays off of the cameras up a process let's go ahead yeah\nRuth calling from Colorado on line to Ruth welcome to Jay sexual live Hi Ruth\nOh hi thank you for having me on and I just want to have two women out there that I'm a Democrat and living in Colorado we're being invaded by thinking that is not traditional to Colorado and send the woman\nI Do not stand with the the people that are speaking for me and clothing me in all their statement and I'm a survivor of abuse but the thing is\nI had like object if I'm looking at all areas where think all media and listening not to sound bite but the whole\nMessage and I just want to commend you on your job because he helped me track what was happening in these last week and it was clearly an injustice to women and it's clearly and injustice towards Supreme Court into our nation\nWell thanks for listening we're number one number two interesting I was with um a couple of dinner on a Saturday when it does have been I spoke at and I was where I was a speaker and um he was dependent and is now big switching the Republican Party I think I'm sure there are independents are now switching to the Democratic party ... out of the play too\nBut it's interesting that this galvanizing moment on the Supreme Court nomination that goes got so ugly and so overheated\nAnd and um with accusations of criminality flowing from centers uh than made up their mind before they were going to vote no anyways\nBut to to make this personal I mean there was one of the I'm not going to name the TV show but one of the head writer is one of the evening talk shows popular talk show said well at least we we all ruined his life\nBrett Kavanaugh's life that's what I mean we're giving the exact words I Want to be specific on that I'm not going to say that those writer what was the head writer for one of the major shows and this was the minimum that was out there during this process was Israeli ... really unbelievable I mean really unreal\nYes and they're trying to keep it up you know Nancy Pelosi is now taking control of this of the house is taking control why because the Senate\nDemocrats no they can complain all they want a but they've got a lot of work to do if they have any shot at all of getting which by the way a couple of weeks ago\nWe were talking about a real significant opportunity for them to take back the Senate even the Democrats now I think they're just hoping to hold onto what they've got 'em do to keep people like Joe Manchin within their own party a at ... even if they are still the minority party so you're going to see now and you've already it's already happening\nIt's Nancy Pelosi yeah it's the Adam Schiff types age the house Democrats who are Brett Kavanaugh and say remember we've got the best shot and they do this is true of taking back one of the houses of Congress specifically the house representatives\nBecause of that we could open up even though we have no role in advice and consent we can open up investigate it and move on\nFrom that and let's get some of the quotes that bad but we'll get some of the sound as well yeah here's one of the ... one of the quotes I don't have the sound on this yet you know this is from Jerry ... from New York is not something that we're eager to do he said\nOf of not just the ads but people on the ground on election day you know coming from the national party\nIf the ... continues to show pinpoint leads up by a by their their ... Republican opponent when you have that kind of lead um again you've got to move on how you think this place I mean we got a minute forty four seconds your how big band do you think\nThis place in the house\nUm I think ultimately be the deciding factor I mean it it will depend on in some of these swing states how many of these democratic members really really make it an issue but the M I n J just the overall tone nationally I think that I think Mitch McConnell put it right when he says the his opposition really played into\nOr the Republican Party's hand so you're down to thirty or forty competitive seats in the house I think it could be the decision maker\nI wouldn't talk more about this we come back from the break we'll have our full panel with us as well we're taking your calls at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten that's eight hundred six eight for three one two one zero so we'll take some more calls when we come back from the break I think look a break you saw the ... you saw the full working of the constitution last week\nA you saw the nomination process the president's authority there you saw the article\nOr I mean article one two and three all impacted by this the\nPresident the executive the legislative with the judicial branch and um there was a multi pays attack on Brett Kavanaugh it didn't it didn't work\nThis out they couldn't get it they were trying to get it to face for which would have been there were not tumult coming out of those investigations to have people saying we need more time and then there was a round the clock out when the FBI did the investigation they cannot cooperate\nAny of the allegations made against judge Kavanaugh and in fact the ones that were raised by one of the other lawyers late in the game a gotten a sweat next I think there were inconsistencies in her own statements that came out so just the evidence wasn't there to to move it forward and that's what happened\nAnd then you saw the voting the confirmation will be back with more including your calls or just after the break\nStuck your weekday mornings with armed American\nRadios daily defense with mark Walters at four AM followed by the Hugh Hewitt morning show at five ... and the am ten Seventy five twenty ... we'll bring you up to date with the news that happened overnight then it's seven ... show with Jay peak ... news along with shot\nTiller and Tom Fontaine morning information and entertainment starts at four AM days on AM ten Seventy the answer live\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow live\nFell so for the American Center for law and justice have secular oh\nAll right so I call it the ... and that's the second place right now judge Kavanaugh is now justice calving off you will hear as first\nCases tomorrow as they support associate justice of the Supreme Court in the United states\nAnd me we are now less than a month out of the midterms and all of a sudden the cabinet nominations becomes it costs a lab in the sense that you have some Democrats saying that they are going to if they get the house they're gonna open up an investigation with a possible impeachment uh Brett Kavanaugh on the other hand does it unite the Republican Party is well Supreme Court nominations\nTend to do that so we want to get your reaction to this we're taking your calls at eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten we've got our full panel joining us now a senior counsel for the ACL jaded director of policy a professor Harry ... and Cornel West Smith\nOur director of military ah fares are are joining us as well as I thin and myself in Jordan All right so let me uh we've heard from the three of us let me go to a ... a professor Hutchison your reaction when he gets confirmed what do you think it's the after effect of the confirmation\nWell first it's important to note that despite the fact that a justice Kavanaugh has indeed been confirmed that the political fight\nOr is not completely over so there are twenty nine days or to the mid term election a conservative voters are mobilized they're energized and they're energized for good reason the cabinet nomination in my opinion has United conservatives from all political spectrum\nBut be sure of one thing opposition is also energized to some extent and people on both sides of this issue are fundraising like Matt\n... no question about that so when you're in a group this week and I was in a group this weekend\nDifferent parts of the same I Would put everybody within the same political philosophy corrected very diverse group what was kind of the reaction but here's what I ... I saw I had there were we were at a table actually at the table we were at one of the couples\nThat we're seeing with me and Pam I'm he was an independent registered independent\nOr had been a Republican had been a Democrat had been a Republican kind of back and forth this what pushed him into the Republican camp he said you know what you that that would they did to Brett Kavanaugh was so outrageous that kind of visceral attack that he's you know this is just ... it just wasn't going to accept it and so he was making ... what was your reaction where you where you know\nVery very similar you know that the ugliness of what happened the last two weeks is on everyone's mind and and the I think the consensus was that the Democrats just made it much more difficult\nTo ... to take the house or they probably were never going to take the Senate anyway and in spite of the polls are indicating that white suburban women are moving to the Democratic party and they were mainly against judge Kavanaugh\nI believed that Americans in general\nAnd Republicans in independent voters in particular they were disgusted by the behavior of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and the blatant means steer spirited attacks from Kevin now I think it's going to be very very difficult for them to have this blue wave that they've been champion today overplay it\nOh well they overplayed so round and round was heavily over played by Democrats the Spartacus fought with I think to a point where it was almost kind of so laws that they were the only ones making news and that wasn't really going to impact the election\nThen you get around to wear a so that the Democrats really embarrassed themselves in the judicial philosophy section of the hearing and then we get through this personal attack\nSection and and again what ... what are Democrats left with\nA judge Kavanaugh who had to go through a horrendous experience for his family is now a U.S Supreme Court justice they're all just sitting there are still in the Judiciary Committee um they did everything they could and they they failed a yet again I'm so\nThese tactics they used by the courage serious question when the and the people\nThat they're aligning themselves with like you mentioned one of the issues is that well you mentioned the lawyer by name but it's like if you're going to start taking it for people like that um your major not doing your your due diligence before you bring these attacks and if people see that you love your cat like that against someone\nCriminal yeah allegation against someone serious wanted that then then it's the American people what question your Sears this ability and leave the U. S. government's\nBeen there I mean more like a twenty six seconds or they're gone now right I mean everybody's out\nBy the Senate will be back tomorrow after the holidays so it's going to be interesting is they come back down in this atmosphere I mean I knew they were out to be very interesting to see the return what it's like [noise]\nWe're taking your calls one hundred and six eight four thirty one time to be back with more in just a moment eight hundred and sixty four three one one one zero your reaction to all this back more\nAt the American Center for law and justice we focus on the critical issues that matter most to you and your family [noise] AC OJ she council Jay Sekulow\nWhether it's presenting arguments before the U.S Supreme Court or engaging in the halls of Congress for more than a quarter century the ACL Jay's been on the front lines protecting our values and constitutional freedom\nThere's no better place to get the facts\nAbout the most important issues of the day than at the the OJ website\nYou can listen to our daily radio broadcast [noise]\nWatch her TV show\nGet the latest news and insight on vital issues even support the work of the AC OJ [noise]\nAt the American Center for law and justice we don't just talk about the issues we take action to defend our values and our constitutional free to\nJoin us online at the American Center for on justice\nAnd the L.
