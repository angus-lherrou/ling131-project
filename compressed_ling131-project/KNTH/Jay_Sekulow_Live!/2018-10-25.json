Texas a border crossing a the ... the Texas border crossing is closer\nLast time around they chose the Tijuana uh San Diego area but I mean they get to states or could be in the mix here I I Want to take your phone calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty what did what should be done\nTo stop this wave of illegal immigration fourteen thousand people on their way a and I think it's very sad that there'll be motivated to buy these leftist activists in their own country maybe here the United states as well uh let's listen to President Trump\nMet ... is working with us there is a movement toward our country is a while before they get here\nAnd his ... his around the say no I'm involved and others will hand or we can not healthy for them into a failing\nRight now the Caribbean is about\nOne thousand miles away from the closest us border that would be in ... Texas and about twenty two hundred miles away from the border crossing it Tijuana shows President Trump said there's time to work with Mexico toured together or with Mexico this I think underscores the need\nFor increased border security and the wall\nIf you have the wall or you can add these situations and certainly you don't want\nFourteen thousand people at the wall you would still have to work on these types of caravans but it would be a big deterrent\nOr because you people would do what they would be up against would they reached the U.S a southern border take your phone calls one hundred sixty four thirty one to this one eight hundred six eight four thirty one to let me go to\nHenry Hudson Harry the idea here this goes to also national security it's not just a humanitarian issue that apartment of homeland security\nHas said that they in a tweet or from their spokesperson they can confirm I'm putting them that they're individuals within the caravan who who are gang members or have significant criminal histories citizen\nSide of Central America including the middle East Africa South Asia and elsewhere are currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S I mean that is from the department of homeland security doing their intelligence work to figure out who these people\nAre absolutely so broadly speaking the caravan is a challenge to the integrity of the U. S. borders it's a challenge to the rule of law I'm bought more directly with respect to some of these individuals who are in ban it in the care of and\nMany of those individuals are a direct\nThreat to US security or some of them are smugglers some of them are drug smugglers human trafficking smugglers et cetera and\nSome of them are perhaps harbor terrorists ambitions and so it would be difficult to look at a mass of fourteen thousand people say\nAnd then to separate out those who are legitimate a refugee claimants from those who wish to do us harm\nSo we should engage in a full throated a diplomatic effort particularly with Mexico and Honduras to stem the flow we must intervene before the caravan reaches our border\nIt's important to note as you indicated earlier joined that many of the individuals who are in the caravan\nA base don't seem to like the United states so why are they in the care of then why are they coming why are they ... or perhaps uh putting swastikas on American flags if they desperately our rent a one to be come refugee immigrants to the United states\nSo there are lots of questions out there\nUh yes we should enforce our law with compassion are but we should seek to intervene and stem the flow before it reaches our border\nOne eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tennis number to call if you want to talk to us on the air is John scholar ready in California on line three John welcome to Jay Sekulow alive you're certainly in a state where\nA a you deal with the illegal immigration on a daily basis and the the the care of and could be heading your way they haven't made that decision yet on which way to turn towards California or Texas or else they'll get that far but John thanks for calling you're on the air\nLike whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so ... ... ... ... ... culture at like ...\nWell let me play for you secretary said ... I think in the ... in the emergency kind of situation like this year could build a wall and this time period a you know there are a thousand miles away from our closest border it's it's it's that's not going to happen I agree Congress should have already\nPassed that I think the president agrees Congress should have already passed that so the construction could begin but take a listen to secretary of state\nMike Pompeo ate a clear message to all of those people in the care of and then I'll go to Andy to talk about really whose role in the U.S government this is at this point when you've got the caravan of fourteen thousand people heading our way take somebody called payout\nHe I'd say it's also has a message for those who are currently part of this caravan for any caravan which follows you will not be successful at getting into the United states illegally no matter what\nI repeat the care of and will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances if you have to come here\nGo through the normal refugee process if you apply for refugee status a permanent solution as possible in Mexico or at a third country but I can tell you what certainty we're determined that illegal entry into the United states from this caravan will not be possible\nBut there again I think this and he goes to the main point which is that\nAt this stage of the game this is the executive branch role because you've got to deal with a foreign country\nA Congress really doesn't have time to act they can't build a wall or they can authorize it but they can't build it up so if the outcomes up to the executive to work with yet another foreign power to prevent this group of individuals from reaching one of our southern border entry points\nYes that is correct your and it is an executive branch obligation responsibility right now Congress is out of session and they don't come back on November thirteenth after the elections\nWere were they when they shouldn't have been doing the this legislating about this they were a wall\nOr they were not doing their job they were not doing a the the functions of a legislative to cure so they left it to the executive branch and and that includes the statements that may or may by the secretary of state\nWho has a responsibility but also the department of homeland security which really has to protect our borders but ultimately the buck rests with the president of the United states\nThe commander in chief of the military the chief executive officer of the United states and the chief enforcer of such laws as they are that are ah extant right now so it is an executive branch\n[noise] let me go to Steve in Florida on line six sixties got a good point it relates back to the last time this happened in a pro Steve welcome to Jay Sekulow live you're on the air\n... do you today we're good Steve our military has your ability to put a temporary we're showing why don't we have the ability to do the same thing with walls with these people will be at over a thousand miles away and shoot it was set up\nI Believe we actually did that when it was a smaller group so back in April there were walls set up a to make sure that individuals and that was a much smaller number again that we're talking about uh about Fifteen hundred total ... ended up being about five hundred that made it to the wall\nBut there was a wall and place I I don't know if it was a temporary structure put there by the military\nOr certainly one that was reinforced hairy so yes you could Harry certainly have the time with a thousand miles out or twenty two hundred miles out depending on which border crossing a this group decides to go to or if they split up to go to different a border crossings there there are certainly times to reinforce specific areas of the border\nI think you're absolutely right Jordan ha it's important also to note that the border between the United states in Mexico is very very long yeah and so the U.S military or to the extent that they are able to put up temporary structures to impede a border crossings\nAre they will perhaps have to wait about in the sense to find out what direction or the caravan is going to take\nA but they're all still then be time to put up some temporary structures to impede the caravan from crossing into the United states but I also think we should focus um most of our efforts at the moment\nOn diplomatic ... a ... efforts with respect to Mexico um I think secretary of state pump pale according to CNN News has said that the caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances you know\nAnd so that is why I think again very important folks to ... this is a this is the executive branch issue right now\nCongress could certainly pass federal laws prevent this in the future but right now the executive has to deal with\nWhat they are dealing with we come back we'll take more your phone call second half hour one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten will update you on the suspicious device as well we condemn whoever or whomever is behind this for whatever reason they should be prosecuted the fullest extent of the law will be back

I Know all the news networks recovery right now so we're not going to adore it they're suspicious packages that have been intercepted uh that we're going to the hopes of President Obama\nA former President Bill Clinton and secretary of State Hillary Clinton uh George Soros I see it in water sitter and it appears even potentially in Florida to one of Debbie Wasserman Schultz is that Congress will but\nOne of her field offices and state offices in Florida it appears that there's certainly some kind of leak\nBetween the individual or individuals who put together a these are devices a steak fleet do what has been injured done of these devices has exploded a but there's still an active law enforcement investigation or going that appears to be leaked\nAll these devices do appear to be leaked we will continue to update you throughout our show today\nAs the news wards are the biggest issues is probably the ... in New York called Columbus Circle is evacuated that includes a what a seeded major hubs includes also a a major hotel the Mandarin Oriental shopping ... restaurants\nA a grocery store and other offices so that is significant than it is shut down such an important building an area in New York City the other issue is that we're focusing on the most take your calls about to analyze it is this caravan\nOf fourteen thousand a day that's what the estimate is fourteen thousand heading towards a U.S border coming down through Mexico\nA but had it been eating out of the Honduras a ... this is much larger than the care of it that was dealt with back in April which edits biggest point was Fifteen hundred we do their political motivations behind this caravan from the left\nOut of Central America specifically out of Honduras\nBe conservative president of Honduras has asked people to return\nAnd offered them assisted to help to get back on their feet ed does so they're doing the right thing but they don't have the power if these people back so we've got to work with Mexico before this ends up on our border or the estimates are there about a thousand miles away from the closest Porter a tree in Texas\nEnded a couple of thousand miles away from the border a tree in California we're going to take your phone calls on it now one eight hundred sixty four thirty ... I just called from Pennsylvania on line one I welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nA happy when\nThey have it\nLike this could be a couple of the first they would say in their own troops also provide some type of care provision for\nLimited responsibility and some of the coin going towards the U.S and this is the issue\nI think right now the U.S is doing reports that an estimating the numbers of people I don't ever it in fact Patsy on Facebook right wrote it will you try to get involved so she was taking the safety I uh\nI I think that what is troubling is that whether you would get involved or they will start telling everyone who has to take who ... off the numbers at city of refugee camps and I don't think that's the situation we want to be at right now I think this could be handled\nBy two major powers the United states and Mexico\nWho work side by side this is not good for Mexico the U.S could provide the support to make sure the Mexican authorities have the support is history to prevent this from causing more trouble in Mexico it ultimately trouble on our border in the United states to by the way we talk about\nWhat's happening towards our border we're talking about what's happening in Mexico that they're dealing with because until you cross over your in Mexico so this is they have a serious interest\nIt getting this situation under control but I don't believe that we would watch uh the UN or to be more involved\nIn this process at this point in time\nWhat do you have to four and a\nHours who could handle it who have the resources to handle the situation we will pay for your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four\nThirty one that's one eight hundred and\nSixty four three one zero we come back on the broadcasts will update you all these suspicious packages as well\nTo ACL jade out of work a lot of work going on and we'll be right back on Jay Sekulow alive\nI had a confession I Want to be eighty million people in the U.S suffer from ... instead of seeing a doctor for years I covered that many legs can live with the embarrassment and pain and ugly building Derek magazines sank painfully I heard about Bain clinics that America\nBy I'm Dr Robert where things incursion physician and pain clinics America main diseases more common than people realize and typically goes undiagnosed often recognized as embarrassing ... spider vein that left untreated can be debilitating and dangerous in that vein clinics of America we're specialists and that diagnosis and treatment the vein disease using\nMinimally invasive treatments main makes an American me back on my feet in about an hour and we're burning Fifteen or countering up if you suspect you may have been to the from home now to see if you qualify for free evaluation countered by most insurance including Medicare about eight hundred\nThree three one Ninety six Ninety think an eight hundred three to one Ninety six Ninety six eight hundred three three one Ninety six Ninety six\nExciting news please visit our new money matters with Ken ... location at Eighteen eighty five St James place we'd seven hundred in Houston near the Galleria had money matters we specialize and retirement planning our retirement specialists can help you plan for retirement income the best time to take Social Security strategies to help make your money last them more or two goals\nAre for our clients that financial peace of mind and they helped make their money last as long as possible find is that Eighteen eighty five St James place we'd seven hundred in Houston near the Galleria or visit on line that money matters dot net that's money matters dot map [noise]\nSan mo lo J.
