for the G O P listed a few weeks ago maybe\nBecause it was look he likes to say that could be in jeopardy listen we're twenty six days out something could change that's why we're going to keep doing these shows an update you are not every day but we will update you as we get closer and closer 'cause things do change\nOr that have an impact a few weeks ago it was like the Senate could be in jeopardy for Republicans right now it looks like the Senate um a is a is not that it is a pretty firmly in control of Republican series of factors talk of\nAdding more Republicans he told me they have it it's fifty one forty nine so any kind of positive ads would be good now it's still very tight margins ... six days out so take nothing for granted a because so much could happen so quickly in politics that being said because\nIt looks like the city is is we're relatively safe for now twenty six days out for Republicans are they really the victory would be I think than\nKid that could uh maintain control the house even if it's the slippers to march is I don't think I think keeping control the Senate um or should not be so overly celebrated a\n... it's it's it'd be great it's obviously important I think for conservatives are especially would nominations and things like that but it's really the house here at least twenty six days out\nYeah the Democrats chance in the Senate Jordan or a really long shot him and you're gonna have to pull off an upset in you know either Tennessee or Texas and then to sweep all of the contested races the Democrats are defending I mean if you just look at the wrong numbers of the three five seats up in the Senate Jordan\nTwenty six of them are held by Democrats in ten of them are in states that Donald Trump won so that's a very unfavorable math than I think the Republicans are going to control the Senate and I agree with you I think they're going to expand their majority there\nIn the house Jordan um I think all the pressure honestly is on the Democrats day they assumed they were gonna flip control of the house\nA historical data says that you would their bases animated because they don't like the president and by and large although I Would tell you in specific districts that is very much not true in seats that they need to win so I think they might be over selling\nA their advantage in that regard but look the pressure is on them because if if House Republicans can maintain even a one seat majority\nThat's not just a victory that is a huge a monumental victory for them and honestly the Democrat Party or the the ... and they would take place in that scenario during it's almost hard to describe the\nHere to me is what is most shocking is the vitriol going into this from our former\nCabinet members of the Obama administration and attorney general member that's that's the OJ were told not supposed to be partisan a everybody should be treated fairly and it's not really under even though it's part of the executive branch were told that really supposed to be independent of president shouldn't order the attorney general around\nTake it was the Eric Holder on the campaign trail in Georgia\nListen to the words he uses the former U.S attorney general who is supposed to be the ... was the top law enforcement official for the whole country not just for Democrats but he weaponize that deep the OJ these and that kind of language he uses once again take a listen they have\nTo use the powers that may have gotten\nAll the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in power they want to cater to special interests is time for us as Democrats [noise]\nGetting painted as they are I mean it is they are\nMichele always as we all over my wife like really hire a lawyer here\nWas selling says you know when they go low\n\nWe go low we can [noise]\n\nAnd that again folks where we've seen violence out of the campaign rallies you've seen the anti ... we've seen a again a Trump supporter of being attacked or you know they don't see this kind of violent language is good for either side but for the nation's top law enforcement official\nCouple of things in that statement want he criticizes the other side\nYou know conservatives Republicans I'm for a warning power for all the wrong things and the first thing he says they want to keep themselves to power\nReally think about that if you believe in the policies that you want to implement of course you need to remain in power\nBecause you can't implement the policies you believe in if you don't remain in power so this idea that they want to stay in power is somehow a bad thing\nNo that's a good thing if you are trying to implement your policies you have to stay in power if you lose you will not be able to implement your policies second kicking people uh again this idea that uh we're going to would they go low Republicans are that we are going to kick them\nI Know he's not probably say actually kick them additives you say get verbally so don't you know but again people here that differently than Eric Holder intended it especially coming from a top law enforcement official but saying to me it sets the tone and I'd love to hear from our\nCallers is well this idea that the attorneys for return Joe the United states is telling a tally Democrat activists to kick those are Republican activists or would they go low whatever that means and how they define that up and say that is tough tough rhetoric coming from our nation's a former top law enforcement official\n... it's tough and I would argue inappropriate door and given the political climate that we're in right now where threats of violence and actual violence have been taking place look I mean I'm Glad you made this distinction because our founders set up a way of government Jordan that was intended to have tension and you wanted to have ... and you needed to have power the\nIdea was that the best strongest ideas would prevail but what you see in that quote\nAnd I think one that you might be playing up it had many here is not I'm looking for ideas to prevail it's looking for the ... preservation of political power at any cost and using any form I Would say including forced to keep it Jordan that is not what our founders intended there should be tension\nBut it should be tension over ideas ways for a stronger government waste to advance the the American people and then at the end of the day coming together around those ideas Jordan or that sound from Eric Holder or it perpetuates um what I think is a dangerous atmosphere we hadn't society right now and quite frankly he should be ashamed for it\nAnd then it gets even more unique from Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton of course can't stop or getting a getting involved in politics take a listen to what she has said she former secretary of state for her first lady who lost the presidential election to Donald Trump take a listen\n... criminal with political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nThat ... can started down\nSo you can only be civil with people you disagree with if you get power back ah\nIn either the house the Senate Hillary Clinton or you can't be civil with on policy disagreements\nBecause the way you describe policy disagreements are destroying what you stand for and care about\n'em that's not very civil so the only way to get back to civility is to have the Democrats take the house or Senate 'cause they're really civil river Brett Kavanaugh's hearing\nReally civil people on that other side of the aisle let me tell you I mean let's let's let's just stop the this is politics it is tough but the language coming out as we can only be civil\nIf we get some power back is what Hillary Clinton said kick them is what Eric Holder said let's go to your phones one hundred sixty eight four thirty one tent and then I Want to contrast\nIs in fact let's contrast it now President Trump uses a lot of tough like which on the campaign trail he does and he's known forty tweets tough tough language as well he's passionate and and he speaks in a way that is unique or for any American president but listen to him last night this is at a rally\nIn Erie, Pennsylvania uh and and we talked about why he was there there are a number of\nA house seats there that are are either leading them like Pennsylvania seventeenth or or a Pennsylvania six Pennsylvania five out of open seats a toss up in Pennsylvania seven then Pennsylvania won Pennsylvania so I mean it in Pennsylvania sixteen so a lottery is for him to be an eerie Pennsylvania last they\nTake a listen to his writer\nFamilies here and what kind of country you want to leave for your children [noise]\nThis is Keith Keith ... Keith ... Keith I'm for a man [noise]\nI guess Hillary Clinton means that you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to\nUh that cares about your family values or the country you want to leave for your children keeping America safe strong proud and free\nUh and so that you can't be civil with that and Eric Holder believes you got to kick that down that message or that ... that's not civil I mean again this idea that if you disagree with the policies you must uh uh uh go to war not just in the political sense but in the individual Alex as well\nThan uh the end and and even in North Dakota treated very seriously because um if you could hold on to Tennessee and flip North Dakota that's a big went\nWell and I would say just one thing on each of those races Jordan first of all in North Dakota part of the reasons the races will run so rapidly towards Kevin Cramer is because of how few votes are cast there I mean you're talking about only three hundred thousand votes\nA state wide in that race or a league can open quickly it can also close quickly Jay ... or Jordan so you know the ... the adviser you would spend in that state can move a lot of votes in Tennessee I I really think Phil Bredesen got hurt very badly this week because while he did say that he would vote for cabinet if you were in the Senate he\nAlso got caught or some of his staff on under camera undercover video a door and saying that that was a ... that that was just a political statement and then if you were actually casting a vote he would oppose Brett Kavanaugh so look I think he did make a politically motivated statement on Brett Kavanaugh\nI think that video coming out really hurts him I think Marsha Blackburn was probably the political favors certainly going in any way I think he'll Britain is in a while he's run a good race joined I don't think he had a lot of margin for error and this was a pretty big hair are coming down the stretch\nAnd of course we're not getting into all the gubernatorial races out there Tennessee does have one of those where the Republican is far ahead in the polls for the Democrat so there's there's that also\nGoing that affects things certainly I mean all of this [noise] all these different if you got a governor on top if you've got to sit on top if you've got lots of\nA contested races in the house level driving different kinds of her now\nDepending on where you live we're going to take your phone call second half hour basically if you take a second half hour on politics don't always do this on this broadcast but today is that they were focusing one hundred percent on politics so give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we open to a couple of lines up\nAs we go through these important racist can the Republicans maintain control not just of the U.

J. also oversees the FBI\nBut take a listen to his political rhetoric from the campaign trail yesterday they have\nTo use the power that they have gotten\nFor all the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in that they want to cater to special interests is time for us the kinds of Democrats [noise]\nDedicated as they are to me as a minute is they are\nMichele always says all over my wife like really high when ...\nMichelle Williams says you know when they go low we\nGo low we can't [noise]\nI mean again he's talking to a Democrat audience but this idea of language like kick him and he had to go back to explain why didn't meet actually attack but we've actually seen people be attacked\nOver politics and and specifically a\nA more recently it's been the left attacking a conservatives physically with politics in politics should ever or we should be able to disagreed vehemently\nA run very tough campaigns against one another without resorting to any kind of violence or violence a rhetoric especially writers that generic just kick the you know and then Hillary Clinton\nShe describes what's necessary to get back to civilian politics it's it's pretty shocking which she were what she believes is required for Democrats to start acting simply get\nYou cannot be hitting all with political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nThat ... can start to ...\nSo you can't be civil with people I mean she says destroy what you care about but with people that are on the other side of the aisle who have\nPolicy differences from you you can't be civil you can only be civil if you're in power [noise]\nYou can only be so you're only civil when you are the ones making the rules [noise] that's what you should be so\nI think that it's just again that these messages are what put Democrats in trouble leading into mid term elections these kind of leader the Eric Holder's and Hillary Clinton should probably get off the campaign trail as a Democrat consulted that's what I Would advise get them off the campaign trail I'd stop these distractions is bad statements we come back [noise]\nYour phone calls one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenth as one eight hundred sixty eight four three two one zero OJ sexual alive we're prayed for all those who are affected by hurricane Michael were not ignoring that we do they're dealing with a lot [noise]\nI bet you people want to\nAsk might want to get away from me even after we gave her ... she would still say\n'cause your dog itch scratch stink or shit like crazy come to China for help\nAnd maybe I can see that [noise] that are cooked out front yard dog\nTry after we started really kind of gone\nTricia eight five nine four one K.
