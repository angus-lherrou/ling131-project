E. M. S.\nAnd you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance was sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind\nDo they're greedy and watched undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if you're a real estate or something like that so talk to your uh financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to on a bus\nOr

... here today to talk about why we struggle to lose weight and really we're talking about the core of this problem being high fructose corn syrup\nIn terms of being overweight being obese and the health problems that are created or because of that\nDr ... has been sharing with us a new formula that he's put together it's a weight loss formula called skinny is designed to help really kind of wean us from this the sugar or addiction that we have but do so in a in a very smart way\nSo Dr ... can you ... for my listeners that that might just be joining us um what's going on out there\nWere in a situation where the foods we eat are driving us to want more of the same foods ... most of them have high fructose corn syrup which is something our body just does not handle that changes the way our bodies metabolism works\nCauses your brain to want more food and it causes this vicious cycle of overeating becoming obese\nIn their research supports that and and what is some of that research well back around to Nineteen Ninety or Princeton did some studies what they did is they took a group of rats that we're able to eat as much food as they want it to\nOkay and they had another group of rats that eight just a small amount of high fructose corn syrup the high fructose corn syrup rats ended up with obesity and had all of the signs of metabolic syndrome which is basically what we're facing now\nFrom that standpoint maybe you can talk a little bit about how your skinny de formula than kind of break that cycle\nSkinny do you is scientifically developed and it's going to be proven to give the body\nNutrients that it needs to stop cravings and shut off the hormones that they're stopping the brain ... telling you your full mhm so natural formula and nutrients and nutrition is your best appetite suppressant and best advocate for weight\nLoss mhm now what if what if you don't have any way to lose\nSomething you could just use to get the nutrients that your body needs\nWill let me ask you this Christ you eat breakfast every day\nNo [laughter] but off he does that count that's the problem and most people don't eat breakfast they get up in the morning they have a cup of coffee\nAnd they might not eat again till noon and it's already a stress on the body just not eating overnight skinny D is the perfect solution it's a very quick very nutritionally packed concentrate mhm they can put in a bottle water walk out the door there's their breakfast\nAnd how long would you use this for is this something that you could just keep using I suggest you do [laughter] okay ... if we look at statistics a\nNinety two percent of dieters fail the cookie dies pre packaged meal dies they're not working so when we're talking about skinny de we found a successful option just stay with it and long term weight loss can definitely be achieved\n... what what do people tell you about their experience with your skinny de formula\nChris I gotta tell ya we get phone calls emails letters here's a letter we received from Jaycee said when I first started taking skinny dean my cholesterol was a little high\nI now have perfect lab results I have more energy than I ever had since

hundred eight one zero eight five five one or give it to one more time it's one eight hundred eight one zero eight five five one [noise] [noise] well\nWhat do you think folks I bet you never knew that high fructose corn syrup is in so many of our foods and that's really what's causing overeating but Dr ... has been telling us about this new way to effectively drop the weight through his formula called skinny de it's a male replacement is going to help you feel full it's going to help you deal with their cravings\nAnd then secondarily which I think is very unique is going to give you all of the nutrients that your body needs so that uh you're not starving yourself right yes\nStarvation as a stress on the body and it's very similar to what bears do when they hibernate silk bears try to slow down their metabolism yeah by hormonal changes and it's no different what happens is starvation programs and that is why the rebound effect is so dramatic\nPeople get off of these diets and they just look at foods and he's urging ways [laughter] that way you know this is true\nNow is that also why you kinda hit these plateau does\nYeah that's correct in in our research we did have Flatow's but they were very short lived Flatow's are inevitable and it's actually kind of the body resetting itself to have short Flatow's is really what makes the scientific breakthrough was skinny de ... was formulated\nTo work in a program that would minimize plateau and keep people losing weight and a nice steady fashion\nWow well I Want to talk about the studies in a minute but before we do that\nI took the liberty of going to the supermarket I picked up what would appear to be a similar meal replacement drink and it actually has a little seal on at the says for diabetics so if we do a comparison here in terms of this versus your skinny de formula what's different about these to\nGo first to just go ahead and start reading the ingredients\nOkay All right this as water than corn mall to Dexter and oh and what do you think that is a sense that has fruit those nearby and might be high fructose corn syrup or\nThere's a lot of uh interesting ways on labels that you can hide the actual ingredients\nThis is kinda scary right because this is for people with diabetes and yet you're putting sugar back in the body\nThat reading labels is confusing in marketing ploys out there saying a hundred percent natural but yet they're still full of Hi ... how can that be it gets very difficult to figure out what do I really eat\nReplacing meal whiskey needy and then try to choose foods that are more whole raw foods have results your body's do not defy physics if you eat that way you're going to get results it's plain and simple\nI Want to talk a little bit about the about the studies ... skinny de can we talk about some of the studies that were done\nYeah we did a few trials ... the most recent trial from the weight loss standpoint the average weight loss in two weeks was Eighteen point two pounds Eighteen point two pounds eight point seven pounds in the first Seventy two hours that we want average weight loss of participants\nHigh fructose corn syrup or high sugar content uh and wants to the same time get the nutrients in your body that your body needs is a great way to do that all in all skinny de will help you lose the weight and get the lean sexy look you deserve and I

course you can find us in use\nOn am Seventy the answer\nWelcome to the impacts used in the weekly public presentation of Salem Radio Houston focusing on people in issues affecting our community here's your host news and public affairs director Jay beat Richard\nPresident Donald Trump has said that it is a difficult time scary time for young men and the U.S\nI think the truth of that statement became apparent during the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle a man presumed guilty despite any corroborating evidence\nFortunately cooler heads prevail the Republican majority rejected allegations against judge Kavanaugh and he was confirmed\nBut he has some of the nation's most important people defending him\nBut what about other falsely accused men and especially you falsely accused boys it's\nA dangerous time for boys and men but it isn't just because of the threat of false accusations Dr Warren pharaoh is an expert on the plight of boys and young men in fact he's the chairman of the White House effort to create a White House counsel on boys and men and he's the author of the book the boy crisis why our boys are struggling and what we can do about it\nDr Warren pharaoh is joining us here now on impact Houston to elaborate and explain\nDr federal thank you so much for joining us we're glad to have you with us with a topic that I think it's going to be very important in people's minds now that we've seen what's happened in the confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S Senate does any of this surprise you to see what took place in that event\nIt didn't it was the way we treated it it was it was\nUm either she had to be totally Raul and making a false accusation or alternatively\nThat he had to have not done this and so that was a it was it he said she said that is what it what is people's reality I teach a couple of communication workshops all around the country and um when\nI finally get people to be able to listen to each other without becoming defensive\nThey feel so hurt that their their partner finally understands what they're saying and then I have to reverse roles and share the person who is listening who got it exactly the way they are the critical Senate finally speaks up and says his or her truth\nAnd his or her truth I have to prepare them I have to prepare him that he had like a light workshop after the fact that his the your partner is truth it's going to be very different picture it very for the truth they have\nHundreds we all have thousands of pieces of our parts of it as our history that we that we see things through and we remember ... ... it's ... it's only\nThree or four or five months separate a person talking about it and then after thirty six years you your memory select certain things that are that are traumatic for you\nAnd Rick crashes other things that make you feel that would make you feel like a dead person on the show and other times for other people it magnifies the things that would make them feel ashamed\nAnd re pressures the things that would make them feel good about themselves and so there's only one person or the other that was telling the truth\nI think it's it takes to a very um major flaw in our process of communication and of course reflects itself as well and Democrats sticking Republicans are all\nWrong and vice versa\n[noise] yeah I I think there's also exposes the way things are remembered a in a while I I think my I'm old enough now to do I look back at how family stories get changed over time and nobody's trying to\nEnhanced the story or make it better they're just telling the story the way they remember it and often times it's very different than the way other people remember of this is that this was actually\nThere there was a pill that she's going to be coming out that I saw a preview for last night called boy the race\nAnd boy he raised ... one of the ... sisters have a fairly large Family Guy\nAnd so they're all talking about their memories of their history which of course we've all heard it and they feel that we've gone to a memory of a mother a father and you see you know like if their family members talking about it you see pictures of that mother father\nAnd it and this is even within the framework of a funeral where you try to for a nice thing about a pressure if it really letting the whole gamut of experience with that person that you'll remember different experiences is I think we really have to start\nLooking at the two things with a capital experience one is it less work on um acknowledging people of different ways and he gave an incident and then secondly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jay Sekulow Live!", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
