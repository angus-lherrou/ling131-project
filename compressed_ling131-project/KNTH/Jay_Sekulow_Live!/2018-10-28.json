Am your host ...\n[noise]\nThat could jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states vary\nOn beyond and you know what buses right we want to help more people\nDo their retirement planning than anyone else that is our goal and uh so um because of that and we primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that is you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nAnd I ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven\nYear in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on them I gave it to my clients well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year okay and\nSo that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak can you play it I Know I\n\nWould say you\nKnow my ... may be\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed it take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education\nPaying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption a is a Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [noise]\n[laughter] ah almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon\nYour death and it goes to whoever um and they want it attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS has a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that\nThat would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid\nSo they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that\nBut they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can give to\nAnd as a married couple you can give thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd by the way if you exceed that Fifteen thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo sensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat and come mono thank God and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember bury the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are affirming that uh we uh we special we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon\nAnd so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website\nAnd when you're there you have a lot of options one is you can get my market alert email which I send out weekly and uh you can get that so\nWow that's really

alternative health we've been talking about how critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow Dr bring as I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've got to talk a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough item and see but you know the reality is that I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I I I'm not arguing that point\nBut the reality is that I'm Still standing I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here\nI mean has if the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to\nBe healthy when you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a deemed minus because they're already a for vitamin C is sixteen milligrams sixty military ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. it's like partially water and your grass and so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the writer mouse and the right form in order to get yourself\nInto a high level house but why why is that is so critical though why uh skating and not fight 'em and see so critical\nWhile just to recap number one your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least\nThree thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day ... vitamin C. you're going to be someone who was on multiple medications you run into doctors you're got blood pressure problems you don't make the good cholesterol your triglycerides are high you might be diagnosed with diabetes you have pain in your body you're looking at old and you're feeling old before you\nShould be All right well let's let's get into this a little bit then I I mean can you talk about what's in your supersede twenty two formula [noise]\nWell what I have is first of all it's a powder that you mix into cold water okay and each surveying is Fifteen hundred milligrams of vitamin C.\nOkay and it has twenty two different sources of vitamin C. which is very very important for your body what's the benefit of having those twenty two different sources or the benefit is is is that your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli to certain type of cherry call them\nDrill a cherry lemons lines grapefruit with the super see twenty two I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it in one form I see okay well speaking which can we can we make some yeah a lot of trial right here yeah okay All right now why why a powder instead of let's say a\nA pill or a capsule or something like that ... vitamin C. it's it's necessary to get it in your system not just in your blood but down to the tissues\nSo any powder and you put water in it it activates it absorbs quickly this is the best way to get in your body is ... is is most of his yeah the ... is showing that is activated the minerals and all the vitamins they're
