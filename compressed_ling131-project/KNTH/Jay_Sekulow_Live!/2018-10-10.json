L. J. [noise]\nWe decided\nTo stay away from domestic politics for a day and stay away from the Supreme Court and focus on the case\nAnd another Supreme Court and that's the Supreme Court or Pakistan that we've been involved in the American Center for law and justice for a long time we have an officer lower Pakistan and there was a case involving a Christian Woman named I see a baby\nAnd she has been charged and sentenced to death for blasphemy let me go first to skip past year senior counsel international expert bless me in every one of these cases we've been involved in skip there's always something like a blast recharge that's made or level\nAbsolutely and this is a a a charge that has leveled very often as a way of getting back as somebody so we have a situation where if you have an enmity to somebody especially a Christian which are second class citizens in Pakistan\nIf you have a route with them some argument very often they will alleged last may and blasphemy is a death penalty case if you're convicted blast but you're supposed to get the death penalty so what that does that intimidates people and they normally\nAre are so afraid of that that they will give the Muslims what they want so this is exactly the situation we're in countering here and let's remember this poor woman has been in jail since two thousand nine now twenty eight team so she's been in jail waiting for the appellate process for nine years\nCharged again would blast me for offering a cup of water to Muslim co workers the person that made the charge against ... was considered a prayer leader in mom from this particular village\nHe hasn't actually appear at the hearing and did not give evidence that cheap judge pointed that issue out I'm now these the pressure these judges are\nUnder our it's just a man's word answer your questions by the way\nUp you're on Facebook and parents could you could either calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten or get your comments in and we'll answer him or social media team is monitoring those right now we'll take your calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one zero let me go to Ben in her office in Washington DC we have raised this case Pakistan as an ally of the United states\nWhat's been the Washington response here\nWell this has been a multi year effort for us Jay both internationally in here domestically domestically the lead in this effort in the United States Congress is being led by Senator Rand Paul who has a resolution are called ... one of seven and demands Pakistan release to see a BBN reform is blasphemy laws\nUh Jay the important thing here about this resolution is a bipartisan nature Sen Paul has eight co sponsors on a\nFour of them are Democrats it and they really range across the spectrum Sen Cruz senator Baldwin Senator Durbin and senator Manchin has joined with him in that effort\nYou know all day we would love the United States Senate to move this piece or as a this resolution of course the United states can't in itself a mandate that Pakistan release her though that's why we've taken is the human rights council I knew we'll talk about that in a minute but here in Washington the tip of the spear is this resolution from Senator Rand Paul\nHere's what's interesting go back to the facts on this for a moment to share Harry R\nIt says one of the chief justice said the witness testimony did not state that she had used blasphemous language for the holy Koran he said no black to blasphemous words were used at all oh seeing her statement said that she could not even conceive of committing blast I mean that's what the lawyer said the chief justice seems was wondering where all this so called evidence was Jerry are\nRight and and and that's one of the most important thing that I think what happened today was the justices were looking for the evidence\nAnd the other side's attorney actually started when when he saw that the justices weren't convinced by the allegations he started courting the chronic versus\nAnd the justice is stopped him and he they told him they said look that we understand that that's the sanctity of the prophet is it is important but that's not what what's going on here we need evidence we're looking for evidence you have to prove that she's guilty of a crime\nSo it's interesting we got a a a Rosanna on Facebook by the way if you've got comments get 'em in her social media teams looking at those and we're taking your calls as well and eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten if you're if you're praying for a sea of baby let us know that pray for those judges to\nVery very important to pray for the judges involved in this having just sharing was high risk and the international community step in or is this really a Pakistani governing issues is Rosanna well they're they're both\n... there is international pressure being put on both are where you get to the un mom in a moment with a better who is are are designated representative to the United nations for the European Central injustice our European affiliate uh bought a international community pressure is the reason to see a bb is alive we have found it\nAnd time again with these cases professor Hutchinson that keeping international pressure up is what keeps these people live\nAbsolutely so international community pressure is absolutely necessary absolutely essential to maintain the life of a ... baby\nA it's clear beyond question that there are many people within the Pakistani community who are prepared to allow these blasphemy charges to go forward with out evidence as a way of course in the minority Christian population within their country\nAnd I think it's absolutely essential for westerners for some people from all over the world to mobilize against this effort if we are going to sustain a sea it'd be nice life and sustain the lives of Christians where ever they are throughout the world\n... let me ask you this is our international law expert here in the ... runs or international legal group give me your sense of the nature scope of the importance of his ... obviously we're fighting for this woman's life so you there's nothing more important but this blasphemy issue is a really serious problem on a global scale\nThere really is for instance even in Pakistan we have determined that when you can get a fair trial in Pakistan provide that the issue is not one of these very sensitive\nIssues like blasphemy so this is a problem we have to recall but twenty eleven the former governor of one of the states came out in support of I'll see a baby and he was assassinated because he just took the sand saying that she wasn't getting a fair trial so the pressure on the judges as amazing\nNow what they are what the international Islamic community though is concerned about is that this type of thing and bring discredit upon his law and I and I think they're as concerned about that as anything else and therefore the outside world needs to race and keep the pressure on\nSo that when you say this is not what you claim Islam to be\nBut look was we'd look and see what happens in Pakistan we said this law being misused and being applied primarily either as to to get a vendetta against somebody or to keep down the minority populations so we have to keep pressure on them so that uh her name is constantly\nUh before the government of Pakistan and before the court to Pakistan so they will operate in the correct way\nAs I said we're taking comments coming in from Facebooking periscope as well as your number of calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one and maybe on Facebook wrote this can the u._s. put pressure on Pakistan withholding international aid than\nA yes the answer is yes and we've asked for that on this case in a number of others Pakistan actually gay as one of the largest recipients of us\nAre foreign aid make human rights have have long been something to the United States Congress has done a poor job\nOf of of drawing money down on for Jay we have consistently said if you want to be an ally the United states human rights especially agree just violations like this one should be one of the criteria to continue seeing those dollars Jay we will make that request again next year we think that this should be something that should cause Pakistan a usa\nJerry I'm I'm getting a lot of people I'm looking at some of the Facebooking periscope feed is coming up before a lot of people saying they're going to pray for the judges let's skip mentioned that the governor that came out in favor of a ... a baby was assassinated once the pressure like on these judges\nWell just by looking at today's hearing there were a lot of Muslim clerics present in the court I just received an email from a from her office there in which a they have told me that\nA Pakistani Muslim group has released a video in which they have noticed this uh this hearing and they are saying that\nThey have these judges are are open to releasing her and and listening to even listening to the appeal was horrendous for them and they have released that video asking for death penalty for her and even against the judges or that they are very angry at the judges to even hear the appeal\nI don't know if we have the hash tag ... we do I want to show people what's going on on on the social media platforms right now or by Muslim radicals that are trying to make this case um they want to see the death penalty look take a look on on the screen I mean this is this tells you what's going on\nAnd uh let me hang around here is what that's called\nI mean they haven't started showing up on my feet over the weekend as we were starting to promote the case\nUh we've been involved in this case for many many years and I ... it's there's always been some of this but I think it's fair to say well it's never been at this this is the highest level of\nSocial media interaction coming out of it looks like Pakistan or certainly um they're they're using Arabic uh and sometimes in English sometimes appropriately the English sometimes not but clearly they're trying to make a point here so what\nA very important for stand out to utilize international as you said international lovers here can be very important\n[noise] well I think there's a reason to be frustrated in frankly those frustrations where the ... region to the United states officially left the human rights council we talked about this many times have you put the wrong members in the human rights council their effectiveness to officially stand in the way of actions like this is very much uh to the detriment so I thought the United states leaving was the right call there\nBut we as the ISI L. J. engaging through formal intervention sometimes they're written sometimes they're oral Jay is one of the blessed platforms that we have uncovered for keeping a case like this in in the in the visibility of the international community and look I I'm I'm at a ... if there wasn't visibility on this case I'm convinced you to see a needy would not be\nA law day you're going to say she'd be dead I mean ... professor ... she would be without an international attention that sense would have been executed\nAbsolutely so if you look at this from the context of the domestic\nPolitical atmosphere in Pakistan this would be an easy case for the justices in other words they could throw out the presumption of innocence they could throw out the rule of law because they're under intense pressure\nFrom ... clerics and activists or to execute someone for a crime she did not commit\nSo it's absolutely essential to maintain international political pressure so that the outcome of this case can be reversed\nIn her paper All right we've got thirty more minutes of this broadcast so if you want to stay with us we appreciate that on Facebook and prayers go you know how to do it you're listening on radio just go over to a C.

Ninety percent come that day you know like the relatively reddish yup I'm this is it important cases so the other ten percent they do take time but I don't it's not usually the time like here where it could be months and months and months from our Supreme Court\nThis this could happen at any moment there's probably a lot of security concerns that risk here there's geo political issues at risk here um and I get nervous because of what these judges face so I'm a what we saw before is is even like you get to this point and judges start leaving so you don't have a core um so you can have a verdict\nYou got to go through it again I get nervous about all of that because you know they're under sound like you're hearing one very well the hearings have gone well for her is that the judges have either been killed or have quit\nAnd ah and again I think that's ... that's a ... will get people more and more update on the news comes in and we're gonna we're gonna give you a full ... hour on that Mars that big of a case I Would prefer the judge is\nIn any situation I mean that's the only ... and even the prosecutors ah the government officials at the police um her attorneys as well of course her family but I Know you're doing that uh but but especially for those judges not not under the decision a but but on a their safety um even while they're\nUm they're deciding a because what we know the other side is that has tried to harass\nOr kill them before they got into a decision point\nSo the ...
