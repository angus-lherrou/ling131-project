the answer to\nThis is Larry Elder the great outdoors said from South central the prince of told union MSNBC host ... voted for Neil Gorsuch\nExcept she did each other's hashtags\nRadio for every member\nOn the next to Larry oh to show the Larry Elder show right before Jay Sekulow at age phone am ten Seventy the answer [laughter] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back to show them into instead of the answer\nIs you know the steward half of the sort of annoying habit of singing along with the music\nYes I Am annoyed habit it's terrible lifted an inspiring yeah it makes other people want to sing over me and makes other people are wondering what the rest of us have to say after you\nMangled up my main goal mango mangled the lyrics\nAre [laughter] only clear and we got I'm Glad it all\nI used to do the lyrics just hearing it once twice three pounds when I got to help you okay so you're going to explain yes same tournament in\nFive simple steps yes All right uh saint ship remains a holy one St Paul speaks of all the Christian Community as states okay we also set certain things aside to be wholly so\nYou know I'm a child has a a a plate that those things would be holy and that's the same as I say St just means wholly but for a person\nThere are unique people that we see who have lived lives of heroic virtue\n\nI mean just really you looked at him and and one of the one of the classics of our generation was mother Theresa okay she just everybody knew\nShe was going to be a site in fact we even pushed the Vatican two ... to take the five year plan out order and make it happen 'cause everybody knew a Pope John Paul the second or sometimes referred to as a John Paul the great\nUh and the bringing down of communism and and all the things that he was involved with but normally\nA local bishop investigates a candidates life and riding Zuma local area in the local area for what we would call it heroic virtue\nAnd if he sees this he writes up the documentation center to the Vatican the Vatican handed over to a committee we called committees congregation congregation for the cause of sites it's the committee ... to it and they evaluate the candidates life\nIf the panel approves they send it to the Holy Father and the pope proclaims that the candidate is venerable all that means is that his life is a good role model his or her life is simply a good role model\nVenerable alright\nThe next step towards what we would call sainthood is beatification which allows a person to be honored by a particular group or region got what was the word\nBe added to the out of ... like the only address to or does it right yeah the ... and that's for that says now this person\nHas been seen to be of such harrowing virtue that the people in El Salvador or\nWherever are raising this person up locally\nIt goes back to the local uh and then uh in order to be ... candidates it must be shown that the person is responsible for at least one miracle after his or her death\nWhich suggests to us that this person then if for lack of a better term has the ear\nOf God and what\nWhat would prove ever show that are indicates\nYou know somebody has to ... to the ... praise through that person to God right same please help me get what I Need and then it happened my child and then doctors confirming or or say no it was just a bad case of\nPepperoni pizza and it passed and everything was fine right but somebody has to say I prayed to God through\n... like Mother Teresa and it happened I asked Mother Teresa to leverage my prayers that's all we're asking the same as if I were um having some problems and I might call David and say David would you prefer ...\nOr I'm going to a a meeting tomorrow I really need some guidance rabbi would you pray for me that's all we're ... we're just ask\nThat said who is when it happens that it's the beatification because that begins to tell us that that person truly is in the mirror presence of God All right now we got to be out of ... so we've got a venerable\nBe outside and then we call them blessed third and then the next step is\nIn order for the candidates to be considered a site there must be proof of a second miracle after that person's death and it is at the proof of that second miracle\nThat we then have for the church positive proof that this person is in the near presence of God and you know to put it in in in terms that we would talk about in the community [noise]\nApparently has the ear of God but but the\nPoint that all of this makes is simply to validate that of all people vis perks and certainly would already be in heaven yes and you've got about three thousand sites\nThe church really didn't get in to proclaiming saints in this particular way till about the year eight hundred nine hundred\nBefore that they were raised up by the community who simply said this person lived and going back to that trauma you wrote a life of historic and heroic virtue a life that is worth in yeah lady and we believe that that kind of life\nBrings you into the mere presence of God so it was the local community that for lack of a better term\nMade them saying through gave them as liberal restaurant with exactly exactly\nAnd about three thousand think of all the all the Christians who have been alive in the last two thousand years three thousand is not a lot of sites I mean when when you put it in those terms and where and all of that is a term that I've heard they would use every memorial use called a devil's\nAdvocate okay it is no longer or it's not part of the process that the prior to I think it was Pope John Paul the second\nThere was a priest who was\nGiven the job of arguing against approve this was not true you know to argue against make to argue against it and that person was literally termed the devil's advocate right poker one who would speak on behalf of the devil or if the devil could be there\n\nSo yeah that's the process and and so again ... you know they're one point two billion Catholics around the world right now and only three thousand sites in two thousand years mhm that's not\nI suspect I'm taking a very unpopular position\nBut when which Churchill said we sleep at night because she kept guys do mean the people would do is harm I don't believe he was much different than the king\nOf Saudi Arabia who probably hill that individual within his embassy when the\nPresident and I are in the late ... when he invented the United\nStates or does that drones to kill someone any place in the world\nIs killing someone he ... he things enemy of the security of the country now they didn't have a big way pros don't do that they do it with a bomb or ... or mugging industry\nThere are there are more subtle ways to do it it was stupid thing they did but um I don't think on on a moral wherever it's no different than what is being done by countries all over the world all the time\nOK Howard what's the difference between Killeen murdering\nA very little I mean all night and there's one big difference right\nYou can even look it up killing is taking the life of someone who is a\nNot an innocent and murders considered taking the life of someone who is an innocent so for example if I Am in a war and your across the\nWay for me shooting at me you are clearly not an innocent you're part of the people trying to kill me so I Am only killing you when I Do it in self defense but if someone is in the store and I go in to Rob it\nThe person behind the counter as an innocent they're not trying to attack me they're just doing their job day to day work a day job and so that's considered murder murder and kill you know taking the life one is taking the life of an innocent the other one is not so and ... them and it becomes the problem becomes is\nWho's doing the defining who is being innocent in other words Saudi Arabia would say the person they wanted to kill was a spy and damaging Saudi Arabia where's the people against Saudi Arabia would say the person that killed was in fact an innocent and therefore it was murder\nAnd and the and I've and I've read that this guy had been warned multiple times to shut up about the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and and he refused to do it\nAnd uh he was a theoretical correspondent for the Washington Post living in the United states\nAnd how they how they worded it meant to the embassy I don't know\nIf I could have said we're going to give you a really good insight and the story in some story or something whatever right by but what they make an advantage of his ... a journalist\n... what they did with the Saudis did was dumb stupid public relations\nIt'll all settled down because he never cared about public relations\nWow yes and no they were making nice with the U.S we need them politically and to keep the price of oil and they need\nTo protect their their rear end from ... and ... Iran for which we have a definite it will do 'em there's that old expression in the intelligence world I don't care if he's if I buy God he's off a okay you know these things are and when the ... side\nTakes takes care of an arms deal or\nAfter he's been one stop selling those things and then he is taking care of in that one of the Arabic kingdoms uh what's that ... its defense for your nachos security one way or the other\nAnd I see your point and I think the difference is the prospect of used and much as I really\nReally really hate to a quota you know there's an old quote about somebody of terrorist\nOr a a a was a freedom fighter thank you freedom fighter terrorist okay well\nIf you if you continually kill innocents you're a terrorist\nAnd and ... today's\nHeroin is tomorrow's a parliamentary\nBook you know members of parliament are I don't think of\nThe Israeli I'm a member of your good and will have to jump off the ship loaded with ... because ... was destroying it and later with the prime minister of Israel\nAnd\nUm I'm not familiar with the story so I couldn't I couldn't\nEven remember who was the primary in you know I I think I think a part of the issue here ... step in and say we are talking about the the the law\nTo show the who is this ... shoddy re being living in America a contributor to the Washington Post have been missing for more than a week\nNow people are people think he's dead he's been was killed in the embassy\nThere in in in Istanbul and I think there's a difference between somebody who has known terrorist ties and and an editor who is reporting things that happened to be that'd be true but inconvenient to regime\nNow they can they can declare him you know ... percent that they can decide to do but that that's a very different kind of thing and the rest of the world is working on this point are we all go round killing journalists like the Washington\nPost or New York times because they happen to say things that are unstable to president how we operate a little differently it it is different when it's ... somebody that has actively been using violence against the threatening vouch as part of that that work I Do see a distinction there\nHow many journalists are also spies on the side or doing double duty duty for another country while they're posing as journalists as well that occurred throughout the second World War and it's a Kurd throughout the Cold War\n... idea how many but I Do remember there was someone who was a a TV game show host who claimed also be ... people's ...\n... I'm a ... that\nThat could show you could have been a a you know are working with the spot for another country I I don't know that I don't know the day that evidence just been put forward a all all that they claim is that you know he walked out of there he's fine uh but it's just nobody knows where he is at this point while he's\nThe soon to be dead and dying and and the way they did it is just stupid they could have done it in any new groove ways and the pros would know exactly what was done and by whom\nI'm so it was it was just stupid the way they handled it um but this kind of thing happens\nAll the time I had a someone who who had been working in the intelligence average Schmidt of a friendly government who said Howard if we read about it it's only a seven\nSo this kind of thing happens all the time I guess my biggest gripe is not that the Saudis did it but that they did it and they totally stupid way\nAnd now they got all the do gooders you know who are gonna be protesting about you know what happened in actually taking this very moral high ground it was not that by the way it was not that we\nTried to kill Castro in Italy screwed it up in New revolt time well I mean even\nOur president has has said you know this is this is outrageous this without landmark\nHe's got an election coming up he ... he has well Sammy Hi grant but do you do you think our president or the president before him ever ordered the killing of a suspected not approving excess affected terrorists\nTo know why we may have ... you know we will memory mega that clearly we will never know but if you had a laid back I'll bet I'd be willing to put heavy money that it was done and ... and we will never know about it to the book is written a hundred here at home\nAnd my response Howard is that if the person\nWhose life was taken let me put the beltway was in fact a a\nArms dealer known terrorist uh you know someone like that then I Would say I certainly hope the president before the president President really did do something like that\nI I ... that's my ... I guess my biggest gripe is that the way it was done stupid and by the way here's the thing to chew on within it and and I am amazed that the Turks have any audio of this going on this is Saudi\nRoyal government territory it is it is not Turkish government territory and how they got an audio I don't know and by the way I\nThink of it this way when the Iranians invaded the U.S counseling they declared war on the United states for America we are technically still at war with the Iranian\nGovernment for the way they behave yeah lady our embassy even Hitler and the Japanese did not do that\nRight because it would be ground upon which ... I'm Sorry a uh in the\nBecause you have with it it was the archbishop of of cargo light and so it ... the archbishop cardinal archbishop of Washington DC yeah ... and ... everything\nSeemed to be be okay until it got kinda got tangled up and the sexual abuse question not that he himself you know was accused of anything but that there are questions about how he handled the situation\nHow he handled a cardinal Theodore ... who was his predecessor and how he handled other situations\nUh in I'm In the I'm In the state of Pennsylvania when the attorney general went through and just went on a fishing trip from Nineteen fifty to the present in every Catholic diocese\nOr now I'm going to say something\nAnd they married Catholic priest I have two boys if anybody had messed with my boys I Would have been going to the gun safe and pulling out of my favorite Betsy\nBut let me say this\nAll of us who've been around the church for any length of time had had in our church or in our schools\nAsbestos asbestos met code in Nineteen sixty\nBut in Nineteen eighty Nineteen Ninety then we find out that is a horrible thing to use and to expose people to let's go back to Nineteen fifty in Nineteen sixty when it met building code\nSome of these bishops are getting caught up\nBecause they apparently handled situations\nAccording to conclude twenty five years ago and now you're\nNot talking about the perpetrators no I'm\nTalking about the bishop who had or or the the priest who was assisting the bishops who had oversight of these priests\nAnd there were there were times not too long ago when we believed psychologically that this person could get help this person could be rehabilitated the worst thing we could do is take his livelihood and his vocational wages that\nDid that did that\nAnd so we were working within those parameters now\nLet's fast forward to do two thousand and Eighteen and suddenly we're going no apparently there's more to this a lot of it we don't fully understand and we can under no circumstances\nAllow this person to continue to work in\nA sexually since two thousand and two when the biggest yes yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm going to do now that are changing yeah but I'm I'm Talking about\nThat asbestos thing yet met code Thirty years ago forty years ago it doesn't meet code today ... things change and all of a sudden people are getting caught caught in that bind I happen to know cardinal Wuerl and he is a delightful Christian gentleman\n... and that's where I'm going to stop\nStop anyway it's another another break while I chose to them ... years [laughter] so I'm sort of a yes there were\nGoing to be back with bills cold waters call after this\nHand Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to manage share where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical fails exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our panels\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure it's\nSo worth looking into there's a reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nAid for for forty one Bible that aid for for for one B.
