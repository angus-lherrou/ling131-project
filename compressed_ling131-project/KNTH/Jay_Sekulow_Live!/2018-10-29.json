seven\nSixty seven and that's the [laughter] and then went and that's going to college except adult and hop shirtless city are you what the San jose state called ... that you say Hofstra\nI was accepted as adults are and how short back in sixty nine by listening the army what the ... in California San jose state college I finished up in the southern Bible college here in Houston I kind of graduating got educated you know\nYou have one right contract ... is but anyway are a college graduate\nI Love that one oh anyway I was listening to father Mary on this really very interesting because it relates a lot of background in our family\nAnd the thing is when he was talking about you know like the word negro when they're talking in Cuba or remember there was a guy on the radio is talk of he was white man from Africa and he told the cook festering college liberal college\nThat he's an African American no you can't be an advocate you got any which he was China down ...\nThe other thing was cost and California Cosby California or where some all white guy one of the wet dreadlocks and so some gala so cut them off or you can't be work or what is this you know and then the other thing is my grandparents came ... ... and ... with that issue European actually you're not you\nKnow we're living in Brooklyn so that was a lot of stuff what he's talking about similarity of the culture and the climate other times and everything and I tell people you know especially people that are black and people out in the Jewish faith I said during the time of Hitler\nYou had Mac spare heavyweight champion could be not only not smelling but I also want to check on the ground from I'm\nA criminal ... an hour and then you have of course Jesse Owens right now and then of course Joe Lewis and said that's more that it's quite a statement and that's like [laughter] that would then those are especially when a when he knocked I knocked down I didn't I was before my time but I saw the ... by\nGetting on the champs down pretty well clear about ... about eleven twelve times of the first couple of rounds so but the thing is but when the culture said to be a lot of the political climate comes and what's your comment and of course the culture 'cause you know a ... it's gone from negro to color to a South African American\nYou know dogs over my head I am I'm very I'm I'm not against all political\nCorrectness I think that uh you know the language language sets a lot of reality\nA depending on on how what language for example right language is important when police use Trump's incorrect political that's actually the same well simply not dead yet to see I see I think it can be political correctness run amok exactly okay\nBut some amount of political correctness is is good like give you an example my little sister\nI had a little sister who died a years I mean when she was a baby\nWent out and she had um she had Down syndrome\nOkay\nNow you may be needing to tap me again a little window when my little sister I talked about my little sister we used to use the word retarded mhm now ... that was a normal work then Dan\n... but even today I struggle to preserve the what is the correct word to use and now there is that one\nCan use the millimeter challenge yeah but you can't like for example they were ... or people with Down syndrome were called ... and ...\nSo there's no specific word you can say mentally or developmentally challenged right but you can't make it any more specific right now is in general to general but\nBut again I think that that's a progress I think that's progress and a\nMember of the idiot savant they refer to yeah that's right that's right so so some amount of political correctness is good but not taken too extreme\nRight but just using the term political correctness unit of itself can be an extreme yeah how old you are going to say something\nI point out that sometimes the languages loaded yeah when I taught Sunday school several years ago and we were talking about this a little bit and\nSomebody said I said Indians so he said well Native Americans and I wasn't quite sure what to say so finally I thought about it and made the same ... Americans that took turn to them and said well what are you\n'cause every one of them was born here they're Native Americans if he appropriate the term for one specific set of people here in essence nine a whole other set was not true and\nThat's the whole struggle that were and I don't want to ... watch out you're not as liberal as you\nThink you are or that you claim I Am so\nI I just think it's important that we respect each other see that's what that's the whole etiquette yes cold manners it's called respect that's right\nAnd I don't have the political correctness you know the etiquette ... yeah but ... political remember I I can understand the word political as polish meaning acceptable within people right\nAnd that is that ... that is basically just to me I it's political when you take it excessively right that's that's what you don't have to enforce it yeah I tell you\nSomething about the idiot savant are um is that there was a one particular one they said it was the inspiration for the rain man but when you said this kid came peak\nThis guy was so William ... is ... it passed away here in the back of an Israeli ... very interesting the scenario and said you can't beat them show he can't correct themselves but he was at Cambridge University and answering questions like\nYour retention level like Ninety eight percent and he was he was telling them about all the different adults yeah dates and everything now that's not an idiot savant at all\nA\nWhen I myself in a hurry or does he\nKnow who's married to his mother his mother his mother but you can interpret any song anywhere you want to\nLet it be welcome back to a show of faith on infants Seventy answers\nSo Mario we have all Hallows eve coming up\nYes\nAnd at St cereals we are we have a ball\nAnd we do and you're one of these days you can look up and let me tell you smiling and tell you what we do because all Hallows eve it originated as a pagan holiday\nUm wings wings Sam ... yeah and the cats I Know champagne different than the when the Catholic Church began Christianized\nAnd Ireland what the Catholic Church normally dies is we don't go around and throw away everything that people the peak in customs and people have that's a problem with some of the are Protestant rather\nPay because they do not want anything that is of tainted with a pagan are really\nThe Catholic Church what we do is we go in and we leave the pagan\nUm ceremonies alone except that we infuse them with me and the other word for this cultural appropriation yes who we are good that\nWe are excellent so what we do is we went in\nAnd the established the feast of all things on them on the day of November first right so that the IV which is Sam Hain became the eve of all things and\nHow low as high low game how is he an as an even as an evening that's right and hollow means wholly right to be ... so how long how long haul so like when we say hallowed be thy name right okay so Hallows eve\nSo it's we transformed it into a Catholic now please understand that's not so weird your Christmas tree in December\nIs due to the Catholic Church transforming the German then German a secret trees and spirit what it's called I forgot but that's where it comes from well thanks so and by the way the year\nI'm is also Roman and what we use the year that we are right now is called the garage gory end calendar and you do know rings go under Mubarak Greg Harris direct Gregory\nRight [laughter] so anyway what we are doing is we're\nTaking we're taking at St Charles we're taking the whole Halloween and we're bringing it back now here's the Irish tradition in campaign and a little bit in the whole ... issue there is a ... average tradition that\nIn the darkness the day before the the the holy day of all seats in the darkness there was a membrane that divides the good from the evil and that it's especially poor is on the night\nAnd so they take their can come in and out evil spirits and so it started\nBy people giving candy that's like you said trick or treat mhm because they would give you candy to keep the evil ones away but okay so the whole point was to keep the evil ones that way and as soon as the morning came the saints came and\nAll the oval spirited away the daylight is owned by the same time is owned by track so\nWhat do we do October thirty first here's what we do you got to lose his hair we all the kids we have a mass and it's at seven o'clock and all the kids come either Greste is seen as angels or superheroes because the superheroes\nAre helpers of the angels and say it's a good guys and so every single kid gets I sort of plastic sword\nAt the very end of the mass all the kids come in and their costumes and at the very end of the mass we have screens in the front\nAnd we put an icon of St Michael the arcane to saint Michel the arcane journal has a sword and stepping on Satan and all the kids gather in front and I gather in front of them and I have a huge plastic I could so imagine you during those are\nAnd then all the kids raised their swords and there is a prayer to St Michael and we say the prayer together\nAnd as soon as a percentage from the back to the church\nThere was some of our volunteers\nThey can heavy black you know a sheets and they come in with microphones going\nAnd I turned around and I go\nOh the evil spirit tire yeah let us drive them back\nAnd all of the kids so hold me and we are and all that the the\nBeast or going around and they're falling back we have to hold onto the kids because the kids with one of them yeah I didn't want to really up to these volunteers were volunteers and whacking them with [laughter] so we have to hold against any way that the the all the guys go back words and we changed them into the ...\nAnd we build the jail and the kids get them into the jail and then as soon as that happens you're balloons go up and all of a sudden there's a carnival rides happening and all the little kids I get a little kids coming up through his\nFather we didn't we didn't we drove them back and then begin since ... where we have to go to a break ... article you've sent\nIs exactly what you do yeah it is it's ...
