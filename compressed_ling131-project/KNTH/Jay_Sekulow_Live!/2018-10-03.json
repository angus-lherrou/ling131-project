M Ms ... and uh the the client of a a sweat Nick missile ethnic declined uh Michael ... they come forward\nSo now you're saying that it's not just allegations of what's their sexual assault which will be serious and another ... obviously but now it's also a judicial temperament credibility did he make false statements under oath about his activities in college this is where I assume you're never going to get those that are opposed to his nomination\nOn board with him what you're trying here to do what the Republicans are trying to do is can they hold three senators flake\nBeing one of them a center Collins and Murkowski that is what they that's where the focus is right now yeah absolutely\nIt's you're talking about a handful of senators\nIf this is going to move forward that she was important um because it's either\nI think it's it very clear those those those handful vote over then I think you get ... maybe a couple of Democrats yeah or the nomination goes down\nAnd the question also would be is why we're talking about this let's be honest or will there ever be a vote\n'em or will the nomination should be pulled that's also a political calculation right now it appears I'll go to say a bit of Washington that it appears that we're heading towards the vote even if it's even if it's like the health care I compared to like that situation if they like the health care vote\nWhere um we didn't know until the late Senator John McCain voted where it was going I mean but they decided to have the vote and and uh and things change I Would imagine though unlike that than\nThis is somewhat different I Can't imagine a college or Murkowski not putting out their statement before they voted 'cause this is so serious\nWhere do you think they I think I think that's a great comparison to her and I think there are a bunch of senators and the Democrat side of the aisle probably senator Manchin center a high camp and senator Donnelly who don't want to take this vote so you know you have to ask the question to the very end whether or not it's called I agree with you and senator Collins and Murkowski Senator Flake as well by the way because remember before consideration\nAnd the committee he did put out a statement so I think they will make a statement one way or another\nBut I come back to this bottom line there's more information coming out the president supported more information coming out at the end of the day the constitution gives the Senate the duty to vote yes or a yes or no on a nominee I think they need to take that but you're going to have that information they should take\nThe vote well here's what but here's what I go back to I think this is you've seen this in three phases here Harry this is what I'm looking at you got three face in our first it was judicial philosophy\nThey couldn't really\nMake they disagreed with it those left of center but they knew that that was none of this qualifier right right so they met that didn't work then you had the late allegations regarding the sexual assaults serious they have a hearing on that reopen the hearing that's that space to of this I Would say and that goes and it made and it's kind of a drawl last week I mean was\nThere were allegations there's no credible cooperating evidence of that time but Senator Flake then says I Want the FBI to investigate the the FBI investigation men is the president now says should be a comprehensive now I'm starting to see\nIt's not so much and not that it's not about the allegations on sexual assault\nBut now it's about veracity under oath of what he did in college or didn't do in college and how we perceived as issues so now you're moving into what I call pace three of this and the problem is time in Washington is never you know the longer it goes the better it gets is not usually how Washington works absolutely knew lived up to northern Virginia for a long time you know\nThat absolutely so if you look at the latest round of attacks on judge candidate a judge Kavanaugh essentially they're grounded in his performance or the last week in defending himself and defending his family\nAnd so now some Democrats including professor Larry tribe are arguing that judge Kavanaugh has disqualified himself even if he were to be confirmed yeah why because he's attempt\nTo defend his family against arguably squirrel is attacked a and so uh Larry tribe argues judge ... justice cabinet if he's confirmed could not operate as a justice\nOf the United ... that's a face for attack yes his pay more for attack is if he gets in what can they do to cabin him whether it's\nYour course the recusing is completely after the justice there's no standard that the judge justice of the Supreme Court they decide if they should recuse or not not some panel not some judicial calm personal ethics charges but they're trying to cabinet this so they got this\nIt's a multi prong attack now with a strategy of what you gotta give 'em credit they're they're they're not they're not smart you know go ahead and you know I mean they're doing a great\nJob of doing what they set out to do and that's to resist because for Kavanaugh's nomination delay means defeat\nYeah yeah I Would just remind people that Elena Kagan came straight out of the Obama administration on to the Supreme Court and and did not recuse herself from the health care case say and so uh that you know and it was handled by her offices all a surgeon or for up to her it's up to her so they can they can complain all they want\nA but guess what if it's the highest court in the land ... you've lost your place um art that's it I mean there's nowhere else to go now I I Do think that I don't like to use the word I think that would be level five impeach if but they would have to have again they'd have to super majorities they're not there yet\nBut I think that the question is like for most Supreme Court justices even controversial let's say justice Kavanaugh is confirmed okay let's\nSay screw further they try to look this up for a little bit longer in two years from now like is this going to be what people are electing a president over when we have another presidential election are ... most people can't ... the Supreme Court a Supreme Court justice not alone pick them out of a group of pictures now\nThey might be able to pick Brett Kavanaugh for a few years but ask them for three years from now if they can question no probably not\nSo let me saying give us the ... under best case scenario what's the timeframe here which and the realistic timeframe or as well as you say what is the realistic it\nWell the the sentence debating an unrelated bill right now Jay and they cannot get off of that bill until tomorrow night so the earliest the leader McConnell could file cloture would be tomorrow night which would mean it would set a cloture vote for friday more down that we knew\nThat we are report by tonight\nWell by tomorrow night Marmara nights when they get down to the un other bill right so then you have to have the intervening day according to rule twenty two you get the cloture vote on friday morning and then you have to have that that thirty hours a debate that we all know about it would set up a final confirmation vote Jay for\nAs early as Saturday Night so friday morning for cloture Saturday Night for final confirmation that's really the fastest timeline you could have here\nIs a Saturday Night the earliest now and there and then Blumenthal is already saying delayed to like go ahead and take a phone call\nOne eight hundred sixty four thirty one time let's get some oh yeah right to the phones or we go ah Chris is calling from California on line three crystal welcome to chase you alive Microsoft's\nGuy left to help at all that and less low key guy thanks for my plan is since the president or any pet at Franklin that fit in to send ... ... go longer\nFor like second question is the judge Kaplan I had ... quite taken for and whether or not he get that the point that\nWell on the on the question on timeframe so the FBI's got at the president said he wants to return than a week they are capable of doing that and the bad and the resources to be able to do something that's not a criminal investigation oh they're not interview and and but they're not trying to recreate the crime scene there trying to find you know the truth here as to what allegations are there's no\nDoubt that the FBI has the capabilities I mean the the the person power is there they could get a agents out to do these leads and follow them up in a day I mean I've done I've I've handled FBI investigations in terms of supervising FBI agents and told him I Want you to go out and interview this witness and they come back with a three oh to the next day\n... former they write down there in in in court so that's number one number two records for judge Kavanaugh if confirmed no I mean he just goes on the bench and and rules and then that's it the beach not confirmed he goes back to the court of appeals although they do you put it behind them trying to trying to get him removed they'd have to have a super majority that I thought I was saying\nI don't see it doubled down on issues that people move past site again it's like it's like how we have some calls you're still say let's open up the investigation again yeah we hear that right and the truth is not happening too many people are not that focused they want a government that's moving forward and doing things proactively to help them\nRight to help the American economy to help the American military to help the American people business a an ad so this back looking ... sounds okay in the middle of it\nAnd I will tell you that if it doesn't happen I think there is a commitment inside the United States Senate to just delaying until the nominee is withdrawn and frankly I think that's an affront to the constitution\nYou think that as an ... do you think that's a possibility here\nYes it's a possibility but ... ... the scheduling to the voters up to one person and that's leader McConnell and I think\nHe knew we had that he sent over time you know we don't because we don't have culture\nWe don't you will know the answer to that tomorrow night Jay when the FAA builds finished leader McConnell files cloture tomorrow night I think\nYou can today well closer without vi investigation and I can play without the three oh Tucson beard\nHe could but I don't think he will but basically you need three days after finally cloture before\nYou hear about on them you can go right into next week yeah I mean look at it that I mean everything has to line up perfectly for this to go to be done this weight\nYou you're absolutely correct I mean that's really where we are at meantime of course the Democrats are coming up with more and more fresh allegations which may not necessarily be grounded in any fact [noise]\nAll right we're taking a break up you don't get to pull out of the program go over the ACL Jay dot org or any of our multiple social media platforms periscope Facebook we've got the TV version of the broadcast going there each and every day we knew it not just live radio we do a live TV program and there's a difference\nWe're taking were talking during those breaks or give me a special videos are there are team put together so there's a lot to do here we encourage your an ACL Jay dot org or Facebook or parents go right now if you're on Facebook with parents go encourage you to share it with your friends [noise] hey\nWith questions you might not but one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten that's eight hundred sixty four three one wandering don't forget support to work in the ACL J. A. C. L. J. God or vets a C. L. J. down or\n\nNow a matter of days before America decide who will run the country for the next two years Republicans have benefited from having a Republican in the White House was losing the house or Senate this\nCountry back to the left wing lunatics can you see this booming economy when do we need to keep up the jumps rules do we need and keep adding the rights judges to the high court\nDo we need to keep ISIS on the run this one he's too important to sit out am ten seven the answer\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie\nBut here's Rafael out of ...\nOn judge habit all hear all this law this week\nHere on this for\nCan now chief counsel for the American Center for Law Justice\nSo let me give you a sense of where it is a as we were in the second half hour of the broadcast I Am looking this thing now in phases and I this was a somebody I work on last night this morning but I think this is where it is\nPhase one of his a confirmation was judicial philosophy and he passed it reluctantly by the Democrats they're not going to vote for maybe a few on the floor will but he couldn't argue with a judicial philosophy is judicial capability his qualifications to be a judge that did not work then you get the last minute eleventh hour page two\nAttacks on allegations of sexual of salt it starts with Dr Ford ends up to others so you have faced too and that expands out ... to as ... all these other um\nAllegations against him so there are serious allegations they've got to be investigated president authorizes an FBI check after three Republican said no\nI'm we're not going to vote on him until you have a full episode vi investigation he authorizes they were his words president's word comprehensive a investigation for background that's background check not a criminal case that space to\nThen you're starting to see now I think we're in a phase three and pastries a little bit different they're not so much going to find it looks like cooperating evidence on the sexual assault or at least so far they haven't so what are they go to\nWhere their statements that judge Kavanaugh made under oath that maybe were false misconstrued basically a a what we would call it a thousand one violation if it was a federal case\nA false statement to me that's where it is their space three then there's a face for we're not at base for yet but we're clearly and phase three and delay his defeat I think that is what the economists said earlier and that fits right in with us in our area that I'm putting together and that's exactly where I think there's cases right now if I was looking at this is a lawyer in charge of this\nI Would say you're in the story\nAnd the way you respond to phrase pastry is get this FBI investigation over with\nRapidly put thoroughly making do what they the capabilities and vote yes or no if it's no it's no if the jets the jets get the process over with now dance telling me that he's up there right now dealing with the staff that it's not like it there is a chance it's this by friday but that's not a guaranteed by any stretch of anyone's imagination\nYeah in the sense that I'm getting it J is the Senate Republicans believe that Senate Democrats have as many phases if we want to call them that as they will allow them to have so I think leader McConnell has decided this is the last one senator tuned in Senator Flake made a deal for the FBI investigation and when that runs its course there will be a vote I Do think that's accurate Jay\nBut look if Senate Republicans decide not to to force it through and I think Senate Democrats will bring as many of these pages forward as they allow\nThem to get into pays for it I think pay for it becomes very difficult base for becomes not only it's it's ... it's a pile on that is what happens in pays for here it becomes a pile on an ... you know face so if the Republicans are trying to get the nominee confirmed and if they're willing to wait for the FBI investigates which is supposed to be done expeditiously get it done in both because we go to face for I don't see how this goes forward\nI think that's correct so it's important to know too much by one there is really only an audience of about five\nIndividual better I mean that's where I Am really important free moderate Republicans to moderate Democrats and I think\nAll five are wavering at this particular point and so if we go to space for a that may be enough uh two caused the collapse what are you an Amish\nPolitically here let's say I mean the FBI airport\nWill will come out of this was the deadline is friday the ... so that would trigger the time to have thirty hours and all this a procedure that must go on\nA that will be very telling itself it should be enough for us to know uh if the votes are going to be there or not I mean that that's it I mean they're they're either going to be there or not based off this um I don't believe there should be any more uh\nFBI investigation pass this of I don't think that there should be any more testimony [noise]\nUh there should not be more in the hearings or anything like that it is they gave it over to the FBI Congress\nAs usual punted to another branch got back to another branch get back to the executive is interesting because their role is advise and consent they think is so important but then they give it back the executive to really make a decision for them and and that is what\nWhat if the FBI presents nothing\nI think those those fighters have to vote yes on Capitol something they have\nA choice if I were going to find out soon enough now there's two issues anyone you expected\nAccent those two two and then by the close of business on Wednesday [noise] that's what I say\nIncluding your calls income is one hundred sixty four thirty went in and just
