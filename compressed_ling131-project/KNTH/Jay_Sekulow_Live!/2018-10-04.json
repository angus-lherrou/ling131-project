there are less than they do so actually qualified to take on that role\nIn certain sectors but that doesn't mean to say that we should stop that was encouraged people to get on with that but I don't think legislation is the way to go at this point I think it probably send the right signal a north there that we actually get\nPrecious that down the organization the only place because we can make a

there trying to make progress and especially in the initial services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress a\nLittle bit now more most recently but that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quote as you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender representation\nAnd so as a result I I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas thought what I Do think we need which is sort of what we're seeing here the pay is not\nBecause if there isn't some type of the pressure\nWith a perception that there are consequences on the back and you know I think the excuses for inaction running so it's really incumbent upon all too I think with that little bit of pressure\nKeeping a spotlight on the issue is that type of thing that hopefully in that light light people feel that the need to do and then once you actually start to get a more balanced representation just a little bit you get to the tipping point and then becomes organic and it's also selling so I Hope that that\nYou know what's going to happen in the near term without necessarily having to have that term number on the table that

[noise]\n\nSo let me read that this summer and buddy bays one was judicial philosophy\nThe normal things you're having a confirmation battle Harry that's the normal thing you have that took place here that was not successful in knocking him out as a nominee\nAbsolutely showed judge Kavanaugh handled himself extremely well during that face he was a diverse set of ... ... talking about uh he was before the United States Senate for thirty two hours at answering questions\nThere was a a follow up he answered Thirteen hundred written questions he met with each senator who is prepared to meet with him\nAnd so all of the senators if they were on us would agree that he is well qualified\nBut for his judicial philosophy\nAnd so then the dams were prepared to move into space to okay and so the men and I think they're I think they're in space to still but they're also into basically that's my exercise fully correct so they have in their back pocket a phase three and possibly a face for\nA while I'll tell you with pastry is in a moment faced to Andy was the allegations on sexual assault now the reports are right now that the FBI may well be done with the they're a background check today what does that mean to you what does it mean tell our audience what that means what's now happen if it is in fact\nThat if in fact it as soon as they have now taken all the leaves that they're going to take all the people that are going to end or inquire of\nAll the questions that they're going to ask and they have to ask those questions and they have committed them to riding in the form of forms three oh two wrapped it up and ready now by the end of today which is Wednesday ride to turn that over to the Senate to each of the senators\nOr who have the documents and then there's no doubt those are going to be leaked I don't have any doubt about that but the FBI should be concluded should have concluded ... background\nTo that space to sue assuming there's no credible cooperating evidence you you're in face to face the way we now are in face to rebuild Jordan without while you're prepared for it because they are prepared for it or not to be I mean if they if they want this fight or if they want to win this fight there to prepare for a test to move on in a different strategy they've already done that\nI'm their greatest hope would be subject to those reports it's safe to admit that it's over but it down but ... right now it doesn't appear to be the case I mean there has been leaked\nNothing is leaks that indicates that realm and here's what center Booker said 'cause I think tells you that they that they are moving to pay three because they I don't think they think that the FBI reports are going to be productive for trying to knock out judge Kavanaugh here you go\nPaul ... not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial to fulfill mentally [noise]\nHas questions the rain that we should not move on to another candidate\nIn that long list put together by the Heritage Foundation and the federal society move on to another candidate because ultimately the Supreme Court is not an entitlement [noise]\nJust because he went to jail or prison in your class entitle you to the Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is a sacred institution\nAnd the people that should be on it and whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy at all the people who should be on the Supreme Court [noise]\nTo preserve the integrity of the court [noise]\nAnd be beyond reproach all these different will parties and so\nThere you have phase one face to editing knowledge made that were in pastry fan I mean I and I know when it's pointing these phrases but I think it's true I think we are in pastry doesn't mean pay dues over but clearly we're I mean Cory Booker speaking for the Democratic base is saying we're in a story\nYou heard senator Booker admit essentially the scenario that you laid out Jay and look senator Booker was someone who is not going to vote for judge Kavanaugh he admits that to this day that his mind was made up\nOr from the beginning he says that he wanted to get more information from the hearings but you go through the judicial philosophy you go through the assault and I think that comment you just played from Senator Booker was essentially an admission that they were not able to derail him from that day I actually\nI don't think there's something that can come out of this report a on either of those first two pages that will keep judge cabin off the bench that's why they've shifted the target of but look Jordan alluded to this this is now at University of three people in my mind is it Senator Flake senator Collins and center mccaskey he gets two of those three boats he's going to be a justice if he doesn't Jay he won't be\nWe're going to go to the phones we wonder what you have to say would you want your comments on this one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tens of you're listening to us by radio give us a call it a hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you're following us on Facebook or Twitter Our TV get your comments and also that way\nUh in the comments sections on on Facebook or on periscope that's where our social media teams looking at those we do want to hear from us\nGo ahead and take a question coming in from Alan in in New York on line three Helen welcome to Jay Sekulow lifestyle and\nI think what's happening now to sixteen then I never seen before and I was wondering is there a way\nTo override this foolish Democratic Party\nJudge Kavanaugh I\nKnow you got it I mean the liberal look here's what the constitution says the president nominates\nLet me the advice and consent of the Senate so you have both branches or two of the branches of government involved selecting what will be the third branch of government the military so article one article to an article three all in play here but now if he did it mean procedurally than ... ... plus quickly review that procedurally what happens next\nSoon to report the FBI reports are done today what do they do to tonight\nThe first thing they will do is what it's called file cloture day it's just simply emotion from leader McConnell to start the end of the debate now there will be no voted that phase there has to be a day in between according to rule twenty two so two days after closer is filed which would be friday if it's filed today\nThey would take a cloture vote which requires fifty votes in the United States Senate after that and Jay there will be thirty hours of what's called post cloture debate and then there will be a final vote so ultimately he's got to clear those two votes likely on friday and Saturday both at a fifty vote threshold\nAnd Jay goes back to Jordan point about Merrick Garland I mean the constitution says the Senate can vote not vote they can do yes they can vote no uh but ultimately it's there is to decide their votes on friday and Saturday\nWho thing happened to George I I think uh I get it all\nComes down to how if the Republicans hold together or not I mean I don't I don't think it comes down to any Democrats\nI'm On the actual votes so do Republicans holes together um I I Do believe they will put out statements\nUm clarify mattress state was here and there but actual statements about how they vote 'em as it gets closer to that made me that they allow a vote on cloture but they they don't vote they don't vote for the nominee I'm I'm Talking about Republicans here\nSo it could be a twenty four hour period where um you could get passed cloture because there's there's some who believe that that's you should not it's trucked yeah and allow a vote and still don't know because it's out there that's passed the obstruction part but days\nIt's again I think you're talking to three or four people right now probably just three you know what I mean I I think it's a Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins a and a lesser somebody that bear port that causes the nomination that'd be withdrawn\nWhat would that be any if there was an allegation in the report how would that ... is what is this report look like\nThe report simply is a statement of the facts that the FBI's elicited from witnesses that pays a interviewed and they just said oh conclusions of no I said I talked to John Smith John Smith says I talk to Jane Doe she says she says she says this she denies this she admits this\nWhatever and it's a two three page document depending on how long remembered two agents there's always two agents who are going to be interviewing these particular persons and then they're going to just factually ... if it's done right if it's done right and if it's the FBI that I Know and I remember\nThat's the way they're going to do it and they're going to turn it over and you draw your own conclusions from the facts\nSo if that's the case yeah and there is no cooperating evidence of the sexual assault outlines the question then is\nIt most of the pastry which they're already at the judicial temperament issue that's the temperament issues that everybody's talking about that he was too angry that he was too hard that is that he was too partisan\nHe was attacked about a horrible thing there no then how was he supposed to react so what's your reaction to that\nWell I think Andy is correct I think the Republicans they have to steal themselves to the fact that they will face a fire store\nThey faced a firestorm initially with respect to judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy they faced a firestorm with respect to be alleged sexual misconduct\nNow they have to deal with allegations that judge Kavanaugh violated some ethical rules that he threw ice that he lacks judicial temperament\nAnd so the quintessential question becomes what will the Republicans stand up\nWill they fight back\nOr will they indeed have caused the B attacks are going to be unrelenting this is all part of a premeditated\nIntentional strategy on the part of the Democrats and the Republicans have to face the fact that those charges those allegations will indeed continue this will they stand up or will they not time will tell\nBut I think there's a face for the stand and met face for is let's assume you get through the the the ... temperament face it's going to be they're just trying to run the clock up where the guy out\nThat being said it is Republicans who will be responsible for his failure now I'm not saying it's every Republican personally I'm saying it is Republican senators\nWho have the majority it ... it would be Jeff Flake and what a ... and say what is he doing playing games because he's retired so he's trying to make a name for himself before he goes I mean if you weren't alone now they know me he's a weakling\nLet's face it he gave his Chris Coons gets in there for hours works on them in the Judiciary Committee he comes out folders Hansi sits back and he says a vote either get advance but there's got to be an investigation investigate and now there's an investigation it's as if we had to do we have that is their sound from Jeff Flake saying the part is an issue\nYou know I Want to play that if we have let's go ahead and play it\nI was I was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks interaction with the members was sharp and partisan and that concerns me that and I tell myself to give a little leeway\nBecause of what he's done through people were out\nAlleging that he was guilty of rape right I mean the people forget what they were asking Brett Kavanaugh than I mean and I mean he attempted rape\nNo they were always just planning to move on and you know Jay and during that hearing I I was miserable and none of those were you listen to what justice she's right yeah and you're listening what Senator Flake said I mean the defending himself go ahead [noise] [noise]\nWell I was just gonna say I was critical of Cory Booker and Kamala Harris for running for president during the hearing I look I think that's what Jeff lakes do and you just went to New Hampshire so you know we can criticize the political motives on both sides and I think all three of them day I think that's what they were doing five here's what we're doing we're here for another thirty minutes we're taking your calls one eight hundred\nSixty four thirty one day and so again Russia's we come back we're one line open and there were lines are going to open up so we're gonna get will do some calls even in the first segment coming back in the second half hour eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten

American history depressed played a pivotal role in gaining freedom and liberty sadly that rule has now become reversed today's press only promotes their chosen agenda\nIs called propaganda this is

secular\nSide so here we are in face I mean clearly phase three of the judicial confirmation\nProcess we are going to go right to our bones in a moment but let me just laid out very quickly put those just joining us phase one judicial philosophy that was the first here he's professor Hutchinson said there's a model say it again in a short way\nA concise way he he passed the judicial philosophy debt eventually disagreed\nWith us Ross somebody absolutely I mean it was clear beyond question that's why the Democrats were so prepared to move quickly to face to face three\nYes a face to was the sexual assault allegations and they were taken seriously and there was an FBI investigation or ... ... and ... and it was I ordered it now looks like it's being completed it may be even be done today let's quickly tell everybody what that's going to look like right now there is no leaks of any cooperating evidence\nThere isn't and that means it probably isn't any but we'll wait and we'll see what a what leaks there are the three oh two that does what happened but the that investigation simply was a further background investigation into the allegations made by these three women and perhaps others and it's a factual investigation made by\nThe agents who are in the field to agents interview each person and come back with a factual statement of what they find that out yet\nFace three which is where we are right now is the attack on judicial temperament Jordan that's where we are right now\nYeah and his personality I mean like his personality at the hearing 'em every minute cues of right now for ... what do you have you with\nRussian on judicial farm right this is just for Saturday after he gets accused of attempted rape and are these allegations that have no cooperation and these Republican senators are agreed to allow a doctor for it to come testify even though no one will will agree that uh even acknowledge the histories any bit of truth like even a bit of truth\nTo it or who was actually a president at the time or even someone who was a not even president but uh but around her at that time period um\nAnd yet they allowed this to happen he he lets them have it yep I'm\nAs usual the senators show they're very good at giving speeches they they're not prepared most are not prepared for responses they don't like being\nA they don't like toughness or they love to act tough enact right and they're nasty people they are nasty if I'm President Trump says that\nAh it it has a it's a real tone because it means something different to be\nA a meaner kind of obnoxious and nasty yeah I think a good ... to ... to put that up for like\nA ... or ... yeah they both have the tone that doesn't sound so obnoxious but they are meeting there at the end of their nasty yeah every questions or is it is so ... about the person uh recently tournament I think he kind of resolve those states he's more of a tough guy them um but\nHow tough are they where they get sort of going back at them they get off\nThe these are blue still senators they don't ever have real opposition to the\nAlright so than where are we on the timeframe and then we're gonna we're well get calls right after the break but where are we on the timeframe exactly what the what do we expect to happen I got word that there could be a boat Saturday I maybe I had a\nI think that's correct yeah I mean I think they're waiting for the FBI to turn over their report those three oh\nTwo one thing that has led I met happens today no cooperate evidence what happens\nI Believe leader McConnell will file cloture tonight which would set a vote cloture vote on friday probably late in the day and then a final vote on Saturday afternoon J I think that's the only thing they're waiting for I I don't think they know whether or not they have the votes but I think they are committed to study that clock in motion as soon as they have that a report from the FBI and that would be a cloture vote on friday and a final vote on\nSaturday So it's a yeah you're on a on Saturday in your view [noise]\nThat's right and I think it's important to point out we are joined it earlier that did that in most cases if you clear cloture vote you're fine on final I think because of the dynamics here I don't think that's true I think both of those votes or a hurdle what do you think any\nYeah I think are saying is right both of the boats are but I think it's going to clear cloture and if he loses it's going to be ... proved dude Republicans that did it to him not to Democrats\nYet do I I think it's just some ... Democrats will just be bonus votes if they come on board [noise] they're not going to be this way here it is Jeff like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski if there's a chance for parents having\nThat means he got passed this that the FBI Rick Perry [noise] Jordan's analysis spot on but I fear must be Republicans it mostly Republicans what does that mean and it's something\nThe time is it you know it's ... days skilled days to go All right we'll take your calls we come back from the break one eight hundred sixty four thirty one thing if you're watching on Facebook and bears go we've got a special video for years we always do it the same ... so we'll have that ready for you in just a moment but again a C.
