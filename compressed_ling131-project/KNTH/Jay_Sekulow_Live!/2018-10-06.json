nomination this will be the vote the up or down vote\nOn whether or not judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Kavanaugh you need fifty one votes the vice president came cast the fifty first vote if necessary there was concern that one Republican senator had a daughter's wedding to attend\nA tomorrow he is made clear a sitter days that he will fly back to Washington DC tomorrow evening if necessary to be the vote 'em to be that fifty or\nFifty first vote so that is no longer a a really a concern I let me say this before we get into kind of all of the what ifs as well\nI told you yesterday that and again they're not ... the Democrats they only had one ... defection Joe mansion all the rest including some who are facing very tough political battles\nIn states Donald Trump won and Republicans traditionally win state wide and um they ... all the ... decided to vote against cloture\nAnd let me read some of these comics that came out member of the word temperament I said listen for that from Democrats here senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota she's a no vote now she was one that used to be in that group of five to ... talks about always that were potential for a vote for judge Kavanaugh no longer and how\nShe says last Thursday's hearing called into question judge Kavanaugh's Kurt temperament she's voting no\nThe Washington Post editorial board which is no surprise opposing judge cabinet and calling for a no vote assets that his judgment and temperament would be in doubt the New York times just comes out and calls him a jerk seriously that's the term they use they call judge cabinet a jerk\nSenator Feinstein says that he's angry at aggression and and the aggression so talking about two permits she didn't use the word but Senator Schumer did\nQuestion the confidence to judge Kavanaugh has the temperament sitter Durban\nUm uh it's asked to be put on the ... how could you trust his temperament center Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama also a show your temperament it's becoming a judge and Senator Patrick Leahy a he has neither the judgment nor the temperament that is just a sample again\nAnd they're not going to let up on this folks I think that there seems to be made very clear to you that we have a time period here it's more than twenty four hours for like thirty hours where people like\nJeff Flake and Susan Collins um are are going to be under immense pressure as well as Joe mansion\nAh from both sides but especially the left right now who is flooding the offices in Washington DC and obviously did have an impact of Lisa Murkowski so they they it is said\nUm I think with the white Lisa Murkowski explained she was the only Republican vote no our culture that she decided that she was walking into the Senate chamber or right before we went on the air they had that vote\nThat are those protesters did have an impact so I don't think they can impact every senator I think that they probably don't have as much of an impact on someone like Joe Manchin of West Virginia especially with its Hollywood liberals protesting but they did on in Alaska Senator\nSenator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski now\nThe big question of today is what will Joe Manchin say what will um what will Susan Collins say she's already scheduled a press conference at will Jeff like say anything or do we go into tomorrow it it really still not have a clear indication that the votes are there for\nBrett Kavanaugh saying right before I get to the phones I just wanted to make it kind of clear to people you need fifty one votes\nUm he got that today to get to cloture if those votes held he would be confirmed without the need for the vice president he could lose one more and the vice president could be the fifty first so\nYeah that's where I joined in fact if everybody votes as they did today the way this would probably go down as the vote tally would probably actually be fifty to forty nine\nBecause Steve Danes will not have you back in Washington DC now now you're absolutely correct he said if his vote is needed he will fly back in time to cast it so if you play that hypothetical out say you did you know Jeff Flake or shooting colander Joe Manchin\nA flip to know the final tally when it is initially taken will probably be forty nine to fifty but they won't close that vote Jordan and then in that scenario you would see Steve Gaines get on a plane to come back from Montana and at the same time the vice president would have to make its way\nTo the Senate chamber so if everybody votes as they did today I expect it would be a fifty to forty nine confirmation and if you see the tally a sort of come to a closed at forty nine to fifty then it's going to be held held open for several hours to get the Danes backdoor and all\nI don't want to put words in the city college math but she's having this press conference which to me is unique because she she indicated one way by voting yes on culture I think she could have let that stand\nBut she decided to have a after do press conference that hypothetically you lose Susan Collins and if you assume that Lisa Murkowski's that's which you could vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample for you as well this is a good ... what company from Facebook you talked to us on air and one eight hundred six eight four thirty one to that is one eight hundred six eight for three one was zero uh uh which stood on Facebook I'm surprised that senator Joe's from Alabama voted no on culture\nThan Doug Jones just showed everybody that I used to it at Alabama senator and a Democrat or that he is he's got to be voting with the Democratic party a so long as he's a U.S Senate\nYeah he's been joined that for a while and I mean honestly he was never really in play on this one and he has not been on play on a lot of key pieces of legislation as well as on the nation's um\nYou know I I guess I Would read the political tea leaves on that a little bit maybe Doug Jones doesn't think he as much of a chance for reelection so he doesn't have to play uh today's in Alabama I'm not quite sure but I Would just I Would just say this I don't think this is the first indication from Doug Jones I think this is a pretty much more of the same of what you've been getting from him since he's been in town not\nI mean listen to him today on CNN bite Nineteen\nThere you go for Doug Jones is the temperament issue of his face three the question is is faced three\nSuccessful [noise] it's a question because the cloture vote was so close to that is just the vote to allow a final vote and just because you vote to allow it up or down vote not mean do you also we're going to vote affirmatively for nominee\nWe finish out of the first half hour that you should always allowing up\nI'm not but again this was fifty one forty nine\nWill be back for a second half hour on Jason king alive\nIsn't it time for the silent majority to stand up and be counted due to flee casting votes every couple of years and then quietly returning to their respective versions of normalcy is no longer in good enough\nPeople can just register their views the first Tuesday of every even numbered year and hope and it's going to make a difference [noise] concerned people need to speak their minds and fight for what they believe in every single day speak your mind here am ten Seventy the answer [noise]\nLive from\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow live\nOn this side of the age of fifty one knows are forty nine the notion that green [noise]\nAnd now your host\nTo Jay Sekulow live in our second half hour of the broadcast [noise]\nA lot of phone calls to get to but let me just jump to speeds people just joined us will do very quickly the full Senate took their first of two votes on judge Kavanaugh uh today it just happened just before he went on the air or the vote was fifty one to forty nine in favor of cloture on the Capitol domination that means the nomination moves forward\nA that was a vote to basically allow the final vote on whether judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Kavanaugh\nUm we don't have to really go through and read through the entire list because it ... it was pretty easy only one Republican voted against\nCulture that was Lisa Murkowski only ... Democrats voted for culture that was Joe mansion Lisa Murkowski is from a Republican from Alabama or from a Alaska and Joe Manchin is the Democrat from West Virginia\nWe're taking your phone calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one to the final vote\nIs likely tomorrow evening I mean that's was scheduled for a Jeff Flake voted yes if you're wondering that on culture he said he's likely a yes vote\n'em on the nomination unless something changes so he's left to caviar doubt there Susan college was a yes vote as well um she has a press conference scheduled for later today where it's reported\nThat she's going to announce how she will vote on the confirmation\nOr we can play up the stairs for you and we will throughout the second half hour the broadcast as say a bit of choice to be a from Washington DC but I Do want to get right to the phones people have already been hold on for a half hour a Andy calling from Missouri on line three Andy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nYes how are you doing today handy majority I'm enjoying your program where they got the whole hour here\nBut real quick my father my question regards if Kavanaugh is voted down tomorrow [laughter] of looking ahead to Monday morning I'm my thought is known Trump do you think he would just come right to the microphones Monday and say okay\nYou didn't like this ... pound living a woman to yeah to run for\nI think it was I think you know I don't want to think past this vote because I think judge Kavanaugh deserves to become justice Kevin Oh I Hope he does become justice Kavanaugh first family for him up for our country or is this will philosophy\nA and a and I so I ... for ... you know for those reasons that's my personal opinion so I don't really want to look past that\nUh but I Am also a political realist that this is a a nomination that have the balance could go either way at least X thirty hours certainly um we may do before that exactly um or how it may come down I don't think that the White House will take a long time in announcing if they had to\nBut uh again I don't think we ought to be totally go there yet I'm sure that they are prepared because there could be more vacant they're already preparing for potential for more vacancies on the Supreme Court during the Trump presidency during the first term even potentially so they're ready are always with a ... they have to be\nA things happen um and so because of that they're they are always ready their lifetime appointments but no one does again I'm sometimes justice retire sometimes they pass away while they're still serving and sometimes that's unexpectedly like in the case of of justice\nScalia one hundred sixty four thirty one Ted we do have a couple of lives that we just got open by taking some phone calls early in the second half hour if you want to talk to us on the air one eight hundred sixty eight for three one zero that's one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenth fan um\n[noise] we have a press conference coming out from Susan Collins we're waiting to see if Joe mansion issues that he kind of statement\nI'm a people can follow me on Twitter for that I Will be you know I I did was that tweeting on the here you could probably the allegations that make you save us about that I Am on the come down to a political vote to things like that if it doesn't happen while we're on the air it's certainly the final vote it will happen tomorrow but they\nJust briefly we go to this break\nHow confident should cabinet supporters be right now [noise]\nOh I think they got what they want it today Jordan I mean it was the third or fourth votes he needed on the floor of the Senate I think they'll feel a lot better after Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins go down to the floor as part of this final debate and announced their position assuming it's a yes\nOr but look I think he set it up right I mean this is a margin that really hang on one Republican right now because of one Republican were to flip Jordan or then it all hangs on a Democrat and I don't think a judge Kavanaugh supporters would feel comfortable in that scenario\nFolks we will continue to take your phone calls we come back
