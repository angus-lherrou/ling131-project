Pennsylvania\nAnd you may know a Christian Adams ... been fighting butter fried and I was a um cold watcher for years and the voting ride happens inside the election polling area and not outside so I'm just encouraging you to all your listeners know that\nThey should be asking the deal pie or what or one of their favorite candidate she'll get them trained can be inside poll watcher\nI think so many things I I I I was at one polling area and um it was seven o'clock in the morning twenty five after second one of my poll watchers and this is during the Bush Cheney\nOn election when I trained over three hundred and sixty five poll watchers and we showed up and we were in our county first time and she called me she just to get anything um these white porn sites have all come over and the\nAnd I went over and they were came to the address bar which you could do if you live in the same voting area but you just moved three straight away or whatever well I asked the gum and if I could see them and and she said I said with their names in the book and then they went on the machine she couldn't now that they weren't in the book that he told them to fill out this white\nPiece of paper so when I look at these like pieces of paper\nThey had first name ... a street name now house number they were all in completely fill it out and I said to the judge of election that I mean people heal these out incorrectly and he said oh I didn't notice and I said they they weren't on in your book and you let them go on the machine and he said well that's because they said they change their after I was just\nLetting them till this out and that\nWas in the morning and the same thing happened at another fire hall election going area at night and I found about twenty five twenty seven of those there is so what really encouraging people to do please I'm begging you go to your favorite candidate go to the G O P although they don't like it because it takes more work for them\nBut just say I want to get trained on how to be a poll watcher I Want to pull out your certificate and go to the most challenging area and take another person with you we have to watch what's going on that's the

Gillum response he's like this is the time to come together and we're in a state of emergency we've got a rally around because people in our state are hurting and\nIn those poll numbers that you're showing that in that response from him that might theme me that might seem turn the other cheek at a time when everyone's throwing hurling brick bats at each other I think\nIt's resonating with people people are tired of all the fighting of all the arrangements for horns they want someone who appeals to appeal to their better natures but who also makes it clear that they're that they're not going to back down from a challenge\nAnd they're willing to go in and do the work to help people in the shape because how many times can people go to the polls vote for someone and then nothing changes\nAnd that's been Andrew Gillum to monitor a\nFollow along when he was nowhere in the polls and where he is four points ahead in the polls\nSo you know we've got twenty we've got twenty four days have got twenty four days and I think you know the more that Republicans her all the kitchen sink at someone like Andrew Gillum and other Democrats across the country I think people are going to see what they're up to and it'll ... for them what that state\nSo that's Jonathan Capehart London for the Washington Post or Florida or Republicans are running a quote overtly racial campaign against Gillum here's another pundits saying that the Republicans are trying to turn the Florida governor race into a race war\nQuote it is and I think the Republican campaign the racist Republican campaign speaks to that out as Cornell talked about\nA unless they make this from this campaign if you will on racial terms unless they turned it into a race war we've seen Andrew Gillum over and over again refused to take the bait he's running a unifying campaign turn it into a race war and talking about what he wants to do for all of the people the state of one\nIn the ... mold democratic candidate is refusing to take the bait like when a his opponent Rhonda Sanders use the term monkey and rather than say was just a regular expression that people use he went\nWell I I I I'm\nAn implied was racial me my\nOrder while the Republican Party and his Republican opponent Rhonda Santa's continue to try and bring this out why\nIt's very simple please explain if the white electorate in Florida yeah goes eighty twenty four yeah we're on dissent this and they can make this race and defined it always disgusting racial jokes that they're trying to unfortunately that will be enough to win however\nDisgusting racial tropes\nFor if they can keep those margins down we know people will call we're going to turn out in much higher numbers because they're in St excited and enthused by the given Canada said so that's not going to be an issue or concern on the Democratic side\nBut I I thought there was voter suppression here you are saying the minority vote turnout is going to be large\nHigh but but I I thought they were being suppressed\nFive but if the Republicans can make this a race war which is what they're trying to do not so subtly then I think not even subtle\nThat their calculus for how they win this election but it's reprehensible and I think the voters of the state of Florida of all colors need to ask themselves are we going to fall for these cheap tactics that not only undermined our campaign system they undermine our democracy joy that's the central question people need to ask themselves going into this election\nChris Matthews just conceded\nThat most white vote for somebody if they think he's a racist why that would any politician with an art you two points above plant life run a campaign\nThat's racist here's what a pundit riding right for roll call said\nI don't want to go back to that went in to the women's vote because I just I think it's critical that we you know we we always talk about the fact\nThat there is a gender gap in elections and that whoever is going to be elected to office and it's typically determined by the women's vote but I have to say I I I Am very pessimistic about what we will see happen with the white women vote in terms of whether they're going to got Republican or Democrat and and I would remind the audience\nThat for it not for the vote of black women and women of color Roy and Roy Moore a more would have been elected in Alabama I'm despite very credible charges um that indicated that he can get had engaged and pedophilia 'em and went back I think a racket Traister I Believe on has a new book out one of the things that she talks about\nAs a white woman is that the belief that white women have always gain power to the park some all I'm a ... pack Seventy that they have to white males to their husbands and they vote in the family that their husband do because they always end somehow favors them and help that led to that\nAnd another one they're completely ridiculous out and saying this because\nYou know lying on a cell phone biggest hangs on ... and then I thought it was terrible it is a lot of Democrats that a problem with settling in Islam and then it's really a tour white

about particular it's very unusual for somebody to basically\nGrow up in a place he was born in Seattle his father was one of the chief librarians at University of Washington\nAnd he grew up here and he came back here and he said just an enormous impact on the city almost all of it very very positive it could have been more positive one of the things that I first admired about Paul Allen is he was pushing a plan called the Seattle commons\nWhich would have been a terrific sixty one acre park right in the middle of the city where it would have replaced\nAnd a a bunch of warehouses in a very fairly rundown area of town with a great green space coming back from lake union\nAnd uh and then that would have been surrounded by housing buildings and office buildings in any event it was turned down in a city vote a right the same year that we we arrived we moved to Seattle city vote was incredibly close and\nBut it was turned down and so now there are lots and lots of office buildings in that same area many of them by the way developed by Paul Allen's company Vulcan\nBut he built the museum of popular culture which used to be called the experience to music project he was a huge fan of Jimmy hendrix who was a Seattle boy\nAnd he wanted to commemorate Jimi Hendrix originally then is developing this big museum with a controversy old building by Frank Gehry some people hate the architecture's others love it he um owns a Portland TrailBlazers down in Portland and the Seattle Seahawks\nHe developed the Allen Institute for brain science and the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence he also has this other very cool museum it's called the flying heritage in combat armor museum\nWhich is a collection of vintage military aircraft tanks and other military hardware yes a living computer museum that he built the the point about this is that so many people have the idea of why don't we take more money away from rich people Paul Allen had more money than he needed and the answer\nThe energy and the creativity and the love with which he spends his money\nWas a a true factor\nOf the the success that he had with these various projects and most of them were quite successful and they made a difference the notion that the government could have spent\nThis money better than Paul Allen\nI think is fallacious he should rest in peace his sister and his other

Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they wait in line a long time to go to the local clinic and they'll get taken

don't think anything could could could match the devastation and uh as far as the left is concerned about the election of Donald Trump's but this will be close if the Democrats don't get the house it's going to be close to election night back in twenty sixteen\nYet that isn't it only will raise the stakes support for twenty twenty but it may very well and that will safely get at least one more

five or ... or a completely different story to have six or eight\nMhm or the house the Senate\nAnd defend it I think a number of races that looked to be very close for hanging in the balance out to

of courts\nAnd the main thing for a while because we're like the ...\nI think if the public and starting out it's going to be a very good November\nMy guess is the ... the death of a nation available right now and digital HD didn't ask this may sound like a bizarre question a Donald Trump has called people all sorts of names he's called a Robert De Niro low IQ Maxine Waters low IQ\nLie in bed or Pocahontas and on and on and on why hasn't the left come up with a name for him\nI think well they have and I think part of the problem with calling him name is that they think the bottom was awful and I mean I think when the left came up with Stormy Daniels they thought they had they thought they had him because they thought here he's a Republican\nThe Republican base is never going to put up with anything like that the Republicans thought cost and they're drawing out the law lives in ... I think their own and they weren't very confident that what happened to catch up with the law the motive throughout straws ... like what else is that\nA man and then the mark or word in the face of the kind of attack\nThat would normally then Republican going for cover it puts them in a category of his own\nBut ...
