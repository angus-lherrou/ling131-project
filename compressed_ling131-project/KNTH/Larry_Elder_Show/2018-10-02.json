and GE triple a nine to one Seventy four three Larry over here will effect the dotcom studio next segment and talked to attorney Larry claiming claiming the founder of dish will watch I think he's representing virtually every one of the accusers of Bill Clinton except for one [noise]\nHe\nConducted a number of deposition [noise] and he knows all about the role that George Clinton novelist played in helping to orchestrate the so called nuts or slug strategy that was used to malign women like dinner for flowers was called a saloon singer Paula Jones drag hundred dollar through a trailer park no telling what you're going to get [noise]\n\nWhen he'd have Broderick to alleges she was raped by Bill Clinton in two weeks after the alleged rape [noise] was threatened by Hillary we're going to talk to Larry claiming about the role that Mr Clinton off let's play because\nOf the sanctimonious way he interviewed Sarah Sanders and Sarah Sanders had the grace not to bring up his behavior during the Clinton years\nAt West let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations determined his entire\nScene though that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly and the kids when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one Brett Kavanaugh is accused the president consistently every single time takes the side of the man you\nKnow it's interesting that you say that it's a lot of Democrats that like to ignore Keith Ellison and Cory Booker they love to fight and champion women until they disagree with the al ... Frank and lost his job in the Senate\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr putting up the behavior back in Nineteen Ninety two let's revisit\nThat government Clinton has a character problem but I take it that you're allowed to play and has okay reliable cataract has its own well let me he is\nNot denied that he has engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he has talked about the draft and to some people it's a character brother bill\nClinton's passes character tests throughout his life and throughout this campaign and he's still senators commitments to real fights and what are you from doing this campaign is focused on the reporting to the American people on the giants and the education that's what the American people care about they want to move into the future they don't want to be diverted by side issues they're not going to let the Republican attack machine divert\nThat was then and this is now\nAnd a number of other Democrats should have that same type of thing what the president is saying that question every single time the president is taking the side of the man against women accusers trip\nIsn't that an amazingly annoying can we go back again Nineteen Ninety two George Clinton apple is\nWhat is named interest I can say effects with names addresses phone numbers of an affair with\nThis is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that Bill Clinton had an affair\nIt wouldn't make a true it is completely [noise]\nIf he went on the radio\nAnd I said the bill Clinton is the part of it as a child would be laughed at they would think the crate I guarantee you if you do this [noise] you never were in that way and\nNow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what is a reporter doing working in democratic politics\nI guarantee you if you do this [noise] you never were held back again\nSo you were threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\nThing you don't want to or not they are matters you'll be embarrassing for the national [noise] people will think nobody will believe you\nThis is again George went novelist Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton Governor Bill Clinton\nPeople think is [noise]\nWe went to the alternative is they don't do it cause any contemporary have people who tomorrow I'm going to matter and you have a campaign that understands on a difficult time [noise] um did something right\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence for ... the other individual stories and there's been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talked about the brake having all that they know\nAnd they're confident that these things didn't happen final question when is the president ...\nAll right Julie sweating it because the one who claims she observed Kevin are participating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she says she herself as he was victimized but can't say whether or not a Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened what says you're comfortable telling us what happened to me is probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen to any human day my body was violated [noise]\nMy soul is broken or by with not able to have somebody stop and I said no stop [noise]\nYou know I felt like somebody took me and basically said you're worthless there's\nNothing to us you are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes torn\nDifferent rock show um I was touched it everywhere or I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault Taiwan then it was horrible I had no way to send them off\nWe know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people which by Catholic [noise]\nI cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before this happened to me at that party I saw that catalog there I saw\nMark judge there and they were hanging about the area where I started to feel disoriented and we're the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing I can share them laughing and laugh at\nThe very hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody said something because if Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world that he should get scot free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court he just I\nJust think about ... if he does I there's no justice in the world\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door\nOr ... or the punch container is I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yes\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others\nTo cause and girls to become a knee bread and disoriented so they could then be gang raped in aside rumor bedroom by train as numerous boys I have a fair recollection has seen boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room these boys\nIncluded mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat did she say for you to say well I tell what happened and he happened to me I didn't put two and two together\nBut I Would see boys standing outside of the rooms congregated together sort of like a gauntlet and I didn't know what was occurring that I Would pay them laughing a lot of laughing I'm falling in line outside or wind definitely huddled by doors and I didn't understand\nWhat it could possibly be and and your declaration you describe Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge standing outside seen them stand outside the door\nYes with other voice senior suggesting that in hindsight you think he was involved in his behavior I Would say yeah I I it's just too coincidental\nNow here's what NBC's Kate Snow said about the things that's what makes it on camera there were different from her written statement\nWhat we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story\nOur reporting we want to be very transparent kind of things are very serious allegations Kavanaugh has\nCalled Julie sweating story nonsense and as far as the president today questioned\nHer credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her claim there\nAre things that she told us on camera that differ from her written statement as we've been trying to independently to reach out to anyone who are intending parties with two is sweating again Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names\nSo far we've not found anyone who numbers that she's also unclear about when she first decided\nOh hey well as just Tuesday we have a whole week we come back Larry claiming what role did George putting up with play in the lining the shooters of Bill Clinton and how very effective only has right now I'm going to be town\nAll coming\nOn ABC's This week called me up and he asked me about an office whether he had been found to live and I said Sam how could you leave this going on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know he's a multi millionaire he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels so it'd be bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a stepping up all is under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell he had a very good memory the memory you know the the favorite phrase with the Clinton people was\nI have no specific regular recollection means I remember something I Can't remember now on the front of the ... justice so no he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to glide Angelo\nWell given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary\nWhere in that book he admitted to working with a record attempt to address\nFalse allegations by your accusers but Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented in ironically wary if today's world from the left has judges who are out of control\nDenying an allegation is enough to say that you think someone in fact the correct It's got to lawsuits right now because he denied that he sexually harassed any women\nHe's probably left his judgment allowed to go for her forward in time for change and we now are and what can affect the civil war between left and right\nAnd these judges are furthering the civil war\nWere claiming as the founder judicial watch and freedom watch Larry I was having a conversation the other day with a buddy of mine is about my age\nAnd he said he told a friend of yours about\nGeorge Stephanopoulos role
