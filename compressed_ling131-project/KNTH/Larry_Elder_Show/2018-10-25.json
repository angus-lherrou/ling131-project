I I talked with him cause some earlier today he was one of the first people to start using this term again several years ago trying to revive\nIt because of its actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some who are looking a you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there in the open to the our you know this uh this is the following his rabid peace keeper politically correct\nThe Olympic politically correct about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that's the political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive\nI don't care I'm not about not\nOffending people and neither is ... now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donating Institute and the Lincoln fellow Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to brags that leader Nigel for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus\nGlobal is nationalism versus globalism it's exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not a ambiguous\nIt was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim 'cause Saddam about what nationalism really mean since they have that experience there and as I said he's one of the first people to kind of revive the term as the president said when he said you're not supposed to say that any more and it's ridiculous to say to not be able to say I believe in my nation first\nThis is part of that conversation with ... ...\nThank you for having me I have to I have to say I was with one of the first as a given that given that nationalism goes back hundreds of years but\nCertainly certainly in in in in modern lines I think we we reintroduce the political lexical ... across the across the ocean I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in and let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly\nWhen he when he tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's a needs rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly or that he means nationalist in that I'm going to put my people first we're worried about the concerns of less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that nationally ms ... nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use anymore and I think we should use it again\nWhat did he mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction writing but why did a tour nationalism which when compared to globalism is a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says more concerned about our people before the world's be\n\nWell he because there was actually being roll their gender is about ... and I mean globalization if you think about what a dog\nOr over the past Fifteen Twenty years actually it hasn't really conserve itself with the rest of the world it's considered itself with a a political and cultural and media release a around the world whether it's in Beijing London or New York city of Los Angeles you know global it'd be really a ...\nA very very very few are not married are very few have been you know exploit the workers at Foxconn factories that are exposing jobs from Racine, Wisconsin and so say for no reason you get\nAny drug said ... leave at ... ... people off with all the media Iraq especially because we know now for several years I think people the study is life by the way I see\nOver the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he's had these nationalistic plenty\nBut they're actually come out and said it and\nAnd ... and ... by saying it is is crazy gets another dividing line he's very good at doing this a\nDividing line that he knows that the that sort of leading to the machine the Democrats the media one of those guys that they have to attack that law they have to attack that ... and that's how it is very hot it gets mad and why wouldn't you be he's indefensible even at the age of Seventeen whatever it is\nUm and they do have the lecture logging and so they call them fight the idea of nationalism it to fight the idea\nThat the nation states should be the final arbiter\nShady be show for it is almost impossible especially amongst Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll revolution was nationalist revolution\nHamilton Hamilton's ... on the subject of ... was a national issue document um you know what to the Roosevelt said about how to one flag want him to one language and say goodbye to the immigrant assimilate is nationalism and they don't have arguments against that so that's why they're\nAngry they were upset but he's a then young mother from on them and I think that's what we've seen play out last routes\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is just just say just scream racism which of course is the you know the easiest argument to make\nA ... is our guest is a fellow at the middle east forum the gates don't Institute in the Lincoln fellow at the\nEr Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look I care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris and another event he said in his first year in the presidency I was elected president of the United states not president of the world\nHow can any elected official whether he'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else suggest otherwise your job is to represent the people that chose not to represent the interests of outside nations especially if it comes at the expense of those who chose to lead them\nYou know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually a fantastic book it's just come out on this subject if it's called the bigger picture of nationalism by a professor Golda your I'm has already\nAnd and he he sort of explains his childhood and and it it sort of awful and by awful I mean the rest of the world's all you know it could be an educator\nI'm and I'm staring at math have a a an empire that we won't have right now\nYou know it's sort of ... what we've done historically imperialistic global aesthetically\nIs looked to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Holy Roman emperor or you know the the world is used to have it in ... words to one person where they already they will\nOr several people wherever they are in the world and the world is currently doing that oh 'cause hysterically done the last few decades was the president of United States you don't always referred to build\nA river is in that in the in that office is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all of that sort of thing\nAnd and it's it's it's refreshing ... not just I think for Americans which holiday to you know like trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan which was that it should be no money for public schools and it's\nRight um I think it's refreshing for them but it's also refreshing shouldn't be refreshing but the rest of the world\nUm where nations like Italy and nations like the United states hated and nations like India stray and all these uh uh three independent sovereign nations\nDon't have to act is protectorate table\nThey actually do have to act that independent sovereign nations and this was another thing that President Trump stretches when he talks about ... so he says look I'm not looking forward to flip protectorate started looking ... allies and and so this is a major reset what's going on now I'm ... and it pains me to say that\nWhen you talk about national news and yet says there was a period in history where nationalism\nUh ethnic nationalism specifically but very I'd be very quickly and spiraled out of control but it pains me that people don't know that nationalism actually goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still looked like many countries most clubs I Would say around the world that for whatever reason\nLess media doesn't want to applaud United States\nAnd and of course the key there is ethnic nationalism is not what President Trump is talking about that's what they want to make it about that is what the left wants to make it about he's talking about nationalism versus globalism simple patriotism\nNot for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us versus nation first\nNational national doesn't mean that is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge elaborate said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever we sided that pledge using\nThis is where my allegiance lives don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to uh to um uh Switzerland or to\nUh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national ...\nThere's no coat in it there's no racism and if there is no bigotry and then we need to stop this nonsense right now stop letting the Democrats defined language to us Diane is calling us next from Greenville South Carolina Thank you for joining us now and go right ahead\nHey how are you

minute because I really got from what I Want to hear about this here now listen okay we're going after the first thing I thought what I heard about the so called spoke to devise and these are all these Democrats\nA after Nineteen twenty four yes\nAh and when the Israelites were wandering through the desert did the Canaan nights not welcome [laughter] check your Bible or there were no the gained an ice emphatically did not welcome them and that is why there were some very bloody struggles in that regard\nAnd um it didn't work out so well for the candidates are who by the way we're and by historians confirmed this is not only of biblical account they were child sacrifices they practiced human sacrifice they burn babies alive\nOr so not such a level folks and by the way you want to have ancient Canaan nights welcomed with open arms into the United states\nOr you were six sorry son of a B and you need help signs Sally in San Francisco well thank you for helping me with a segment we've talked about this earlier in the show\n'em look I think it is perfectly appropriate for people to have personal compassion\nFor some of the people who are in that caravan and no I don't think they're all terrorists and I don't think they all mean or evil for the United states\nBut if you simply cannot say that the country is going to be wide open to a every single human being in the world who is hungry are starving or facing\nViolence are facing a difficult situation it's billions of people and that is not fair to the people who have lived here who themselves or their families have contributed to the United states I look what what is has to happen with the caravan particularly\nThis is a test and if the Democrats\nReally want us to say oh come on and you six thousand or seven thousand or however many they are\nThen what do you say to the next caravan which is already starting Guatemala\nThe truth of the matter is I Do believe President Trump is wrong to say well we should cancel foreign aid to El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala what we should do is say look let's work together on this and we will provide more of that foreign aid to keep the people there\nAnd for the people who are going to be sent back from the caravan you don't have to say well you're going to be sent back to a hopeless situation\nSend them back with some private organizations or some Christian organizations some do good organizations that will help them get set up so they don't have to live under such squalid conditions of back\nHonduras or back in Guatemala with the other caravan but the the answer and I haven't heard a single Democrats say this\nBut that's the implication if everyone who is needy and helpless and a destitute and desperate has an open door in the United states what does that mean to our population and what does that mean for the people who are here already\nThat Joanne from Los Angeles wrote in er during the disagreements segment last week you mentioned\nHow the rights is not generally harassed groups of politicians as the left is prone to do\nI remember the Tea Party people disrupting rallies and far right groups in Charlottesville et cetera okay the Tea Party people were not disrupting rallies\nWhat she's talking about is they came to town meetings a constituent meetings that were held by congressman to try to get their attention and\nThe left does this too that it seems to me is not is not hateful when people come and you have against it to a meeting with a member of Congress what I'm Talking about is yeah I the effort to shut down people and not allow them to speak\nThis on college campuses is uniquely the left when it comes to interrupting congressional hearings uh when it comes to and you might say well what about these bombs we don't know about the bombs right now we don't\nBut it's it's so laments a bowl and this that same thing by the way it's true Charlottesville Charlottesville wasn't conservatives\nAre these people these creeps that's one of the good things in the ... movie\nAnd yes it has some good things in it some things that are I have more problems with one of the things that I thought was very good in the movie\nAn interview with Richard Spencer who is is leading neo Nazi was very much part of that Charlottesville scene and he's a leftist he's not on the right\nOkay and then there's a another email that came in about where left and right stand right now and where they're going saying that no Republicans haven't moved to the right up plus a a tweet that says Michael you're wrong President Trump

A. R. K. Davis that's another whole show that takes place over there but this is the one that that I liked the best one that involved you calling us when we were here on the Larry Elder show eight eight eight nine seven one stage\nAre why do they call it the stupid a package Bob strikes\nThe story at its core\nIs very serious anytime someone sends\nA an incendiary device you are a real bomb fake bombs that looks like a bomb attempt to scare to kill somebody or just scare somebody is a terrible terrible crime right so let's just stipulate that it's terrible and by the way who else said that that would be President Trump all day yesterday\nAnd it wasn't quite enough it wasn't quite enough for a punitive media culture that seeks to milk this an opportunistic media culture that seeks to take advantage of this and make it seem like it's Trump's told\nThe reasons CNN got targeted is because Trump called them fake news\nAre you know Hi this is ridiculous and this is going to backfire because there is obvious and proper empathy for anybody that gets a a a bomb or something that looks like a bomb in the mail or dropped off by a courier\nThe people on the target list you get any the Clintons the Obamas Eric Holder Joe Biden Robert De Niro these people make my church\nBut I don't want to get a bomb in the mail no these are birds that does and and and so the president was saying exactly the right things and so what have we been treated to in the last twenty four hours well he didn't call him he didn't call the Clintons called the Obamas just to let them know hey we got this\nKind of stupid idea is that what Bill Clinton doesn't\nKnow much Eleanor thank God I Wonder if they've called me I just wanted to do about it but I Am I going to give other bugs drop it even though we're\nDoing just stop it ... this is what makes the story stupid in the hands of today's media a pretty serious cut and dried story a bit scary devices center the mail that people becomes needlessly\nAmped up into you know welcome to twenty Eighteen where a media culture that has poisoned discourse\nA million times worse than President Trump ever has for ever could is now winding its finger at him winding its finger at us and they're very daring to tell us how to speak it how to act like crazy\nNow is the price of the United states\nHave brash sharp Bella bowed plain spoken rough June ... kind of guy in terms of a communication skill absolutely\nDoes that ruffled some feathers from time to time yes it does has he done a couple of things that even made me go oh sir you're killing me a little here yes All right so let's stipulate that [noise]\nBut for CNN in part heck your just to just the discourse in America\nIs a is is tainted because of it yeah and and most specifically because she's come after them with the fake news accusation and I know the one they like to trundle out more often than any other he called us the enemy of the people\nIs everybody's stupid I'm I'm just asking is everybody\nSued\nBecause that's simply not true the enemy of the people comment was leveled at corrupt dishonest journalism which is rampant at CNN and in more than a few other buildings\nI had to juggle very serious story but but obviously but but this morning you all the coverage was well the packages have been received by several key Democrats you know the Obamas the Clintons so it it does you know it was a your ears afraid they'll mess up my own story\nThe packages received by several key Democrats and CNN like they need to be separated out of ballistic keep Democrats sorry I digress I'm\n... in the midst of of all of this hand wringing\nIf the president has at times dropped the fake news moniker on people it's because they totally do that Trump is a racist it is fake news he insulted all Mexicans is fake news\nThey make crap up because they hate his guts the fake news accusation is one hundred percent deserved to\nGet argue all day over whether that's a tone you want the president take whatever that is stylistic side show quieter\nWe are in aid but I'll tell you one ugly bubble there you go [laughter]\nBut I'll tell you what a [noise] I'll tell you what is absolutely\nTrue that is that the media culture that hate his guts call it a racist every day\nThe other day the president was just down the highway for me in Houston at the at the rally for Ted Cruz that made people's heads exploded I a lot\nOf 'em and he said the ... and I am a nationalist I Am America First country\nFirst as opposed to below the list is trying\nTo make sure the world is okay and we're but one cog in the wheel of the world\nNow I'm a nationalist he said I put my country first my nation nation nationalist get hit nationalist rather than global list some people didn't get it oh I totally got up and they just may do well and there was\nJim Acosta here's a here's a prince\n... done as president I'm just while I was just wondering if if you knew that when you were talking about being a nationalist was that a dog whistle was that kind of a wink and a nudge to Nazis white supremacists was it a reference to white nationalism\nCNN the people who are lecturing us today about how a president ought to talk\nAnd so dripping from all of this ridiculous asinine coverage today maybe Trump will take this occasion to dial back his rhetoric really maybe
