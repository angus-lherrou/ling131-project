much faith in government things are going well in almost every category that matters and yet\nThe left continues its relentless pursuit of power to advance the gender is not even in their own best interests and in many ways as anti biblical we who are conservative and believe in a kingdom not of this world that will last forever we who are believers whose faith is not ultimately in princess and kings\nWe know or should know that the world and everything in it is passing away would you pay a patriot to fix up the house that is on fire the danger for believers is that we will follow the left in their faith in government\nDiminishing the greater power that as ours\nA power to change hearts minds that lives\nNo political power can do that only the power that comes from that other kingdom

for it [noise] it's funny 'cause if John Anderson lead vocals to he has to Seventy four he's only two years younger than McCartney\nAnd he was a ... when the Beatles very much a sixty is a\nPhenomenon yes very much a seventies phenomena but you know what [noise] you know one now and there are coddling together the uh the the building blocks of yes Nineteen sixty eight [noise] so I mean the Beatles only been around for like four or five years and and and yes is starting to crank out a progressive rock and\nTally most people's heads explode there in Britain in the late the late sixties anyway yes quite quite the record library there already a telephone number is eight eight eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine seven on said Mark Davis in Fort Larry Elder let me hit the reset ha tell you where exactly we\nAre and what are my thoughts on some things and then the idea is that you share your thoughts\nAbout some things that we hope that uh that you will do so eight eight eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine Seventy one real quick as we begin or would you be the first on the movie everybody's talking about before the elections depths of the nation national issues his masterpiece is on DVD at about five days\nOctober thirtieth really states or your topic today at destination movie dot com death of a nation movie dot com directed it so you know it's compelling so go get that destination movie dot com\nOkay the mystery packages the story seconds the finger pointing continues and let's make a list\nOr we don't know and what we know this is how you stay sane throughout this entire thing right now my list of what we don't know and what we know\nMay differ from yours you may think you know some things that I don't you may think some things that I think I Know are in dispute and that's why we have telephone lines\nSo um to join us here's what we do not know we don't know who sent these packages that can be started the most basic we have no idea who sent these packages or why\nI and that's where you stop your toe for the first time it's like wait a minute don't we know that this was some\nExpression of hate for for liberal uh iconic figures clearly sent by some nut bag on on the right\n[laughter] so we don't know any such thing you know is that probably the greatest possibility yeah because we have our bags to\nKnow the little boy left as guys who shoot up baseball fields and and the left has tons of people who uh will shock you out of a restaurant and claw like zombies the doors to the Supreme Court and do all kinds of other who feels off nonsensical thing we've uh we've we've got our crazy too\nBut you know the thing that that started to wrap itself around me when the story first began and the and the and the tally of mysterious packages started to grow\nSaid you know doesn't tend to be something we do and they\nAre and why in the world wouldn't exactly being an expert logic why would you do it sometimes you send somebody a pipe bomb because you want to kill them but you know ... nothing exploded yet you know what I mean\nAnd I think that it was the one in sources mailbox where the ... where the the white powder was nothing it was in art now and then by the way that doesn't make it okay if you send somebody something just to scare the or the ... out of them that that's a terrorist act\nAs well so you don't have to blow up for you to have done something very very illegal but is it okay for you if you keep that uh that hoax antenna primed and dialed in you bet it's okay mine is\nDoes it mean on declaring it a hoax I'm telling you I Know it's a hoax I Know that the left doing this to the left so that we can you know spread out and have some myth of equivalency\nLike yeah we're ... we got a lot of restaurants were chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants we got Maxine Waters advocating hooliganism but you have your crazies do you're trying to kill the Clintons and the Obamas and Joe Biden and Robert De Niro you people are just like us yeah\nNo we're not okay\nBecause even if even if we do find that this is one conservative lunatic you know what that is one conservative lunatic\nWe have more to be sure but um it it's not our rank and file really popped up activists who are doing things that countless thousands of leftist are doing\nAll the time there is no comparison so the thing that we don't know is who did this and why we do not know\nHere's what we do know a media culture that hates Trump's God's will do anything to tag him with this bad story\nAnd that is why you actually get I mean I I heard Wolf Blitzer I was kind of funny I was getting out of the car a dollar and serious actually I'm In the car Wolf Blitzer talking to some congressmen aside and say we know we have CNN just if you ever have the president's ear tell them that we we really try to get things right and we're not involved in fake news like will shut up\nDude it's pathetic it's sad I mean they got a great\nIdea of you and Don Lemon you know want to go you know build a tree house in the backyard never a club meeting why don't you decided to start covering things fairly covering things honestly lose the corruption fire Jemma cost to get your act together\nYou don't lose the Trump drain joins syndrome and become a real news organization because the the cries of fake news are real and deserved invalid\nAn accurate and I'll just try a ball around mess and I'm going to your calls eight eight eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine seven ...\nAs the question hangs from the rafters\nShould the president dial back his rhetoric in view of the there's this package story or blah blah blah blah blah\nShort answer is no\nThere is nothing nothing in President Trump's rhetoric that somehow necessarily leads up to somebody doing something like that even if it is a nut job conservative\nThere is zero connection to be made there none by thinking people\nBut by people who've had a bug up there but about Trump since the day he won there's plenty of material and they're going to use it and they're going to hammer it and they're going to bludgeon it and you know what it's going to backfire to\nJust like Kevin are just like the caravan desk is going to backfire too you don't the voters are paying attention today say wait a minute what now vis\nFirst we have ... media apologist planted embedded with the caravan trying to uh uh characterize it as as something noble pursuit\nAnd we have what the media and Senate Democrats did in the cabinet debacle and now they're taking this very admittedly\nUnfortunate and scary story of devices showing up at a that some Democrats mailboxes and they're trying to blame Trump for it are you kidding me this will make people crawl on broken glass to vote Republican\nSo please keep it up guys please keep it up [noise] we're in San Diego hey Sean Mark Davis into Larry how you doing\n... good ... good thank you I Want to

time\nSo many radio career is find a hundred and radio guys and many of them will probably tell you a story about how it ended being fairly young and just being in the right place at the right time where somebody gives you an opportunity to do something to give you an absolute\nThe no idea whether you can do it but you you show up you don't embarrass yourself for them and uh and look what happened to thirty six years later I most of the show holy\nCow so thanks thanks thanks Sarah everybody listening when we're here Sebastian Gorka is here tomorrow and I'm back on Monday before Larry's return\nOn um on Tuesday of next week All right I'm let's let's hit the reset top of the hour we sat on what we're doing on the mystery packages I Am hearing a lot of skepticism about the preferred narrative of we have a conservative terrorist\nI'll believe we have a conservative terrorists when we have a conservative terrorists in handcuffs being arrested and fingerprint till then I Am open to absolutely anything up even Chuck Todd but it's kind of interesting\nEven Chuck Todd said today apparently uh how about the Russians\nSome some and and you know what I Do know\nConservative cherished Russians Democrat prankster or any of the above ... absolutely no idea no idea\nOf the misspellings and ineptitude and if it is the Russians and the Russian government at some idiot Russian guy in his basement and you know Michigan or something I I don't do so again there's speculation games lovely parlor game you can play with your friends\nI have no idea and neither do you so it makes it a very bad idea to jump in and like we kind of know and that's that's that's the third\nLevel of obnoxious fast to all this presumption and this this drawl a modern media culture has to lecture President Trump about his rhetoric when they call him a Hitler every day for lunch come on man I'll take no lectures from CNN about civility and a ah\nAt the end and decency in a discourse our phone number is eight eight eight nine seven on stage so we we have no idea what's going on a package story let us lift up a prayer and every good wish for law enforcement and for the people who are working on this so that we can get the bottom of it and maybe sci fi and find out\nWhat a and see and find out what is what I'm going to say on saying you can join me on this or not to freak out if they don't find a suspect like in in weeks and I mean because if it was just some moron terrorists who happens to vote\nRepublican uh they're going to find him probably by the weekend so if they don't find anybody for a few days here much skepticism is only going to grow but yet I Will reach no conclusion I Will jump to a to know bottom line\nOf all at the game come to me here's something I'm not going to lead come to me the caravan\nPresident Trump apparently in St mood deploying the military secretary of defense James Mattis signing deployment orders [noise] as we speak sense military down there I said for weeks that\nIf we if if this caravan gets the feeling they're about to get ... by the United states military and I don't mean they're going to get you know rolled over by tanks or anything but um they may turn around and and think better of this let me let me do this I've been sitting on this this new\nColumn news written an opinion piece in um on Fox News today migrant caravan on the large what we must do it for when the caravan arrives at our border ready here we go\n[noise] the caravan of an estimated seven thousand Central American invaders trekking through Mexico toward the United states is roughly one thousand miles from the nearest point of entry a second group of roughly one thousand is also seeking to join them\nThey may still be weeks away from our border but this leaves a little time for President Trump Congress and all Americans who care about our national sovereignty and the rule of law to solve three incredibly pressing challenges\nFirst we must determine and do what we can right now and this invasion before it reaches our doorstep\nSecond we must develop and execute a cohesive efficient effective plan for preventing these invaders from illegally crossing our border and forests swiftly deporting those who are successful\nAnd finally we must fix the debilitating leaf stupid amalgam of immigration laws policies and court rulings that enable and encourage migrants to band together and stage these types of illegal invasions\nShould we fail to solve any of these problems are already dysfunctional immigration system will be further cripple our relationship with Mexico and Central America neighbors can be severely damaged our border will be overwhelmed by droves of new migrants and America will become significantly less safe\nIf this caravan is allowed to get through the end of the U.S the next caravan will be even bigger the one following that will be enormous according to the Gallup world bold twenty nine percent of people who wants to migrate from Latin America the Caribbean want to make the United states they're permanent home that is thirty seven\nMillion people who want to come here we must demand and ensure that they do so legally\nDeclares dancer do alleviating decision while the Caribbean is still in Mexico is for Mexico to stop it\nPresident Trump is already made clear that securing the border is more important than our recent trade agreements with our southern neighbor Mexico should take him seriously\nMany members of this caravan forced their way through the Guatemala Mexico border they're already in violation of Mexican law Mexican law enforcement should take action\nFurthermore we should not underestimate the degree to which human traffickers and trains national criminal gangs such as that has Thirteen and other cartels are involved with this invasion force\nMexican authorities should also be seeking to weed these elements out of the caravan and dealing with those who may have legitimate asylum claims through the Mexican system\nOur Mexican neighbors must understand that while they did not assertively deal with this problem at their southern border they will own the problem if it gets to their northern border this relates to what we must do it for when the caravan is allowed to arrive at the U.S border\nPresident Trump should instruct attorney general Jeff Sessions to issue a clarification to define the qualifications for asylum asylum is meant to provide protection for people who are fleeing real persecution and human rights abuses such as genocide simply being from a poor country that lacks opportunities does\nNot qualify someone for asylum we already have approximately seven hundred and fifty thousand backlogs asylum cases\nThese invaders should be screened preferably in Mexico so they never enter the U.S just a federal government should also immediately begin coordinating with local and state governments along the border to develop an organized completely non violent system that can deter these migrants from crossing into the United states\nDo taxes already worked with federal officials to prepare for mass migration events other border states should follow suit\nWe must overwhelming invaders stopped them in their tracks and quickly return them to their home countries\nOur immigration system has been completely broken by Democrat back laws that make it easier for immigrants to flood our system and stay in our country while their cases take years to process\nThe immigration system has been further hobbled by activists judicial rulings that have ties the hands of border enforcement officials and prevented them from keeping track of those who cross the border illegally once we deal with the immediate problem of this invasion caravan Republicans and the White House must work to fix our broken immigration system\nOnce and for all Newt Gingrich within opinion\nBased ...

I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I Know I was just thinking about how long have you ever you know there there was an older though Steve Allen of people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book call I think it was dumb ass\nAnd he said he pulled up to the post office had one heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and the clerk and Steve Allen is the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the clerk says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have a number he says well you'll have to go back to not much we can freeze the box always it back\nPlus I Want you know those numbers like you might get at a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with a heavy box walks up to the counter he's the only when they're in the postal clerk says Thirteen call suits number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you've got to give them credit seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job\nUm but seriously it never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well I you know President Trump says we have the ...\nI think in in this case you know around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that but you know last plane lost ships whatever it was called the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the wayside was why it was so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department engage in a soft coup I think a lot of people's knowledge that now against the ... legitimately elected president of United States Donald Trump\nBut our unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular agents those who do the work day in and day out and the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so disgraceful to see those in power tarnish the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI no we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know its image being so tarnished and so rude because somebody you engaged in a lot of hold like a banana republic activities that's why we were unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them\nSo whether the suspect winds up being someone with deep mental issues\nOr someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what the uh the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disaster someone should be pointed that out when he tried to do the political system is what you guys already with the political system\nIn trying to get her legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn it this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is on and it looks like we all know sure looks like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy is that you want to be around no matter what side but it's early\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor did they probably care that we were as unhappy with this election and the re election of President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them after all\nMany of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the announcer was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally changed the United states of America\nWe are\nNot only for a lot of [noise]\nI always got that wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave us notice you know for a job you to give two weeks notice now says that five days before what previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that\nAnd which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made when a leader steps up stays true to his values in Charlottesville\nAnd the mentally different course for the country\nThat's because you're not in power when you get in power I Wonder if you agree that we should try a fundamentally different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have\nWas right yeah [noise] and apologize for what you may know my sign off is always a pleasure privileged to have a my front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world but\nWe're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House dinner those actresses or singers threatened that like that march that day of or the day after whatever it was\nOr printed you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president they I guess it's supposed to be fiction obviously\nPart uh we don't do that kind of stuff but the left and the Democrats and the press which are really the same thing\nAs a never accepted as a victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now even before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about the suspect\nSo this will be used and it's being used to hurt President Trump and the Republicans\nEspecially with the November elections just stays away [noise] so this guy did it because of what President Trump says that's what they'll have you believe [noise]\nAnd because of everything goes wrong is President Trump's fault Tom mark I live in a pain free\nStudios that comes to the U.S I mean don't you think frequently factor dot com [noise] let me not to think eight eight eight nine seven one said [laughter]\nI guess I shouldn't be surprised\nAnd mark a the mark or what you were a bringing up about a media is absolutely true they don't want to record the fact that the cycle and here's a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida like our ... and I I don't know the mother to\nSow what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the cost of elbow hurts for the government you know and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up right to work you said a few times during his because I'm I'm a not his candidacy while he was trying for\nThere's a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead you're on the face or something like that that was that but he hasn't done anything like that where the the law whether it's the actual political people or the news\nOr they've all actually said they're going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's the part of the contracts and different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know during the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that\nOh of course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well they'll they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even\nMost of the hard core I Would say\nYou know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something that way if the Trump arrangements so now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say no question about it\nBreaking ATF news just recently the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a complaint filed

[noise] All right we're taking your calls at a eighty eight nine seven ones the agents for those are just joining us\nThe first hour we were talking about the bombs in the uh the accused and we didn't mention his name that's important so they don't get that kind of publicity if that's what they're seeking\nBut after we did that and said that how outraged that was an we acknowledge that\nWe got into the idea that the press obviously wants to blame President Trump for everything and anything everything is his fault that goes wrong and everything that goes right President Obama as you heard we'd like to take credit we we played a clip of in a minute or two of them in the last hour and it was hard for me to take\nBecause I forgot what he did all the time which is he would set up strong dummy and then tear it down like you said in the clip we have that to you know we want to rip babies away from the arms of immigrants no they're illegal immigrants and we don't want to risk babies away was your policy by the way Mr former president\nYou know we didn't change that policy needs to be changed obviously\nBut it was your policy in the first place\nAnd we don't want to rip babies away in fact the real answer is\nDon't come here in the first place if you're going to come illegally\nCome here legally and there'll be no issue and who knows who setting up this caravan who's paying for all of it how they're getting here I've heard all kinds of rumors but the fact is\nHe's got to stop them it's an invasion you can't allow this to happen so we followed by others but he can't he can't do anything right and of course the things he says\nAre the reasons that the suspect in custody did what he did it because of President Trump\nBut then we evolved into the point\nThat you know why they hate him so much among other reasons because he's the first Republican that I can remember in years who standing up to their nonsense who's willing to call it like it is\nIt's reasonable to ask because I mentioned last hour whether Hillary should be indicted for what she did she committed crimes and when I was sympathetic to her eye on another station another network people get annoyed with me because I said if they agreed to leave the scene forever maybe we could agree not to indict Hillary and\nPeople said she's not above the law that is a reasonable argument that's what they said lock her up that is not violent that is just following the rules and principles that we all in this country are subject to the country what is so radical about that\nYeah but but yet when President Trump says it is absolutely outrageous\nAnd what else I Can't even remember what else they pick on them for what was the other issues besides lock her up that they say Trump keeps inciting the audience when I think of it I'll let you know but whenever he says it's ... it's just terrible right for the press because the press the fake press effect press the enemy\nThe people the enemy the people if they're not going to do objective journalism cause they have tremendous power and the ... if they can make ... American people can't get the news and an object away I never knew when I was growing up with the politics was\nOf the journalists who are reporting it that's not true now their gender so clear he's right to call them out on it\nBut I think this is insanity when when the Obama could be outraged sent in theory the rest of us and say things like you'll keep your doctor and you keep your health care and uh you know we're we're ... we we care about race people on our side and we judge people by the color of their skin don't illegals all\nI've often said give me nine black women on the Supreme Court court conservative and I'm happy camper know where the guy that always see race\nAnd gender and uh you know sexual orientation we don't talk that way we see individuals much more has Dennis and Larry always talk about we see people as people you are the guys that do this kind of stuff\n[noise] All right let me know what you think and we'll take your calls at eight eight eight nine seven one stage and here I have an article Sean just gave me journalists accused troubles inciting violence against the press I mean I I don't even want to read the article now 'cause it's too upsetting you\nGuys have created this in the media because you haven't been fair let me know what you think well let's go to um I think we're going to and guess is is that Angus I don't see the name of al ...

Georgia Iran was mark\n[noise] yes [noise] Well Mark you know as a retired job a mental health professional I just have to say that the U.S one time media has finally revealed itself in it veers site cos\nAnd I'm at this point uh the media and uh this a bomber individual both have some very prominent features a paranoid schizophrenia\nAnd I'd start with these uh\nA media are nuts are saying oh that Trump is responsible for all of this ah bombers stopping these responsible for the bomb well you know\nThat's not only mind reading but it's thought insertion they believe that Trump has inserted thoughts into the bombers mind for him to go do it\nAnd the bomber of course well uh you know it's thought broadcasting and he's having a conversation with Trump through with television or maybe he looks out a picture of him in the paper where shall I get the water or tell me what hardware store do I get the pipe what about this other stuff\nWell the reality is is that individuals are responsible for their own behavior and speech just moves air\nAnd people their motivations belong to them and what they do is their responsibility and speech is protected for the president just as it is for everybody else\nAnd just like we've been talking we didn't blame a Bernie Sanders for what that guy uh with that a phony a you know Chinese a cave rifle did in nearly killing Steve\nA school league and um the other people that were out there with the baseball but the thing of it is is that um\nYou know moving air with speech is one thing but behavior move physical objects and those things can either be helpful like somebody building a building\nOr making sandwiches are cooking a meal for someone can be harmful\nCatch you let me know what you think eight eight eight nine seven one sage

of people are accused of that like you know Republicans are evil and we're racists and homophobia that's the problem we there we know there are not like the the guys up the pipe bombs we understand that but we all don't get guilty of that\nBecause of it we we don't take responsibility for the\nPerson who Trump hasn't done anything outraged look he's not a perfect package he doesn't always say what I Want him to say but he's standing up to the other side which hasn't happened before and that's why you have the reporters are filling out that the document with two hundred people signed onto

so many years and as I said this is the first president to call them on it and they can't take it\nThey can accept that how dare you challenge them and one can't just ignore this because when the left and the Democrats and uh even some liberals when they're not on us to their former cause\nThey can't accept us fighting back there all the same\nThey're all the same in the sense they've always had a meeting on their side and you also amazing it's amazing we went in the elections because when you have a media against you and you have the school's against you and if you don't know me more gosh
