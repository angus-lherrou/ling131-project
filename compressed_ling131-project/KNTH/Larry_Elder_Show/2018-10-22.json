[laughter] you know very very cute cute\nBut I don't know if we still have a son but the events do yeah real estate forty four and\nNobody goes that way anymore but right right\nBut next week I'll be in Columbia I'm Lenny yeah our school a number of our graduates\nA PHD graduates have gone and enter teaching in schools overseas\nAnd he's topic or English as a second language or well\nI mean they're they're teaching us energy theology teaching new tests or an old estimate that kinda thing and the ... and so I'm going to send an audio of the ... yeah that was the seminary in in Colombia right I think a biblical assuming I built into the Colombia I think in the name of it so going there\nAnd it kinda renews some connections interest that we both have together from Wheaton College to to that school I'll be lecturing a few days down there on various topics and lectures\nTo a Spanish speaking\nI Am not this is the first time to do that so you know I'll be very interesting speaking and then you know listening as ... you\nHave to chop it up into\nEach sentence has to be chopped up into phrases cause the best way to do it is you see a phrase their dreams that you sort of phrase we translate and you'll be here you're emotionally hear what you're saying and the translation comes through you know it really changes the way that you speak yeah different way of speaking well have a translator\nHe told me to you expected to do about half of what you'd normally do\nIn in because you're going to you know the strings west of having a translation of and then from there we go to Panama in Panama City down there\nThere is a um a trainee a conference\nOf evangelical seminaries Louis ... three years every three years of your every three or ... years\nThey meet and this year it's in Panama and there'll be a seminary presidents and deans from Africa and they'll be all over all over the world and uh you know I'll be there were representing we'd in college and we'll have another representative as well April McLaughlin\nIs leading them whether you're us from Wheaton ... who runs our Billy Graham scholarship we can we give away fourteen Fifteen scholarships every are full scholarships to students who are coming through ... schools overseas this is money that I think was given to the Billy Graham ... association many years ago and it's been a it's it's been a great gift\nAnd it's wonderful to see these is now that the provides though and it is that they go back to their home country roads they get this money and they and they and they don't want him to stick around the U.S or they don't want him to do various things I wanted to go directly back\nTo their country when they're done with their master's degree and such so it makes a whole lot to say so I'll be down there for about four or five days before heading back way back in Houston\nUh so what are you a teaching in Columbia got to lectures or the lectures I'm doing one is called the place of Jesus in biblical extra Jesus\nWhich had their arms and happens to ram I didn't I didn't mean for your call it's yeah but\nSized so as not to be fed saw those extra large ... extra extra large changing it because they they don't want to be sexist so to say is man size means right yeah right because\nYou know men don't have larger hands to why they don't have to browse to to dry off with a ...\nA big bigger noses too with the bigger [laughter] strange parallel\nRegarding that I'm probably not probably bring is about him turn I remember years ago when I was a kid my mom I buy this range than beans\nMy boy ... ran child ...\nReally really good and you can find any brand that's great okay there are a low end versions of the means to me that she would buy specifically that ... the black came that the white lettering and part of the label\nThat this little yellow flag when the man's face a caricature of a man said that has been clean and they don't say that\nNo more had more he's not any more than ... family please right now\nAnd I thought [laughter] I remember distinctly that's been playing and I'm not sure we all would whether we use our whole family instead of just does exactly right political correct well\nLike fifty sixty years they'll figure you know the person the person's typically the family structure was such that there was a woman who who cooks you know for the right but you know she did work outside the home a lot of times and so\nYes but you see this is used as were the maturity go out to eat\n[laughter] no no we have we\nHave one of the highest percentages per person per meal a of going out to eat that any other maybe that's what I've heard\nOkay yeah All right let me ask you about this because I don't know I've been very busy less to anybody when the big lottery\nYou know the billion dollar loss nobody wanted to ... billion dollars what it is now where it is now Tuesday night one is really interesting I was ... my wife has been an well for a couple of days as Margaret emerged fence for say so I was at the at the at the at the rentals near home\nAnd uh just kind of shopping there and and it was the day of the lottery and there was this woman who was just tired out like crazy because she'd been selling lottery tickets all day long and I asked her what did what was your biggest do it what was your biggest sales she's three thousand dollars or some one person to person came in with three thousand\nDollars to buy a lottery ticket\nAnd she's been processing these lottery tickets all a thousand dollars and Fifteen hundred tickets yeah I guess so ... where do you do you realize\nThe tiny percent change\nOf increasing their odds by having Fifteen hundred tickets it's it's so small right it's one of the three hundred plus million three out of three one out of three hundred million for for for one ticket for one to talk to her one of the three hundred plus million over inundated with it I think something like that so getting Fifteen hundred\nMoving the decimal maybe people have been over three places right places something one way out there right not much of a change\nYou know no so anyway it's just interesting to watch you know this whole thing so yes All right yeah I I think it's it it it as they've said is a tax on the poor in a way it's\nTax or the people who came through math yeah and I never got to ask about a surprise us rush to you I Will get three tickets that's all I Do three to six bucks so you get you get a chance or is\nIt is a chair okay you know well if you win our will be very generous give Egypt God's

with Rollins the first guy who made the accusation green to pay him two hundred thirty four thousand dollars over Thirteen Years in presser stopped those monthly payments to Rollins\nSo he is claiming

I noticed in Fox they say how the push is are helping the Saudi would that translate to into rabbi is the ... the debt that the Saudis Mayo\nToo I hate to use the word Jewish lobby or the Israeli

Illinois basically\nOn bankruptcy and and\nShe probably go now to swallow hind as close yeah it really is and of course the governor's races very hot because of that at this point up there and uh I've heard the expression is growing up in the south is cook it as a dog dogs hind leg\nAnd up there it's just crooked as Illinois politicians so as late as just as the way it is a lot of governors in jail right so that has have\nYou do it all into how Chicago war to heel politics are run they adopted my old Tammany Hall friends vote early vote often and pay off your cool guy\nAnd and that and and the other thing\nThat the Democrats really ought to be afraid of the Democratic party was basically made other than the south of course was basically made by the Irish and then the Jews Tammany Hall in New York in northeast\nNow the new people personified by that woman in New York state who who threw out of thirty two he ... he was in Congress for thirty two year old solid Irish politician dishes or what's\nComedy and they said and basically the cigarette a\nThroat lie even that house elections you had to go through who's going to me if he was incentive for thirty two years is five elections\nOr right why I think it was a ... he was a congressman\nOrders in ... in a typical ... elections\nIt in a typical or like a democratic district\nOr a yard sale this movie Argo thank you much time Walter

definition of a love is off of up here Walter come on I mean I'm not talking about a boring people at a every person can be interesting people ... you know we always used to fly the interesting part of them right right and that's part of what movies to love somebody has to find\nThe value in them into re elevate that and ... you're going to do\nI Do agree with you that you can find people who are interesting you're drawing them out but if you're if you're if you're like oh you're on TALK about how about I mean you're talking about myself right\nNow I'm hearing those people that are on or

cakes pancakes too you can hear a\nLittle author okay memorial you wanted to talk about David stock we'd be brought about that the bill GB communities asking\nWell they know that the young young people in the Catholic Church of kind of but Bob Bennett ships I\nI saw that report that they think like what I say that the article that I read was really talking about how they church\nI'm In the top levels controls positively and tries to control language because the way that you\n... it you know like we talk about political correctness and I don't want to get to technical about this but the way that you define thing is\nBasically structures your imagination and structured reality when we do when we see things which\nWe don't see things in themselves when you see the interpretation of things that we are\nGiven usually by culture by the cultural gravity mhm in other words if you have a group of people thinking one way you are going to begin thinking that way because the grab it cheap coal of that we all want to be like each other and so when you start thinking of each other [noise]\nYeah but it according to the language they use David you should know\nWhere you at ... at the way that the crystal logical definitions of the early church councils how they struggled with the language to make sure that they would describe relationship between Jesus and the father\nAnd describe the whole issue of the trinity and described salvation at all or even a reformation\nAnd so what the Catholic Church is resisting right now is the language of of A L G the tea\n[noise]\nMan [noise]\nNow let me start with this [noise] back from Arizona that beautiful place you'd if you if you know anything about me at all I've been doing this monster show with in our in our ten year never missed the show in\nTen years very proud of that\nAnd if you've been listening and many of you have\nBeen listening for those ten years as a show continues to explode two hundred plus radio stations now lord knows however many venues other than that exist out there I'm not even aware of okay probably some affiliates I'm not even aware of but nonetheless if you've paid any attention to me at all over the last ten years you know\nMy affinity for the great state of Arizona love it love it I'm drawn to it can't explain why don't really care what\nFeel very comfortable feel very home there and I

Gottlieb because Alan Gottlieb ... years you know if you listen to the daytime show we're into stone Arizona\nOn Monday and Tuesday broadcasting from that living breathing history museum that's what tombstone is so we'll talk a little bit about that tonight with my upcoming guests you'll find them fascinating we'll go to them just a minute but\nI Want to throw that disclaimer out that I'm going to run that our\nFrom Tucson from tombstone Monday show because I had just an amazing conversation with the mayor and with Gordon there's some big things going on in tombstone relative to your right

enormous show and two hundred affiliates of don't get to hear the daytime show you're going to love it so let me start with why was I in Arizona to begin with\nThe Arizona citizens defensively [noise] excuse me has asked me to speak I have three or four times now I I I've lost count\nBut I Love speaking of that event each year I'm a life member now so here's kind of my progression of my speaking relationship with the folks out at Arizona citizens eventually I actually woke up in tombstone Arizona a number of years ago put my genes on drawing a shirt strapped on a firearm\nPut my stepson on my fry boots on\nThe gun on my hip and drove to Tucson to speak to the Arizona citizens defensively meeting and I thought that was kind of cool when it dawned on me man I woke up in Tucson, Arizona today put my boots my ... my gun on\nIt came up here to Tucson to speak\nTo one of the greatest pro gun rights organizations grassroots organizations in the country I thought that was kinda cool to me that school so because I Love Arizona and I put you in particular I Love to do\nSo I thought that was it but I was a basic member of the organization at that time card carrying the next year I spoke as a sustaining member in Phoenix and then a couple of years later this year I speak as a life member and I couldn't be more proud of that fact so this year\n\nI Am Alan Gottlieb and who you hear on the program founder of the second amendment foundation usually here Allen every week I don't I've been planning on personal trip the tombstone for just a couple of days to get out what turns out\nThat Gordon Anderson who we met in shots show in Vegas a couple of years ago invited us out along with the mayor of tombstone\nTo assist them with and appear at their freedom day celebration in honor of their proclamation of America's first proclaimed official Second Amendment city\nBut it happened kind of quick and both of us were unable to get out there in June for personal reasons\nSo we came out there this past week\nNow we had already pre planned his trip\nSo it was an awful lot of fun to pop into town out an eye on Monday we stayed until Tuesday we brought to live armed American radio daily shows from that living breathing history museum I've also broadcasted from tombstone in the past a number of years about four years ago as well\nSo we were there for a number of reasons not just the history in the front of the town but we were working both days in fact Allen panda USA Today op ed piece from malaria and motel and assisted me a production of both radio program so not all play I could sure use a lot of work going on\nBut here's the fun part and you're going to hear this in the third our today as I bring you the actual daily program for Monday This week from tombstone where my first guest was the tombstone mare\nDustin ask a pool who unbeknownst to Alan Gottlieb than myself prior to the program presented each of us with an honorary citizen of tombstone plaque\nAlong with two golden keys to the city now again if you know anything about me that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me because I've been going out to Tucson for twenty five plus years\nSo to have that to me it was an absolute incredible honor I had no idea that he was going to do that and it took both of us by surprise I have that plaque sitting right here and I can promise you that's the coolest thing and I have a lot of cool things on the wall studio I can promise you from NASCAR stuff done stuff\nTo this this right here ranks right up there AS number one or at least tied for number one\nBut I got to tell you what were we doing there why were we there because we're beginning assisting that incredible little town with their upcoming freedom day celebration in June of twenty Nineteen next year where I can promise you will be there\nThey're thinking big into stone and they want our help and we are more than happy to assist them and we will be bringing some big names to that town in June I Can't give you the list of who's who yet as it's building and we've got to reach out to a number of people but let's just say there will be a number of huge national celebrity figures\nAs are expected to be out there are pro gun rights celebrities yeah hard to find right but they're out there some of them made movies that you might be familiar with like why are too so you know that kind of stuff\nIn fact right now Val Kilmer is into stone as I speak to you right now he got into town today we're hopeful that maybe we can bring him back again\nIn June he's been there before but the list is building for movie stars to talk radio host that you listen to and see on national TV politicians newsmakers\nSo it's going to be a giant enormous event in tombstone and we want you to make the pilgrimage with us there will be more on that over upcoming shows a months as we get closer to ... to believe me just going to be on your like that just going to happen so we'll have
