much\nHas really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that matter most exciting work at the wall cat what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states is that his country's may not like we\nSaid what we do they know that if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO thing that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether it's the trade deal forgive and amazing they get the pie that means that mess and they all over whether\nIt's his promise to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem she should've included that but teeth on so much now you can expect me to remember everything\nBut then if you look at just the two years at the last one point three billion\nAnd the un like we've made it stronger laid up more in the south and we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green North Korean sanctions um
