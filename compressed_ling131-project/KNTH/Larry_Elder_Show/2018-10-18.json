claim of having Native American heritage it's no different than you claiming to be Jewish\nOh really I'm not a U.S senator and I've never tried to claim any advantage to identifying is Jewish as just who I Am it's the way I was raised he writes the name id vet is Eastern European that is true ... means bear in Russian\nAnd it's also means bear in check I Believe Hungarian a Serbian I Believe a bunch\nOf Eastern European languages a I'm On the bear that walks like I'm In the name id vet he writes as Eastern European it is not\nMiddle Eastern in origin well that's true but the most common choice names are Middle Eastern origin Goldberg which is a common Jewish name they were all taken\nA during the exile and again this is all pretty well known Jewish history\nUnless you believe the twelve tribes of Israel came from Europe no I don't according to my knowledge of the Old Testament Abraham the father of Jacob actually ever had was the father of eyes they it was a grandfather Jacob Abraham what was the father of Jacob who fathered twelve sons which became the twelve tribes of Israel that's right\nWhich upon entering the promised land God commanded them to commit ethnic genocide against the pagan is well no not exactly commanding them to kill them and when children obese and burn while also burning down orchard et cetera a Holocaust by all measures okay so what's the point\nI Would pay for you to take a DNA test Richard says no problem I'm also bet you a thousand dollars to the charity of your choice if you can show you have more than thirty percent Jewish DNA you know I might take this that\nI might take this fit for the record my grandfather who was an immigrant from\nGermany his mother I understand was from Poland grandfather told me his mother handed down to him a solid silver Menorah which I have a very good memory of seeing as a child during the holiday season it was always placed above his fireplace\nThere were never any Christmas trees and grandpa tells this Menorah there was handed down from his great great great grandfather to his mother does that make me Jewish\nAnd you're faithful listener Richard okay Richard ... it it does not make you Jewish because you weren't raised Jewish you've never affiliated Jewish you've never been part of the community the point about Elizabeth Warren that was so stupid\nWas that she never participated in any American indian life she was never registered with any crime there was no tradition of Indian culture in her family I can assure you and I have three brothers who can help\nTrue but uh even though my parents weren't developed the religious when we were growing up they were extraordinarily committed to Jewish life or my parents in fact when I was six months old took me to Israel for the first time and we do know\nBecause my mother's family had lived in ... Germany for many many years my uncle my great uncle Julius\nHad actually traced back to the families lineage\nTo the fourteen hundreds and an old Jewish Jewish Jewish Jewish but you see this is this is not the point there are all kinds of convert to Judaism including members of my immediate family who have limited Jewish background some but limited Jewish background genetically or ethnically\nBut they choose to live as part of a Jewish community and specifically they choose to live religiously\nAnd this is really the problem with Elizabeth Warren is she was claiming to be a diversity hire at Harvard\nShe had put this in Harvard she had even contributed to a cookbook done by the Harvard Native American community called powwow chow\nAnd her whole identification with Native American identity was phony\nI can assure you if someone has been a synagogue president for Fifteen Years or in a prior life my involvement with a with Jewish life and Judaism is pretty well documented but by the way even though my grandmother\nWas blond and blue eyes and obviously it was not a Middle Eastern origin I'm pretty sure that if I Do take one of those DNA tests and maybe I Will uh I can win that that with you will save your email and uh I'm willing to to go there with you because um I\nWould turn out like most Jewish people that more than thirty percent of the DNA is identifiable as European

the San Antonio spurs great pop a bitch use the fiftieth anniversary of the black power salute ... remember that in sixty eight\nBy Tommy Smith and John Carlos [noise] he's calling for politicians to have a more civil constructive conversation about race relations\nQuote we're politician to our devices with their disingenuous cynical approach that is disgusting\n\nAnd he goes on and on and on about this time for politicians to have a civil conversation about race relations now coach I Know you listen to the show I'm period in San Antonio appreciate the\nCoverage me tell you something you're not helping you're making things worse maybe the poll that came out a few months ago that said that six out of ten Americans feel that race relations are getting worse in America\n[noise] but then most of them never discuss the issue with their friends or family and I think about that\nRace relations are getting worse people agree that they're getting worse but they don't discuss it with friends or family\nThat would be something on the part of people like pop of issues that people are discussing it because it's such a sensitive topic because America steel seizing racism the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow yeah to block cetera let me tell you why people don't talk about it first of all most people don't think they are racist\nThey don't most people think they're fair most people think that there give people a and even shot most people consider themselves to be Christians and the whole basis of Christianity is the golden rule\nTreating people that way you want to be treated most people think they do that so they don't like the races number two if the great diversity is right and I am that racism is not a major problem in America anymore\nDespite the fact that you feel things are getting worse doesn't mean there's some major problem is it ruining your day is a stop and even going into a marketing ordering something if the person behind the counter happens to be a different race in yours of course not\nWe're getting along just fine here\nIn this country the third reason people don't say anything if\nYou tell the truth about how you feel and you're going to be called a racist or an Uncle Tom witness what's going on with Kanye West witness their retreat that Steve Harvey had to give you a quick story buddy of mine just told me the other day he's in a bar my buddy is white everybody in the bar is white and it's a sports bar just normally there are sports things on TV for some reason of local news\nAnd they were doing a story about how a bunch of dentist every year uh for for several days or lend their services for free to poor people are and they interviewed some woman happened to be black holding her baby\nAnd she was saying uh my baby needs braces my baby needs braces and some white guy said what about your baby 's husband what about your baby's father what about your husband what about your boyfriend where's eat\nAnd then some guy a table to over said hey that's racist and the guy that argument and the guy that said hey this race if eventually left because uh it was started to escalate to the point where who knows what might have happened so here you have all white guys one white guy saying out loud hey\nWhere's your where's the baby where's the father of your baby how can we can help us what he said how can the father of your baby can't help you\nSuddenly fit perfectly legitimate question he's called racist by another white guy\nSo the point is people don't talk once the upside I Want to say how I feel it's going to be politically incorrect and next thing you know I'm a bigger around when I called her\nIdeas of jets that racism is not a major problem in America and I'm Talking to somebody thinks it is what's the upside how am I going to prove it what what what am I supposed to say\nThat's why\nSo coach you're not helping anything and Matthew is Chris Matthews expose the game listen to this mainly for white\nPeople because white people won't vote for a guy most them if they think they're racist so of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get some off the hook you know what I'm saying\nNow Matthew is making two points although he doesn't realize that the first is\nMost people aren't racist sorry not secondly\nSince most white people will vote for somebody if they think they're racist if necessary for us to characterize that person has racist your brand Reagan's races to brand George W Bush's races to brand Donald Trump is races because most white people will vote for him to get in the heat races therefore we're going to characterize it raises\nThat's the one he's just exposing it\nMost white people coach are not racist or your friends races are you a racist or your friends' friends' races\nKnock it off Nineteen Ninety seven time CNN poll poll black teenagers and why teenagers have talked about this before both\nWill ask do you think racism is a major problem in America more whites team started wasn't black scene\nBut then they asked this do you think racism is a big problem a major problem or a big problem a I'm a ... ... minor problem or no problem in your own daily lives\nEighty nine percent of the black teens that racism was a miner or no problem in my daily life\nGrow up knock it off you gotta do three things get to the middle class coach you know this finish high school don't have the kid before you're twenty get married before you have that kid you will not be poor regarding this business about up to ... racism and and structural racism and\nAnd uh uh what's the other word as soon as you know structural and a systemic racism yeah\nAbout the police coach tell these young black men comply you will die\nVirtually all of these high profile cases would not have taken place had the individual flash suspect\nComplied and the Supreme Court has ruled even if the officer gives you an illegal order you must comply unless that Italy order your company with force so you're not helping any anybody coach and the big problem coach is in your lead look in the mirror for every player that does not have a kid\nIt's out of wedlock there's a player with to do something about that that is the number one probably in the black community number one problem in the country forty percent of kids in this country are born outside of wedlock that is a massive problem Seventy three percent of black kids coach outside of wedlock that's the problem\nNot racism knock it off\nTo be talking with Dr ... just a second one of the things we will talk about used the abduction and apparently the murder of this Washington Post reporter here's what Jake Tapper set about\nThis afternoon the president is denying he's giving cover in any way that it's out in the things he simply wants to find out what happened but that's about as top that the president was willing to get he\nHarsh words in the last week or so for Stormy Daniels Senator Elizabeth Warren and Taylor Swift than he has had for the Saudis responsible for the likely butchering and water of a Washington Post columnist ...\nWhile they are going I mean well uh CNN defense guy mud to this\nOne with more that's only half the bombshell here I mean the the really interesting part of this is an addition to the typical prosecutorial side of this as you report and the opening we're talking about a potential report a draft report and narrative if you will\nFrom other going over Rosenstein let me play this out watching it Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation they Congress I bet it's going to turn around and say we want to see that and and the Congress is going to leak there is going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictment I really want to see what's in that narrative of work\nSo we're gonna talk to Dr ... about CNN reporting that we may see more indictments from Robert Mueller and has a parent as president been dismissive about what's happened to the Washington Post journalist [noise] Hi I'm Larry Elder do not leave town\nLarry Elder Paul through all\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this polite tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused that I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time now a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't feel like that long ago it wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and yell before the cross what is it Ben five\nEven as a member of this was the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform remember that\nAgo a crazy thing to say absolutely not and and I\nAnd tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago or it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive ... executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your town in traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker ... since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that is a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from any of them\nThat's a shocking what is the same to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward [noise]\nThat's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWhen you're going to do\nWell um I'd like to continue to bring this to light

Dolly tape on it it just not right I don't care but\nI I I and I understand that you're bothered by what you proceed to be his bowling or you bothered by the fact that ABC NBC and CBS the last three months Ninety four percent of their news of Trump has been negative even as the economy is getting all time high unemployment all time low stock market all time high you think maybe\nThey can do a little better than Ninety four percent anti Trump coverage I'm asking\nWell yeah well I think that ... ... ... why\nWhy lie about all the things he did you see lying about unemployment if you're lying about the stock market is he lying about consumer confidence\nNot gray signing trying I mean forever it's not that great at economy and they hit ... actually it is we have\nActually it is name another
