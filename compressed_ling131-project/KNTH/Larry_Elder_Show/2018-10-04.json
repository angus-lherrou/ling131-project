there for just under a year\nWhen I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta by the honorable America's St Marie and two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success how how is it you ended up\nWhether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\n[noise] well a\nA year prior to my termination I published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Chris Jimmy and the book is called\nWho told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam in the

hadn't use public funds what business is it of the city of Atlanta\nOr the mayor of the city council or anybody or what's the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city's views\nAre and that I can have those you as
