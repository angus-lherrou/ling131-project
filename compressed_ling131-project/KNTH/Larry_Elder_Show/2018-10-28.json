income taxes you name it we talk about it and we try to have more fun than a human being should be allowed to have when talking about all of this boring financial stuff\nAnd this week we have a lot of boring financial stuff to talk about because man has it been event ball on the markets and we have so much to talk about what you are but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I have been a sort of I Am can write the host of money matters with Ken ...\n[noise] that you had\nBeen a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years [noise]\n\nI Do feel good and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients and as a farm are for money matters we specialize in retirement planning so we work primarily with people that are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon\nAnd that we currently work with over for a thousand four hundred beautiful wonderful families we are still\nBlessed and all the ideas that we talk about this show these are the same idea that we talk about with them every day of the week when we Visit Sunny over with you uh what what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances so first of all\nIf you haven't noticed the stock market the Dow the S. and P. have been on a decidedly downward path shall I say I'm over the last what six weeks now\nAnd uh so many of you who have been listening to show for many many years now may be wondering if it is time to get out of the ah stock market of the S. and P. and other things\nAnd so I've been getting a question a lot and it reminds me right now of two thousand seven and so as you guys may remember for those of you who've listened to the show for low those many years or who have been getting my weekly or market alert email\nYou know the uh in two thousand seven in November we uh we said it was time to sell it to get out of the stock market and and to stay out until June of two thousand nine when our by came\nAnd so those of you follow the advice route of the stock market during the credit crisis during the stock market crash of overweight\nAnd that there are some similarities right now to two thousand seven that I Want to share with you because it is looking like there's a there's a possibility that it may be time to sell so I Want to talk about that with you\nKnow also um this week we're going to continue or an hour a journey down the Eighteen important risk that you face during your retirement and we are a number eight this week\nAnd of course number eight is very timely since it's called market risk [laughter] I didn't plan that ahead but boy is it highly right I'm I'm kind of going in order\nAnd a number eight is market ... so what that means is that when you are a retired person or you are about to retire um that is\nOne of the biggest risks that you face in terms of your investments is that you get hit by a big downdraft in your investments and now you don't have as much as you add ones hatch so uh we're gonna talk about number eight market risk now also\nSince we are a a firm that specializes in retirement planning\nA one of the big topics that we talk about with clients are pretty much I Would say every time we visited seems like\nUm it's Social Security so we're going to have some ... we had to have some questions or that or I Want to share with you and of course the answers to those questions about Social Security that I think might be on your mind so we're going to have the social ... does security queuing day\nNow also in\nView of our philosophy so because we work with people who are mostly retired are retiring soon our philosophy of how to manage your money is preservation of principle comes first okay we want to grow your money certainly we want to give you the income all those things are important but first and foremost we want to make sure that we protect your principal\nBecause for you to be able to go out and enjoy the all the things that you want in your retirement\nIf you get hit by a big bad bear and it takes down twenty thirty or fifty percent of your money you know that's going to change a lot for you so I'm going to ask you the question the average bear market and this is according to Ned Davis research going back\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent and Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nAt age sixty or at age Seventy five which one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do\nYou got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great in the right and that's how most shows are just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to\nOf course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we're going to have our estate tip of the week\nAnd normally a that's you know that's the part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're going to talk about paying for college and not having to\nPay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gifts and college in most cases is more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a a we think the boys and Girls Club this one is a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society and a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called the sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala that are in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raise over three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life\nYou've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to yourself signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two dozen eleven or strategies said to sell both of those were very very near to bear markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may those two\nWhich we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out\nAnd uh those turned out to be near misses or they were close to bear market but they weren't and the market to rebound quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it's not like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I was very feeling now I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline of and then the same thing is how I feel now\nMajority of people did not expect it you know if everybody expected it probably wouldn't happen right\nSo therefore it's important that you prepare for it\nSo what I Want you to do is go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were there we have videos we have podcast we had

certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marble is wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same idea that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients\nSatan league do and I you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and uh so we we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisor refer money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's a thing we're proud of but without our clients we force probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go that's will kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is a second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive\nDelayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits and the answer is that uh the you can get\nSix months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth and it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months at age ...\nIf I'm with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy um one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply as can a person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re filed to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re filed okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss day form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they've paid you and then re filed later alright\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nAnd whatever you have this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you have enough money to retire on we call that the magic number we want to show you how to calculate that number\nWe we also want to talk about what our five strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four O. one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her ah the IRS once attacked eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we went [noise] I agree [laughter] and you know what we want to show you how to beat that if it\nIs a tall possible we want to talk about diversification or how much risk should you take with your portfolio we have a way of calculating that we call it your hurdle rate\nH U R D L E and so we're gonna talk about that at the
