seven little short of a hundred\nAnd not one of the European country now could be wrong if anybody has better information please provide it this is just a kind of a quick look and appears that Greg is completely wrong about his assertion that\nThat uh uh every a country in a in Europe or allows it in fact no country in Europe allows it ah and even ... have changed their laws so I'm just saying\nWell we've been doing is looking at the data\nAnd are just ... just don't see it but he Greg if you think I'm wrong call back and correct me and I've given you the quote from the draft or of that provision\nSubject to the jurisdiction there up in the fourteenth amendment senator Jacob powered hope this will not of course include persons born in the United states were foreigners\nSomehow some way that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted as meaning that anybody in this country whether legally or illegally so us on on our daughter on us soil that son or daughter is automatically an American citizen nonsense says the draft or of the fourteenth amendment\nAnd a Trump is right that is certainly rare uh he's wrong when he says we're the only country uh there are others or the other one uh I suppose that is um one of my calls significant Canada\nAbout Greg asserted then you heard him that every country in Europe or has a this kind of automatic birthright in every country in Europe does not in fact there is no country interrupted US Soccer match you nailed it anyway thank you very much for the call I appreciate I Want to get back to the anti Semitism in the Democratic

he didn't clarify the catch anything you can't leave\nOr if you don't have much information as you can connect other anew sees\nIt can actually wasn't too clear and the ... just to clarify\n... when you condemn her boss here and now\nI'm Sorry what would you condemn Hamas condemned for mass as\nA terrorist organ genocidal are you asking me to put myself on across\nSo you will I I actually had this experience many times you didn't read the pamphlet because the pamphlet this chapter and verse of the main connection is that the MSA is part of the Muslim Brotherhood network has revealed in the document\nI don't think you understand what I mean by that I met if I say something I'm sure that I Will be arrested for reasons of homeland security does he get please just answer my question\nIf you condemn Hamas homeland security\nAlly support ... gives you a question for me to condemn the last ...\nReally condemned\n... obviously supported case\nClosed [noise] I've had this experience I give\nYou I had this experience at UC Santa Barbara where there were fifty\nMembers of the Muslim students association sitting right in a row was there and throughout my our talk I kept asking them we condemn his blah and I'm off\nA and none of them would and then when the question period came the president of the Muslim students association was the first person to ask questions I said before you start\nWilliam condemn his ... and he said well my question is too complicated for a yes no answer so I said okay I'll put it to you this way I'm a Jew\nThe head of his ... has said\nThat he hopes that we will gather in Israel so he\nDoesn't have to hunt down globally\nPoint [noise]\nThank you for coming in showing everybody what what's here [noise]\nThat and although my recollection of my\nUm thought a European countries having the same um citizenship by birth situation was an accurate or may not be accurate I I'm not able to research or not but here's what I Want to emphasize\nDonald said we are the only country\nRight and he's wrong\nAnd and you dictated on on your show right now at least thirty five\nCountry correct correct okay\nAll all all the ... all the outlook on all of which all of which\nBy the Gregory in the western hemisphere except for except for Fiji and you said ah with with great confidence that every single European country did and you were just as\nWrong if not more wrong than doughnuts and most I think he's I think he said all of them believe\nThat most but my son was born in Germany mhm I Believe he would be affiliated with German um\nRight to the ship McGregor point with it but I'm not arguing that like I said I Can't research you know but right with your point may point is that Trump was wrong with Donald said we're the only country that's why and and there's no he's got a new research before it blows up\nLike that you know Greg I'm I'm sure he's done his research I gotta feeling he doesn't care I gotta feeling but his point is it's a stupid policy how outrageous it is it is rare\nThere's about what two hundred and fifty countries in the world only thirty of which allow this and they're not big countries by the way Arlen into bears and two thousand five France and appears in Nineteen Ninety three so I think his point is is outrageous but you're absolutely right Greg\nOr he is wrong and he should be more precise I agree with you\nI appreciate you very much and I hope you're a great show but it's very much at all be back again\nOkay you got a great thank you very much a rolling Martin a I'm a debate it and twenty sixteen over the
