wait don't tell me\nTell me how that applies to the case we're talking about in other words the case of a Baker who says look all all you\nCan buy any cake you one for me I don't want to do a special

else's fourteenth amendment rights but yet I'm going to finish this place but what I'm trying to say is that if she said she just too busy I Can't do it I'd like to but I'm otherwise occupied he would have been fine\nYeah she would have lied he would not have and find something\nYou want to stay out of trouble\nIt would have been very convenient for him to live and he didn't want to he's a person of faith and he didn't say he didn't say you you're going to go wait a minute he didn't he didn't attack the fourteenth amendment rights of his customer he said look find another Baker to bake this particular cake I actually I don't understand\nWhy it is and gay marriage is a law the land and and and you have to respect the law the land we all live here we all believe that it's the law the land\nHowever that does not mean\nThat somebody should be forced to uh to bake a cake he doesn't want to bake I I've talked before on this show there was a um a supermarket Baker who refused to do a

say I'll tell you what would be evil and we'll be illegal certainly in the state of Colorado and if if he said to the guy look I Can't serve you because you're gay event not that's against the law\nOkay and what I'm saying is that makes it so much easier because ah for example I'm a little bit overweight and somebody said no we're not hiring you 'cause you're you're overweight I could sue them but if they said we're not hiring you because we don't have any openings and now it's basically just a way of getting around along that's fine\nOkay but here it is a question of someone not wanting to lie and you're right it would have been easier for our nails flowers or were major for all these people to say oh yeah I'd love to work on your wedding but I'm busy that day\nUh I I don't

top priority or things like\nSanctuary states and single payer and the bullet train to know where we'll talk about that in just a few minutes\nBut first I Want to get back to Hillary Clinton\nRemember this cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\n[noise] where do we start with that\nWhat about traditional marriage\nAnd his Supreme Court case that alter the marriage laws for every single state when Obama ran he was asked about same sex marriage you posted Hillary posted\nObama said and I'm quoting him God is in the mix close quote\n\nA few years later he opposed traditional marriage\n\nWould you want to talk about your party that is undermining traditional values roe v Wade\nToday's decision Nineteen Seventy three struck down every single anti abortion law\nIn every state and federal ice issue that should be at the state and local level as Antonin Scalia so eloquently put it these are the kinds of matters that should be dealt with at the legislative process not before the courts healthcare\n\nObamacare one giant leap towards single payer\nAnd of course Obamacare was supposed to solve all our problems would have Joe Biden say when Obamacare was assigned quote it's a big ... fast forward it's not nearly far enough Obama's already know signed onto single payer knowing full well Obamacare was nothing more than a\nStop towards their eventually goal which is single payer and you want to talk about a party that's threatening traditional values and everything we stand for and don't get me started on sports and now they've taken politics to taking a knee\nAnd if you oppose that you're the problem my goodness this phony narrative of\nInstitutional systemic structural anti black police bias not only is it wrong not only do the fast not support the narrative but it's making things worse\nWrong Emanuel says fear of being accused of racist as cause police officers in Chicago to quote roles themselves into a fetal position close quote it'd be passive not proactive as a result\nCrimes gone up\nNo I haven't seen the numbers recently but a few months ago a year to year\nPolice deaths were a fifty percent\nYou think maybe just maybe the anti corporate hurricanes inspired some of these bad people officers Lou in Ramos in New York We're sitting in their squad cars and they were executed by some person who was inspired by the black lives matter movement we can we know that it's because he posted on his\nFacebook post\nCops in Dallas who were shot OK and execution style shot by a guy who also was motivated by the black lives matter movement because he said so he posted it\n\nYou can't even have dinner now you have people like\nJohn limited who's not a lawyer and his colleague it's the in ... at the CNN\nChris Cuomo who is a lawyer both saying that you have a First Amendment right into a restaurant a privately owned a restaurant and heckle and a fish person provided that person is a public official are you kidding me\n\nAnd you want to talk about a threat to values can tradition\n\nWhat did you actually want to say if you find a cabinet member surround them let them know they're not welcome anywhere anymore and you want to talk about\nAn attack on everything you stand for what incredible chutzpah now Donald Trump is frequently called a liar right let me play this clip from Hillary one more time listen very carefully what you said about the white vote\nLike when all women went for me and look white women have than a voting against democratic presidential candidates for a decade now\nWell because um people vote typically the way their spouse votes then if you're married you vote the way your spouse of votes but according to Hillary that means the man is telling them what to do right\nOr the white vote has only been one twice in the last ... I'm sixty years my husband being one of the two uh Lyndon Johnson being the other\nLet's hear that one more time since Donald Trump of course is a liar and\nAs only then won twice in the last ... I'm sixty years uh my husband being one of the two ah Lyndon Johnson being the other [noise]\nOkay now according to the rubber Center for public opinion which is based in ... a Cornell\nWhen Bill Clinton ran in Nineteen Ninety two\nHe got thirty nine percent of the white vote George Herbert Walker Bush got forty one percent and Ross Perot got Twenty one percent when Bill Clinton ran for reelection in Nineteen Ninety six he got forty four percent of the white vote according to the rubber center Bob Dole got forty six percent\nAnd Ross Perot got nine percent so let's let's hear that again and of course the person a tomb she told us the interview work either it's foolish or didn't want to correct her\nVote has only been one twice\nGo back a little further\n\nCandidate for a decade now or the white votes has only been one twice in the last I'm sixty years my husband being one of the two uh Lyndon Johnson being the other\n[noise] where do you mean to say\n\nThe bigger problem of course is the person who she was interviewing with who didn't say jak\n\nExcuse me a no your husband didn't\n\nNothing close thirty thirty nine percent Ninety Ninety two forty four percent in Ninety six\n\nNo George Herbert Walker Bush when a greater percentage of the white vote then your husband did in Nineteen Ninety two and Bob Dole won a greater percentage of the white folks and your husband did in Nineteen Ninety six you were wrong and of course you weren't correcting\nHeidi Heitkamp says she decided to vote against Kevin all because of his body language\nAnd you were obviously yes vote on on Capitol then switched to your vote to know after you re watched his testimony understand with the sound off I found that really interesting I'm Wondering can you explain what you saw with the sound off that we knew that change your mind\nWell I think I think first off it's it's important to know that I watched it now in its entirety I watched her testimony I watch their testimony I lift and and and ... with the sound down\nCouldn't tell that point of this hearing um I was preparing a statement saying I was going to be a yes I watch the hearing and during the process of listening I thought this is say this is um ... you know we expect someone to have the Koran we expect someone to have a judicial temperament\nAnd what I thought I thought was maybe tainted by what I heard and so I turned off the phone and watched it with the sound object is opening comment\nAnd um what I saw was someone who um was angry someone who is aggressive someone who really um I think a challenge everyone in the room and and you can understand that and appreciate that I mean\nOf course he was going to be angry but I think there is a way to express that anger and in ways that maybe I'm a think communicating or by like may have\nJudicial point what\nIn the white vote only been one twice now last than sixty year last sixty years um my husband being one of the two\nAnd no he was not one of the two charm so that's all I'm Talking about you were just wrong about that\nI I like that except for one thing she did say before that a white woman or a Republican or a decade I mean again I Would like it she was wearing white as white\nWell Shawn you're being awfully generous I Would like that people give the same kind of flexibility to things that Trump says Trump is a very imprecise speaker he says something he gets pounded and I want people to go well what he meant was this what he meant was that I think it's fair\nHe gets pound it for what he said about Charlottesville ... they're good people on both sides he wasn't saying they're good Nazis on both sides good fascist on both side good white supremacists on both sides he was talking about the argument about whether or not the Confederate statues memorials ought to be in the public square\nThere are good people on both sides and argue my mother and father didn't think they should be removed that what you're talking about\nSo we're going to hold 'em or Donald Trump to be very precise and if you said something of imprecise and you can interpret it the worst possible way the white can I Do that with Hillary\nWell when we met was a white woman if not what she said she was very very specific she said the Democrats have not won the white vote in last sixty years or need to do that again\nLike when all when they went for me and white women have than a voting against democratic presidential candidate for a decade now or the white votes has only been one twice\nIn the last um sixteen years uh my husband being one of the two\nOkay so she just dead wrong now I Want to talk real quickly about Derek Lewis Derek Lewis is that a UFC fighter that won his fight in a thunderous knocked down\nBy Donald Trump called the ...\nAnd he said if you are the for the fight Donald Trump called him and told and now the guy he was fighting is a Russian\n[noise] [noise] see how much the feet in the tank and if you're down the stretch [noise]\n\nLike Donald Trump called the totally forgot about those Russians\nCouldn't make it look bad for those who [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom calling me and told me no knock this Russian
