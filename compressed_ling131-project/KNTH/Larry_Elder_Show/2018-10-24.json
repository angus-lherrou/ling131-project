I Do want to say one thing\nJust because someone is Middle Eastern of course there are no Middle Eastern people there but that doesn't mean that there have added doesn't mean that they're terrorists how do you know that\nWe were in this world now where Trump can say Middle Eastern and everybody then immediately somehow began to think of terrorists of most of the terrorists that we are as we've had the United states are not being committed by Middle Eastern people by Muslims\nThere being committed by right wing stream within our own country but I just did this was a lie on top of lie on top of lie wrapped up in live and then with his life and then on top\nBut so we should just let fourteen thousand people come here that's all and if fourteen thousand more when a company can come to\nThis

himself at a nationalist and today in the in the oval office you clarified\n\nBecause if you want me to this lady is you\nWhat I'm saying or\nDoes that mean by love our country tend to our country has taken several second federal if you look at the trade deals and nobody knows it better than me\nI'm knocking down some of the worst deals I've ever seen what we're getting all of our wealth all of our money to other countries and then they don't treat us properly\nWhere we're protecting other rich countries very very rich countries including by the way a country that happens to be very much that it was Saudi Arabia\nImmensely wealthy and we're taking care of the military for a fraction of the costs not fair to us other countries also immensely wealthy\nCountries of we have to get reimbursed for that we should not be the world's police keeper and not get reimbursed and by the way when I bring up to the edge of the countries like Japan\nPrime minister I'll be a friend of mine I bring it up he looks at me and he goes I understand they understand that nobody has ever asked them for what I said have you ever asked I shouldn't have you ever been asked like\nYou have to be like ... nobody's ever asked so that's a pretty unfair thing I'll get back to get back to his wait wait wait wait\nPresident said all I Want is for our country to be treated with respect that's what he means pieces nationalist do we know he's a white nationalist that's a bone thrown to the races except\nMaybe for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\nBefore a couple of seconds I should have a pretty good report very so yes I\nWas just fall under known as the losers were sending coded language ... somewhere in there that were really\nThere is a concern that you're assuming recorded message a dog whistle out there there is a concern passionate voice you mean that's what you think he's doing this you\nI've never even heard that I cannot imagine that you mean I I'm a naturalist I never heard that theory\nAbout being a nationalist I've heard I'm all for it I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany Spain one percent of GDP report of course the Jim Acosta\nFor NATO and we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair I don't like it wasn't as an example we're protecting a hero and we're paying for almost the entire cost of the day that we're paying for a very very substantial portion\nFar greater than what it should be a we have great respect for those countries but on top of that I don't like it when they put up barriers to our farmers were farmers cannot sell it to Europe they have trade barriers that make it you guys do it better than anybody than trade barriers that are as severe\nAs China's trade barriers which really coming down they want to make a deal very badly there'll be coming down\nBut I Am very proud of our country and we cannot continue to allow what's happened to our country to continue to have one cat when that happens so I'm proud proud of our country but I Am a nationalist is a word that has it been used to launch\nSome people use it but I'm very proud I think it should be brought back find somebody that wants to help other countries of the world\nBut I also have to take it women take care of our country we cannot continue to allow ourselves to be due to the military and also dumped on trade\nWith the European Union as an example last year on trade when all is one hundred and fifty one million dollars on top of that we lost hundreds of billions of dollars on protection so we protect\nAnd we get killed [noise] we we do the training and they get killed you can't do it I Want it to be fair so I Want them to open their borders I Want them to make it fair for our farmers are are companies now by medical companies they sell medical equipment they just put restrictions on\nYear and a half ago with a medical equipment can't get into Europe even though it's better than what they are so they have to treat as well all I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours so called allies\nThey have not treated with our country fairly so in that sense I Am absolutely a national is that I'm proud of it yes yeah for me that um this\nLast

imagine for a moment that he wasn't a liberal darling\nThat he wasn't a democratic nominee for governor of the state this this kind of scandal would have sunk him\nAnd there's something else that that people are just wrong about I mean one of the big democratic issues that they're trying to raise across the country in the last Thirteen Days the election\nIs that President Trump is they hate filled beget and he wants to make war on transgendered people and wipe them out and send in a concentration camps et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAnd or can we agree here that\nGender identity should be an inter individual matter and that it should not be decided by the federal government\nAnd basically that is what the Trump Administration wants is not to impose\nFederal standards about how you respond to somebody else who says I'm a woman\nEven though he may be biologically equipped as a man and by the way in the New York times they have a a\nA big piece very sympathetic is transgender as Mrs anatomy does not determine gender experts say but there's this section and that I think is fascinating\nThey write and no one knows for sure why body and mind sometimes do not match\nBut being transgender is not a matter of choice Dr safer they quote this expert says it is not a fad or women for transgender people that have generally an overwhelming sense that their gender is not the one on their birth certificate and gender is not about whom they're attracted to it's about who they are\nBut see if they get the right to be who you are\nThat doesn't mean that you have the right to demand that the government's force everybody else\nTo accept that can we leave this deprive a choice and get the federal government out of this and at\nThe very worst have some kind of state policy

important show for you are coming up uh over the next three hours\nYeah one hour from now I'm very much looking forward to hearing from my my friend Kurt slicker hurts liquor is a town hall senior columnist or account all the time he was also the author of a brand new book called militant normalcy and he\nPulls no punches\nYou take no prisoners whether we're talking about caravans coming from Central America or whether we're talking about pipe bombs or fully pipe bombs or suspicious packages or whatever it is that you want to call them\nHe is ready to go hard core so perch liquor will be joining me about one hour for now at the top of our number two so if you are settled in and able to listen wherever you might be\nYou're going to want to hear that conversation also I've got conversation scheduled for the broadcast a today slashed tonight uh with some pretty important in a press if people are ... listen I sat him for Hugh Hewitt on his Salem Radio show this morning\nSo I did his program and as part of that regular schedule um I've got an opportunity to speak with an MSNBC liberal anchor slash host\nOr by the name is Stephanie rule you probably know about her you've probably heard clips played from her and all of her I got a chance to talk to her to say that it was\nMm entertaining\nI think was an understatement enough so that I feel like replaying it for you it's only about five and a song that so much time there but in the morning drop clock but I Want you to hear from Stephanie ruled just to get a feel for what the liberal point of view is as it pertains to President Trump and his supporters headed into these midterm elections\nBecause the president can't say anything without the liberals adding words to his statements in order to make them sound offensive\nAnd you know exactly what I'm Talking about\nThe left going crazy about the president two nights ago speaking in Houston, Texas on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz at a sold out Toyota sold out packed jam packed Toyotas center with thousands of more people outside\nThe president declared user nationalist that is a dog whistle we're told that is an absolute state minutes a color code coded language to the base saying I'm with you a white supremacist wow and what\nYeah I'm going to talk about that we're going to I'm gonna play back for you\nThe conversation that I had with Stephanie rural also going to talk about what nationalism really means with where he has some ah who is a very impressive person he was a a close senior advisor national barrage when uh the Brexit was decided\nAh we're in England or in Europe rather a when Great Britain decided to essentially remove itself from\nAh do you and you know what that is that as an actor of\nNationalism we're going to talk to ... uh and then also as it pertains to the ongoing and ever marching inexorably\nToward the southern border of the United states the northern border of Mexico that Central American caravan now believed to be some fourteen thousand strong [noise]\nAh what does it mean for the United states and what can we do to stop\nWhat I think most of us would agree is an invasion it is not a migration it is an invasion RJ home and is the director of governmental affairs for fair the federation for American immigration reform so we've got that coming up next to ours are also a lot of really good people to talk to including crutch like there are ... ... ...\nStep in rural from a conversation that I had with her earlier today\nBut the lead story of course that we have to get into is who is sending explosive well potentially\nExplosive devices to prominent Democrats in New York and in Washington DC the homes of George Soros the Clintons Brock Obama and others apparently have been targeted for these suspicious packages let's get a little check your of the news on this from Fox\n... latest tallies six packages were confirmed threats three in New York at the home of billionaire George Soros on Monday and today it's CNN and one address to the home of bill and Hillary Clinton in ... for which Mrs Clinton at a campaign stop in Florida thanked Secret Service who intercepted\nAnd dress she last long before it made its way into our homes\nAnother was addressed to the Obamas in Washington and also to Florida in Maryland for Democrats five packages were cleared three in California and one received by New York's governor\nSo this of course all happening less than two weeks before the midterm elections and uh right now as you can imagine the finger of blame is being pointed\nIt's being pointed by the American left by which I mean elected Democrats\nMembers of Democrat activist groups members of the DNC and members of the Democratic controlled media which is to say virtually all media there isn't a conservative talk radio when maybe that Fox News report\nThe finger of blame is being poured it squarely at Donald Trump and Donald Trump psychotic supporters\n[noise]\nIt is um an astounding thing uh hypocrisy when you see and hear these kinds of things when Steve skull lease was nearly murdered on a baseball field\nNot too terribly long to do\nWhat Eighteen months ago someone than ever win Steve ... was nearly murdered and when an entire softball field or a baseball field\nFull of Republican elected officials congressional members practicing for a baseball game were attacked by what we came to find out to be a radical extremists Bernie Sanders socialist who wanted to murder as many Republicans as possible\nDo you recall what the Democrats said do\nNot point the finger of blame at Democrats for these psychotic actions of somebody who happened to support one of us you can't put blood on our hands because one not we didn't tell him to do that we didn't tell him too\nTo try to murder people that's not on us right this is what they said very loudly very clearly under repeatedly\nNow those very same Democrats who said you can't blame 'em his politics for his decision to try to commit mass murder on Republican members of Congress on a baseball field you can't blame his politics are now saying you must blame the politics of people we don't even know\n\nWe have no earthly idea at this point in time\nWho sent delivered made fabricated or whatever any of these could be would be might be potentially explosive devices and sent them to Soros CNN the Clintons and the Obamas\nWe have no idea but without knowing who it is they are ready to say it's Trump's fault\nAnd its Trump supporters fault because President Trump doesn't like the media President Trump demonize is the media especially CNN and therefore his followers are carrying out what he wants to have done to them\nThat is exactly what they're spending their time doing meanwhile there are others myself included\nAsking for at least a modicum of patients asking for just an idea\nJust every give us at least a hint of an idea of who this is before we start describing motive and blame because there are a lot of people who six suspect that this close to the mid term elections that this is a false flag and these are things being done by liberals to try to embarrass\nAnd to try to hold where conservatives and Trump supporters accountable for this where a lot to digest year we want you to be a part of the show triple eight nine seven ... seven ... seven two or three by France in Fort Larry

working\nAbout the people of the globe then you are about the people in your own country versus nationalism which is putting our people first the people that are elected me and then I'll deal with the rest of the globe second between those two I'm a nationalist\nThat is exactly what President Trump said and what did the left ear well Jim Acosta tells you what the left her\nJust rather than just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a

globe burst in our country second a nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear that this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree given president history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history\nI prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election or he is capitalizing on the ... so we're going to agree to it with what you're saying\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not cause you to do and it sounds so now what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many at president has said over the years and it's why it make someone like me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable and it's very you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway you you know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries and taking advantage of the United states if I have to use terrorists if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better job market is that now is not an economic nationalism but is that not economic\nNationalism is my question not if you look at the way the president of south that gives you the truth\nChat an impact he would engage in saying like GTC point out and partner with our allies\nThat have been jak say Seventy rural thank you for coming on the first year that she is on ice envy that live at the top of that music can\nBe on there of course was the end of the top of a interview that I did with a seven year old this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that to and um but when I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight nine seven\nOn stage um she said she's not putting words in the president's mouth but she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global let's put the world's first in our country second\nPut our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she and Jim Acosta are saying\nThis rather just to follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national I've\nNever I mean that's if that's not putting words into somebody's mouth for the purpose of trying to tear them down\nThen nothing is he literally said why did you skip the word white don't you mean white nationalist he stuck to stuff that weren't in his mouth I asked up and he wrote about it and she said no we're not putting words in his mouth that's just what he meant because he's been dog whistling and using coded language from the very beginning\nFor goodness sakes the president of the United states has set on numerous occasions I was not elected president of the world I was elected president of the United states it's my job to serve the people who elected me they are first\nI Want to give one great example that I cannot take credit for\nOne great example I think this is just the perfect analogy alright\nOn Twitter this morning when I brought this up and I had the conversation with Stephanie rule [noise]\nSomebody tweeted to me and you can do so as well as France radio F. R. A. N. T. Z. somebody pointed to me and said you know when the airline attendant tells you to put the oxygen mask on yourself first on your children second there's a reason for that because you are no good to your child if you are passed out\nThat's nationalism\nIf we don't take care of ourselves in the United states first we are no good to anybody else around the world that is economic nationalism that is military nationalism that is taking care of yourself first and then being able to help others the president is right\nYour reaction please it eight nine seven months age coming right back by president for Larry Elder on a celebrated on network\nYou're listening to the Larry Elder show [noise]\n\n\nAm ten Seventy FM one oh three three the answer five fifty two [noise]\n\nWant to say something about relief factor you know eighty percent of the people who've tried there will effect a quick start by it again it would not happen if the stuff didn't work now\nYou're already taken care of your body so you can take care of your family\nIf your body the essential nutrients that need to help fight the pain for example Stephanie from Florida I have my own business it requires a lot of muscle work I've always been concerned about painkillers messing up my liver when I heard about released after I decided to give it a try because it's natural\nNow I'm able to get through my day with minimal pain versus before\nWhen I had to be almost in tears coming home and I couldn't do anything but lay down and wait for the pain to subside my pain you take control of my life but now I Am in control\nWhy don't you try the three week quick start Nineteen dollars and Ninety five cents that works out to Ninety five cents a day for pain relief with a cup of coffee a day just going to release factor\nDot com relief factor dot com that's released factor dot com\nAm seven days the answer are you tired of you know I can you can get in jobs and living paycheck to paycheck\nOf course you are you dreamed about getting involved in the signing where all the fix and flip houses at wholesale real estate Daniel Scott from the matrix censorship academy can show you how to earn a six figure incomes working less than ten hours per week matrix mentorship academy is seeking apprentices to enter their Ninety Days training and mentoring program\nAnd learn how to find wholesale them fund purchases located viruses out profitably fixing five houses and the voice of mistakes mostly these\nMake trying to get darn matrix mentorship academy momentum uses the entire process can bring your deals to a profitable conclusion to make a positive change in your financial future this is a matrix mentorship academy dot com website foreign policy ways one five six oh three zero zero nine\nUses real estate market is hot and now is it time to get started that the matrix mental shift academy dot com I called the only one five six oh three zero zero nine\nNow you can save about half off on closing restaurants home improvement item you very attractive and more teachers a new online shopping sites all use them say\nGo to Houston saves dot net this week's election their new items out in each week to keep checking to see what's new is so you don't miss out on something great go to Houston have done this week we're featuring\nFamily moved back to the Lone Star flying museum at half right this is the gallery one aviation history and more sort of Houston said not to get your tickets [noise]\nWas from New York and I'm Renee I'm Seventy the answer your military or radio show [noise]\nIsrael front lines of freedom will talk terrorism was terrorism expert Bruce you get real discussion Holocaust with other jobs shock and we're also talking about the importance of voting day we'll ... we'll discuss this week service which I root for long\nLines of freedom of Saturday Night live on a um ten Seventy flea as anybody can have the voice we have the answer am ten Seventy the answer [noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the Larry Elder show [noise]\nIndeed Bob brand sitting in for Larry and they pay for it really factor studios recently factor ...

book out and ah who is pulling no punches he does not pull punches in his writings he does not pull punches when he writes columns for\nA town hall ... he's a senior columnist there and he does not pull punches in interviews he also does not pull punches on Twitter and he had a lot to say which made me sick coach liquor author of\nMilitary normal regular Americans\nDemocracy on the on the reality shows\nAnd he said let's do those things are going to have you back my man how are you [noise] hey man great to be here\nBut I I there's so much ground to cover I Would like to do the pleasant trees and everything else I wanted to talk about your book but I wanted to talk about all of these issues going on Tucson diving right in do you buy\nThe right wing pipe bomb conspiracy or with all of these things being center Soros Obama's Clinton's and CNN because China weeks two weeks before the election Kurt I Do not buy it for one second national false flags being plan to go ahead\nI think it is more likely than not not a right wing conservative outlier doing this work\nUh eight is one of three things at the right wing conservative outlier it is a nut who was a political and just wacky or it is a someone uh allied with a lap attempting to do exactly what's happening now which is a conservative suburb violent Bob guys um\nIf you look at the evidence that we are constantly told how a random shooters are going to turn out to be you know and are a Christian\nYou know Republicans I may never never we know that a Democrats have been urging violence and a ... attack ... we know that the law has a history of bombings just look at the Nineteen sixties and seventies indisputable\nOr that they did it all it's also indisputable that we did see a nearly endless theories of hoaxes mostly hate crime hoaxes on campus as an adult\nWhere someone gets something horrible ideas swastika or news or something and it turned out to be the very same a social justice warrior victims are trying to create a pressure\nI don't know the answer you don't know the answer but I Will tell you this I Am not going to allow the leap to tell me that I Can't look at the facts and fake\nThis is a viable possibility I were to blame Donald Trump and sixty three decent Americans who are built this country feed it you'll end up ...\nA a base on the the the the the the sketchy narrative I think what we call it we'll live\n[noise] Kurt for the president came out yes or to today rather and did what a president should do so did the vice president by the way and they called for an end to this they called for civility they called for a no more violence\nHe said very clearly quote in these times we have to unify we have to come together in some one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts or threats of political of any time I\nHave no place in the United states of America well that was absolutely\nTrue that we thought of course it's true but but but hold on ... this is what I wasn't really react to\nThe response to that from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority minority leader Nancy Pelosi was to rip President Trump suggesting that he didn't mean it saying quote from President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts\nOf violence think well this statement hurt the party that actually has Maxine Waters and Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton and countless others out they're calling for acts of violence and instability in the public forum they're the ones saying that it's Trump and the Republicans who are responsible for violence start\nWho look they are ... are they are blind and stupid because they missed ...\nThank God if only someone wrote a book called militant normal available on Amazon about this very subject they think we're stupid they think we're stupid because Democrats are used to dealing with stupid people that is for rank and file Democrats [noise]\nIt's not going to work\nThis is going to have the same effect as they thought Kevin always a great idea let's track that guy in a drink beer and you know had fought in high school that's pressure and the ... that destroyed their blue wave\nHere is another example of a situation that the date laid it like sensible adults could only benefit them political but they will not do it they will apply to bigotry and prejudices against normal Americans and try and paid ... merit as\nSome sort of a set of violence psychopaths\nAnd normal Americans are going to say that's just not for you know whoever did this clearly need to go to the weather is a rightwing outlier a yacht well maybe you need to go to the house or a leftist trying to disrupt um\nAnd there is not a single conservative out there who condones this violence there is not one\nUp here I heard that that's that's a big part of this because\nThe the moment even when Nancy Pelosi got shouted down by a bunch of people calling her communist just a few days ago kind of echoing and Mary ... there's been done to\nTed Cruz and and and Mitch McConnell and link challenge is to ah serve Sanders and so in the summer of immediately conservative condemned condemn condemn cannot you can't do that stop that nonsense we don't like it when it's done to us do not do it to them dishes bull crap we're better than that\nNow this uh these these ... you know explosive devices potentially we don't even know by the way right now what they are or or where they came for all we do know immediately we condemn condemn can never get them\nWhen the left is doing all of these things Kurt over and over and over again when these leftist mobs antifa et cetera et cetera et cetera are carrying out these acts I'm Still waiting for the first word of hey don't do that from anybody in a in a position of authority on the American last none\nBut when you won't you won't see because they're not against their poor\n... they're there for that that's the difference in the normal people that\nThey've got about had about good six eight hours of this where where they could have taken the high road and maybe maybe scores of political points that support or ... or ... points but once again have overplay their hand\nBecause they hate us normal people so much they don't even bother to try and understand where we made me coming from so that they might be about crap the message that appeals to us instead they say you know Trump's encouraging violence\nAnd they look a Trump and he's not encouraging violence and they look at themselves and they're not racist sex with hate filled and they don't like buying less\nUh and they didn't like it when as normal Americans do they went overseas and defended their country\nThey are immediately said this is more democratic below me and\nYou know they are not going to discount the possibility this is from a too clever by half lock this\nCrying by sending you know bombs and apparently don't work very well and uh uh to people who ... who they know we're going to screen them to catch up and you know that ... that is entirely possible that in Iraq a discount that possibility and no one should discount that possibility\nThe the the topic is what the facts are and\nYou know of actually either this person will never be caught for the secret service and happy either grab them and we will find out who this person is and you know why\n[noise] conflict or is my guest the author of militants normal she's a senior column on hold up Tommy is also an attorney and the Los Angeles California occurred I Want to hit the nationalism part of the story is well yesterday or another choose me two nights ago in Houston, Texas\nA stumping for Ted Cruz in his race against ... or ... percent of a president said this\nNationalist [noise] course immediately\nYou heard of Jim Acosta jumped up and said wait a minute yeah what did what did what job that's not Jim Acosta this\nWasn't just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national I'm no I don't know how\nYou get white nationalist out of the list but what I mean honestly it's like he's playing the Google auto fill he started to type in the word Lazarus do you mean white nationalist and the left is going crazy ever since occurred makes a lot of water\nI first of all I Love it when Democrats excites against Americans who say I love America more than other country you're free to hold that position going into the electric don't let me stop you go right ahead you won't be in that fire\nAnd ask for that you're really mean white nationalist there is a concern that white nationalist okay that's not true there is no concern meeting among really stupid people but the concern come from a liar\nOkay so you were either an idiot or you or a liar or maybe both but we have you if you're starting there there's no other option because it's demonstrably false and one that\nYou know you have a normal Americans do I want you know I I I like America I was in the show I was in the air force for five years\nYou know before I came home and I don't like that her stay and fourth of July I I I like America I I'm proud to be American and they're telling me that makes me a racist I don't think I'm going to cost them with my vote\nOr ... or their wires\nNormal militant normalcy just regular Americans anyone who is ever so call it brought this up to me and my morning show this morning and said anybody has ever reciting the pledge of allegiance is reciting I'm a nationalist I Am pledging allegiance to this flag of this country\nNot to the un not to the rest of the world to this flag that means this is where my allegiance lies that's nationalism how did that become a dirty word\n... I don't know like when I when I uh first enlisted and then became an officer in the army for twenty seven years\nRight and I was not you know my my goal is\nTo defend the United states of America yeah I I work with allies and protected foreign people off because that was in America's interest to do that with what my the the electric president ordered me to go and I did it a gladly and proudly but I did it you know the war on my shoulder was the American why exactly\nThat's what you fought for and that's the country that you represent and that's the country that Donald Trump represents and he made that very clear as I pointed out before when he um pulled us out of the Paris climate accord said I'm worried about the people of Pittsburgh not Paris that's nationalism and that's patriotism\nThe book as militant normal regular Americans are rebelling against the lead to reclaim our democracy by ...\nGet it now the militant normal thank you my friend\nHey thanks for having me you've got five branches were Larry over we're back after this\nWhether the traffic update already am ten Seventy that's in one of the three three the answer\nTo that sarin news on the seniors in Washington\nNew York city police commissioner James O'Neill says investigators are reviewing security video and see if they can identify a career believed to have delivered a package containing a pipe bomb to CNN's Manhattan off a\nMeal set an appearance on CNN he was pretty sure those images will be caught on video and we'll be able to find out where that person came from packages containing explosives also targeted Hillary Clinton former President Obama and others\nOther part of selling brick Wall Street Wednesday sending the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than six hundred points and extending a losing streak for the benchmark at some ... five hundred index to a six day\nThe tech heavy NASDAQ Composite bore the brunt of the sell off leaving it more than ten percent below it's August peak what Wall Street calls a correction this is ... are in New\n... stuck in traffic we got the answer [noise]\nSix thirty one sixty six degrees are loaded and I did I loved her sixties maybe he might get lucky that the upper fifties northeast breezes five to ten miles are going to shift to the north after midnight yeah your chance grains up there it's at a hundred percent you knew rainfall amounts between one and two inches of possible [noise] oh well\nThat sounds locking or write laying the ISI amusement park like south on the ship channel ... father also highly Ninety nine at the grand parkway than at you at the Ninety an accent blocking the right lane and writes Celtics look out for I saw on the left side I think he feel am ban and Washington DC I'm Debbie sex and that's the only thing he didn't area topic\nShabby I married you've met size you are providing for sculpting ... didn't know surgery came out by something packaging get one free Tom I'm blind marriages that time to find your location near you\nYou're on a um ten Seventy F ... three three the answer Bob friends as in Larry Elder am ten Seventy the answer\nOkay it is you wake up this morning you're feeling tired your neck was hurt in Europe or back was her they be the problem is that ...
