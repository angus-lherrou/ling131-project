us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that as we get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your alive and you know why and you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year we're almost out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing that somewhere else too but I'm going to give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy has that step by step plan\nThat step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ends up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow and the\nOnly attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month ... the gym membership skyrocket but at the same time\nThat you're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal it is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little go away we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places

need you to call now and reserved those seats\nBefore we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am ... the host of money matters with Ken were raped\n[noise] jak I've been\nIn the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting you\nKnow\nAnd I do and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh as at the end of last month we not work with over eight thousand families in forty three states we are honored we are privileged\nAnd recently parents named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states\nAnd this is actually the sixth year in a row and without our clients that would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you I Hope you guys listen to the show right now are having an absolutely fantastic weekend I Hope everything is coming up roses for you and we have a great show so let me go over with\nYou what we're talking about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances wherever they show up for you and I we absolutely do add\nSo as money matters are from his grown and I'm just mentioned that we have a we were not work with over eight thousand families what I've also come to realize is that we have a great responsibility to those clients\nAnd you know when I first started this business back when I was a a you know I said I've been in his business now for twenty nine years so I was actually four years old when we started and when I was four years old [laughter]\nYou know I didn't quite you know I I I never didn't think that we would be where we are today but I actually also didn't really think about that we are going to be where we are today I just kind of went with it and you know as things progressed to just kept on going so now as it's as as we come to where we are\n[noise] I've come to the point where I realized that we have a responsibility to all these families that we work with\nAnd so one of the things that I thought about was you know you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do [laughter] that would be a bad thing right so one of the things that we decided to do was that we would have what we call ... one hundred\nAnd vision one hundred is that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong as not stronger as it is today\nSo how do you do that how do you build a company that's going to be here a hundred years from now serving our current clients their families down the line and all those kinds of things and so to do that\nI studied a variety of companies that have been in business for a hundred years to see how they did it\nBecause if you think about it the last hundred years have been you know fraught with all kinds of things you have world wars we've had a you know bad economic times we've had boom times technology's changed I mean everything it's like all kinds of stuff happened but yet these companies endured and so what was it that enabled them to endure\nAnd so I Want to take you this uh this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and then you're investing life because we're a financial adviser for him\nSo it'll it it it it sounds kind of a you know philosophical this week but I think we're going to I'll bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as a from\nWhat we've decided is that we have to go so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy that helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to accomplish\nSo in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are now we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want them to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that and philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nWhen you retire we specialized work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a beer market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially if you just lost your money you're you're you're not financially or have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six a core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing I always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever to sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that now\nIn our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's\nAbout what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOff a skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nKnow so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something\nYou know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if it's for example if you lied on your resume to get a job and you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume\nAnd we'd like to work with you if if if we could so here's my offer if you go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot

lot of people move here and ah we have we have a national reputation of being a phoney town now\nUm by the way I wanted to write letters or something there's so many great interesting unusual things about you but one of them and I do lots of stories over the years about events around town that you can go to a costumes\nAnd um I I Love it now a lot of people think that the only time you were a costume is like a Halloween party\nBut I've actually found to be if you look around there's many things throughout the year round that\nI mean there is like the Dickens on the strand in Galveston where you can dress up in those type outfit but I Love you know wearing costumes and a lot of different things\nYou've actually won a lot of big time costume a contest where did you first and then ends in lots of different things not just a ... even like some in St Patrick's Day et cetera when did you first start becoming interested in in like entering costume content\nSo my mother a made me a star wars costume when I was a kid I think like a Nineteen Seventy six I Would have been eleven years old and uh I Know I was a ... it was awesome and I think I was\nFrom that moment [noise] um [noise]\nYeah and then the first time I did as an adult I did the wicked witch after the house fell on her\nAnd ah anyway I think I spent all are Fifteen dollars to make that kind of\nWhat it was ...

Ireland and yeah it was actually in Ireland\nAnd uh yeah they put two and a little beard and a hat\nWith the little body and then you bring bring your hand through the curtains so yeah you look like a little ... as they're\nNot saying I Want to ask you about before we get into the apartment world does we do a lot of travel stories on the Houston you've traveled to lots of places around Africa isn't mentioned Ireland\nBut one place she just got back from ah the summer they spent several weeks was Costa Rica I personally love Latin America do I think that's the main focus of our travel stories is a central and South American the Caribbean\nI have not yet been to Costa Rica I've talked to a lot of people have been there what are some [noise] some of the your comments about traveling to Costa Rica maybe a few tips and one of the things that you liked about it [noise]\nOkay so I Do love Costa Rica I bought some property there when I was a twenty four years old so I've had a a real excitement about the country for years a beautiful uh uh landscapes great waterfalls whitewater rafting horseback riding\nA Costa Rica has a big mountain range that runs through the center of that and so there's sort of the Caribbean side which I don't have a lot of experience with but I have really traveled on the Pacific side\nI really love the area near meanwhile Antonio park\nA it's sort of their version of Yellowstone Park [noise]\nUm but yeah there's so much did in the area of great restaurants horseback riding waterfalls now you can waterfalls really amazing waterfall down there that uh [noise]\nYou get to my horse\nAs you fly direct down there or just stop\nSo when you fly in to Costa Rica you're either going to go to Liberia which is the smaller of the two airports that would be if you're ending up in the northwest corner of the country what does that direct from Houston yeah you can find directly from Liberia I typically fly into San jose which is the capital of the country in the center\nAnd a gay pride directly he's tend to ah San jose Costa Rica it's about a three hour and Fifteen minute fly\nA lot of uh Americans are actually retiring down there was a draw about that [noise]\nSo I'm certainly the cost of living is less um if you're willing to live like a Costa Rica and you can live there very cheaply if you want to live down there and like an American maybe not so cheaply\nBut the people are nice the weather is fantastic [noise] um the food is all very organic and fresh a wonderful seafood uh vegetables\nYeah it's just a great lifestyle to me it almost seems like maybe what Hawaii was fifty years ago or maybe what some parts of Mexico where fifty years ago not is spoiled by a [noise]\nA big hotels and\nChain [noise] now\nLet's talk about you and your business um first of all just has a background or do you like where you grew up and how you got into the career you're in now\nSo my mother was a real estate agent and sometime in the seventies she went into a special part of the real estate here in Houston right here to be so sometime in the Seventy she went into a well we call apartment locating and so as a child\nThat's what my mom did she was an apartment locate her [noise] um I always resisted going into the business I went off to college and became an accountant where'd you go to college I went to Texas and I went out there in the summer of eighty four\nOh you're an aggy what what did you study there\nUh accounting I mean if I end up getting an accounting degree anyway so um for about Fifteen Years I was an accountant\nFor small firms doctors lawyers stuff like that\nBut then in Nineteen Ninety eight [noise] um I was actually doing the bookkeeping for my mother's company and I saw how much money are agents are making which was literally three times what I was making as an accountant\nSo I decided to give it a try I'm a I'm not sure I was quite a natural but I certainly grown up around it and did very well my first

Ramadan we're going to talk a little bit about his business a little while there are new spots are on our show but the Howard's a real interesting guy with the kind of interesting things we can spend hours talking but we're getting just got to give you a little bit of a sample of some of the things he's been involved with over the years old he's doing now\nHoward before we even talk about a little bit about you and your background in your business I Want to do that says we're doing a promotion about a Franks a restaurant here I Would I invite you have to eat I didn't know if you knew about this place and found out that you're actually a a regular hear what it is that you like about Frank\n[noise] because um [noise]\nIt's the food is good prices writing this quiet and you can hear yourself think more importantly it's very close to my home and my office governor and very very often and I like Mike as the guy who owns it so\nI always like to go to places where I Know the\nLitter or one or two the the items you must enjoy eating\nWhere when I heard today was the tomato bloom I like the avocado and tomatoes like the shrimp and grits [noise]\nThose are the three I most of the time\nOr I get now was find that a little bit about you Howard tell us a little briefly your background like where you grew up maybe what you went to high school and college and how you ended up in Houston [noise]\nWell my father was was a rough neck\nStone wall Louisiana and\nSort of working for Texaco and were protects go all his life so is this child I went with him and made bouncing around here there and you know and I was born in New Orleans\nFrom Houston to new Canaan Connecticut\nIn all those places I went to high school I went to a Deerfield Academy which is a British school of Deerfield, Massachusetts in ... new Canaan school and went to school\nOn from there on the University of North Carolina for a year and asking for three\nBefore where you are I found out while we're having less you're you are somewhat of an athlete you uh were involved in the downhill skiing and hockey and uh football I usually moved to Texas to those Fords kind of a took a little bit of a back seat not near as much hockey it's getting\nLess true but actually the the hockey and there was a market being played here in Houston when they had the arrows I was actually on the board of the arrows and go to our name came here [noise] and my scheme to turn for the vast because out and started going to Colorado\nOr the scheme was wonderful compare to what I was used to in New England\nOkay now I'm you are one of the co founders of moody Rand been um and uh who who tell us who moody as [noise]\nWho at least Dan Moody it's not the Galveston loses the Houston Moody's and\nThen I just run into each other um\nStrictly by happenstance and we both had the same idea that a patio homes or zero online homes were just being started in Houston and we were both kind of fascinated by that morning to do some so that's how we teamed up and so the name of our company originally was patio owns eight\nAnd then we went from there\nOr we just sat at home building was not for us that they so we were looking for something else that they got into [noise]\nDuring office buildings where we could deal with business people rather than housewives and\nNow you you um do you mostly deal with um purchases and commercial property or lead singer is any kind of about half\nWell currently we no longer developer would develop developers redevelopment twenty five all of us villains motels condominiums a lot of things in Houston but after a six in the crash in eighty six ever since we've really been more of a service business\nSo we we represent both owners intense and we help them McGuire and dispose of property but when they own that we help them\nManage at least the properties and then on the other hand we represent tenants an office industrial in retail when they're looking for space so we're on both sides of the street the owner and the tenets but it's all a transactional in service\nNow you know the old adage that the three most important things and you were your about your business is location location location of course is more true for some types of businesses than others\nBut as proof for a lot more with the Houston being so huge with all the suburbs and all the different areas you know I'm a views itself and then I'll you know down south in Galveston was me Katie the north\nI went to all of the tenants in the buildings that I built in it right around the intersection ... extent and show them pictures of said this is our front yard you've heard of\nYou said you said also when when people would come to supposedly clean it up and he's like ... and stuff and I'm just shred everything looked like it was snow up there\nWhen they when the when the highway department\nFinally did come around to mow it these big mowers it hit it costs ... later and it looked like it it snowed in early ... so anyway I went around all the tenants told him this is what your front yard looks like this is the curb appeal it's you're producing the world and\nSo I we were able to collect money for a long tenants around that intersection so we were able to go then convinced a way to bond to let us go higher professional contractors to go out there and clean so we can glean and accurate that all leaders and\nThat that must have made you feel proud when he looked out there and saw that it was all cleaned up well\nI didn't really I was looking for that I was just sick of it had been looking at that but what must have been at least a relief [laughter] it was what actually happened was that land Ashby he was a\nA um [noise] right yeah that's what he does but it used to post drew I I used to write a column than it used to post carrying and I used to deal with it anyway he drove by there and we've put a sign up and the science it please don't let her please sign concerned citizens and so he got interested in it he was because that\nIntersection stood out so much from all the other one [noise]\nSo he did his research he started digging and he and\nHe found out it was me who did it\nAnd when those to me he wrote an article in Britain my main minute and blah blah blah blah blah well\nEverybody was upset about the way they used to look started calling me and I thought oh my lord you know I'm not in that business so actually I hired a\n... executive director to do nothing but the lowest calls and figure out what to do because he came in my office one day and you got an army of a couple of million people asking you to go do something what are you going to do I said I don't have time you go do it so that it\nAnd now ... and beautiful is a full fledged not proper ... with us that actual fulltime director right\nHas been kind of last forty something you know we're on\nWe're on we're community coordinator we could we coordinate other communities helping them get their neighborhoods\n... thousands of volunteers right somewhere between ten and twenty thousand volunteers per year while while they're cleaning up their own neighborhood [noise] okay so they they actually get their own volunteers we help each neighborhood put together a program\nLike special cleanup days for the neighborhood\nThey do they have ... days in some programs are ongoing and you know okay there's a lot of different things have been involved with the neighborhood who wants to do for not telling him what to do they ask us if we will help them do what they want to do [noise]\nHoward I'm In the brink time we have left I Want to ask you a few other questions you're involved in some type of coaching what is that\nWhere I'm at a coach for about twenty five years in\nA business ... business life goes\nOn they had that for about twenty five years I was a manager at this stage\nSince and semi retired I've taken a portion of this Bush in my life now I dedicated to helping improve the quality of life with other people do that through trying to share some of my wins and losses than I\nSo that other people can learn from mine\nSays there's certainly do as a volunteer and people will pay you for your expertise or\nVolunteer with prisoners and was a recent college graduates when I'm dealing with business people usually business owners it's\nIt's a charge I'm also a member of a nonprofit organization called the silver foxes which is about a hundred retired semi retired business owners and corporate executives who are who are part of that organization to help the younger people\nI once heard someone say that by the time you know all the answers nobody asked you questions they these are actually ... opportunities for people that are asking questions they paired with people and those are answers\nYeah well that's that's the object out also found that you know at some point in your life you heard enough from certain people you don't want to hear it anymore so I can tell you that my\nPeople that are microchip clients listen to me a lot more than the people that work at my company and a lot more than my family does\nHoward is if people want to get a hold of you about a commercial real estate or they like to talk to you about maybe in their coach or how they contact you\nBest way we Google Howard ram and there's a tremendous amount of information and ways to get a hold of me and my my cell phone and sending one three five nine eight oh two a day\nNow on rap they interview up with two questions that pretty much used a wrap up almost all my interviews regardless of the topic or whoever I'm asked to interview and um the parts of the two questions is what I Want her to the basic main things that you most enjoy about the job that you're in in in helping people with commercial real estate [noise]\nWell I think we as human beings exist to solve problems\nI think people get a great\nBenefit to their own self esteem self worth ... Andrew when they're helping others so and in business I see a businessman and we'll sell products we sell solutions were there to help people solve problems they don't have a problem they don't need us\nThe same in my coaches when I'm doing is helping people solve problems if they're struggling with themselves and\nRewarding and somebody I read somewhere says it's your bottom line profit is nothing but an indication of how well your song and other people's\nStandards and yeah the last question to ask you is pretty much I wrap up all my interviews with I Want you to take the hat\nOff of being ... ... and things I just want to talk to you as a\nCitizen and he's ... he's the only and you've been here for many years [noise] um my whole show is not promoting Houston I Do some travel stories is what it's called Houston and beyond but the main focus of is promoting Houston is a great place to live and work in entertainment and\nFood and all that comes to what are some things that you if you were talking to someone about a moving here busy here what are some things that you most enjoy about he's [noise]\nWell I've been to many cities all over the world and all over the United states in Houston is all the amenities that all the rest of them\nI don't think you're going to find something in another city the drone use it as a\nGateway to South America which is very interesting it's close to the ocean which is interesting a lot of people\nMade a very short drive around in the country and you've been rearming\nAnd volunteers alone backdoor activity so is\n... it'll\nYou you get you on\n... you know I think one of the best uh sites\nThat I've ever seen are kind of represent the combination of the things aren't used to when you drive out past NASA you can drive right by some of those buildings that he'd be rockets some of the most cutting technology the world and there's a field that behind and with his long horned cattle grazing submit thing shows kind of some of the combinations that we have your views\nAnd that's the ... talking about diversity on all the diversity of things do places to go but the types of people here [noise]\nMore than anything I think when people come to using the appeal to what we used to call southern hospitality yeah there's a there's a friendliness and an openness that you just know man\nWell thanks so much for being with us Howard I'm hoping maybe tomorrow ... they'll give you a call sometimes in great I appreciate it thanks\n[noise] hey you're listening to Houston and beyond live on Sunday the twenty first of October two thousand Eighteen I'm your host jak chambers that was interview I take the a record of the few days ago and Frank's America revival restaurant over in river oaks area\nGreat lengths we had and that was with Howard rain but he's a CEO and managing partner of moody random commercial real estate if you need help with commercial real estate you to call them at seven when three to seven one fifty nine hundred find out more moody randomness M.

Jones whole dot org\nI'm ... now it's time for our weekly weather report rupture you buy Richmond air heating and air conditioning the kind of help the\nBefore we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am can rewrite the host of money matters with Ken ...\n[noise] jak I've been\nIn the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting you [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] and\nI Do and all the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients\nAnd uh as at the end of last month we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states we are honored we are privileged\nAnd recently barons named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states and this is actually the sixth year in a row and without our clients that would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you I Hope you guys listen to the show right now are having an absolutely fantastic weekend I Hope everything is coming up roses for you\nAnd we have a great show so let me go over with you\nWhat we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land a personal finance seventies show for you and I we absolutely do add so\nAs money matters are from his grown and I'm just mentioned that we have a we were not work with over a thousand families what I've also come to realize is that we have a great responsibility to those clients\nAnd you know when I first started this business back when I was a a you know I said I've been as business now for twenty nine years so I was actually four years old when we started and when I was four years old [laughter]\nYou know I didn't quite you know I I never didn't think that we would be where we are today but I actually also didn't really think about that we are going to be where we are today I just kind of went with it and you know as things progressed to just kept on going so now as it as it was would come to where we are\nI've come to the point where I realized that we have a responsibility to all these families that we work with\nAnd so one of the things that I thought about was you know you don't want your financial advisory firms to die before you do [laughter] that that would be a bad thing right so one of the things that we decided to do was that we would have what we call vision one hundred\nAnd vision one hundred is that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong as not stronger as it is today\nSo how do you do that how do you build a company that's going to be here a hundred years from now serving our current clients their families down the line and all of those kinds of things and so to do that\nI studied a variety of companies that have been in business for a hundred years to see how they did it because if you think about it the last hundred years have been you know fraught with all kinds of things we had world wars we've had a you know bad economic times we've had boom times technology's changed I mean everything it's like all kinds of stuff that happened\nBut yet these companies endured and so what was it that enabled them to endure\nAnd so I Want to take you this or this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and then you're investing life because we're a financial advisory firm\nSo it'll it sounds kind of a you know philosophical this week but I think we're gonna I'll bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as as uh from\nWhat we've decided is that we have to go so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy that helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to accomplish\nSo in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are that we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want him to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that uh you you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that an philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nWhen you retire we specialize to work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad business or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just last year money you're you're you're done financially have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our ... and we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six a core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a you know a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because I wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask\nYou already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing I always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what are their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that what will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nKnow so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if it's for example if you lied on your resume to get a job\nAnd you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise]\nNow

Am your host can rewrite\n[noise]\nJak I have been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at every single one of them has had a ...\nThere are of its own and they've all been different and they've all been that and this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over a thousand families\nThat we [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently a barren named why you're faithful hell it's one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row and uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of the of of business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business is the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life\nAnd so I think that this week that this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with a thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of a family of grandparents children grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that uh as this thing grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now\nAnd if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we are currently serving will be taken care of and so well they're down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think families so to apply this to you personally families that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that\nIs our noble obligation [noise] so what does that mean that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something\nAnd and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do as noble\nIf we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in the broader context and how would you would apply to in your life you know I I my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her okay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song that you know uh it it I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay\nSo now you got to keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters we want anybody that comes to ah talk to us that is not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associate make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have that person understand that every single time don't ever take anybody for granted\nFor granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go away you take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so you don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe it is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not and what you can do

ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd we not work with over a thousand families in going\nBeyond absolutely and we work with clients in forty three states\nAnd all the ideas we talk about on the show these are the same ideas we talk about what our beloved and most valued clients as I mentioned Forbes named our financial advisory firm money matters one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states and without our clients we'd be nowhere so thank you\nAnd those if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff\nThat if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon is important and so we we talk about the estate planning which we're going to do here and just a moment but\nWe also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes are diversification four one K. we talk about the whole ... a whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is a part of shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean\nOr Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter]\nThere you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing sticking your ear and a Q tip Stanford qualified terminal interest property\nBut that we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trusted is designed to benefit your spouse so if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that jak can you play it\n\nMay\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the feel of our show this week\nHas been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago we ... we not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have financial security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our firm called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning and passing on to the next generation and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\n... if not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love\nThen somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe to more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will come to you so our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a burn as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so estate planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in and cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite accused of trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that", "show_name": "Larry
