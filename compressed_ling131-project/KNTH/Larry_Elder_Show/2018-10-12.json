eight Obama said the same thing except even went further\n\nNew York times article Evans referring to last segment Obama sharply it hails apps a sales apps and black fathers listen to this quote

man is not the ability to have a child any fool can have a child that doesn't make you a father it takes courage to raise a child that makes you a father\nI Know the toll it took on me not having a father in the house the holding your heart when you don't have a male figure in the home who can guide you in lead you so I resolved many years ago that it was my obligation to break the cycle that if I could be anything in life\nI Would be a good father to my children\nAnd of course it was Senator Obama two thousand eight which he called uncle Tom's ... what he called health loading\n\nThe number one problem and staring you in the face what you want to talk about institutional racism and systemic racism and\nMy goodness look at Chicago\nA third black or third white a third Hispanic yet Seventy

and I think maybe that's what they\nSee in each other they both think they transcend their industries they both think they transcend\nPolitics so maybe they have a connection over that I don't know of

about it so that the\nOnly sensible analysis in the last four minutes\nThey go out and they talk about the low unemployment which he did he played that clip you got a very a well known African American entertainer top of his industry wants to come and stand with you and talk about issues you're going to do that of course the president's going to take these meetings any president would take this meeting or under the circumstances that Trump's been handed ...\nWhat does it say that in a panel of four three being black the only one who didn't\nDemean Kanye West is the white Republican\nOne

have a Saturday Night live to ... the liberals are promoting it we know\nThis is true yeah that would be a fly by the time that we may be in power we\nBring jobs into America because for entertainment of ideas but when we make everything it's not an America that were cheating on our country\nUh you know again the DMV insists that uh you know a legal residents have voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against the backdrop of you know with the ... id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses that to where people provide a you know our information about the security on airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks to be in control\nOf a voter records and then the law when it was passed in two thousand uh Fifteen one of the big problems with um you know it had some amendments to it um\nWhere you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the ah the immigration status of the of the person uh you know who who is being register and in the law set of a person as a quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California and new voter motor voter program\nThat person's registration shopping presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get\nRegistered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprise DMV may have registered non citizen voters Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens giving drivers' licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure where it right on\nYeah I'm not exactly the libertarian ... and I'm not

democratic representative Jackie spirited about this\nJoining us from San Francisco California California congresswoman Jackie spears she's a Democrat who's a member of the house intelligence committee or thanks so much a congresswoman for joining us let me get their quick reaction to what did you say\nWell it was a combination of stream of consciousness I felt like I was sitting in a psychiatric visit\nA commercial for Donald Trump or it wasn't newsworthy certainly but uh I Would suggest that that the president\nBut understated an unassuming with a quiet and mysterious deaths and in the film\nThe emphasize that part of the reason for that attitude\nWas Neil Armstrong's life at least according to this film in the book that it's based on\nRelated to a family tragedy which is very dramatically portrayed on screen at the beginning of the film every one is remarkable in this movie in terms of performance as clear foie are playing Neil Armstrong's Wife Jan\nA ... and she was a long suffering wife and she was somewhat skeptical of what he was doing she said she wanted to have a conventional life and instead here he is an astronaut risking his life constantly and that's one of the things that the film brings back\nA very dramatically I I live in Seattle is people know and we have a a museum of flight here and you can go there and you can see some of these old space capsules that they actually use from the sixties and you look at them and they're incredibly small\nAnd rickety in dangerous and you think they really want to get into that things of this giant rocket can her only into space\nAnd do you ask people died in the space program and that's dramatized here two of the the scenes in which director Damien ... who previously did la la land with Ryan Gosling and before that did whiplash which also won an Oscar for Jk simmons well deserved\nIf he does such a superb job I mean truly superb job of dramatizing the space flight itself the training and the Gemini flights from the dangerous flights that came before\nIt's um it's it's one of these films where you cannot take your eyes off the screen\nIt is so riveting and by the way Jason her which provides a film score that his heroic that is stirring that his captivating and very knowledgeable there's even a little bit of a nod to two thousand one space odyssey during one of the Gemini sequences where they're trying to hook up in space\nOf the only reservation one can possibly have from the film is that it's not the kind of a real wake wow we've done it totally satisfying triumphant conclusion you expect it's not the right stuff\nAnd uh ... what it shows also an emphasizes is it the space program had its elements of controversy or use your voices on screen about people who are questioning the value and the amount of money that we're spending on putting a man on the moon when we're going through very difficult times\nIn American urban neighborhoods\nBut with all of that the caring about the characters including Jason Clarke Jason Clarke what a year for him he uh\nSounds standing as Senator Ted Kennedy in a film about Chappaquiddick\nWhere Chappaquiddick happened in virtually the same week as the moon mission with Neil Armstrong Jason Clarke plays astronaut E.B White who was one of the best friends of Neil Armstrong and he is outstanding to um ... by the way one quick word\nThere's been some controversy that's been ginned up\nTo some extent by conservative media I'm afraid about oh my they didn't show the American flag on the moon they do\nAnd I don't know whether they put that in because the protests in controversy what they don't show is they don't show a big scene where Neil Armstrong comes down in plants the American flag and I claim this land and the name of president Richard Nixon no that doesn't happen\nHowever there are American flags everywhere in this bill you see an American flag being raised you see the American flag patch on the shoulders of the astronauts on their uniform\nAre there are I I saw the film with rock star Greg Tomlin my producer and uh he counted fourteen different flags scenes so don't worry about that\nThree and a half stars for a film that is rated PG Thirteen it's rated PG Thirteen for some very intense scenes of danger I imagine that most people who see this film are going to love it as I did\nAnd the uh it it is part of a succession you could have an entire sequence now\nOf movies about space program heroic movies remember Apollo Thirteen with Tom Hanks hidden figures a couple of years ago\nAnd uh and then of course the right stuff now\nFirst man a it is a very major Oscar contender as la la land was we will be right back putting it in perspective\nWant more men don't you Michael meant the

list [noise] he's been called a token negro by a pundit on CNN [noise] another punted on CNN\nSaid Kanye West quote is what happened when negroes don't read close quote\nAnd when Kanye West mentioned in the oval office that he had some a mental issues with bipolar disorder\nThey were laughing I thought this was the networks they cared about people's feelings about mental illness and wanted us to make sure that people who are mentally ill sought treatment because after all a lot of the\nRecent gun shootings have been done by people who\nHad some issues and have people been more aware and ... had perhaps there not been a stigma maybe the gum and might have gotten help\nI taught that what you guys thought but I guess not that when it comes to all black renegade\nSomebody who dares to talk about the welfare state in the connection between that and like her father's somebody who dares to say that if he said yesterday the issue with guns it's not illegal is not legal guns it's illegal guns I have a right to keep and bear arms I was a short conversation wasn't it\n\nIn for Kanye West of beer suggests that he had an issue because he grew up without a father when the person who sat in that Oval Office for eight years wrote a book about it is difficult relationship with his father and have a urine and his own father and his house I'm Talking about rock Obama\n\nAnd it's been fascinating watching all these people ridicule somebody who has the care issues do deer bring up the number one social problem in this country and in a climate change\nIt's a number of people growing up with out fathers and this is an issue that cuts across racial lines although with far more acute and the black community than anywhere else except for Native Americans living on

now says I'm embarrassed ever work with you\nYou don't have a discussion about this became they have a talk about this\n[noise] here's what gets me\nOver on MSNBC huh there were ridiculing him and ridiculing him way to kill him do you know what the most watched cable network for blacks is MSNBC and I've read that MSNBC hall\nAbout thirty percent of the ratings from black viewers you just the top cable channel\nWatched by black in America and that is why you have people like Chris Matthews constantly constantly putting out the race card only to admit\nWhen his guard is down they didn't believe it how do I know that here is what he said day before yesterday listened very carefully\nBut I Do understand President Trump did it as much as any of us do he always shoot them on hey there's the the ... the thing and they get in the contest of ideas in politics than the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is as good and some sort of bizarre\nBecause this was just yesterday this is Chris Matthews explaining why and his view al ... was invited to the oval office\nOr politics that Doug Fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the ideas and he's a racist it runs against the either Trump like minorities that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you're comes it will and politics\nAnd it's sort of a racial way and areas flip it I think if people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist\nDid you hear that\nMostly he invited Kanye West in the oval office for white people because white people most of them won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist says Chris Matthews if that's what you believe in why that you are constantly saying things like this\nWhen he said today America First there was not just the racial I mean they are but I should say racial the Hitler areas of backgrounds there was nothing about human rights something about gender writes other things it here from a Democrat\nAnd Russia and that's a serious thing did you notice anything sort of ethnic about his attitude in answering
