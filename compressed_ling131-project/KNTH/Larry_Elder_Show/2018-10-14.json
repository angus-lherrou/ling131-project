[noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or at least for me that he said he said man who's not afraid\nHe's a fool [laughter]\nOkay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also um as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired retiring soon or most of our clients are over fifty\nAnd so we talked about a risk that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement to look like\nAt the same time though to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the risks that can take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about what we were on a series of the Eighteen risks faced in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan to head for that and unfortunately it is something you need to plan for now speaking of planning for stuff\nOne of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're gonna talk about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on wind to apply for Social Security and ah we may not be able to get through all the questions that are lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well\nNow one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that uh you know we work as I said with people who are retired are retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life building your investments your your net worth\nIs job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stops and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... and they just say out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all nine we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself over time time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired are retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of us would say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show is among where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nAnd this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust and this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten till\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly\nGive a shout out to a ... a listener\nLaura if you're listening talking about you I'm I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive ... thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a pie right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email we had the\nBest I\nCan't tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody know deter right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me your phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's okay [noise]\nAnyway let's talk about is this a thousand and eight all over again okay so you know I Want to go back to um you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October ... and all that and at that\nTime you know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was the calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at that time people were saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell\nAnd by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. and October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally fell off a cliff\nSo is this like that\nI'm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength\nUnemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs\nThat no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it well basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raised interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses fewer cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down to re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week at the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff but you know what it does do\nIn my view is should be a wakeup call to you because did you know did you see how fast it fell I mean it was like what eleven hundred points and two days I mean that's fast the market\nWhen it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly\nMean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did in Y. two K. or and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and your contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you that there was

retirement planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are probably\nThe most important a decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed anytime between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take your sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy so an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is it is the life expectancy so\nYou know I was talking to a client just the other day who\nWhose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same okay so something for you to consider\nNow as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at uh we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nAnd then we're here\nFor you and our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter]\nSo uh if you go to our website it is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you have two options when you're there and one is you can sign up for one of our seminars and we have seminars near you and at the center of talked about three of the worst enemies that you are will deal with during your retirement which is a inflation\nAnd taxes or income taxes and of course Barry markets we also talked about ah do you have what we call your magic number will help you to calculate\nDo you have enough money to retire on\nOkay that's a big question well also talked about five strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes when you retire we'll talk about\nHow to maximize your cash flow okay so when you are retired it's in my opinion is all about cash flow you got to make sure you have the cash coming in to cover the lifestyle that you want and you know we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nOkay that means you've got to go play and have fun and you got to have the money to pay for all that stuff so we want to help you to figure that out we also talked about your four oh one K. and when should you take Social Security sixty two sixty six Seventy\nAnd how do you plan for the next market crash what about that you know look at what happened last week\nYou

I I couldn't I thought I don't even know what kind of style to cause called as it was like\nSmooth jazz mixed with classical Spanish guitar a it was just like a mixture of genres but it was beautiful soothing\nAnd I thought who is that so I called the radio station the next day and I said who were you play you know whatever the time was exactly to the program director looked up and said oh that was a a mar\nThe Lieber and looted negra LOU LOU ... which means black move that's just the backup group and I said who's that he's so he's from Germany and he's well I'm kind of grim means that he's a you know I'm a smooth jazz slash\nClassical guitarist and that is kind of got his own style and I and so I fell in love with the guys music I went and bought several albums and I'd never heard of the guy\nBut since then when I brought his name up by ... fans everywhere I mean big time but I actually went to see it as a house of blues couple of years ago he's\nMade he's just incredibly talented um but I you know what I should have said who was because I normally do these music cuts I wait until after I play it to tell you so I kind of gave it away there but I Want to play a a a a\nA performance by a more labor and his backup group um looted nigger here's a or there'd be gets called Barcelona nights and if you'd like this music I'll give you a interactions or I'll give you the information how you could go and hear more liberty a martyr Lieber and looted nigger live near the near future of the Houston area [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] ooh [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] ooh [noise]\n\n\n[noise] hey listen to the Houston and be on an am ten Seventy the answer and that was a more labor and\nUm and the ... which means black moons Becca group and it was Barcelona nice one of their big hits but they're going to be at the does he do on Saturday November Eighteen is really awesome music like I say I've been one of his concerts and it's if you like smooth jazz and or kind of like Spanish classical guitar it's it's a like a few of those two\nAnd a you can go enjoy that a kind of music together there and that maybe you already know about him but that that's going to be a Saturday November the Eighteenth dinner will be at six o'clock um and then the show was eight thirty again I think you could buy\nA just a concert tickets if you don't want to do the dinner first but I'll tell you as the dinner is really good um\nAnd that's actually his sound is called the nouveau flamenco sound as what they that's how they label or his music and uh I'll tell you what that is just a a just a little sample of um uh the just what we played today for his little sample of some of the many types of live music that are available here in Houston\nAll the time and it's just I like I say we can give often a run for their money for being\nCalled the live music capital the world I Want to tell you about our weekly weather report now to kind of help you to make some plans for the week it looks like there's going to be a ... a high chance of rain\nThe first two days although you know you never can trust the weather systems because I went to uh Austin yesterday for the ... Texas football game unfortunately my Baylor Bears lost the get go down to the wire but it was supposed to be Ninety percent chance of rain and it never was a drop parade during the whole time I was in Austin until I left left not admitted that it started raining\nBut the anyway supposedly here in Houston or the next two days is eighty percent chance of rain it's going to be a high Seventy six\nTomorrow and low sixty two they get dropped down toward the high is only in the sixties the next two days and getting out in the fifties at night\nUh the rain chance is going to drop down to fifty percent Wednesday twenty percent Thursday and the temperatures declined back in the seventies and so basically the days it looks like there's going to be rain argue there'd be Monday Tuesday\nA friday and Saturday\nUm and so those are days you might wanna play an indoor activities it looks like at least for right now that Wednesday and Thursday or fairly low chance of rain and especially on Thursday or looks like they're probably you have to close the roof over at minute maid park for that\nA game three of the American league championship series the Boston Red Sox\nAre that'll be four o'clock on Tuesday I'll be going to that game with my brother can't so uh\nI'll bring you report this week about what that was like hopefully by this time next week when I'm Talking to we will have won the American\n... conference or the uh the American league um strike or a championship series and uh Willem sticking a football as a conference anyway and will be headed to the world series for a repeat of ... and that and and who knows it's a it's it's one game to one against between the Milwaukee Brewers and the or\nBut before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am ... write the host of money matters with Ken ...\n[noise] Becky\nJak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\n[laughter]\nAnd all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we uh specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon\nAnd so we not work with over a thousand four hundred wonderful beautiful families\nAnd I recently barons name don't walk you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors\nAnd actually now for the seventh year in a row my goodness but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I get that one to them we have a great show lined up for you we're going to talk about uh of course the\nEight hundred pound gorilla in the room right be a big drop in the market that we saw on Wednesday and Thursday\nAnd boy did that illustrate how quickly the market can change its mind how quickly it can turn and how far it can fall in very short order\nAnd there are lessons to be learned about that and in fact you\nKnow I was talking to a relatively new client\nAnd they were asking me how does how is this field right now versus two thousand seven you know before the big drop that came in two thousand and eight and as you guys know we we told everyone listening to the show and our clients everybody in November of oh seven\nOr to sell to get out of the stock market and so he was asking me is is different now than it was back then and and I thought you know what that's actually a great question to talk about on the radio show so I'm going to answer his question too with you is this two thousand and eight all over again is ... [noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or but at least for me that he said he said man who's not afraid\nHe's a fool [laughter] okay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also um as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired retiring soon or most of our clients are over fifty\nAnd so we talk about the risks that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement to look like\nAt the same time though to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the risk that could take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about where we were on a series of the Eighteen risks faced in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan to head for that and unfortunately it is something you need to plan for now speaking of planning for stuff\nOne of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're gonna talk about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd uh we may not be able to get through all the questions that have lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that the you know we work as I said with people who are retired are retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life building your investments your your net worth\nJob number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stops and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... to stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June of old nine so we're we're we're by holding themselves\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself over time time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole too thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if\nYou are the aforementioned retired retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show leaves Jim on where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk\nAbout that at about ten tell so we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out to a ... a listener Laura if you're listening talking about you [noise] um\nI mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive pink thing that she does like the mom and she sees me you know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon of ... right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email we have the best\nI Can't tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows the terror right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone number as you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK anyway let's talk about is this is Alvin it ate all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to um you know two thousand and seven at the end of two thousand seven October ish and all that and at that\nTime you know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker or there was a inflation was picking up the economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm\nBut there were signs there were some dark clouds let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically\nAnd at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally a sell off a cliff\nSo is this like that\nI'm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment\nIs showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWell basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raise interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week at the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff but you know what it does do\nIn my view it should be a wakeup call to you because did you did you see how fast it fell I mean it was like what eleven hundred points in two days I mean that's fast the market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly\nI mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent didn't Y. two K. and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income for your from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and you are contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you that there was no doubt so here's

one of the areas are probably the most important\nDecision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six or sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll tell you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to make your seventies they'll do that even again so what happens if they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why would you take your sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not let out an average life okay so uh do you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be ... eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take\nTheir own or yours whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned do we do specialize in in in working with

E. N. S.\nAnd you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind do they're greedy and washed undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest if they are real estate or something like that\nSo talk to your uh financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to one of our our financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you know what goes on our website it as money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there\nDorothy guess what people will get they will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunks cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip chips made with ... they form and they formed the chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate that melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or do because I talked to talk and while you're at it you're learning about you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
