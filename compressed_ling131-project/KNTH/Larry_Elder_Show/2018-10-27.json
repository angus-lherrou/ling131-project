A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com and a lot of you've done that and you'll find out on my website and all these other sites where I Will be appearing next besides filling in for Larry or dentists or whatever\nI Do other stuff to\nLast hour talked about the effort of the left to blame these would be bombings on President Trump because the left and the media and the Democrats have him\nIn this segment I Want to talk about what a great job in the ... a color at the end of the other our asked me to do that what has he done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want to talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI set for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis tweets are not always helped him and he's in my opinion is answer many people who shouldn't and engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot\nAnd uh when uh sometimes on the court people kind of know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them off and I say am I getting paid for this getting paid I'm not answering your guts but\nHe talks and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he is far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season I was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John Case like\nWhich isn't saying much 'cause ... the supplies will be a Democrat\nBut I have long since admitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well being the only Republican they could have one in fact I've wondered out loud and the caller suggested this last hour if president Providence was involved in this election\nAfter all a bomb had done you know talking about radically changing our country you might have very well been too late to turn America back of Hillary had one and I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran for the U.S Senate\nAnd I asked him if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and the answer of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost every single right\nAnd what is it also Providence I Wonder that we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou'd get no argument from me about cause involvement and now I think we got Donald J Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election\nOf course that doesn't matter much either considering we try again and remember many of us thought he would be very satisfy we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges especially for the Supreme Court\nSo I thought were way ahead of the game when he points to Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court\nBut he didn't stop there\nLet me go through the list that the caller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula getting American remains he's already done that return from North Korea\nMaking sure our borders means something yeah color from last hour who knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the company right around the election and a mom who who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on\nBut this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course the naming now for a second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another I'm Brett Kavanaugh on the list goes on and on\nAnd the American people love that he is not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who Spain and Spain and spin that's where we are talking about last hour and are afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have that problem you can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never has two little\nHe is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime\nHe has done a great job and most of the American people get but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or their comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left is the Democrats and liberal listeners\nSo maybe it was for this\nIf the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected\nHe's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nYou are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you failed to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you started the day he won\nActually we now know that they started the resistance again ... against the much before election day but was election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he's still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won\nAnd I almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like a Republicans fool's gold you know we're always going to win Romney who's gonna win and W. is going to win it but not only did he win but they are despite the best efforts he won\nHe still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Muller persecution\nOr is that prosecution got to think about that what was that which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump hers no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed\nAnd including the best efforts in terms of the bomber it won't work even though they want to accuse him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the ... investigation of Moffat Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed never choose themself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talk to our adversaries re did she talked to the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying that he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out and he promised that off Mike\nSo all of this you know I'm disappointed in sessions disappointed is lack of oversight should fire Rosenstein but the fact is President Trump has to feed it all of this and as we said last hour\nThe press can handle it they can't accept that this guy talks back then he says well we've been thinking all these years\nThat's why people are so thrilled with him finally\nWe got someone in the Republican Party that had some courage it's about time\nBut someone standing up for what we believe in let me know what you think eight eight eight nine seven wants age eight eight eight seven to nine seven one seven to for free markers for filling

income with passive income within five to seven years\nAt the maximum inside of the equation like I said many other people so after we had the master plan actually when you do a segment our problem so is your problem\nYour spouse does your spouse federal among you broke your problem that you're up your head in debt and you have bad credit and you can't go do anything because you have bad credit is that part of the problem is that what are your problems is that you have no money because you suck all your money to pay off your house\nAnd that are in that money's earning you nothing he's put all

um they are not going to be able to protect themselves their children their family and that's what this book is all about forewarned is for our\nWe had a story that was in this realm a week or two ago about the ah robot boy awful that might be coming from Seattle Wash I'm sure you heard about the ... oh yeah\nAnd and I've been mentioning it in my interviews with the other people um who would've known right here in our own backyard and I say our back yard because I now live at the Dallas area just both area here of Nashville with my family\nAnd um I was a little bit surprised that it with a rare it at a news then you know they've already had these are all a sex\nPot brothels in Japan for civil while uh there's one in Madrid that ... that was the first one in Europe it's been around for about a year or so I talk about it in the book uh but and now they're trying to get a foothold here in North America and the Houston Texans of all places a while and I know there's some pushback there we'll see what happens\nYeah I think they've done a pretty good job so far of a vote of killing it but we'll have to wait for people to do this kind of thing often are very very good at getting it through and we'll see how that works out to\nBe just say real quick that's what happened the threat they shut them down but then they re surface again in a clandestine location that you can only find out when you go online and book a date with one of the sect spots then they tell you whether located just it just be aware of it out there and he was the\nWhoever dreamed we'd be talking about booking

often ... the Internet to ... the world Wide Web and are there are in addition to the fantastic advantage is that we enjoy because of the world Wide Web\nThere are also some real hazards as well I Know a lot of us are already aware of the fact that you could lose your Social Security number and have your wife screwed up about this\nBig time and you know it's very interesting that's happening right now J. P. is that a lot of Silicon Valley executive people who co founded Facebook Instagram a and so forth\nAre now coming out and publicly apologizing for what they have created a almost reminds me of the scientists to apologize for creating the a bomb after the Nineteen forty down there in that case but the bottom at least we we we ended a war\nIn this case so we we have just devastated society with social media\nAnd I'm not overstating that that's what these executives sustain it and you need to read the book because we don't have the time to get into it but\nA lot of what's going on a social media was created intentionally and that does that the results have been catastrophic in the sense that aren't a lot of people apart\nI quote a psychologist has gotten to dance with the generational studies for decades and she's saying she has never seen anything like what\nShe's seen among the young generation I have a Nineteen year old son he Gen Z and what the psychologist is saying is that there are on precedent levels of depression\nOf loneliness of suicidal right and it traces back to social media it is transforming interpersonal relationships in a very devastating way and this is one of the unintended consequences of the world Wide Web it's just a shame\nIt really is and you you see these kids that don't have they don't know how to carry on a real social relationships because they have this artificial form that doesn't have any\nVery few aspects of a real relationship to you you can't see somebody's face necessarily what their expressions argue that it's easy to be critical of someone else when it's impersonal all of these things are just are devastating does too young minds\nExactly and it is addicting a Jay Z and this is what the\nSilicon Valley executives are coming forward publicly and apologized without the whole like buttons or the whole notion of getting you to click click click click it is an outright addiction that's what psychologists to Spain and it's interesting because I was in New York the other day launching this book\nAnd I stopped by one of a college there and I was talking to young man he's a sophomore and he said he had a he said to me in these terms I listen to this is that\nAh I have been sober for two weeks\nMedia so in other words what we're talking now is about a new twenty first century I picture these kids are are good for this stuff and what about what's happening which I find very interesting is that a lot of them are cutting the court they call it ... back it's called court cutting\nThey are at painting from using social media they are literally turning their cell phones off for weeks\nAnd months at a time in some cases permanently we have I quote some executives from Silicon Valley tech\nGiving up on social media period they're throwing it out the window or they want nothing to do with it because of its side effects are so devastated\nYeah I'm Down to a checking my Facebook page once every two weeks\nBecause now I realize that it's a tremendous time shank if nothing else you wasted a lot of time\nAnd you know because I'm In the media you know I have a lot of friends I don't really know\nAnd you can just get sucked into that ... it's no good I ... as a positive note I Am seeing more people are out in restaurants and so I'm not with their faces stock in the phone so I think people are becoming aware of this\nAll day very they very Americans are and I think this book is going to help that ultimately I also we we I I Want to not neglect\nMentioning something else that has to do with the world Wide Web and marriage this burgeoning a inventory of gas has called the Internet of everything that is to say he's smart TV you're smart coffee makers\nYou're you're smart cars all these devices that have now have a chip in them of some sort that are connected to work through the Internet are and what we're seeing for example and smart toys\nAs a as an alarming invasion of privacy in our home uh for example I give stories and the book of what's really happening out there um and now that we're coming upon Christmas season I just want to uh what parents and grandparents choosing to buy toys for their children\nReally hope that they read this book because there are ways of protecting ourselves with what is going on out there but you cannot protect yourself take the less you know what is happening forewarned there's forearm\nAnd so for example the lotteries mark toy can they can be a let me give you an example of a all of a monitor that parents will use for example the monitor their ... or or their ... young children and their bedroom\nThese devices are now part of the Internet of everything they tend to be smart devices that worked through the Internet for example you can be traveling you can monitor if you're if you're away from home you can look on your iPhone and you can see OK everything is okay little Johnny or little Jane are okay\nHere's the problem there these are ... and I tell a story of a hacker who got into these devices and end up an entire brand name of the product line of the bedroom monitors and blast those uh output the video on the Internet along with the location of where they were\nThere this is killing stuff that's going on in what's called the dark wet\nAnd now there are surfing in the dark Web just like we have Google for the regular Web like you and I use every day there are certain kinds of like showdown and others that I mentioned in the book that ah allow you access into the dark Web and you have these malefactor going in there that have access to these\nTexas we brought into our home and it's something that people the bail would need to be aware of in order to protect themselves their children their families and their communities from the stuff\nWe've heard stories about these devices on Amazon has won a Mother's Day gift Google's got one now where the two you can address them and they will address you back they will yeah change the channel on your TV or your radio or whatever\nBut we've also heard stories about those things recording a lot of things that are going on in the room and ending up being a witness to invention in court I don't know how successful that was but it's a scary scary saying\nNo it's it's been very successful and I have stories like that I have a story of a little girl I Believe she lives in Houston, Texas in fact she ordered the the parents had one of these the Lexus and the Amazon Alexis\nAnd you just say Alexa you know a plane need this music elects a bed dying me this is Alexis tell me what the weather is\nAnd this little girl all of about five or six I tell the story\nOr a winning the auditors self all kinds of stuff and the parents didn't know about it until it arrived at the house\nAnd then there's the stupid thing I'd say the once the parents found out they kept their devices a house and I quote the mother as saying oh well now we have to whisper in the house one were around well how how is that you bring in this device they're listening to you literally listening to your twenty four seven\nBecause it is activated with awake word way you say a Lex as soon as you say Alexa she she she perks up but\nShe's listening twenty four seven to everything is going on there and I tell I tell stories of court cases where there was some uh abuse going on in the home just a boyfriend was\nAbusing his girlfriend and\nI well I tell the whole start we don't have time here\nHe was arrested because of it because of a Lexus so we we are now paying people to bond

[noise] no that's been tied down and not one penny the drainage the night went to pay down debt over to ask him in a press couch it matter how do you explain the fact that\nWe're spending less on streets and drainage but we added a hundred million dollars you would be using that money to pay down debt what just a complaint why not one penny that drainage the ever went to pay down any debt\nNow I did go to high hiking by coordinators and the pay for five hundred and five other fulltime employ and pay for developers to develop properties in the ... but it did not go to pay down in that\nRoom

the bike hike coordinator in the midst of all this was eighty grand sixty ran\nThe salary was posted I think it's sixty Seventy thousand dollars and with all the ad on the pension and everything it would cost the taxpayers are almost a hundred thousand dollars a year I signed up for it now\nWhich is so essential versus save homes and admire land or in areas that are heavily flooded you know raise bio and such I imagine how they're going to tell you what\nIt is a moral outrage that the that the citizens of haste and dug into their pockets and came up with a half billion dollars over the last seven years to to\nTo commit towards fixing our drainage and Sylvester Turner took that money and spend it on something else [laughter] it is a\nMoral outrage there are thousands of families that

course ... is an FCC registered investment advisor\nAnd we've got a wonderful program planned for you we're going to pick up where we left off last time really talking about what the Bible says about business building\nA business or all of that of course with us today is pastor David mitchell best or David is always great to have you on the program\nLay always great to have you and I'm Will have a good time today I think we're gonna continue a on a thought we've been talking about the last few days yeah\nSo let's pick up we've been we've been going through psalm one twelve so why don't you take

man ferrets the lord that the life greatly in his commandments\nHis each of the mighty upon the earth the generation of the upper I shall be blessed us talking about his children's generation is children will be blessed\nWealth and Richard Shelby in his house and his righteousness into Europe forever and to the upright their rises light in the darkness his gracious and full of compassion and righteous\nA good man show us favor in Linda's he will guide his affairs with discretion now we've\nKinda covered that part let me just give you a about five points that I see in those versus one through five ... first of all\nThis is a promise that God makes to provide well for his children now we've talked about this many times a lead together even on different shows where um it is not an unconditional promise though it's a condition of promise so ... says I Will\nBring wealthier family generational well see your family if you do this this this and this that's called a conditional promised that if then\nSituation and so that the the conditions are listed if you think about it in verse won it says praise the lord blessed see that blast you know to the two men I've got more camels and you have got more\nSheep then you have more cattle than you so because it's got got his blessing me so blessed is the man and so here are the two conditions that number one fear is the lord he has a healthy\nParental fear of a parent type a fear and here's the catcher in the light is greatly in his commandments or in his word now see a lot of us\nLove the word of God but we don't delight greatly in which means we're hearing it on Sunday when the preacher preaches and we're not studying on her own throughout the week see that there were missing one of the conditions that gone says we must have if he's going to bless us with a generational wealth in our family\nWe've got to not just have the Bible not just believe in it but we've got to love it greatly and the light and it greatly that means you know every week we spend quite a bit of time and the word of God because we want to knock because we have to\nAnd we need revival in that area of lately I talked to people all over the country seriously this is crazy\nIn Allentown they'll come up and say brother David because of the stock market meeting we did with the last month I'm having a revival in my life because I'm starting to rain studying the Bible again for the first time in Twenty years I hear this all the time and you know we've you're one of our talk densely but uh\nYou know we ... there are so many Bible principles that have do business that we're in the word a lot in these meetings and it really is bringing revival doesn't people\nThat's fantastic I Know when you get into the word you study God's word\nOr like you said it a lot of the the meetings and the ... support in fact you have a there is a lot of scripture taught and that's exactly what we're doing today is going back looking at what God's word says about wealth says about wealth creation or what we've talked about this before or how it is not just the love of money does the ... how it is the love of money that is the root of all evil\nOr doesn't mean that money is evil it means anything you've covered whether that's money or anything else is where we get into problem and wrestle with that said\nWhat is hoping that on guarantees or take a leap of faith ... that can turn your dreams into reality to come home to gamble you still free to make your own decision believe in God given obligation to looking\nFor a trade

on investing brought you by trade way again trade way as an FCC registered investment advisor and today in the program or open really being blessed by a bastard David mitchell course faster Mitchell's been in the ministry for over thirty five years and we're really covering some good biblical principles today\nA on a wealth and what that means what God's promises are we're focusing on Salma ones well we've been up through verse six year so best missile let's continue to look at these elements and what we've just learned in a saw him on twelve\nOr rightly well this is passages about God or providing well for his children and it's a conditional promise and we see you know at the very top there and saw him onto a verse won that the conditions are fearing the lord and the lighting in his word in other words loving the Bible living in it studying it\nAnd all that walking with the lord and it's it brings many benefits and we just mentioned here starting down with about ... six and following\nThat or this person who whose family has made wealthy or because he's blessed by the lord he will not be moved which speaks of consistency steadfast and if he's not a quitter and so forth\nIt also says it will be remembered your your children grandchildren great grandchildren remember your name if you're the person who takes your family into position of wealth I'll promise you that\nAnd then next thing says he will defeat fear in her seventies says he shall not be afraid of evil tied ... some one hundred twelve verse seven he will not be afraid of evil tied in his heart is fixed trusting in the lord\nSo this type of person the entrepreneur\nHe is a person who understands risk she understands return and he understands that there that that because of Adam and Eve making the decision to know both good and evil which is what Satan offered them\nIs it now all the beautiful things that we have in the world a company is accompanied by the bad things you you don't get one or the other you get both and so there are going to be trials and tribulations and life gets in the way and all of that\nBut this particular person or is not defeated by fear\nAnd evil ... bad news does not making them afraid in his heart stays fixing it continues down the path that God has led him he doesn't quit he trust in the lord\nThe next point that I see it says his heart is established and that that sort of similar\nBut it ... instead of speaking about the physical things he's doing maybe in the business world now we're talking about his heart before the lord and that is a stamp list as well and he is not going to turn away from the lord he's he's like job even if he goes through hard times he knows the lord is is cheaper\nAnd it says he will see his desire upon his enemies not thinking about that ladies and gentleman tell me in your family but also in the business world if you're an entrepreneur or don't you think spiritual warfare plays a huge role in your everyday life Satan\nThe world the flashing the devil your three enemies they try to attack all the time and tear apart everything\nAnd yet the bottle says that this particular person who fears the lord and loves his word and lives in it walks in it and walks with the lord and God is provided family wealth generational wealth\nThat this person has his heart established\nAnd it goes on and says he will not be afraid until he sees his desire upon his enemies what does that mean that kind of odd that tell you what I picture Lee when I read things like that is king David when he was young before he was the king and he faced the giant Goliath mhm\nAnd everyone in the whole life of Goliath when they saw him they ran from him\nAnd it really surprised Goliath when he looked up and he saw this young man running towards the\nYou see that that's the difference is that you literally is not that you shy away in fear of spiritual warfare of Satan in his kingdom you don't shy away and fear you actually face him and maybe run toward him whistle or never by yourselves but with the lord and hand in hand with the Lord Jesus\nAnd get the victory so you you don't allow the fearful things in the spiritual warfare to make you stop or quicker coward down and I think that man that is a beautiful promising\nYes indeed again we're on the word on investing pastor David mitchell is with us so we're going through some one twelve you can grab your Bible and and read along with us as well\nNow thinking about as it doesn't just say I'm that he's aware of spiritual warfare and that he has the fences it almost looks like he goes on the offensive and I'll tell you the wealth helps because as we said earlier\nThe Bible teaches that wealth is like a moat around your castle is protection even from even from the enemy so it says that this man's heart is a stab list he will not be afraid until he sees his desire upon his enemies so the enemy is defeated at the hands of the ...\nOrd because the lord is working in you and that is huge I mean that that that's beautiful now the next versus says he has dispersed he has given to the poor\nHis righteousness in yours forever his horn shall be exalted with honor now what does it mean when says he this versus means that a child of God\nWhen God brings generational wealth into his family he doesn't know hoard it he doesn't put it in his barn so to speak he just versus it he he he knows the God is working in him\nTo disperse that money where God wants it in his kingdom to people that needed to places that needed ministries that need it\nAnd maybe even to get the right person elected next time we have a presidential election things like that I mean God will use the money in the hands of his people to accomplish\nAmazing things and I'm not saying God and he has to have the money but he certainly will use it\nA ride along with our prayers and it's a powerful tool\nSo then it goes on and says it not only does he dispersed and give to the poor\nBut this wealthy man's righteousness and yours forever again got emphasizing the wealth does not mean you cannot be spiritual in fact says this man as in Deering righteousness because he has the righteousness of Jesus Christ\nAnd he's walking with the lord that's why the lord mating wealthy and now I'm not saying that works this way for the last world it's a whole different a scenario or about how they get their wealth\nThey have to go to their fathers Satan and make deals with him but when you're a Christian it's all about your walk with the lord and God's Plan for your life in fact that he will use that money uh to get it into the hands of the people that he wants to go and he'll use use a good steward\nThen that verse nine there and saw him onto our goes on and says his horn shall be exalted with honor that means you have power in the world the other man even lost people recognize that that God has blessed you it brings power to get things done for the Lord's worked for the Lord's kingdom and it brings honor\nNow the last verse verse ten he goes on and it says the wicked shall see it and be aggrieved nothing about that way that the people who follow the devil they usually don't know they're following the devil they just think they're living their own life\nAnd serving themselves a which is the same was serving the devil and they just don't know it but they are actually agreed to win a good man or woman\nIs blessed by God with riches agrees them because they know we can use riches to get the same\nKind of influence on the world that they have and to turn it around\nAnd get different people elected and get people who want free markets rather than socialism communism elected things like that so they hate it and they're angry when they see God Bless us with money so God will bless us with money but we have to keep the conditions the two we talking about here in this passage\nIn some wondering twelve one is we have to fear the lord with a healthy parental type fear of our parents our father and heaven\nAnd we have to delight in his word\nWe've got to be in the word more than we were last year league we got to have a closer walk with God now than we did last month that's one of the key ingredients of God blessing our family with wealth and there are many others listed but uh well not it's not huge like five six or seven in the whole Bible but another one is skill sets\nUm we have to gain those and the particular business arena and of course that's what trade wise all about we help you learn business school not teach you\nAbout how to trade in the stock market I got an MBA from Baylor league you know that but I did not learn how to trade stocks from Baylor because they don't know how I learned from my grandfather and he uh we were and they all business as we said earlier and\nHe had the wonderful problem of cash laying around didn't know what to do with it so he had to learn how to trade in stock and bond market and so we've built on those skill sets down through our family the skill sets had been passed down from generation to generation in each of us pick up additional skill sets and then pass all that down\nHis power trading radio you buy online training academy\nTo the show of your first time that\nMy name is Ryan cook and we're excited to have you with us today\nJoining me as always is my great friend director restrictive elements\n... down the tree is everyone\nTo be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure but\nGot Larry out here and Larry first question\nFor you is how you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun\nDoing the show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves and one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we can get on the air and every time we can get\nYou in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I and I know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth net consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is 'cause there's three directions and and as individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow one of the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a a fun show starter\nIs really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent and what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach at half the class here it on a training academy one of my favorite things\nIs to really work with the class and get them to view down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well so bad 'cause people are losing money and well that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but\nWhat are some of the things you guys are working on with the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team or or or laying out out there right now or to help people become more consistent than less directional independent inside of the market\nWill this last week has been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling the market\nAs opposed to most who by the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do I'm gonna lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing with the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money when the markets go up down sideways and what a lot of our students seeing we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade them more than just one direction\nYeah and when you look at even the difference between let's even just say a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and the mutual fund\nIs generally just investing into a long position and it was called a mutual funds 'cause it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money is the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful and that that product has never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those phones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved there to be invested into that fund you look at the a hedge fund type strategy and and that word head just pretty critical because hedge\nIs meaning that there is a position that process on the way up and there's also protection or even a position to make a profit on the way down and so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down into sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of liked that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways\nAnd you're one of the things I talked about in one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't imagine if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay you know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the market's going down a retirement account or income account is is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it is deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down\nBut what are the things that we can do is always okay with you every one of the things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that are too are half day classes what he said let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area that have take classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways now they have their classes about three hours long and if you would have set up passes\nThrough these half day classes that is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time any financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment\nTo me one just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of these passes or one of the happy classes to gauge phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over included with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause center twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston ... dot com and see if you can scores and passes there there is we stay on kind of this consistency\nTrack because of this consistency conversations to say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money is the markets are going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you could always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people playing out of the markets are the mine mine's going somewhere either go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock charter bond short gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that day imagined that we did a little piece of I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you could start learning a skill that can make money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster\nSo a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nA direct chili ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves simply because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogies that we can pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go on a river is right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right below the check but\nI just dated myself but it is it true that I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions they say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that that's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it the broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing\nWhen it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of kept makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up in Houston ... and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start\nPeople off with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it would ... once said is you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great so many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly will turn on at all in fact\nMost of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love because if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right they don't want to do that\nBecause we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent no\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and to think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you may get a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nYou just going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that's simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself\nAnd hopefully we'll listening right now I can see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money out of the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar turned into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay it's not very realistic right\nBut so one of the things we always like to bring that up as it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness at any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick program\nThen have to cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nAlso said to add to that because I Love where you're going you also can't be someone who doesn't take action\nYou don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not ... those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill that can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nYeah if you're looking to build some skills in the financial market and learn how to generate a greater source of income and

online pretty easily shed some light on multiple streams of and can we talk a little bit about\nPassive income we talk a little bit about active income and then specifically spent a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago leery about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a ... a a surgeon and they said oh well you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm going to practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill it just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same that that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nReally when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously you work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in the segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put the money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing embarrassed market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that\nKind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really loved to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know are a number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement right\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you in a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nSo that we don't have any question marks in our life and one of the things that we really didn't touch on that last segment may maybe we'll get onto next week\nIs really how many question marks happened the older we get you know it's it's called a surprise because it's something we didn't plan on and there's all all sorts of things that happen\nOr as we start going down that talked track in fact it's always interesting to me how when we talk to people who have not retired you put them in the same room you put in the people who have not retired and the people who have retired and he asked the people who have not retired\nDo you think you can live off less and they all say yes and then you talk to the people who have retired and you say can you live off less than they go no because there's so many unexpected ... come up as we get a little more miles on our body I mean we could just go down the healthcare path but this but there's just so many things that come up the multiple streams income ended up being very very critical\nEnds up being very very important to create that nice stability now whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come I learned a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time to really even add investing into their life you know after all\nThere's only twenty four hours in the day and right now we're using all of them and and the thing I Would like to bring up is Hollywood right there's all sorts of movies that have trading and then there's also T. T. V. shows have investing in it\nAnd they show it let's all encompassing kind of lifestyle when in reality it's not that the average trader doesn't have Eighteen computer monitors the average trader didn't just take their hypertension medication errors traitors not sweating profusely right now in fact when you're doing is appropriately your proactively investing\nYour lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in it and that's that's one of the things I I'd like you to expand on 'cause you you talked with more students than probably anybody I Know you know what are some of the life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom\nWell the first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason poor stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThat people tend to be better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again\nWe'll find with our students Ryan is they are not from a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier\nThe number one mistake than most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they've blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that that can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business so the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning new skills that can give me the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said visit how you open an account these are the stuff that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he just he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... 'cause\nIf I go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis for him and rather than a hall in mind around but it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or\nActions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and then the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started\nInto my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really take control your retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that you're after and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day costs us to get your phone's writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional inside our kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserve\nThose seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh she ate our calm and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said it earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate\nThat income so you can live the lifestyle you could reach that financial freedom goal that you're after but\nWhat are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now in another well the first thing we always understand here\nIs that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you'll come after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis was the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now\nAnd simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there's no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and poster Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked June or you training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago they did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying you know are we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great",
