on the ... where were you able to show\nThe Larry Elder show weekday afternoon just five maybe before Jay Sekulow it eight phone am Seventy [noise]\nWe're back with the last second if today's lifestyle unlimited real estate investor radio show I'm your husband Merlin today we've been exploring the world of real estate investing\nReal estate investing when done correctly as a business model almost everyone can use to create the wealth and passive income you need to retire in the next two to five years\nWe began by talking about the first few steps to get started in this business or improve your results from your current real estate this is the first step was to look inward at the things we want to do the things we want to have and who we want to be this provided a clear picture of our destination the lifestyle we desire [noise]\nThen I referred you do a pod cast of the previous radio show I did was successful investor and mentor Kurt attains\nCalled getting your assets to work where he leads us through the process of creating a personal financial statements and that will give us our starting point so if we have our starting point in our end destination we can now create a map and it makes this journey snooze\nAnd a lot more fun than we went through the five reasons that real estate is the best way to create that wealth and passive income\nAnd now we're going to go through three chips to get started in the business or take your current real estate investment activities to the next level of profitability and they're really simple do the exercises\nThat we talked about throughout this show I Know who you are and what you want out of life and create a detailed vision of the lifestyle you want and find out where you're starting from that can be a little bit painful to take a look at our finances and except where we are in life that if you do that\nThe pain will be over soon because you're going to be able to move forward and create a happy healthy comfortable retirement for you and your family ... so that's the first step is just do it I read that band aid off\nAnd face it the second test\nIs just find a community of like minded real estate investor and there's two reasons that you need to do this one is to support because the people around you are going to think you were crazy for doing that why would you seek to start a different business you've spent X number of years developing your career why would you want to change now\nWell it's not going to be a sudden change it's going to be a transition and transition is actually going to be into retirement\nAnd this is the business that you were going to work on not in so that you can retire and spend more time doing the things that you want to do with the people you want to do them with on your own time frame for your own benefit right do you find that group and that group should include in this just a third cat\nIt should include successful real estate investors\nWho will provide\nSome education and mentoring and that's usually going to be a company as some sort and you're usually going to have to pay for that education and mentoring sure you can get education and mentoring for free out there right you have to go through an awful lot of information and determine which one is going to work for you and combine them into some sort of strategy or\nYou can come to lifestyles unlimited where we have a time tested strategy over three decades that will allow you to step through this and following the footsteps of successful investors who are giving back to the community\nOf investors that help them succeed do ... is my mentor he's mentored all of us at lifestyles unlimited and the only thing he asked of us when we're successful in implementing his real estate investment model is to give back to the people coming up\nAnd that's what we do so if you have people around you who will pass back the map and show us successful route to travel to your destination\nYou have a plan\nFor where you want to go and where you're starting from and you've mapped out the route to get there\nAnd you put in\nThe time and effort that's necessary to take that trip you are going to reach your destination and a two to five years you can reach retirement I understand we have a caller and we'll try and go there real quick and and space to stand by the end of the show high how can I help you\n\n[noise] All right I'm currently always Seventy years old I'm In the machine or you just do it but you\nKnow I mean very good [laughter]\nAnd English law farther than you and the right to religion so you know freedom of religion certainly but also a freedom of speech so it's it's one of the oldest rights that were brought over to a colony is or to the world by the British settlers at least\nIronic that the British have lost some of their rights\nDid\nWell I don't know how you could settle a wilderness without having guns especially when you've got wild animals there who might see you as part of their lunch menu and and the the natives the indigenous people who weren't too happy about these invaders\nBut certainly the most unique aspect of our gun culture which I think it's a continuum from those days comes from\nFrom just the reality of living in a in a place in a wilderness that is populated by people who are often times aggressive at one to Hershey so I'm more than that even you know they the the the initial people who came here want it to settle here but they also have to deal with the French\nAnd Spanish and others who were sort of infringing on their own\nUh settlements and so forth so they so\nSurf putting together the the the the ideological and philosophical understanding of what it meant with the with the just the everyday practical necessity of having a gun as for individual that they kept moving west probably until the Nineteen fifties event ah\nThe gun with an integral part of of of their tool kit as it were and and almost every family at one\n[noise] yeah it really has become a a I Would say a part of the ... floor of American history when I was growing up in the Nineteen fifties early sixties\nUh my youth was dominated by television shows and movies that were all about the gunslinger ears and having a gun to get through life\nThat had a huge part of ... of the American consciousness\nThat for for me as well even today in movies with the guns used to watch it and violently all the time you know most of that is without you though you know I mean in the sense that\nOf course people needed guns and they use them to protect themselves but a friend that's when we talk about the west the sorts of violence that we see in movies rate rarely actually happen that way they the gunslinger is who who teachers guns\nWere often just sort of religious psychopath and not any sort of anti hero and um because lots of people have to for instance on me take a step back dodge city which we we all know about I think during the gun slinging error the murder rate was a rebel a little over one person per year\nWasn't as if people were shooting them each other out all the time but I'm\nCertainly people needed those weapons and the reason probably that crime wasn't as high as because you know if you're going to pick out a gun it ever has one as well it's it's probably going to go a little bit more difficult we would as criminals today who have guns and and don't fear any retribution\nYeah I think about my my own grandmother who was a homestead around in northwestern Nebraska\nA hundred years ago more than a hundred years ago and she talked about being afraid about her husband would go on a kennel drive and my grandfather and uh she would be left alone with a baby there on out in the middle of literally in the middle of nowhere\nShe didn't know she had a gun but I I don't think she it never occurred to her she was worried about people coming to the door in the middle of the night and I was in an era when you didn't lock your doors and all that so she was scared to death of those experiences\nBut she never talked about thinking about pulling the gun out in those days so I think you're right about the mythology of the Old West\n[noise] yeah I mean somebody it's difficult to quantify what how how much violence that really was people didn't keep records and the way that they do now but we still have some some quite a bit of evidence that there wasn't as much\nViolence has certainly is the movies portray all the time and it's not safe not entertaining and it's fun and and gotten it and play a big part in that in that world that they did I mean uh you know a lot of the guns that cold made for instance in ... and others at that time\nTo find them the sharks rifle and others repeating rifles help people on buffalo and survive in that way so it was a big part of life but it wasn't always aimed at other human beings certainly right\nUm I guess the part that comes up in the American argument over guns today always comes back to the wording of the second amendment where do you think that came from where where does that city um because it's the issue of the militia and all that\nWell I go see that history in my book and it's complicated it's almost as if it was over edited in a way but the thing is this you know one\nUntil maybe the Nineteen thirties ever even challenge the notion that owning a gun at Second Amendment was an individual right it's a complete modern concoction it's not something that anyone argued about certainly not at the founding\nWell they're arguing about then was who would control the militias the state\n[noise] states or the federal government most states in fact in their own constitutions it's very clear amendment store in the constitution itself\nVery clearly stated that are going to get a weapon was an individual right\nAnd to protect them from the state\nThat was one of the main purposes because there's a gun as a tool of survival was a no brainer it was like breathing you couldn't really do it without a gun so [noise]\n[noise] the wording itself I mean you know is it's complicated die Madison was trying to to ah to make it a a wide ranging amendment and it turned out to be a little bit a slightly written night even say that about a founder but it's true so I think a clear amendment would have been better but\nI think ah Scalia recently in the Heller decision about that recently ten years ago um [noise] really laid out the history of of of of the event minute why was an individual right\nYeah and I think you know if you go back to the history and that's where we like to do and we try to understand these a cloud ally worries ... word I don't know [laughter] less than clearly written a things in our history or we go back to history to find out what they had in mind and as you say they were afraid of the states\nThere's literally not a single person not one found or that I Know of a vet argued for the gun gun rights being a collective right now ... there's not a single argument about it no I'm not a single founder or anyone else at the time not even the British\nAh during the revolution ever made the argument that people shouldn't be allowed to own guns because they shouldn't be able to protect themselves they were simply trying to uh you know preemptively stop revolution that the people who fought at Lexington Concord against the far superior British forth um we're\nWe're defending a cache of weapons without that cache of weapons they wouldn't be able to find any of their other freedoms which is why I called the book first freedom so I think\nFirst freedom as because how you view the second amendment we're not talking about specific debates about safety but just generally how you view the idea that an individual should be able to defend himself as property and his family started turning to the state all the time ... a lot of it how you view individual freedom in general I think\nYou know if you don't think the gun played a big role though in the throughout the history of the United states we've been talking about Sears lately because they filed for bankruptcy and I I've gone through some of those old Sears catalog the section on firearms is enormous\nEvery kind of gun you can imagine caliber is that you've never heard of\nBack then then the apparently the everybody had one\nIn the Nineteen fifties there was a huge uptick in in hunting as a hobby and other search Shooting Sports or which has not you know which lately have served diminished but at the time there was just an explosion\nOf a sort of guns and then later when criminality wrote was a sort of the modern debate was framed in some people said we have to get rid of all gone to other people said we need more guns to defend ourselves for criminals and there was another by the Nineteen nineties there was another huge explosion of gun ownership 'em so\nYeah I mean it's been part of our lives forever and ever since the beginning of American history for sure\nAnd you know the other thing that I I find interesting in this whole discussion is is that we were talking about kids having guns and access to guns and all that kind of thing and certainly there should be a\nTraining and and safety regulations put them in place\nBecause of the danger to children but you know when I was twelve and most of the friends that I had at the time and everybody I talked to about their age eleven twelve Thirteen we all had guns [laughter]\nA little ... to ... I had friends who had shot guns they went hunting I Would go out with my friends and we do shoot squirrels and stuff like that and this was just a part of American\nA childhood at the time but strangely I I'm sure it does seem we're do a lot of people today but that's the way it was\nWell it's funny because I grew up in New York a jerk area in New York City and for me was the opposite whenever anyone spoke about guns was always a negative connotation typically criminals are the only ones who had done in my experience so uh it was a little bit different and\nThat's part of why where my curiosity about gun culture and I wanted to explain and understand because it it'd be a logical I believed in the second amendment it philosophically I Believe in the right to self defense but I had it really didn't understand gun culture entitled to Colorado many years later I fired a gun it until I was in my thirties so\nFor me that I think growing up in a place where there was a guy in culture search drove the curiosity to explain why America was so unique compared to other country in the world\nYeah well New York's always been a little off [laughter] well actually\nThe first gun control laws you know in the early Nineteen hundreds so they've always been a head of the ... a bad way a\nLot of New Yorkers word on board for the American revolution either so\n[laughter] it's true that\nWhich is interesting is you know recently until very recently Harry Reid and Bill Clinton\nAnd Barbara Jordan Dianne Feinstein we're all very very strong on\nThe difference between a legal and illegal immigration but the Democrats have been rushing to laugh like lemmings going off a cliff on this issue they want to abolish ice so that was no way of identifying and removing members of vicious gangs I get less Thirteen\nNo way of protecting children from Central America for ... ... it was a slave labor or being caught up in the sex trafficking and history no way to protect our cats\nFree at all just because the radical left activists have captured the imagination and the conscience of America is left we need to make\nThe upcoming elections ... on abolishing I a referendum on opening borders we need to make it clear that Democrats are the party and that's their\n[noise] they had a party that would enable gangs like that\nTo flood into America and take over our cities one by one and that's already happening in the absence of a border wall the southern border the U.S is the sovereign territory\nDrug cartels they are the ones who control who comes in a country and\nThey charged five thousand dollars ahead smuggle people in\nEighty percent of women and girls to the country illegally that way of re eighty percent of going to have a post on our southern border is cup and what they call ... trees those are trees with the torn clothes women sexually exploited by these gangs\nRoaming don't take control of that that are are were guilty of that law responsibility stop those kind of crimes from happening on our soil by the sheer number of people\nWho want to come to America can take their chances on getting a job or getting on Medicaid getting food stamps kitten being anchor babies\nThey are just too many people want to come in we can't control it without a walk a hundred and forty seven million adults\nAccording to the Gallup poll want to enter the U.S that their food the number of king they bring a large hundred our our population going up by ... percent [noise] and it just a few years\nAll our our social programs ...

keep moving on today and we're going to jump to psalm one twelve starting with a verse for\nAll right well we we kinda laid the backdrop with X is thirty four kind of twenty four is a good place to read if you guys haven't haven't been listening\nTo the most recent shows but they sort of talks about the the conditions\nThat we have to do in order for God Bless us with wealth and a lot of people don't think that applies to the New Testament but we'll talk about that in a minute specifically but are certainly people understand that in the Old Testament the concept was you know if if God's blessing me I've got more camels than you to a more ah\nGoats I got more sheep I've got more cattle than you do and they really consider everything to be from the Lord's hands and all of the physical things were blessings\nOr as well as a spiritual blessings and when it talked about them going before the lord ... thrice than a year that was the condition that is just a picture of us today having a strong consistent walk with the lord and so with regard to this condition we went into some one hundred twelve\nAnd we talked about versus one through four room pick up the first five let me just reverse one to get us in context praise the lord bless is the man that fear as the lord\nThat the light if greatly in his commandments now see their right later on it's going to talk about wealth creation but there is the condition now you know the condition\nIs that this person fears God was a healthy fear of a father like we fear our our human father only we realized God is solver and\nHe's in control of everything in our life and we have a healthy fear of the of the lord and secondly this person the lights greatly in his commandments so this person doesn't just read the Bible on Sunday at church she doesn't just read it every once in a while he loves it\nSo he picks up the Bible and he reads it any meditate sonnet and he delights in it and those are the two conditions for wealth creation when you think about the promise that goes with that\nWhen a person does these two things his children will be mighty on the earth is says wealth and Richard Shelby in his house and his righteousness and gear is forever\nNow that's quite a promise\nNow I Would ask this does this mean this is true and the New Testament\nWell many old time preachers and commentator se no our blessings will be only in the heavenly say say well is this true or are they missing something here just God no longer want physical blessings for his children on the on the earth well let's take a look and say I'm going to go to some New Testament versus here\nLet me give you one and Matthew eleven five it says\nAh the blind received their site in the lame walk\nLevers are cleansed and the deaf ear the dead are raised up in the poor have the gospel preached them\nAnd blasted is see who's whoever shall not be offended in may Jesus said now that word blasted is a Greek word or that specifically means Supreme leader blessed fortunate or well off\nSo the word itself certainly can carry the connotation of physical blessings my car he also says the word it can mean it generally does mean physical blessing if you go back and you look at the Greek when you study Greek\nYou can look how the words were used a and profane writings you can go all the way back to Aristotle for example\nBut you'll see that the very earliest uses of this word simply ... rich you know why a person would say well it certainly doesn't mean that here I understand it it's it's predominantly speaking of spiritual blessings but\nWelcome back to the word on investing brought to by trade way I'm Lee Michael's along with pastor David mitchell now trade way is an S.

seven trade or go to trade way dot com\nSo pastor David we're getting into a great message the day and it all ties into as we understand wealth what the Bible says about well\nWhat the Bible says about wealth creation\nAnd here we are as you pointed out both in the old the New Testament it's a great education which really gives us the foundation for being in control of our finances\nYes late you know we saw pretty\nClearly and some one hundred twelve that for the Old Testament St you know one of the conditions of wealth creation\nWas that they walk closely with the lord and that that comes through to us too of course but the question is\nThis guy promise us in the New Testament the same things in other words if we walk closer with him and\nFulfill other requirements that he mentions a such as diligence and there's a there's five or six or seven things in the in the Bible lady list as the conditions for wealth creation then does he fulfilled his promise in\nAnd bring well to our families does even want to do that and I say yes a lot of the old ex positive to say no and we're talking about why did they say no and I I Believe a lot of his 'cause they\nMisinterpret the attitudes they take them out of context\nUm even Jay Verna gays and so often years ago when I listen to him on the radio ah that that his kingdom literature he said if you ever tried to run a business today according to remember his old voice lay he would talk like this kind of like me actually\nAnd they would say if you try to do that and business Martin brother it'll never work done by [laughter] because his point was\nThey were taking it out of context let me give me some other evidence of scriptures that in the New Testament that seemed to indicate God does in fact bless us\nWith wealth creation through the generations that are families if we walk closely with him and fulfill some of the other uh ingredients that he gives us to do now X. twenty thirty three says I've got a coveted no man's silver Paul says are Boulder apparel man you know why leave\nThat to Paul did not cover any manned silver gold or apparel because he owns a temp making business so he was an entrepreneur he made money with his own business he never took money from the church\nVerse thirty for a gay yourselves know that these hands have minister to undo minus an cities so see he he took care of his own assess cities by working in his business and God Bless his business financially\nAnd uh he also said that his hands inverse thirty four took care of them that were with him so he paid for their necessities the people that he took with him in his travels [noise]\nAh so ah So Paul uh was blasting his business and had created wealth and because he had more than he needed to live and that's my definition for wealth wealth it's when you have extra so he's able to help others\nFirst thirty five goes on and says I have showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the week to remember the words of Lord Jesus I said as more blasted to give them to receive LA here's a question\nIf Lauren does not want us to create extra then how are we going to give to others we we have the lord tells us that if we don't take care of our families first financially that we are worse than an infidel and have denied the faith\nSo in order not to contradict that we have to make more than what our family needs in order to be able to give to others Paul says clearly there's that he quotes Jesus is more blessing to give them to receive so you have to create something through capitalism actually through through business\nThrough a buying at wholesale marking it up selling it retail and so forth grade of profit in order for your family to create wealth so that you can give others there's another way you can do it in the real world and and so that would be totally contradictory if a person said well God doesn't bless us physically\nIn the church age but because he actually does there's plenty of evidence of it let me give you another section ... chapter nine or Paul starts out here\nIt's it's kind of beautiful the way he words as he says therefore I thought it necessary to absorb the brethren that they would go before to you and make up beforehand your bounty in other words collect some money so that we can take up an offering before we get there\nThat the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covered business so they needed to have extra in order to lay aside money for love offering but this essay\nHeat which so a sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he would so it's bound to flee shall reap also bound to fully now a lot of people say that's just if you give to the Lord's works and he gives back to you there is\nSome truth to that but that's not all it means if you take it in the context of how a Jewish man like Paul things who has his own tent company and who understands that God blesses fits\nBelieve when you're walking with him is this is an entrepreneurial versus saying if you if you so sparingly and we know this because they're proverbs that are awarded just like this that have to do with ah actually investing your money putting your money out there in in proper investments\nDiversifying properly so that you make a return and that's what this is talking about two he which so sparingly will rape sparingly in other words if you love money so much for aid to invest it you just hang on to it then you'll you'll never create wealth\nBut he that so's bound to flee and other words if you're willing to let your money go and do good investments in put a little bit of educated risk in your life then your ... ... so\n... why would pause say we're supposed to rebound simply if God is not going to blesses physically so I think those are\nThose ideas are incorrect or seven says every man according as he purposes in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or a necessity for God loves a cheerful giver and God is able to make our grace abound toward you that you always have listen to this\nAll sufficiency in all things and may have bound to every good work now that only talking about doing good works in the sense of Christianity you know like so many people talk about well from said I'm going to do good works\nOr is it talking about working out in your life having commerce going on doing work with your hands like Paul did with his tent making and God blessing that in bringing all sufficiency to your family so that you have extra to give well look at the context I mean it's talking about\nHaving extra money in your family\nAbove and beyond what you need to live on that's what we call wealth and God and he says if you invest properly and you work with your hands God will give you all sufficiency in all things and you will abound in your good work the works that you do will bring forth money and wealth to your family\nAs it is written he has dispersed abroad he has given to the poor his righteousness remain as forever\nNow see God dispersed says what does that mean he's giving you the things that you need to get the job done whatever your algebra narrow skill is he's giving that he's dispersing that too so that you can be blessed and be successful\nNow he'd minister is seeded the so we're both minister bred for your food and multiply your seed so that is a business expression lady and a lot of people miss that\nA sewing your seed is the first part but the harvest is the main part and your wealth multiplies because every seat grates a plant that has hundreds of thousands of seeds\nAnd that is a picture of the economy working well to be a family business working well and it's very clear is saying here that is God that gives you the sea to the store and also multiplies the seeds zone in other words gives you a great harvest\nThat money in the Bible days and so this is what it's talking about is talking about successful business activity and your your family being blasted says increase the fruits of your righteousness as well so it's both spiritual\nAnd physical blessings and that's my answer league it's it's always both what do you think\nI think you're absolutely right and I think we've had a fantastic message today looking forward to the next program already\nWell you know burst eleven and twelve\nI think I could rest my case says being enriched and everything to all bountiful ... which causes through us Thanksgiving the gods when God blesses us with these physical things is ... from the work of our hands we come back and we bless him and give testimonies\nIn church around God's people\nAnd it's obviously talking about physical blessings for the administration of this service and not only supply the warmth of the saints he doesn't just give you what you want or what you need but he also gives you what you want\nChance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes so get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull

now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up a Houston ... and see if you can scores and passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people kinda miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in a down market with how margin in different things work\nBut at the same time anything that we don't understand where usually afraid of and isn't it just mainly fear the whole people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know and in\nFact I'll share a story I share with my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people defined it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and a frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if he would have a frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the fraud tries a couple of times to jump\nBut it's the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for\nAnd that's kind of most of us out there and we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great ... and a lot of other students and we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work\nBecause then all of the sunnier this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap that you've been believing your whole life has gone away and that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there or stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle\nWhen reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets so great analogy like when I use is each week I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you actually get there where why would you want to do that people do that everyday Ryan what they're trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting his head on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole ... I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the word I can to are just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh when you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying you know a while ago they are you know what I'm ... years and years ago they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a vis the about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic lipic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to backs right\nSo the so these these these these restraints that we've put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we ended up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could have a few more people get started\nWe've got a second tickets here the show is just beginning what you say we do know that give away let's do it right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area now have take classes where you see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nAnd not only was she able to do this and learn rather quickly she was able to put her two kids to school but bought herself a new car so the thing to keep in mind when you're starting to consider these things one it's not a ... get rich quick schemes you're going to learn how overtime to generate money\nIf you're somebody doesn't want to be stuck where you are right now a lot of people just get stuck in life\nOkay it's not going to be for you if you're not coach of all you got to be open minded that there are people out there every single day making money and doing exactly what you do and the question I Would ask grind of all this did was really earn you some extra money wouldn't be worth it\nRight right well and and then ties back into what can you do with that money as far as giving you that financial freedom and and doing maybe the fun things that you want to do it it's kind of interesting over the last little bit of as we've kinda got ready for our big conference that we do every year you know we we chatted with a bunch of different students and start talking to them about what they what they want to do and it's amazing to me how many of our students love kayaking\nLike over and over and over again is like what do you do now with all the spare time you have kayaking I was like whoa we'll kayakers ear thing when they were oh they do that the ... orders they're all real fit and I'm like oh it's pretty cool\nBut yeah it's a it really just boils down to being able to do the things that are the things that you love and I mean how many times have you bumped into somebody where he said\nHey would you rather go to work today or would you rather go paddle boarding and most of the time it's like well I'd rather go paddle boarding but I have to go to work and so it's all about doing the things that you want to do rather than the things that you have to do you do the income is it's kind of necessary product that we have to have in order to give us the freedom that we want but really\nIt's the freedom that we wanted but at the income that actually allows us to get there and one of the things we can do as far as helping a few more people get started before we get into this uh before we get into this next break is what if we do another giveaway\nYeah I just have some people out there thinking what would you do if you had more money and time\nYeah absolutely right now I have a half day class caught up in your area that have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market which is where it was just saying can give you that time back right can give you that more more time to do the things you love\nNow including with your passes to the half the class is going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors buttons on topics like an ... strategy how to make money

Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston ... dot com and see if you can scores and passes there we've got to take a quick break\nBut Larry which we talk about next you know with all the volatility in the market right now a lot of our students are asking\nHow can you help us preserved capital racing to talk about that is a hot topic right now with a retirement account kind of inside of the ebb and flow of our financial markets the up and down in the U.S will be five hundred and Ryan and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nIf you could invest just about three hours to open

life you've dream to learn more visitors on line at Houston oh TA Don calm that Houston oh T. A. dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio now back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and half instructor it online training academy really shed some light on different income streams of side of the market we're talking a little bit about passive income we're talking about active and\nCan we are talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we ... and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there and those multiple streams of income or really will create that financial freedom but everybody's after I not just that one source not one source of income when you have that sole source that is why\nJobs stance J. O. B. right stands for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we want to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts the markets have been super volatile right we've had a big us we've had big downs\nAnd so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes via social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one\nThey're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire or just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it and so it's kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts\nEspecially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day\nWell the simple thing I Would share with our audiences\nThe cavalry ain't coming there's nobody who's going to protect your capital better than you can right now in the way to do that with education I mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four O. one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is\nThis is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four O. one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you and I have talked about this all the time right now people have been told and I've been doing this pretty\nPretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at all time highs not when the market was low swim matching when there's another correction\nThe first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nYes always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics were ahead of my class last night is is the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday\nAnd they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible forced to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets is whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want\nTo be invested in rather than be invested in the right things and\nAnd uh there's this guy Dan that when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects and Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share though there\nBut it was just kind of funny you say you can't let her stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is\nYou called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially invest the end of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two\nDoesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and then honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my account except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status perpetual kind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time do we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a\nThe other thing I Would like to bring up is every time I see a movie on trading or TV show on trading are investing they always show somebody sweating profusely in front of Eighteen different monitors taking hypertension medication\nWhen in reality the thing that I Love so much about this and I was even telling my class last night a brand new set of students they're just coming out with on online training academy is is when you're doing everything's pro active when you're proactively investing you're able to be strategic you're able to be logical you're able to be rational and you're able to set things up ahead of time proactive\nThe average kind of trader investor out there is more reactive something happens and they react to it\nWhich keeps them in an emotional state and the lesson last night with the class was was all about kind of the mental makeup that we need to have for to to really have consistent income in the market and it's all about being proactive rather than reactive and I also think\nThat that is a point to bring up in this conversation because the pro active side of it is what allows your lifestyle to be whatever you want your lifestyle to be right it's something where you can schedule the market around you rather than schedule in your life around the market you know look Albert Einstein had one of the greatest\nQuotes ever about insanity in the you know step initiative insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome most people live in a very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nIs they read a book of go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching well I can tell you it's amazing that what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time is the only profession you can do this\nWhere the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education so right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean\nIn the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is they simplify trading system of step by step investment strategy to help define the way that people make money on Wall street\nThere's no excuse not to and Sam side and they said this many times the architect of our core strategy that\nReally what trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our county right what happens is there's a buyer and seller\nThere's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are conduit that just hooked us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market but it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfer from my account into somebody else's account is the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show",
