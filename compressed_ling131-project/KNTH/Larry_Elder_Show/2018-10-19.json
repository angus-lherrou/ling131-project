resign\nGay or I assume you're a Democrat or you're not\nI was like hey that I changed to a Democrat I like and\nI see and the reason I I assume that you're a Democrat is because many Democrats have

probably on Twitter account ... belly tape on it it it's not right I don't care but he\nI I and I understand that you're bothered by which you proceed to be his ruling argue bothered by the fact that ABC NBC and CBS the last three months Ninety four percent of their news of Trump has been negative even as the economy is getting\nAll time high unemployment all time low stock market all time high\nYou'd think maybe they can do a little better than Ninety four percent anti Trump coverage I'm asking\nWell he didn't lie about I think that Tom play your current folks had Kurt Elaine why why\nLie about all the things you can see the lying about unemployment is the lying about the stock market if you lying about consumer confidence\nIs not that great at finding trying again forever

they concluded quote the analysis shows that strict ID laws heavy duty for originally negative effect on the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries in general elections in quote right\nSmoking gun Mary likes data and here's a study that shows the voter ID laws are in fact negatively affecting minority voters therefore Larry you must be wrong when you say that they're the
