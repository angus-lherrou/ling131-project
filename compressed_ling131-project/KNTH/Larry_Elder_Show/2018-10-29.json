R. Hawkins from Breitbart News followed by a four hour with Dr John Lott\nWho I Know is frustrated and I I spoke with him today but I Can't wait to bring in the program today [noise] excuse me I bear with me I Am getting over a cold and I don't want to keep reaching back behind me to the board hitting mute so if you hear me every once in a clearing my throat bear with me I Do apologize when I got I got to start the day off we start the hour off with you here today\nWith this I got a phone call this morning\nA from on my studio I generally don't ever answer that\nPhone I don't even know the number but it was bringing incessantly and continue to rent so I decided I pick it up into a telemarketer where to go\nWhen I heard ... this is Mike ... LDC British radio how you did I and I am doing just fine Mike how are you just wondering if you might be able to join Kevin McGuire with us on the radio today\nIn about Fifteen minutes so I did and there is a big article that I just found the moments ago Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now this guy you know anything about Kevin McGuire\nKevin ... is a long time political a journalist undone and radio hosts very well respected in England he's also so far left he's ready to fall off the planet\nThere is a clip here that's attached I Want you to take a listen to what I have to do is give you a theater of the mind\nBecause you can't see Kevin the clip is a video of him on the air with me he's letting me talk and the whole time he's rolling his eyes you finished ... shirts coming off he's rolling his shoulders back [laughter] and\nTen minutes of being on the air with him and my complete thorough utter destruction of him I Want to read you a quote from the bottom from one of the readers of this piece of cyclists and see how I did\nHear how they do see if I can give this to pop up here I Hope I can hear where you go can I Do it I might not be able to do it well we'll have to\nMaybe pull that up in the later segment here or maybe another and another thing when she might give me one more shot on this I just pulled the ...\nMinutes ago so it's possible I might not be able to get to run but we're going to try it again\nA background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward Kevin and that's the problem that we have these people actually start thirty mass shooters in America who passed background checked\nWe can add any what we want to the problem is there are guns in American as\nPaul said if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun\nCan in America and that's what it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very very complex issue as I said there are hundreds of millions of firearms in this country now your response was ban assault weapons well first of all I bought my first a are Fifteen during the Clinton assault weapons ban there are\nTens of millions of these guys in America that aren't going anywhere so it's wishful thinking it's easy to get your reaction say my God we have to band is\nIn reality that's not going to work because\nThey can't be bad they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their lawfully own firearms who have done nothing wrong with their firearms and that's the vast majority of civilians this complex and it's frustrating and I feel your frustration as an American gun owner we hate to see those were the ones that will just stop\nWell we don't the case for people murdering people and say\nThe fifth of Americans with buildings are intimidating the the whole fifth not do not I don't know I don't want your phone or any more I don't want your thoughts and prayers any more than ...\nNow he went ahead and got does what liberals do he lost the argument he got very ... and he cut off my Mike\nNote was excuse me it was an awful lot of fun but I Want you to take a listen to a comment at the bottom of the article and we're going to go to my first guest\nAnd this was for Martin Martin Palmer's another you interview was longer than that one minute and forty second clip but\nHe was completely utterly destroyed this Kevin ... this Kevin McGuire isn't ... wonder if that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he swam down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nSo apparently after he hung up on me he went off on me on the air and that's fine I couldn't care less what losers though\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this present or by the way what on earth as American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it is it like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year than in New York let me go\nDirectly to Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation and have some fun with this as we move into other topics with you today Alan how're you\nFind mark that sound like a ... a finding a little little stage there\nThere was a lot of fun and for somebody like you who has a has a lot of experience and you know people coming after you and you know these interviews are going to be set up I've I've been on with\nWith um with Kevin in the past so I knew what was coming you know it was interesting how he before he interviewed me he interviewed a gentleman by the name of Paul with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette who absolutely nailed and said essentially kind of what I said\nBut he talked about more of the complexities of the issue he went deeper into why it's impossible why gun control laws don't work et cetera Kevin McGuire never set a thing to him never questioned him when he came after me because he had me on before and he knows I'm armed American radio and not a journalist with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nSo he you know he tried to attack me but he got put in place and I thought the comment from the uh from the reader of the article in Britain today was wonderful and I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nWell I think he did a marvelous job uh unfortunately you're not going to change his mind or probably a significant amount of his viewers because his viewers of people just like him otherwise they wouldn't be viewing a\nBut he did a very good job and you know that's the expected ... e getting at at a a left wing person who's written a I mean they're like people control I mean they like to control people it's just the problem is in Britain they don't get into the criminals and he wants the running wild\nYeah and they were the he doesn't like to talk about crime in Britain and so forth but now Piers Morgan put a tweet out the other day too I found this fascinating Pittsburgh shooters reporter to using a A R Fifteen the preferred weapon of choice for most mass shooters in America Sandy Hook Vegas et cetera and I was a lot will be your letter to tell us that that's not true\nBecause they kill lots of people very fast this is what they look like and he posted a photograph of us really scary or repeating and he says I ask again why the ... are these legal for civilians and my reply was quite simple\nBecause tens of millions of responsibly armed Americans use them safely responsibly every single day\nNow how much of this argument now are we going to start seeing because of Pittsburgh I Want your thoughts now on how you think this whole thing is going to build up over the coming days and weeks ... by the mid term\nWell before I answer that I'd like to point out that this particular murderer didn't just having a are you also had handguns with them as well [noise]\nAnd we don't know what what kind of see actually used to do all the firing of how many truck it was quite bullets from which guns so when they go like to pick on the assault weapons you know if you're banned assault weapons has got to walk into an unarmed unprotected you know I you know synagogue\nOur nobody had a firearm to protect themselves because of their country policy uh and if he didn't use the R I couldn't eat probably didn't use his handguns anyway\nSo the problem here is is that none of this works and they just don't want to admit to it now in answering your question how it's going to play out there's no doubt that he pulled his gun rights prohibition lobbyist can bury it can't try and spin ... you know the evil of guns for the midterm election\nUh there's just there are two ways about it I'm not sure the American people are going to buy it because that take the American people just by ... recognize the fact that this was a hate crime I can committed against people of religion\nOr that it took a crazy crazy person to do this that was a you know obviously a murder that they have a A R R it's handguns you could walk in with\nA pipe bomb as well and and kill more people so the problem here is is that it isn't about guns and the American people get it so I'm not too concerned about how this can impact the trauma lectures\nI've I'm with you on that in fact I'm with you on that a hundred and ten percent at some things you can feel in your listener union I Know you know this you get that gut feeling\nOn descent I get an issue if only to find this week three billionaires one day Michael Bloomberg dumped in six hundred thousand dollars for less than a media by ... do you help quote unquote put them over the top and I don't have these thousand dollars but in the media bias compete with it\nSo all we do have the grass roots and we definitely have more grassroots either side does does advertising dollars has to be sixty seconds TV and radio spots have an impact as particularly on need it the more uninformed voter or the casual voter out here\nAnd that's the ... that's a concern so this does have an impact I Can't agree with you on that I Wish we had the money to compete and that she had a whole lot said about winning I I'm hoping aggressors is can be strong enough to win on that particular ballot measure but if we don't win is approved is putting its dollars at both the election\nWhat concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't it that statement concern me somewhat as I mentioned but here's really why because I didn't I don't want it to create complacency statement like that can create some apathy on our side with well we've got the grassroots look what the interests of they're not really worried about it\nMy five boxes enough or well I've I've just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about it I that's what concerns me about that and I know the honorary wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our dust we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but\nWe need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative that six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say you felt better last week than you did this week is that first statement\n[noise] oh yeah I had the money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they did last week\nI don't feel it within the last minute money coming in from three big donors Bloomberg being one of those and you know one of the problems we have is you want to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes can't believe you're on the letter Rick uh and sometimes it it it it's better to let people know who they are in the battle\nYou know I always say that are done rightfully one election away from extinction and it's really true\nThat it absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes s a F joins California group\nSuing riverside county sheriff overseas cw policies this is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights of a legal American resident tell us about this one real quick\nLewis is a share of its decided to 'cause California get his may issue says chairs get discretion of what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know resident who ... holds a gun you know in in Sacramento a lo and behold you you you can't you know in reverse I can I should say you you can't get a permit to carry it for self protection\nOr we once it's like this all across the country will win his students well a and the sheriff or he pretends to be a pro gun but he he hardly get permits out in his county and uh he's ... he's in a tough reelection battle right now\nLet's go probably happen that you eat good chance to lose the election and the new chef coming in will move to suit for us and we'll win or because he'll start issuing these permits or we'll go to ... for the court battle and lobster and the court overturned it\nShare Stanley Smith a sniff is actually pro gun he's pro his gun he's just not pro your gun

Michael midday dot com\nAnd I should also noticed Brian did that uh the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle yeah the\nAh President Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portrait to the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson I could President Trump for this moment in his presidency with all of its challenges to he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like LBJ LBJ was Jackson more where he said okay what do you need to get it done because you've got to get what I Want done\nHe cut a lot of deals with the Senate and leverage to leverage his power a gotten a lot of people say but in the end he got things done and he ... he turned the economy over that Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do that not have a deficit\nSo I think that he had to make some deals for that to the same time\nAh you know both to programs that will allow their country to grow\nAnd he understood the working class more than ... percent more than that it was more the Monroe or the watch it um you know more than John Quincy Adams says he was born of legal means an orphan and he understood he really thought a Midwest so badly south or the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think because Donald Trump constituencies that same morning proportion I didn't even go in and cut some deals in order to average greater objective\nAnd then see what happens after two years if he loses the house you don't see what happens after six years if you get the second tour so I think that's what they need to learn what the relentless the fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\n[laughter] yeah he does um but Jackson a ... in terms of his fighting spirit also have this great ability of making up with people that he was fighting against the one point he had he had actually for a dual with uh\nI've been involved in a very bloody brawl with Thomas hard Benton the senator from Missouri who became one of his closest allies and he'll get his program through\nThat may be comparable to the Ted Cruz Donald Trump relationship\nAnd Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham and the Nikki Haley\nOr he has a lot of people that were critical of him working with it but when they were were were willing to put his side in support him and for the most part\nEverybody has I think this evolution of his other team is is much more in support of who Donald Trump is Larry Kudlow the Gary Cohn\nSo Larry Kudlow said this Donald Trump got to get over this free trade agreement about two years free trade free trade is good and Donald Trump is is almost one Larry older but he didn't uh he did not want to come in because\nHe said you know the I Can't really go along with busting up all these deals but then after a few months after talking to him he's now in in the beginning Trump 'cause we're\nYou know I think that I think the idea for Larry is that a ... as he's believing President Trump that the whole goal of a tougher negotiating posture is lower tariffs all around for us\nAnd for them we will be right back uh with just a few

com even when the filling guys are here again I'm Mark Davis from six\nSixty a and the answer in Dallas Fort Worth or on me a\nHappy morning show host and this morning a boy what a what an emotional exercise and as I always say what I fill in for Larry or Dennis ... some of the other shows on the U.S are and that some of the best preparation I can possibly do for these national shows\nIs my own local show each morning and boy did I Do that today\nAnd we talked a lot about the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre and we talked a lot about the rest of the bomb scare guy a bear in uh\nIn Florida or we talked a lot about the approaching caravan and so with another day of news in progress and least on the uh the the eastern Mississippi half a day that's just about done in terms of the business hours as we head into a a lot of people's trip home\nLet's talk about where we are I Am going to share some thoughts with you and then you just share them back into the method of your choice on the telephone lines of course eight eight eight nine seven ones age eight eight eight nine settled on S. H. G. E. O. or are there on the Twitter account at Mark Davis follow me there and shoot me stuff they all take a look at the\nVarious things during the during the commercial breaks and as I say that's another whole show that takes place over there but the one that involves a U.S in close proximity is right here and do our phone lines are open for you and I've got some questions for you ah obviously plenty of things to say but I always couch them in questions for you\nBefore I Begin asking you what you think about some things I'm In a time when so little unifies us I think when we were lashed together on Thursday here on the Larry Elder show I think I went through my usual speech about how unity as for the birds common ground is a is a mess\nAnd in fact we are a better people we are a better government we are a better society when everybody just\nIt is true to their beliefs let the conservatives be conservative and fight for conservative things let the liberals being liberal and fight for liberal things were going to have winters who wins losers who loses won the election is about two weeks from tomorrow the winters are going to win the losers are going to lose and I've been preaching the conservatives for years\nI don't think you're going to win by trying to reach out to the left 'cause all they're going to do is buy your hand off because they ain't reaching out to us and nor should pay the left should be left if their ideas prevail good for them not so good for the country in my view\nBut they're they're all this common ground unity come by on nonsense\nI is in terms of policy\nIt is ridiculous but I offer that as an on ramp to the following\nThere is a short list of things that unify all of us under the umbrella of our humanity or at least should I Wish it were all of us are but there is a of a little tiny sliver of a subsection of of humanity it's seen the underbelly\nThat uh that does things like what we've seen in Pittsburgh and so before we dive in and talk about Pittsburgh before we dive in talk about the the media reaction and political reactions to Pittsburgh let us just pause and do the most important thing we can do as Americans as people\nAnd that is lift up those last people in prayer let us lift up the soles of those who are shot by this this this monster\nTheir their families their friends\nTheir faith community there at the tree of life synagogue it is it it is probably it it is sad\nThat it takes thing the only things like this truly unify us but this is not a policy battle this is not a left versus right thing this is a good versus evil thing\nNow in a minute or you will hear people say that they're in their take on good versus evil they consider the president of the United states to be evil well done I'll have a word or two to say about those people but before we before we had down\nThose various rabbit trails of talk show live 'em let us just no matter what we are doing\nRight now where I Am here in central time it's a little after five in the sun is shining it's beautiful warm Texas day\nMaybe you're a little bit into your commute on the east coast may be a beautiful vistas of mountain time it's late afternoon and you're enjoying whatever you're doing it out on the west coast and now to\nAn elder country of Los Angeles and various other affiliates in California where it's a little bit after three it's the middle the afternoon to Monday and maybe you've come through a weekend filled with blessings filled with faith and filled his family at least that certainly my hope for you\nThis is exactly what these folks thought as they walked into the synagogue on Saturday morning\nI've heard a lot of people say that the one victim they can't get out of their heads as the Ninety seven year old woman and I buy confessed to that myself not that any one life is is worth more than any other are like that was really bad I mean they're all bad it's all terribly there's all heart rending but if you're Ninety seven\nYou saw the Holocaust first hand a lot of people who are Ninety seven are Holocaust survivors and they were dwindling generation we should cherish them while they're here\nAnd the notion of somebody surviving that time when we had a global force in the Nazis who's goals including the eradication of the Jews\nTo defeat the third Reich to win World War two\nTwo seed decades of further one would hope enlightenment a surround the world\nAnd to have that horror be an increasingly distant memory but a memory we keep alive there's a reason those words never forget are so important never never forget\nIt's not like this was thousands of years ago with all kinds of brutality were common\nIt's not like it was the ... time and you know just a few centuries ago the kind of world gave birth thank God to the United states of America this was when this was this was the thirties and forties for crying out loud we're people walking around a wife who who were\n... teenagers and young adults from that time and this this this wonderful\nWoman who was one of them for her to survive all of this only to take a bullet in the safety of her synagogue in in in Pittsburgh in October of twenty Eighteen are you kidding me\nWell no we're we're ... we're not kidding there are people who are in this twisted there is hatred there is anti Semitism there is racism and massage me and and all of these these behaviors that\n... that that are the devil at work in our lives [noise]\nUh how many such people are there I don't know if it's not many at all but it doesn't doesn't take many this only took one\nI I Am not comforted by the fact that it's a tiny sliver of humanity that that dives to this death but the fact that they don't want us to many the fact that the any human being can ... view this kind of nonsense of of the about the Jews\nHaving another any type of hatred makes more or less sense than than the other there are some people who hate other people you know because of skin color others who have other people because of religion and others who have other people for a wide variety of reasons\nAnd ... and ... and it's pathetic\nAnd all good people you might a segment where he's talked a lot about division in unity all good people unite to to mourn to lift up these people these victims\nThese beautiful souls in that Senate God we lift them up we celebrate the they're welcoming into the arms of a loving God\nAnd we keep their families and that community there and squirrel hill and all of Pittsburgh we\nKeep them in our thoughts and prayers and in our our best thoughts as we move forward as we do move forward it is time to take a look at the sorry tawdry bottom feeding that happened is people politicized this oh and you're going to\nHear some of that and then you're going to hear about some of that from me and I'd like to hear about some of that from you we may not agree on everything that's fine that's why we have phone lines eight eight eight nine seven one said Mark Davis ... very very glad you're here on this Monday is can be important show very blessed to be here with you right back\nThe Pittsburgh synagogue shooter was somehow spurred to action by the president warnings\nAbout the care of in\nThousands of people who are headed our way in order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is vigilant about that\nSomehow set the stage for this kind of ...\nI mean how low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is in why is the author\nVery very first\nThing that the president didn't convincingly attack something Pittsburgh and in the pie found the very first thing the media was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous\nActs you can't start putting the responsibility of the individual on anybody but the individuals who carries out the crime is delivered on the promises he said and if anything I think it is sad I and divisive the way that every single thing that comes out of the media and Ninety percent of what comes out of the media is loud negative about this president\nA man came in and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged down\nAs you hear word afterward and page after page in speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet about our level of discourse in civility is all kinds of dashed against the rocks and observation that you certainly can make\nIs it because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp elbows a salty thing that he might have said it some rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nReason our discourse has been dragged into the muck is the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that she won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd this this is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way the level of vitriol the level of venom when\nYou have an entire dominant media culture walking around saying the president is racist the president is a hater\nHow how in the world is that how do you think Thanksgiving is going to do or how do you think your Facebook exchanges are going to go so All right Mark Davis in for Larry Elder more than a moment and right on to the phones will you ate it eight nine seven one stage stick

her Amish responsibility and and whatever your responsibilities maybe as as working men and women or fathers are mothers\nAre students or whatever you're doing a we gather as one will unite in prayer we lift up those who were lost in this massacre in this synagogue\nAnd we ask God's blessings and wisdom we asked for his feeling love we asked for his guiding light and we we hope knowing that it'll never happen perfectly because human beings are imperfect but we hope for enlightenment and love\nAnd all the good things that humans are capable of ... drowned out of the occasional moments of outrage when you're never supposed to forget\nYou're never supposed to forget where never supposed to um a shell of these things and I'm a forget they happen we we should we should we should remember what happened at\nA church in Sutherland Springs Texas we should remember what happened in Las Vegas we should we we remember but as we gather those things and keep them in our minds and wrap them around our hearts in is the responsibility of the community of America or to step forward to to move forward\nAnd see what we can do a bit too will never prevent them but to reduce situations like this now we we can't magically work our way into the brains of seizing hateful anti Semite\nAnd say hey stop hating Jews um people people are going to do what they want to do attitude and only\nThe things that we might be able to do is provide I'm a better backstop\nAgainst those who for whatever reason Jewish hatred racial hatred or just be an evil grip but has made possible by some mental dysfunction that may not have to do with distaste for anybody just get through to folks and and try to\nPrevent these things as often as we can with yes armed guards the mockery of the president's suggestion that maybe this would have gone a little differently if there'd been an armed guard a tree of life\nHe is undoubtedly correct is that a guarantee that there'll be no death toll no of course not never any promises of life but ... and I hate it it's it's sad churches\nChurches are supposed to if there's any door that supposed to be but it's funny last hour we were talking about how you you don't leave the door to your house open just let anybody wander in and you don't leave the borders of your of your nation open so to just anybody can wander if but if they were supposed to be a place if they're supposed to be locations in American Life\nWhere the doors are supposed to be up where just anybody is supposed to be able to come in those places are called churches\nAnd synagogues and mosques worship is supposed to be open to all the method of worship that takes place inside is up to the faith that is being practice there and we didn't have a choice as to where we wish to go to have our our our our freedom of worship\nIn this in this nation of liberty we also have the freedom to own guns and that's where the next level of scapegoating came well on this guy a Twenty one guns you know what does what does anybody need Twenty one does for\nWell that's exactly the wrong question to ask why does anybody need ten cars why does anybody need Fifteen private jets why does anybody need you know seven hundred pairs of Nike's doesn't matter what anybody meat is because they want him and you have the freedom to have them\nAnd that's what the second amendment is about there is no correlation none between the number of guns owned and some of the bill and co linkage to sinister intent\nI Know a lot of people with a lot of guns there some of my favorite people there's some of the
