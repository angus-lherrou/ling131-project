one Republican\nJust one and it looks like Collins who satisfied with the\nThrone is of the FBI report it looked like flake is\nSo we can't afford to lose anybody and that's why I'm a little worried about being sass from Nebraska turns out he did not want Kevin nominated not because he knew anything I think he felt that Trump should have nominated a woman and here's what he said today\nThe Supreme Court confirmation vote isn't a grand choice about whether we love our daughters or whether we trust our sons that is not the choice before us\nThis is a consent decision about one person for one thing more over also say that although I've said many complimentary things\nAbout judge Brett Kavanaugh and his distinguished record of twelve years of service on the DC circuit court I Will say that I urge the president back in June and early July to make a different choice\nBefore he announced this nomination I urged him to nominate a different individual I urge the president to nominate a woman part of my argument then was that the very important to me too movement was also very new\nAnd that the Senate is not at all well prepared to handle potential allegations of sexual harassment and assault that might have come forward abs and knowing a particular nominee\nNo one really thinks that our body politic is going to get any healthier by giving more oxygen to the one man clown show that is Michael ...\nBut you know what not being down with the circus\nIs not the same thing as being indifferent to the complexities of the me too movement I Believe that we have a widespread legacy of sexual assault in this country\nI've worked with the victims of sexual assault and I believe the advocacy groups data between one fifth and one third of American women have been sexually assaulted at some point in their lives\nAnd given most women have many other important women in their lives\nA mom and a daughter sisters and a couple of close friends\nIt means that the overwhelming majority of American women have been deeply\nAffected deeply hurt by the tragedy of sexual violence\nI've had two very dear friends who've been raped and it is an act from the pit of hell\nThe me too movement of the complicated movement but it's been a very good thing\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through this time\nWe know that in this position ally unable to restrain his impulse to

anything for me I have to be part of that for their background check\nI wasn't that you know the FBI has agreed to interview this person\nI think coming out now and I thought it would require because I think that you're asking a lawyer because he that worked for her and it's not going to\nDianne Feinstein the one who sat on the litter for all those weeks so she had an opportunity to read some of the FBI report but not all of it\nAt nine o'clock this morning my staff and I reviewed the FBI ice report into sexual assault allegations\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh let me be clear I Can't talk about the details because\nThis remains a confidential part of the background for it I Hope that uh changes are made and we'll be able to talk more about what the FBI did later but what I can say is it the most\nNotable part of this report\nIs what to not in it as we noted by the White House the FBI I did not interview for Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview dots of lazy for\nShockingly Dianne Feinstein feels that the FBI report is an adequate as does senator Coons\nI think it's going to be very close um I think um there's a number of centers both Republican and Democrat who haven't\nYet with the senator they did they deal with with like and I said at the time watch Coons then say oh it wasn't it wasn't adequate enough wasn't there on up it should have taken more time\nAt made public what their final position will be a and I hope they're going to look at this report and I hope they are going to reflect on a number of other things are ways in which a judge Kavanaugh showed um I think a partisan inclination or a lack of judicial temperament and how he conducted himself in front of the committee a and a number of other issues\nYou see when you were accused of sexual assault you're supposed to be calm cool and collected about that and if you don't mean to you lacked additional temperament issues\nThat have been brought forward or both through this process in\n... well I've been accused of sexual assault is not right before I'm an old hand if there's a senator I really\nAnd I hope that will reflect a hard on how this balances out against what they might hope to accomplish\nUh

already interview Ramirez so and now you're hearing today that they've gone forward with some of the other interviews that were done some of the other tips that they had gotten so\nThe White House to basically said we don't want you to do five years fifty thousand interviews in the case\nBut narrow it down as much as possible to the most recent allegations that are credible and take a look at that and it sounds like they did or the senators who have already looked at the report wouldn't be saying that look thorough to them and [noise]\nThis is not Fox is on CNN I don't think they were

hear from the attorneys are both at Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez that they're not really that thrilled with without it went down let me just read you a quote from Deborah Ramirez attorney she was interviewed part she's one of the night here within four days later however the FBI apparently had\nConcluded its investigation with out permitting agents to investigate we're deeply disappointed by the failure we can only conclude that the FBI or those controlling it isn't that the gas and did not want to learn the truth behind ... action they the argument there at that she gave the FBI other people to talk to and what if I Would apply for\nIt I mean I think the problem is that if you let me control who you ask questions to I'm going to control what your answers are going to get back to when he's in the second\nAnd that's the big on on because as Don McGahn is White House was shepherding this whole thing\nTelling them and they are the clients because I'm Helen them who they should talk to and that's all they can talk to doesn't matter how good they are when they're talking to them they're only going to get the answers the White House already has prepared to have and that's where the problem is in terms of our consciousness so was the world on or not well done it's technically probably done\nPerfectly but the problem is if you control who gets to be questions you can tell the outcome\nAnd right and I think a lot of people in the Senate than what the\nProcess or not a criminal investigation no not a normal than another normal thing that people think of when they think of the island but this is a big part of what the FBI does and so I think what was happening back story here that's going to play on you know if the Democrats take over the house that they are going to spend time\nReviewing what the FBI did here for the FBI knows that and that's why you see a lot of this information including the tip line information is being set up to that you know the I think the FBI is kind of tired over the last couple of years of being sort of the\nPolitical football for yeah for the politics\nI Would imagine broke like the probably the right time I fly the fourth lawyers are saying that it back to when these ridiculous that she wasn't talked to as well as somebody who's done this before to agree or do you think that but she got in public as I\nKnow I just agree what you're talking public was under oath\nYou know she ... she gave her a letter she gave her statement or through herself in through her attorney to Senator Feinstein\nBack as far back in July but she testified under oath for several hours as a judge Kavanaugh that their statement that that that's everything that needed to be fed and she applied the names of who they should look at and

S. M. C. A. as president calling it\nMisses now jumped story and making main factor for example be alive and come back and true here in the United states have ... million a factory jobs now being created and President Obama if you remember that that could not be dust that manufacturing was done in this country\nAnd and what is bizarre here is a again they not only one to raise taxes and they want to kill Medicare in effect because when they're talking about one third of all the Democrats in the house or co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill right what happens\nTo our whole Medicare system if you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty a instead of reserving it for the senior citizens of actually paid for it\nI mean I go visit this is this is one of the biggest things that we have to talk about the nobody's actually talked about to thank for bringing us up this Medicare for all the expected costs for that is thirty seven trillion\nDollars that was really in the ... billion trillion yeah so thirty seven thousand billion dollars\nI mean if it is absolutely over ten years right so there's no way to that sustainable what's going to end up happening is Medicare for all the medicine or none right as far as I'm concerned is going to be the same thing that happened with Obamacare you're basically standing up and\nThat's going to end quote on it because it's just not survive that way we're going to eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay right now the these congressional races are so close I I Do want people to get involved and you can get involved by going to tax cuts work dot com it's a great source of information and engagement\nAnd getting engaged is the crucial thing one of the points that people have made is that\nOne of the impact of this whole Kevin all thing is a lot of Republicans who are kind of sitting back and enjoying some of the economic good news and some of the good news on foreign policy we're just taking it easy they weren't particularly excited are worried about this election time to get excited don't you think\nMichael absolutely I mean one of the things you've been around obviously a while and their election season ... called the October surprise I think the October surprise here is that the Democrats are prices so how this whole thing cabinet thing blew up in their faith\nUm and and we're going to say that enthusiasm gap for example the past week alone I think we've seen that not only in the state by state level but across the country have closed up almost entirely and so\nUh people are very upset with what went on there and at the end you know honestly this entire election Michael ... were were caught I like the big choice election right and voters are going to have to make a big choice they're going to have to vote for Republicans who can build on this economic opportunity right and can improve the lives of nearly every single American\nOr they can vote for the Democrats who have promise to raise our taxes and throw really stand in in our ears in this war and the economy I mean it's the choice really frankly it's clear\nI Am ... and again it and be especially clear because what you are voting for your voting for people like Maxine Waters would become a committee chair in the house if the down here and I'll take ever Maxine\nWaters a committee chair\nAnd and Jerry Adler of New York he would be head of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already

meteor\nHits the earth tomorrow Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the next justice of the Supreme Court now I Want to say something\nWho have no problem saying all women should be believed all men should not be believed\nFor those of you who felt that it's perfectly OK to accuse somebody who's had up until now impeccable reputation\nOf a sexual assault without any corroborating witnesses corroborating evidence\nThat's not to say and I never have said and I defy you to find when I have said that Dr Christine Blasey Ford is a liar I've never said that\nI Do think something happened to her is not my job to determine what happened to her though it's my job to determine whether or not we we have fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a\nJury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but\nCertainly got to be more likely than not which is what she said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have vouch for his reputation given that nobody's ever made it kind of allegation before given that he's now undergone seven background checks given that the four people Dr Ford say where they're all say they have no recollection of it that does not meet the standard of more likely than not\nFor those of you who were yelling and screaming berating people like breathing Senator Flake look at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying they believe a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America you have been listening\n\nFor those of you who took up on this issue not really so much because you're concerned about the issue but because you want to stick it to Trump because as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about Kavanaugh is because they believe you overturn roe v Wade\nNot listen to me very carefully somehow\nSome way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining its laws on abortion in states like New York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had an abortion pretty much on demand\nAnd there's no reason to believe that if and when Ravi wait where to be overturned in a matter of goes back to the states\nThe landscape would shift in a sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd in ... states if all the way we're overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly enact anti abortion laws given their unpopularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot with change now how and why Ravi way became known as a quote right to abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox\nThat Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago\nAbout the opening of the papers of justice black man he was we sign erode the author of the decision and he thought was going to be a very narrow decision he thought that the decision on whether or not women should have an abortion was a medical decision when that you'd be made by doctors\nAnd he almost issued a warning that the this is an art might be ... be construed any other way he was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a man gets woman thing just because everything\n\nThat you dislike and Donald Trump\n\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think evoke or because you think he's a bake it because you think he's a racist because you think this because you think that\nYes what his approval ratings are up he's now at fifty percent according to Rasmussen guess what the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans used to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two in favor of Democrats\nGuess what the attacks against Brett Kavanaugh effected some leftist have referred to him as a attempted rape is for a serial rapist excluded a backlash and the backlash is\nRepublican even when Kavanaugh gets on because\nAlready signal that you intend if you take over the house to open up a piece when investigations so I'm urging Republicans not to let their guard down just because\nKevin ... is likely to be confirmed\nFor those of you who feel very strongly the other way and feel that just a referendum against women that it means that you don't believe women I mean you're not taking a rape and abortion what rape and sexual assault and things like that seriously you haven't been listening\nI Know you're just like this but one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected because he promised to nominate judges that would follow the constitution this is now he's second one\nAnd God willing and the creek don't rise and he gets re elected he may have one or two more so for all of you who are very very unhappy about this I Want to say this very sincerely\n[laughter]\n\n\n\nDo you do you do you try [laughter]\n[noise] corner Ted Cruz or restaurants or face a restaurant\nYou go with my wife they were ... and you feel lost\n[noise] I've got to fight [noise] some dirt on to get back in the game [noise] all it's all true hall\nA little box in the lower right hand corner of a of people will appear to be in the hallways of maybe Congress holding up signs anti Kevin outside we believe for we believe her and\nAs Carl is with speaking she broke almost half hour she started out very slowly and you didn't know where she was going to go kind of built up to it [noise] you\nCould see the screen and the bottom right the there were two women that were in the forefront and you could just tell they weren't happy the way this thing was going and they put their hand over their head when she began to wrap up when you can tell she was going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh they just look to distraught\nAnd then I'm watching them and I'm listening to comment I said did you hear anything she said\nWith what you said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you\nDon't you care about how she ... got to her position\n[noise] she said she spent more time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief did she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she can understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine forced testimony and very simply simply said as I said before that uh that she believed her she believes something happen before we can assign what happened to her to Kevin Oh there's got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply their standard of beyond a reasonable doubt into a moral certainty certainly it's got to be at least more likely than the nod and she went over the evidence in such a name for people\nWho she claims were were there and the four people either have no recollection of it or say they weren't there and now now what do you do with that\nAnd ... also said that the person who who took her to the party or or brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly\nShe didn't say that about didn't fly I added that but um she got home somehow and whoever it is who got her home never came forward and told us of who he or she was\nAnd so given the background of having all the reputation of Kavanaugh all the women that are supported him all the women he's worked with with no allegation\n\nAnd we're going to deny him the seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot corroborate her claim doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where does know how she got that isn't how she got back didn't tell anybody she said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness test and everything she said was ... she's a moderate\nBut the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't\nListening or turned it off or felt that\nUh somehow it didn't make any sense I mean did you hear what you had to say does not matter that you want people to think it through I bet you wanted to be an FBI investigations of do have more confidence that Dr Ford allegation
