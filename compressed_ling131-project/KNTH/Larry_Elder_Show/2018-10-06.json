favorite moderate Republican\n[laughter] she she didn't really find God\nKirk how is it that the Democrats and look at the FBI reporting conclude that there was no cooperation and excuse me Republicans can include there's no cooperation of the allegations made by Dr Ford and the Democrats and look at the same report and say that there's all sorts of evidence of misconduct in the Kevin report let me play\nCory Booker for you the center from New Jersey the one very likely going to run for president\nWell first of all I mean those characterizations to me or a pen about to just a ... for treating a sham on the American people because there are clearly a many witnesses\nOr people that could have cooperated or what Mitch Romero said people that were eyewitnesses what Mr ... said they weren't even interview but I just want to take him to that room for a second uh the whole process was to me again I'm a what's considered a young senator here ah for just five years but I just never seen anything like it we were shuttled and they were about\nA dozen Democratic senators and our first shift we were given an hour to go through the papers be literally only had one copy so we were reading together and your folks playing her overall Ridley very conservative Democrats all the way to more liberal or progressive Democrats\nCook so that's Cory Booker here's a Bob Corker from Tennessee\nThere's absolutely zero co-op or a cooperation zero cooperation\nTo any of these are allegations are obviously makes people feel really good coming out of there Kirk\nZero cooperation uh the uh the Democrats are saying that there's all sorts of stuff in the FBI report and stuff that they should have a track down but didn't\n[noise] [noise] is they don't want anybody to believe that it's a legitimate FBI reports on what they run into I don't know what the heck to investigate on me on that side I guess\nThey say that they should have interviewed her initiative interviewed Brett Kavanaugh or you just got to listen to him for a\nWe're not going to cook\nWhen you were you surprised about Heidi Heitkamp she's a senator from North Dakota she voted in favor of Gorsuch and she'd behind by double digits in her race in a state that Trump carried overwhelmingly and I thought she was going to be a yes vote but she voted no\nIssue with the party line I guess\nMaybe she's writing off or you know I really don't know you know Democrats\nWere almost two man it was only one democratic voting for him or if I'm correct\nYeah it looked like Joe Manchin will but here's what Heidi Heitkamp said Joe Manchin from ah West Virginia\nBut the one thing that I learned from that experience\nWas really that the most important thing you can tell a victim\nIf you in fact do is that you believe them\nAnd I believe I'm a doctor forward I Believe her story and I think it is critically important that the message gets sent to women and girls and and people across this country that um when you believe a victim\nThat you should sad and and that that begins that process of really exploring and revealing I'm\nA ... the changes that we need to make in this society and I know that's you know a lot of people would say well you know this has been exaggerated I think that if you really sit down with most women in even in the state of North Dakota and talk to them many have personally been victims\nOr they know someone who's been a victim or they have a daughter or a a granddaughter who has been victimized by sexual assault and and I think that\nMy my belief that a doctor Ford is telling the truth leads me to the conclusion that I have to vote no on judge Kavanaugh\nCook [noise] well [noise] I don't think you're helping women caused by my ...\nJust tell the story and you don't make any coup unique proof or anything you straight and if you really want to make a dent in this you gotta figure out a way to\nGet women to go to court shoe to the police and go with evidence unless

that\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd here's what Don limits [laughter]\nAbout or nationally him to grow up\nYou seem to think that um we forget about the about Vietnam and the protests then\nAnd how people got into their elected officials face as we forget about the civil rights movement when that happened we forget about the women's movement when that happens\nWe forget about the stone wall and the gay movement when that happens and all we forget about the Iraq War that the the most recent Iraq War when that happened and people got into the faces of their leaders that is part of a democracy and that's what makes us America so I say shame on those lawmakers\nFor speaking to those women like that they should encourage them\nTo dialogue and maybe the engaged them in a conversation and listen they wouldn't have to\nCook this battle of this confirmation is like Vietnam it's like the civil rights movement it's like the gay rights movement really\nI don't mind when she

over a hundred and fifty people over two decades not a single one of the cooperative any of this has been a single credit cooperation I'd be the first one out there I'm Still reading through the

raised corroborated any of this and so we have to operate based on that but I'm not done reading the documents okay\nDid you get a chance to read Brett Kavanaugh's op ed in New York Times uh no I did not\nKnow he said the basically apologize for uh for the outburst for a saying that this is a revenge and the Clintons is about the left are trying to upset in election he said he's never been more

one's going to be either faith based or um or maybe because she's a heterosexual I don't know what's going to be coming up next\nWe'll Joshua ... all I Know is is it doesn't matter if they this this list that I'm the president put out during the campaign is the attitude that has it has women on it\nAnd believe me they would be just as vigorous against or whoever that person would be ... as they

Fifteen seconds soil and this will be one minute timeout one minute it right here I mean\nThe question is like did you go to the ball and I think what'd you do is now\nI think today you know your best football but jail hurts been really good football players had a good day is Dale because I Am Charlotte much sugar man I'll let Charlotte make the decision to do is I just printed out a little bit and I get the ball to Charlie Charlie look you know I Need to lead you to get the first sale\nOr I Need you to say I'm hardly do their thing all they did bill are jailing or one of our gas and catch a ball or you can run it because we do have a time out so at this point in time I get the ball to Charlie Charlie make the decision or because he's the guy\nThat you like as a trigger man and he's the one that that sets mailed the leader deep so good at me and I see what he does it go next to do but that's what I'm thinking [noise]\nAll right the line of scrimmage has been nine yard line if the bears kicked a field goal from here it would be a a ...\n... maybe a severe angle for their urine so close really a ball spotted on the right hash\nJust in my head I'm sanctions prince Charlie this direction a worst case throw it out of bounds that will you moved the ball to this is yeah much easier for ... from the right to strike\nAgain I'm thinking you want the ball in the middle I mean you want to put it right in the middle of doing that you're going to\nGo to you got to run into the left I'm thinking it put right in\nThe middle of the feel if you're going to get in the\nCharlie Sheen the shotgun happened there is in the backfield Charlie will take to snap he's going to run it right\nIn the center of the field and then slide down so that's what Baylor was doing to get the ball standard with the goal post ...\nScans a state called time out while they had to say well I mean it won't go through what it called it's not what they think they just decided to use it but because he was going to have to call one [noise]\nOh instead of twelve they've set of four seconds which he shows now it's twelve second\nI think coach rule had led the clock wind down before before he called a timeout with K state bench called a\nTime out as quick as they could\nTwelve seconds yeah well there are no call a couple of more probably ball will\nBe spotted at the Nineteen yard line is entering the meal and then his editor for Conor Martin [noise]\nChris ... with the snap first gay let's just the whole good home\nCarter\nGod and the pairs thirty seven or eight seconds\nTo play a fake or if we all sit back and thought about it we knew this game probably and it still feels a thick gray will probably come down to feel to either the yeah you know with the struggles would tend to say teachers out ... you know it's just kind of found\nA bad spot for a kicker and we should have all know that was going to come out to a field goal to what a\nDay what a range of emotions for Conor Martin who uh again it's this three field goals today's miss an extra point but now he ... a twenty nine yards are dead center\nI mean there was no question about that that puts Baylor up thirty seven thirty four with eight seconds remaining go down to the sidelines ...\nWherever you're going to say that one was dead center as soon as it came out before there was no doubt it was good that's a good period here so and not to do a lot of current or Martin who weren't forward through you're happy to see the\nBig thing here now is now\nThis ball needs to go back and do the more you don't have the chance of return you make them do you make them you know staff this ball and I know the question would be that squid and make them use time out you know I\nI think you make of set up let your deepest get set up and you make them navigate the field with two time out uh in in a second [noise]\nYeah you would think swimming run a little clock\nBottles start as soon as soon as somebody touches it more hands and say\nWell ... there with no return really\nA note time clicked off the clock\nGo this is going to be one of those places where you don't have time for that I'm thinking all those one of those places where you throw it to them and they put\nA through line in front of him but he doesn't have that much time but it [noise]\nAnd even on this one would I Would do is if I if I'm if I'm wrong or any of the guys I think a little bit too far back [noise]\nIn front of here's a ball game for their own twenty two line who say three five three seven seconds on the clock\nThrowing the left side of the field it is caught in out of bounds show there's triple zero\nAnd I don't think they're going to have another chance to play\nThat review of that review it\nSee if they're the ones that get left\nWhen we were All right hold\nOn hold on a celebration\nBut there may be one second which would be one more play for K state Joan ... went out of bounds\nWeird about midfield rather writes a mid field I Want to say when I went out of bounds right about the forty seven forty yard line\nYeah and that that I'm telling you that was the ... that's a long way ...\nIt's right at about one he's still too we still do not in ... I think he got out old man who was barely got out that's where you need a basketball game I have a secular they're actually a little bit less than a cigarette out\nHis brother right at about eight ten Seventy under a second but enough to run a boy that could be that that's all they need our\nEars are viewing apply the runners stepped into the why there was one second left almost caught\nKansas to look for you\nThen what did you got to be careful for here is and I was thinking about all this play\nAccept pick I forgot who ran as an NFL place but I Do is they throw something short\nAnd they get out in front of the guy so with this big gap between regulars you know they only have three runs to the second line at certain lines\nYou don't want to let them you don't get something for the cable to get ... down field in front of a job with a free pass if it can be some sort of ... on fuel\nMarket form and then he got a free Ron it's really bad here we go better it's got four\nGuys back on the goal line three down wind but for Baylor\nWill use despite all the time out all righty\nAround ...\nDime out Baylor won second on the clock bears leading thirty seven thirty four over Kansas State\nAnd I think the set up by ... really want to think they look at the set up with a set up you just can't say probably just drew a Hail Mary they may which would you want to guard against is the little short pass quick pass and then they released the lime and down the block\nSo and if they're getting all of a sudden you got this guy running behind four or five linemen and there may be a chance for them to you know get a stew touchdown he'll marry that they may go for\nOne second on the clock [noise]\nThirty seven thirty four Baylor on top [noise]\n\nChris ... the deep snapper Gaillard says the older\nTied at thirty four with twelve seconds to play the game [noise]\nCan't buy Carter\nThirty seven thirty\nWell we have to\nBe poor beta wins over Kansas State that is our Texas Farm Bureau insurance plane worth covering Texas Farm Bureau\nInsurance crowd official corporate sponsor all Baylor athletics Iraq with us here at\nThe planes stadium following the thirty seven thirty four Baylor when on the first central credit union post game show\n... by the first several credit union everything we do we do for you Jon Morse J. J. Joe up in the booth reiki Thompson joins just outside of the Baylor interview room and Ricky a lot of drama there right down to the final play the game today\nWell it sure was when the parents got up there late you're thinking well they're in good shape to come down to a touchdown and go about seven and ... drive right down the field ties it up again at twenty come back\nWe're thirty for twenty seven same thing and go back down again and credit cards go down the ... and get that game winning through go mark ... who had struggled all day but the hit that would write down the middle\n... what fourteen seconds to go take seconds after the ... there's a huge huge boy you drive into the earth where for this favorite football\nTeam yeah big big when Donald possession favorite Baylor by about nine minutes is the is the way it ended out Baylor which can of Seventeen on third down to ...\nYeah I mean all day I mean they ended up with good and bad for the rent is five hundred fifty seven ... yards of all but he gave up by three or four yards at the end you know just in this business see a candidate they didn't have an answer all day long and if it wasn't Baylor having especially seems miss miss fields all sort of interceptions\nAnd I'm not going to count do show\nThat comes along when you have Charlie and he can make plays with his feet that put so much stress on the deep at the same coverage is covered in film in\nJust leave him in ... which is running away from everybody so fantastic performance about all the great third down and that's the only heels of the seven before the phone was why for example you [noise]\nGood sons for the benefit is and and Ricky a three takeaways by Baylor defensively today to take away is the first five games of the year those three today were really big where they\nWere and two big interceptions than the palm of recovery right at the start of the second half on the return address that have a quick Tony ... believe it was to take the way that is a huge turnover particularly\nWhen you're down by two minutes to go home the last player the first time to turn it right back over knowing the opposing team's gotta get the ball but to turn it back over turn that into points I think that set the tone for the football team in the second half although I still had to fight back multiple times to win this gang\nYeah not a not that we have are a factor in the booth in a winner last but not wanting to jinx anything sort of sat on the fact that Matt rule coach teams had one twenty nine straight games\nWhen leading going to the fourth quarter and now make that thirty strikes so out of breath when third straight games when leading going to the fourth quarter and today's most recent of those yeah and that's just I mean he he has a good fundamental you know approach to this\nAnd it's good to see that these kids and it is a big thing we'll get there but the next year we're going to be joined now by a ...\nArt and Baylor kicker it's our post game player interview brought to you by Baylor's department of health human performance and recreation building future leaders with a passion for health and wellness and counter appreciate you being with us today uh what what was your day go what was your day like\nToday one of those days\nEven last night he says there's certain games you just have a feeling might come down something like that and\nI just kept coming up to me to saying what's next keep your head down keep working and you just had a feeling that would come down to that and I have to go all the credit in the world to the other guys usually usually it's my job as a kicker to try and [noise]\nYou know bell other guys out but dolphins in the events they bailed me out time and time again and I looked ten points on the field and the fact that they kept it close and smell less kick I just I I told myself like I have to bail them out now it's time to repay that favor so all the credit in the world of those guys\nWhat's good to hear pretty good support from your teammates on the sideline right\nYeah so what are you guys just coming up to me and told me to keep my head down stay with it and that means a lot of the kicker it is to have the trust in the living for the team makes [noise]\nHow do you uh how do you calm your mind and focus on the job at hand when you go out there for what turned out to be the game winning feel do you\nKnow like I said what's next mentality and you take every case one at a time and the the mind something that thought process is the same so you know just focusing on the ball and staying calm and Conor ... did you know as you enter you\nStarted struggling a little bit not hitting him cleans you want to do was\nYou know he told me believe me told me he was going to keep me go out there and and take chances so I mean I had nothing but support from my coaches and my teammates even Mrs [noise]\nBig win for you guys today and they get you to foreign to on the air and two in one big twelve why\nHis there that's where the man congratulations grant when thank you ... thanks for the kind of art and visiting with us at the game winning field goal today that bears when at thirty seven thirty four over the Kansas State Wildcats appreciate him visiting with us [noise]\nRich let us go through and every ... here we are ready let's here from the Baylor head coach coach mad rule again following the thirty seven thirty four win over the Kansas Wildcats today coach graduation speaker you win\nToday yeah just before our players but they showed a lot of heart and a lot of determination [noise] you know um play the first African dominated excuse statistically but\nWeren't really able to show a lot for it\nAnd I thought they didn't panic they ah they just hung in there and hung in to the end and it was a fun to win a game like that\nHow do you handle it when a kicker is is up and down and and keep his confidence up\nFor when you need him in the game winning situation well you know are we what we tried a bunch of different things you know why and I are and it's been over the last couple of weeks but the mice Robin who talked at half time and he just came to terms with the fact that\nYeah yeah so he came to terms with the fact that uh he uh he he wanted that kick and I said when you want that kick\nNow you're going to make it and you know we played for the and played for the fuel go and um so I didn't have a lot of confidence in and we were on a couple shots in the end zone but a a weekly\nFirst downs on the day five hundred fifty seven a total yards are often she was very very productive\nYeah just struggling a little bit in the red zone I'm you know and that's ridiculous ridiculous have backed past call by me I take full responsibility for that or a bad job by me as a head coach but you know um I thought we did a good job of of of\nGetting things move and didn't have the ball a lot in the third quarter in the fourth quarter really found a great rhythm and guys\nMade a lot of a place at three takeaways today coach boy that was that was great to see yeah we've got points off of them in what we've been waiting for\nHow about sharing McVeigh you know he's been he's been the safety and\nDrink was down and he had a chance to go in and goes and he takes off a path and that was really the story for me today you know Kayla Barnes gets his first start Raleigh ... um you know Connor more steps up squirrel goes out there McVeigh goes out there so a lot of guys were pressed in action and and they made the police wouldn't matter\nCoach offensively things will get what you were in the fall much better talk about what you saw film and how the guys execute\nWell you know um we we thought we were you know go back and watch the Oklahoma ... it's a score we weren't behind you know we we we did one that we thought you know what there's there's really some positive things here\nAnd uh so today we just tried to\nMake an end and then you know we lost you Michael for the entire first half early on and I'm so we were down to really one tell back so we we tried to\nNot kill trusted you with the run game 'cause he was all we had it was pretty hot um but you know what I thought our guys are coming off we run into contact and um you know it was really pleased to see you know much contributions from all those different guys man on the flip side\nA coach gave up a few more ... and you want to give I'm sure what were they doing it where you see and I know that you know a lot of these folks who played\nThem as well yeah that's who they are you know I think at one point they had like eighty orange\nPassing 'em so I was I think you know while we were we were doing some good things and from that perspective but um [noise] you know we're we're we're still have a lot of things the correct way of a long long way to go and uh really run defense today was was the one thing that uh probably stood out the most\nThey coach just from a psyche standpoint as you mentioned you got to get closer that you get a late they close it what do you think this team is from just like well I Would say the psychological development of where you want them in where the where you want to take the pro rent or becoming\nA tough team we're becoming a competitive team and uh you know I was walking downtown uh this morning I got up in the hotel walk and I saw the the monument to the\n... or nicknamed the squirrel\nPlayed I I think yeah to carries today did me when they only an on on ... I think it was too I Believe it may have been three but I think you're right and one was a pretty good run of uh let's see why would a touchdown was Twenty one yard so uh fourteen yard run and then a Twenty one yard touchdown run late in the game\nAnd the legend of squirrel is born today it is you know season\nHe ran it in for the touchdown that tied the game at thirty for peace game with for twenty six to play uh no I'm Sorry I'm looking at it wrong that came up with a six forty one to play and gay Baylor thirty for twenty seven lead\nAnd a a guy that the coaches have been getting ready and here he is in the sixth game of the year with that new richer rule a perfect place to put him in in a couple of situations when they needed somebody at tail back you know they really need a tail back today and they did and he\nBrought an album at the speed element that uh that they need I mean not that the other guys on fast but he's a little bit a little bit quicker out thanks so nice utilization of it I Believe they'll probably grow that a little bit using when they can't without burning that whole shirt yeah\nAbsolutely so great highlight there his first touchdown as the Baylor here so we come back on the first central credit union post game show it's brought to you by the first central credit union everything we do we do for you Jay how bad a look at the final stats\nBarrels run a hundred and Ninety four plays in two weeks in Ninety three place today for five hundred fifty seven yards\nSixty one for four sixty for Kansas State and while at the second half of them may have three in the yard and the second half so I Know coach no go back to process that tape and and and and look at it probably wants to burn it go hasty pitched in another six you know just night carries\nSo they don't hurt through in another fifty six hours at a score so it's it's great to see the off its mind that's putting on the ground I think that's a testament to go through sticking with it\nA coach bill coaches up those office environment and the Lyman themselves starting to jail and sometimes it takes a long time and time to jail as a as a team Raymond Chandler Seventeen on third downs thirty four minutes at fourteen seconds of time position\nCan't say twenty five minutes and forty six seconds on ... position and they're playing the game is Alice Barnes he came to the game is the major threat well he left as the major spent twenty to carry two hundred fifty yards three touchdown had two or three explosive Rosa one for fifty five one for thirty four that I got another one for forty five\nNow for a low point for your upper carry average and then of course got our towns and the second leading washer all the season I was a third of the rush on the season second in this game that cares for fifty yards in a score a it through the air or you know Charlie brewer thirty or forty four\nYet an interception that was a great play by Shelley I'm not you know I'm not going to disparage Charlie on that one that's just to play\nA you know two hundred Ninety six yards at a school where he was sacked four times in which all you got to get a few more seconds he's going to hold the ball and not all of them was the old the ball but a few of them he was and he's going to get that but you get the good place they wouldn't hurt special kids uh eight eight cares for fifty six yard touchdown then he also through in\nLebanon catches for a hundred and thirty five yards and he was just always there that are found a little hole in the zone they were throwing the ball to him\nBut then they'll man's eight catches nine to have the wonderful touchdown can catch in the in the end zone they're lighten the game and Chris plant three catches up with her yard receivers did shards penalties Baylor you mentioned that John only to penalties today\nAnd after all those hold we got calling for norm and I wonder when they when a man because I'm a [laughter] we only had two feeling today and we do on quite a bit that's put it that way they had a good pass refer\nA and a Kansas they fixed pose a fifty five yards in the great thing of the tunnel ... or not to Baylor you know we turn them all over twice I'm Sorry three ...\nNow with the return them all the twice I Believe I'm not mistaken history here\nAh and although she does in three Kansas State turned them all over ah twice on the afternoon a but a great performances see us get the ball out so if you look at this that line of John I mean you just it just it was wonderful are the only thing I think the only reason his games close 'cause counter struggle\nI'm Glad to see him knock it through I was hoping we wouldn't have to land on a bit we'll rely on it you'll go but you know it's just the way they just said that he comes in you Dr through because you're going to major kicker the whole season and coach just show that confidence and if that you'd have to point in the program where you know what\nYou know if we lose sticking with his kid I'm going to lose because I I got to show confidence counter showing that he could do it\nAnd overall just a great day uh and you know the last thing I think I said there's we can say six to twelve I'm third down by the fifth have to find a way to get teams all the feel like they did the first half\nA but then also the office do as you mentioned jobs in the Congress that we had to go through ten of Seventeen off and that's on the heels of seven to fourteen and get so you so\nAre all places finding its footing and I think they those mixing it goes Thomas goes ruler founder something that works\nThree eight first down so I just can't get past that you think that's close to what you think the school record is\nThree I mean that's I think there's only a dollar thing going thirty eight has to be up there I'm checking through the record book will will trickle down there I was trying to figure that out but it's really impressive thirty eight first downs in the game today and the beers when it ah thirty seven thirty four over Kansas State\nBears now foreign to on the year or two and one in big twelve play with a victory Wildcats drop to a
