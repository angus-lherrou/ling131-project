which it intellectually and the ... immature people were on their when their world view was overthrown\nI look at it I think there's a great deal to what you're saying because I recently Michael Moore came out with his new movie Fahrenheit eleven nine\nUh and uh this is a movie about supposedly about Donald Trump and how he's ruining American is the end of the world the movie had tremendous hype it had very good reviews though not so much for me and a and it proceeded to bomb he's he's actually going to end up reaching a fraction of the people you reach with death of America\nWell the thing to realize is that Michael Moore problem with the ... that is back in Studio give him the money to make the movies he's on every talk show he gets all the publicity whereas I read\nI mean if if my movie with Scott mentioned on ABC NBC Phoebe out a little worried about it from CNN or MSNBC and yard at not covered at all so good luck to sort of\nThey they go out of their way and I know where the film

of a nation or you can stream right now at death of a nation movie dot com\nBut the other point about Moore's movie it begins almost identical to your movie except your movie covers the materials so much better it's so much more washable\nAnd it's actually very funny the way you do it what you do at the beginning of the film is you go back to election night and you show the change from the beginning of ...\nTonight where the anger is the beginning they were all happy and excited they are about to welcome the first female president and Hillary of course is going to win and then you show the increasing desperation and heartbreak as it becomes clear that the result wasn't what people expected\nMichael Moore does the same thing but he doesn't play it for laughs he plays it oh my goodness this is the beginning of a nightmare and a tragedy and it's not washable\nI'm ... in terms\nOf my response to the film the one segment of the film that I think is most unforgettable\nIs your

on a bar so beat his\nHead I I and of course they're if they're all lying they all lie over there that's why we have spies we've and spy on our allies\nBecause everybody has an incentive to distort the troops over there\nNow here's what I find fascinating though on the part of the left\nThis is the party that called George W. Bush warmonger that he rushed into the war in Iraq never mind Fifteen months run up never mind he goes to Congress and gets a resolution from the house resolution from the Senate goes to the United nations resolution telling Saddam Hussein to declare what he has\nOn a stage consequences no\nBush was a war monger Bush lied people died\nNever mind Robert de Woodward who's now Johnny on the spot because he's written a book critical about the trumps wrote a book about George W Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq War and said that when George Tenet the CIA director but then at the ...\nThe president's first reaction was is that it that your case and required tended to go back and get a lot more information to convince George W. Bush that Saddam Hussein in fact has stockpiles of WB he was skeptical at first\n\nBut still the left says George W. Bush launched the door the majority of Democrats believe that Bush lives into the war\nNow all of a sudden these guys are ... and\nRonald Reagan hated his got couldn't stand him largest antiwar a demonstrations are in the history of the world because of Ronald Reagan to lift militarism hated us uh FBI\nOr believe me he was hammering when he referred to the Soviet Union as an evil empire as George W. Bush was hammered by Madeleine Albright who said he he lost his mind when he used the expression access of evil to refer to Iraq North Korea and Iran\nNow these guys are ... you cheered when Obama against the unanimous opinion of his national security apparatus pool all the troops out of Iraq and then when the fifth Shannon ISIS metastasize and he had to send back five thousand marks you didn't say anything\nAnd when Obama said hey the\nReason I pulled all the troops out as because George W.
