I guess it was a a sort of assumptions that you could you know talk this kind of inside baseball ... I mean I was very very uncomfortable with what a what a lot of\nThe promises that went into this whole uh you know anthrax in I mean there was something that of course we want to get rid of the blacks and that this young Harvard educated you know with with that but it's going to come up with a great solution had accomplished that it was awful\nAnd it was humorous planned the ones that you just outlined about relocating them on the basis of these are going to be refurbished and then they get right at first refusal they wouldn't be able to do a forward to pay for it and voila they would be gone just with Schumer outlining the plane right\nAnd that's it yeah and they were selling them to say look what a genius he came up with a strategy would have thought is this is a massive stroke\nMhm now this plan never gotten from in it or do you know why not\nWell they do get in for months and then that they did do the refurbishing but ah they underestimated the capacity of the people to move back they they were able to raise the father came back\nMost of them and there's pretty much the neighborhood is the same as always been except that uh the blacks ended up with with better housing which was up to the good but that was not the answer is\nWhat is your father think of this plan\nWell my father was not really that political figure and uh and I didn't really discuss it with him I was a teenager and to me it was is revolting mhm so\nUm why did you take so long before writing about that you were sixteen years old but you didn't write about it as a kid\nAt the time but that but that's really what got me motivated to politics at all the years as I was getting engaged and as a writer I used to write for us to the Jewish magazines and eventually a broad and into the Washington DC magazines and I was working my way up\nThe ladder so to speak I always wanted to tell my story and in fact in Nineteen Ninety six\nI was a there was a fellow named Robert L Virgo who is running against Schumer for Congress and I actually went to apply to become his campaign manager and like you know he says oh you like ... you come from\nThat so you don't understand I this man is is\nA you know evil personified I if I could do I think to bring them to I was so so of course uh the local Republicans I never heard of me at the time and I and I didn't get the job but [noise] but uh so just to show you how passionate I was about that and I was also particularly offensive because\nHe was the congressmen for a very orthodox Jewish section in New York [noise] uh he would go around and and pans it to them or talk a little ... stuff like that mhm and then he would take\nTheir votes these are really holy wonderful people and he would use their votes for all the evil society as a law that you couldn't show is the most reliable vote for Bush as anything any type of thing that that involves a you know undermining right traditional\nPut me at the national African American woman raise them we actually and in your face in our country\nAnd I don't want to say well\nWhat were they I also lived in Michigan and uh I had a great time in Michigan I I didn't want to know I I didn't feel

okay okay our car\nThat poverty is not merely because I'm white like sex classes are the bigger issue in this country and say wait [laughter] it's there it's real but you're right the driving force of poverty\nAnd they're in their in their way more in the ... and I'm sure there's way more poor white people in Arkansas mirror poor black people this is this is way more poor white people in this country dinner or poor black people in the country where where they where are you from originally\nI'm originally from Detroit\nYeah\nSo why didn't why didn't the racism and sexism hold you

Eighteen forties we be sure and he's from Larry for Michael dot com from a cold Larry\nYou'll be able to find the interview I did with Jane Harman on Larry Elder dot com as well as the memo that was prepared by the prosecuting the sex crime sex crime prosecutor that the Republican tier to\nInterview doctor for it in that memo she said that there's no\nReasonable prosecutor that would ever bring a case based upon the allegations that she's made in wouldn't even survive the preponderance of evidence statute a standard which is the standard for civil let alone criminal even Jake Tapper said it wasn't good news\nThat I Want to bring up the fact that uh that Rachel mental who the Arizona prosecutor who the Republicans brought into question she issued a report now obviously it's not a full of ... investigation she did what she could and the time she was given but her conclusion was that are responsible prosecutor would never bring a case\nOf based on the evidence presented last week as you know to quote Dr Ford professor Christine Blasey Ford identified other witnesses the event of those witnesses either refuted her allegations are failed to corroborate then she went undecided inconsistencies in her statements to the committee the Washington Post or therapist um\n[noise] I mean this doesn't look very strong when it comes to the effort to convict Kavanaugh on this case this this doesn't help her work\nAnd I could tell that people like ... are feeling uncomfortable about the goalposts being shifted at one time it was all about whether or not I'm Brett Kavanaugh engage in an attempted sexual assault or sexual assault attempted rape\nI mean there are three court shows I think Dr Ford shouldn't be asked to see if she can remember first is why would she leaves the gathering downstairs in the\nCompany to any breed it young men to go upstairs number two\nWhy would she and the company to actually ... young man go into a room that had no other exit and\nShe alleges that Kavanaugh was trying to take her clothes off was relying on on the ... when George joined the three of them are supposedly they fell off\nNow you've got to see athletes they might have been drinking but if they were intent on taking her clothes off\nWhy is it not one of them was able to grab her arm or a leg and to read from getting before she could get out that doesn't make any sense to me and I heard nothing asked about that\nAll excellent questions Hillary even says that ah Christine forest testimony she cannot say with a hundred percent truthful\nI Want to ask you a question about Dr for for a minute\nThere are a lot of Democrats who are in a lot of other people who are absolutely certain hundred percent her her recollection is the absolute truth I'm asking this as a lawyer do you feel a hundred percent certain that the events that she described um ah are true and are therefore disqualify\nBut I I watch as much of protests money as I could I found her very credible you have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through this if they\nDid you ask a question about when he to Broderick\nNot believe canceling willing that they had him in for flowers court information all the junk Ken I'm On a Lewinsky to convey to the Senate she basically said that she thought\nNow this was a fascinating exchange between ... between Chris Cuomo and Rick Santorum\nWho will keep saying that Kevin testified that he was pure that he was a horrible you know you didn't if he's lying about anything in this context short of his actions toward the women who are making the accusations do you think that that is not disqualifying record\nWell look I first off I don't know how you're going to prove that he's caught lying about something that I mean this this is what he's he said that he drank he said that he drank to access at times that he was drunk at times he admitted to that the only thing he did not admit to his\nWas blacking out and not recalling things and he has you know he has his his college roommate basically you know saying you know I Lived with this guy for three years I never saw him in the physician or the next thing more than ... ...\n... ah did also so that you never saw him blackout I don't know that the blackout standard is the sole criteria and I know and you know\nWhat you're saying that he got drunk I might I didn't\nReally admitted any more than he needed to I Do think it's fair criticism to say that he was not talking about himself the way his classmates talk about um the question is does it matter\nAnd I get I don't think I I don't see where ... is it does he have to go out and say oh yeah I got I got ... no I mean it's so dry I feel like you watch yeah the\nInterview wait aren't cold at us when it happened as a mistake and not because it was with Fox folk it's because he sat across from a friendly face and he painted a perfect picture of himself\nChurches social projects for me now he could have a meal here that we drank beer but you know maybe you want to many he was not talking about himself the way other people talk about him but\nJennifer somewhat that characterization that's not a lie well then why are all these people are like why are these people coming forward and went to school with um wreck and saying he's lying about who he was ... called I'm afraid\nI and I think that he has a lot of many many many many many more coming in and saying that the writer Kevin they know is exactly consistent with what he's saying yeah yeah like well yeah yeah in fact no what sixty five women side to side of documents are saying this is all about checked or not\nThat's not Brett Kavanaugh that general yesterday Romney there doesn't mean that didn't happen weren't there there there are tightening\nNone of them ever said he didn't party he didn't get drunk a lot that that he said they can't afford to vouch about his character you're right and I get why but it's got to be our slow your party\nYou say all these people came out to say that what the other people say is on trial but none of them say that none of those sixty five you have to permit to parse a woman said and on the issue of his credibility about his habits drinking\nHe is so over a hundred percent of the time and they own a little bit too much nothing out of character that's not true they don't offset Jennifer what your point\n[noise]

I mean I was very very uncomfortable with what ... what a lot of\nThe promises that went into this whole uh you know interaction I mean there was something that of course we want to get rid of the blacks and that this young Harvard educated you know with that but it's going to come up with a great solution had accomplished that it was awful\nAnd it was humorous planned the one that you just outlined about relocating them on the basis of these are going to be refurbished and then they get right up first refusal they wouldn't be able to do a forward to pay for it and voila they would be gone this was Schumer outlining this plan right\nAnd that's it yeah and they were selling them to say look what a genius he came up with this strategy or the voters this is a massive stroke\nMhm now this plan never gotten implemented or do you know why not\nWell they do get in for months and then that they do they're refurbishing but ah they underestimated the capacity of the people to move back

Christopher Hitchens' book God is not great or some other atheist quote classic effect and child wanted to counter bring the Bible to school day was that kind of book you'd have no objection to that would you\nOf course not that people should\nYou know go and work on their own thing but for us we appreciate the fact that over five hundred thousand kids last year\nDid bring their Bible to school on that first day of that first Thursday of of October and it's great you know you run the manual for example made that comment a few weeks ago saying I Know it's politically incorrect but what we need and in our public square is more faith and family\nWe could ... around the manual send him one way to do and you know what I'm saying and marriage you know America Argo\nI'm saying okay here's one way to do it let's let kids and encourage kids to participate and bring your Bible to school and that's that's one way kids can be proud of those attributes those moral convictions that are good for our nation there's nothing to be fearful about people who want to love their neighbor\nAnd one would hope not um how did you pick October is the time to do this\nYou know it was just a day there's so many special days going on now that was a date but it was available it's easy to remember the first Thursday of October every year and again this is our fifth year of doing it started with eight thousand kids or the next year it was a hundred and two fifty two hundred fifty thousand and last year five hundred and fifty two thousand so\nUh we're grateful for the participation and people can go to the bring your Bible dot org website we have lots of assist\nA sheets there that even the legal assistant sheet that they could print off so they can take to school that day and there's affirmation

talk to an expert in tax in the state planning to find out whether or not the president and his family engaged in law for tax the fertile\nAnd tax avoidance schemes or did they do something illegal\nLet me read you part of the articles of very very long article some of us would probably prefer to wait for the movie\nThe contrary to Trump's assertion that he received one million dollars from his dad and turned it into a ten billion dollar fortune it says that he received in today's dollars at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire ... much of it through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen nineties into Fort\nTrump participated in dubious pack scheme during the Nineteen nineties including quote instances of outright fraud\n\nThat greatly increased the fortune they receive from his parents investigation by the New York times has found were going to ask my expert did the Trump family engage in quote outright\nFraud [noise]\nSaid that much of the money came to Trump hope because he helps his parents dodged taxes she and her siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars and gifts\nRecords indicate that Mr Trump helped his father taken property tax reduction worth millions help formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those property for transferred him and his siblings\nThe article said quote the maneuvers met with little resistance from the IRS close but what does that mean met with little resistance you mean it was lawful you mean the iris didn't care I mean the IOC didn't challenge it what are you saying\nSays that Fred and Mary Trump from parents transferred\n\nOver one billion dollars in wealth to their children which could produce a tax bill at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate than imposed on gifts in an inheritance is but the trumps paid\nOnly about fifty two point two million or about five percent of that\nQuote according to tax experts it is unlikely that Mr Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents he paid taxes because the acts happen too long ago and are Pakistani limitations there is no time limit however on civil fines for tax fraud\nI'm going to find out from our expert whether or not the president should be worried about a civil fines for quote tax\nFraud quote unquote [noise] now what is this based at one\nTime says the findings are based on interviews with Trump's former employees and advisors and more than a hundred thousand pages of documents describing the inner workings and the men's profitability of his empire they include documents from public sources mortgages at the deeds probate records financial disclosure reports\nInvestigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records bank statements financial audit accounting lectures cash disbursement reports invoices cancelled checks\nQuote most notably the documents include more than two hundred return from Fred Trump his company's in various Trump partnerships and trusts\nWhile the records do not include the president's personal tax returns and reveal a little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad dozens of corporate partnerships and tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises\nThat Fred was a relentless in front of creative ways to channel money to his children that Trump when he was three years old\nAlready earning two hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars from his dad quote the most overt fraud was\nAll county building supply and maintenance\nThat's accompanied formed by the Trump family in Nineteen Ninety two of the New York times all counties ostensible purpose was\nTo be the purchasing agent for ... for Fred Trump's buildings by everything from boilers the cleaning supplies it did no such thing records an interview show instead all county siphon millions of dollars from Fred Trump's him empire by simply marking approaches has already made by his employees\nThose millions effectively untaxed gifts then slowed to all counties owners Donald Trump his siblings and a cousin Fred Venus the padded all county receipts to justify bigger ... increases for thousands of tennis\n[noise] again I Will ask my expert in just a few minutes did does any of this amount to something illegal doesn't amount to fraud I'm holding in my baby round libertarian fingers in article from force magazine data July eight year of our lord twenty fourteen\nHeadline held the one billion dollar Kennedy family fortune defies death and taxes quote\nProtected by a labyrinth of trust as well as tax credits that would make jokes at the Kennedy proud the Kennedy fortune now spans approximately thirty family members including the surname Shriver offered and Smith\nThe bulk of the family's wealth is held in Douglas across which range in value from tens of thousands too much at twenty five million nearly all are managed by Joseph keep the Kennedy enterprises\nLocated in New York City the trust also protect the family after it from another set of prying fingers uncle Sam's by holding assets in so called dynasty dynasty trust which are passing air to air for decades if not longer the Kennedy family is largely insulated\nFrom the estate tax handled correctly a dynasty trust could potentially maintain and on taxable fortune indefinitely the oldest Kennedy trust on record dates back to Nineteen thirty six\nAnd then they talk about the sale of the family's most valuable asset the iconic merchant my merchandise marching in Chicago\nOnce thought to be the largest building in the world and thanks to a carefully crafted deal the Kennedy family differ or possibly voted completely capital gains tax on nearly half the value of the sale\nThe secret sauce however is accepting partnership unit in lieu of cash diverse capital gains tax\n\nThe partnership units are placed in trust capital gains taxes could potentially be deferred for ever\nBut when one of the Kennedy family members who and handles this trust was contacted Christopher Kennedy said and I'm quoting we are very public family with a very private investment philosophy you just wonder how many reporters the New York times ever put on the\nKennedy family and how they have their money in these so called generation skipping trust to defer taxes indefinitely if not forever\n[noise]\nWe'll put another one up on Larry on the dot com called\nJoseph Kennedy and generation skipping trust in this article written by a truck in the state lawyer about what the Kennedy family has done\nAnd how they got the attention of Congress for it says that Congress a became aware\nOf these so called generation skipping trust and try to do something about it but whatever they did critic other loopholes that other tax lawyers are driving Arnold Schwarzenegger's Hummer through\nDid the president\nOr his father engage in illegal tax fraud\nOr did they simply hire very shrewd people to minimize their tax liability\nThe way virtually everybody does including John Kerry who say five hundred thousand dollars from his yacht by arguing that he's more and get\nIn Rhode Island even though he really hasn't in Massachusetts because Rhode Island doesn't have the same amount of taxes did the president\nOr his father engage in anything illegal or talk to an expert about that when I come back also the vote on Brett Kavanaugh maybe this week and the FBI report could come out any moment now I Am Larry Elder do not lead\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove mhm so I'll give you an example if you if I make sure I'm suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars of the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be one of the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that market\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars and like a lot of clients of mine decided when the down\nI came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return what four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left\nThat would be the value of the gift now a decade later there's been\nImprovements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell my children sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep\nThree hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain the leverage of real estate so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how

three point five million dollars in cash\nA were passed so for example the Kennedys died before the uh Nineteen eighty six\nA generation skipping tax was introduced so they could pass wealth down to their grandchildren without a an extra\nLevel of the state tax at every generation but I'm sure that they had some dental Joe Kennedy was not exactly the cleanest a a living person alive and I'm sure that there are there were problems or ways that he skirted the tax laws um I just don't know\nNow the article the New York times ... says that ah the statute of limitations has run on many of these transactions but there is no statute of limitations for fines for civil fraud that is ... is the president or in in jeopardy\nWell I mean the IRS has been scrutinizing the Trump family for many decades I I just I just can't imagine that suddenly they're going to say oh look what we found\nAnd now they're civil penalties there is one thing that you should know though and that's if if something if some gift was made and no gift tax return was filed to report it in any way there's no statute of limitations on the assessment of tax on that gift\nMhm are you uh went to war and you got a degree in economics ... were you there around the same time you know who was there\n[noise] um no he uh I I started at the Wharton School and he and both both he and I were actually at the undergraduate school but he I Believe I graduated in Nineteen sixty seven sixty eight and I didn't start there until the fall of sixty nine so we didn't we were not contemporary\n... when you read the New York times article did anything occur to you they gave you an idea of what to do or what\nNot to do it did anything pop up when you said wow I never thought of that or boy that's a bad idea\nNo I mean the the article does talk about the most important part of their\nA movement of wealth downstream wants to do things to the value\nThe gifts because our gift in a state taxes are what we used to call in Latin class at the lower um they're based upon the value at the date of death or in the case of gifted on a date of the gift and so there are techniques which are used to diminish the value of the of the gift so for example\nIf I were to give you a twenty percent uh ownership of my house just to be for me to Larry Elder over twenty percent interest\nBut instead I I that that's one value twenty percent of whatever the value is because in California we have the ability to pursue to sell the property if you worry partial owner fractional interest on the other hand if I put it into a partnership or limited liability company the whole property\nAnd in that in the uh organizing documented says nobody can partition this and revisit the only person who can make decisions about the property\nThen you have in your twenty percent you cannot sell it\nAnd you cannot a manager so I have the management control and I have the ownership control and that diminishes your twenty percent so if you went out and tried to sell your twenty percent interest in our partnership\nIt would be far less than a twenty percent of the underlying real property so I've just diminished the value of that has been accepted by the IRS or in the courts and the only thing that the IRS argues with practitioners like me is what is the discount that has allowed\nVery commonly it's twenty or thirty percent that's a kind of a safe harbor these days\nWe have just one minute left of the Washington Post I'm Karen told us he or she is a reporter with them described the New York times report as depicting a quote criminal enterprise close to ... would you call what you read a criminal enterprise\nWell and if you want to call virtually every ... every closely held business criminal enterprise that they are uh you know it's it's very common that a a an older business owner or takes no salary in order for more of the profits to go to his employee children\nI mean it's just so many ways that people
