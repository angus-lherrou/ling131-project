WWW night storm\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P s state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and\n... by the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually win a Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so what would change one seat there and then makes a a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead\nSays on there that he literally right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot\nAnd that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists\nThey don't want this new vision than it's been so articulated by the Seattle city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that ... tax that they pass\nAnd ah we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay this hadn't tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with\nAnd and your opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against the tax cuts and jobs bail she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attack say don't love it's another way to get people's money and the people in this country are seeing a new way and that thanks to Donald Trump kind of doing it with his policies out what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved\nIn our state and across the country that unemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three full terms in the U.S\nSenate um

smoke based on very bad policy if they keep us from clearing out the under brash and getting rid of that tinder\nUh it's ready to explode the moment there was a forest fire we have had catastrophic forest fires\nIn our federal for us and that's got to change and that's one of the first things I Would do another thing is we are really hurting when it comes to transportation because our state is so poorly\n... and the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that the federal dollars for infrastructure that my opponent has been unable to do\nWas harshly because he can work with the Trump admitted to directly and and but also partially because I think you share with a Trump Administration to desire to move us to fixing our roads rather than building new choo choo train as our friend taught her refers to them yes uh that actually go nowhere\nExactly you know we're on the cusp of a very exciting time and transportation a cleaner cars and and the ability to use a a phone app to find a drivers and writers in order to a double and triple up in car pools like we've never seen before you know kind of an ... like\nVersion of transportation for the commute and there's so many new innovative things that are coming down the road it's just a shame to use the phrase it's just a shame that we spend so much time wasting billions of dollars on a\nOn not getting our folks to and from work and back home to visit with their families for the rest of the day so I'm I feel very strongly about if there is there's another thing that really affects all of that and this is nationwide it's bringing down the cost of higher education\nAnd that we know the federal government has had a major role in increasing those costs\nAnd uh we've got to step in the time has come and it's an issue that I think all of that around the country are going to be working on\nAnd what are what are some of the promising ways you could bring down the ridiculous cost of higher education\nWell the the biggest one is that a federal use of of loans a bit has allowed the cost at the university is to go skyrocketing\nNo of

falling\nPoverty was falling\nTalk about economic merit goes right now\n[noise]\n\n[noise] what I find interesting about that assertion is it implies\nThat what Trump is doing with the economy is exactly what Obama would be doing with the economy or a Democrat will be doing with the economy really you'd be cutting for regulation for every new one that you are inactive\nReally you would have a gotten us out of the wall street deal with President Trump did really you would have pulled out of the\n\n... to agreement and updated it the way president has\n\nAre you serious when President Obama was in office the Associated Press talked about the third year of his recovery I Need to back up first when Obama came into office his economic team\nCame up with certain scenarios scenario one is we do nothing\nAnd then under that scenario Obama estimated that the GDP Growth would be about three percent Obama never had a single year where the GDP Growth reached three percent which he predicted if he'd done nothing will be three percent\nBut he did a lot\nOf stimulus plan that most people don't believe stimulated\nThe raise taxes\nHe signed a brand new entitlement program known as Obamacare and don't get me started on the regulations to fight climate change to force feed an economy from a\nFossil fuel based one tour renewables when you add all those things up it was the worst economic recovery since the forties and as a rule\nThe deeper the recession the bigger the bounce back not so here in the third year of the Obama recovery here's what the Associated Press ... wrote in the Associated Press is not at all conservative\nQuote since World War two ten us recessions had been followed by a recovery that lasted at least three years\nIn a pie and Alison shows that by just about any measure the one that began in June two thousand nine is the weakest\nEconomic growth has never been weaker in a post war recovery consumer spending has never been so slack only once his job growth in slower more than in any other post World war two recovery people who have jobs are hurting their paychecks have fallen\nBehind inflation and if\n\nYou can't find anybody more left than have a

quote\nHonestly and he wants to take credit or you're telling me had Hillary won this election she would cut the regulations\nWhich you would you cut the regulations governing Wall Street the regulation that you fought for really\n\nThis is incredible for the first time in a long time income for growing real incomes adjusted for inflation are growing under Obama\nWhat do we hear well we

from regular recessions I thought all recessions where financial but what do I know\nExcuse after excuse after excuse\nHe didn't come close to ... to his projections not even close\nHere he is taking credit for Trump I thought you guys hated him I thought Trump was giving all access to the rich I I thought Trump was was was\nUndermining your your agenda uh I'm doing your legacy and now you're bragging about what was happening under Trump I don't get it from\nWages were arriving\nOn insurance rate was falling\nPoverty was falling\nTalk about economic merit goes right now remember who

really simple reason [noise]\nPrior to that tax reform being passed corporates were sitting at record profits as a percentage of GDP record cash reserves in wages were at an all time low relative to

governments of those women done multiple William [laughter] off enough\nWith now there are a lot of ways to express or the ideological divide we have in this country and one of them is this half the country believes there's a free lunch and the other half of stopping them from eating Bernie Sanders tells this young person how much do you pay nothing punch paper childcare nothing comes you pay for college missing\nWho's your favorite healthcare nothing nothing\nThey don't have taxpayers in Sweden even in Sweden Bernie Sanders government has\nNo money they can tax it they could borrow it they can printed what they have no money in Sweden is moving away\nIs the president and chief executive officer of resources to let's say San Francisco based think tank founded back in Nineteen Seventy nine please welcome back to the program so we sell me how you doing\nWell thank you very how are you\nI'm doing great I'm Sally a Bernie Sanders wants Medicare for all can you give us your analysis of what this would do\n[noise] yes it would be a complete disaster and if you know Larry I'm Canadian I grew up in Canada under a single payer I started a publication back in Nineteen eighty eight I'm I'm waiting your turn a guy to waiting lists the average Canadian family um wait Twenty one point two weeks from\nSeeing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by specialist Bernie Sanders want the Canadian health care system is eat that Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to add vision care free drugs\nAnd um and and and and free vision care and and um you know of course he he had the bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for whom want to become president\nAnd of course he never talked about what it would cost and how it would be paid for\nBut it's Charles ... center said\nThirty two trillion dollars over ten years all private coverage under his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would lose their coverage immediately and we would all be\nLike people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under Medicare system be on waiting lists are care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSally how would why why does a a Medicare for all seem to test so well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single payer has been around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary\nFor the Democratic presidential nomination he brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all and so\nYou know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again\nThat you know who wouldn't want something that's free but as I say he never talked about how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course is I'm a new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\n... member of the Democratic socialist with America she is going around with Bernie telling candidate you know promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in this midterm election on November six\nAre these candidates who are running to the left\nThat Ben Jealous or for governor of Maryland this I'm Andrew Gillum who is running against um [noise] the Santa's for the governorship in Florida how do these people do to the American people are they finally understanding by people like you and me tell educating them on how terrible to be what the cost to be their tax burden\nAnd you know in the latest poll a study out of the American association of medical colleges\nThey're predicting a shortage of a hundred and Twenty one thousand doctors\nBy twenty thirty because so many docs sixteen percent increase so many dogs you know quit medicine under Obamacare but the thought of being under a single payer system where Bernie says they would be paid forty percent below\nWhat they're paid now um because they their salaries their payments would be tied to Medicare so this will encourage more doctors to quit and the best and brightest young people not to go into medicine\nSally talk to me about a pre existing conditions I thought it was an assault on the on the insurance model to force insurance carriers to take people with preexisting illnesses now hearing Republican say hey hey Democrats don't say that we're going to take away preexisting conditions because we're not I'm confused\nWell I Know it's very confusing and of course it's all goes back to the fact that when Trump what's running as president and the Republicans were running in the twenty sixteen presidential they promised that they would repeal and replace Obamacare unfortunately you know by the early fall at twenty Seventeen they hadn't been able to do it and it wasn't done\nUm we're seeing some very good things being done through the administration secretary

I just mentioned the ... detective Jim orders undercover narcotics officer he's the one who made this all happened if it wasn't for him\nNone of this would have ever come to light and in fact as you said you know and it's true the FBI and the d._a. where only focus very much on the drug case but\nJim Woods said what about this woman who died this woman kind of mind longer who died why don't we why are we talking about her\nAnd because eventually because of gyms perseverance and they actually ... opened up the man the the the the homicide investigation into the death of kind of my mongering once you once they did that and we're allowed to search for evidence that connection with her death they found everything else\nThe other of course big point of the movie is that initially the mainstream media didn't care about this case yeah it's amazing and the reason I didn't care about it because it makes them ...\nVery unpleasant thoughts about abortion yeah\nAnd they don't want to go there no no they don't want anything that might in fact you know ruled by you know have any effect on roe v Wade and this film certainly do some ... ... am portray abortion a very good like because you get to hear about abortion and you don't hear it for a pro life activist you hear from two of the you know during the trial too good abortion is to legal abortion is for us to understand to describe it good abortion\nAnd when they when the jury heard what good abortion sounded like they didn't see much of a distinction between that and murder\nMhm um I ask you this before when we interviewed a golf now Rick regarding the the drug stuff I'm sure he he he's aware that was illegal I'm sure yeah he's got conscious consciousness of guilt about that but about the abortion I got the impression he didn't think he'd done anything morally wrong\nNo not at all in fact you know he feels vindicated that he was helping poor women you know that he you know that he really it's a hero to the poor\nYou know at some level he ... a certain claims that that's the case you know when he I mean even worse by the way and I know we're at Salem Radio station I mean can you imagine he also had scripture passages have given me scripture passages that justify abortion to justify what he did he's written poetry pruning when one of the homeless he wrote pruning and you can imagine\nThat reference he was using that that we need to prove and for things to grow well I mean I really extraordinary but he's\nYou know match to me he is complete lunatic but it's all the people that are enabled him to make a make for very chilling reading and very chilling knowledge\nAnd medical him he is my guest she is the co producer of the movie ... the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer I've seen it it is a moving deep disturbing film I urge you all to see it did you ever speak with doctors are saying\nYeah I've been into prison so I spent about three hours with him and um\nYou know it's it's amazing he actually lives up to all the cliche for the serial killer he's like Hannibal Lecter he has this very soft voice he's very highly educated ... you know has the whole thing about his hands he's asking look at how big my hands are his whole thing about his feet which of course becomes very chilling when you realized that he cut the feet of children and kept them in jars\nHe sang to me twice he touched my leg inappropriate to continuously andme and he has this really soft voice and he has the demeanor so he really is in prison forever and never going to see the light of day again\nAnd freedom and he has the demeanor like he's just come off the golf course he has to very relaxed and he's smiling all the time and but every now and again when I asked them hard questions he would do this kind of brain freeze and go oh\nYou knew what park that's like in an extremely creepy weight you know so he's yeah he's every kind of creep actually I don't believe your movies showed his wife\nNo that's correct or he wasn't married yes what she aware of what was going on\nThey're not ... not only was she aware of what what was going on she was involved so in fact it's actually one of the most awful parts are what are we leave her out of the movie\nBecause he couldn't include everything so we'll have to you know the plant itself to an R. movie and she was one of them I mean it and also actually bringing her and makes it really dark\nBecause she was involved in what they called the Sunday babies when the clinic would completely empty of every of all the other workers and he and her would see what they called the most difficult cases which was people up to nine months and we knew about that\nAnd because people would see some of the remains the following day and stuff so she actually went to prison ... but only for a short period because she cooperated with the authorities children yeah seven children from three different by any of them involved no none of the children involved um seven children three different wives yes\nYeah but none of the children now in fairness none of the children were involved in the youngest child the youngest child was with a high school student too and you know was there during the raid on the house\nOr we'll have a few seconds left and what is his reputation now in Pennsylvania specifically Philadelphia black community what's his reputation now\nWell I think you know he he now has the correct reputation for being I for being an animal in a monster but I Would urge people to go and see the movie and they can find a local listings of Gulf no movie dot com and don't be scared don't be scared because I Know you're hearing me failed and stuff but actually that's a lot of that from the book on the worst stuff in the book the movie is PG Thirteen anyone could watches\nAnd ... the movie is called God's mail the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer I urge you to all of you and thank you very much for coming in with great ... thanks Dana Rohrabacher up next I'm Larry Elder Larry over\nAll through all the other\nCongressmen what about this migrant caravan how big a factor is that\nWell I think that that ties right into what we're talking about was Trump\nWhen people begin to understand that we have a guy a tough guy like Trump as our president it gives us some kind of confidence that we're not going to our people our country will not be invaded\nAnd are Democrats or doing nothing but a ... year jak open other Republicans these folks are there there are there's if there's an invasion of our country doesn't exist in fact quite opponent\nUh this guy earlier Wilder\nUh as ended up saying that it off here or there are here illegally we're going to be giving them Medicare and all these are federal benefits\nWill surprise surprise when we leave we looked at Latin America we have families would we do anything to get them here if we got the politicians all the time\nThe finance health care and education and other benefits what were the crater on people can't do that we got to be loyal to people like her father my father worked so hard to make sure he had a good education\nAnd they said if I people they went overseas and save the ... the Japanese ... sex\nBut the fact is they were loyal to the American family which is a United States every race and every other group we are Americans that's a lot of people\nThat our president is a tough guys watch out for us and some people on the other side of the line or not watching out for America they have some kind of interest or other interest on\nMy congressman Dana Rohrabacher California forty if he's running for reelection in tough district your opponent got the endorsement of progressive Democrats of America and he signed off on every one of the groups or a\nBoost positions on their questionnaire including things like reparations for slavery Medicare for all I\nMean this guy should be pretty easy to defeat in your district I Would think\nWell they accept what God is a ... incredible propaganda campaign or your do have what President Trump cold and fake news it's out there and lower your your big player in trying to make sure the or get without\nFifty fifty light the facelift in second Fifteen seconds congressman\nAll right well that's the I Will just saying I
