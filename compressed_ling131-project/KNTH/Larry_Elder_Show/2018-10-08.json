with the chronology when with those misdeeds have been perpetrated\nAnd when we're not even win but how would the president Polk been involved with them he was in South America should I'm asking\nWell this would have been the Nineteen eighties I think in the Nineteen nineties\nRight so the president was president ... plus in around right so I don't know if\nJohn all the second was pope at that at that time right so so ... and ... and so\nUm I I don't know exactly\nWhen when the first accusations came forward I think it around Nineteen eighty or Nineteen right and then I said listen\nPope would have been him you know South America the time why would she\nProbably would have been a very modest preached to\nPrevent Zach way so why would whichever one of his name is ... the uh\nGot a ... why would he accused the pope will turn his head and\nNot being involved and and the prison pope was in ... in two thousand and two was the more you know\nHe was right so this was you know but I fear I came in with I think he's accusing\nBar walls or\nThe studios with you know I got to go here briefly and have some fun with the second okay\nBecause you've heard me say for years freedom never takes a break\nAnd for ten years now and just see the actual anniversary will be April twenty six coming up but we are in our ten year now here on armed American radios monster broadcast particularly\nWith ten solid years a decade in right now and we've never missed a show not one time you've never had a guest hosting this chair it's been me all along\nI think we had a couple technical glitches over ten

... you know maybe the third our of the program something like that\nBut we're proud of that freedom never takes a break on armed American radios monster broadcast I can promise you that and I want to

have come up to me and [noise]\nWell I I Can't thank you enough believe me we're still sifting through the email we got so much of it that is unbelievable\nAnd one more thing you know I took some time off a couple of weeks back\nProbably to anyway best I could took a few days went down to the seaside beach area you know just a little bit east to Destin west to Panama City the route thirty a area of the Florida Panhandle gorgeous beaches down there\nAnd when I had a house rented for about four days when I got down there I found out that there was some construction work going on in the house I said no no no not going to happen in the house I paid for not going to happen right so a rather than make us think out of the deal you know what I decided to do I decided to play nice with everybody\nWith the with the real estate agent with the with the the the the the managing company which I Believe was Wyndham I play nice with them and you know and and I had an opportunity\nTo me it just restore my space really in in these tough incredibly difficult trying political times in America today sometimes we we tend to look at things through that prism we don't know who we are talking to and sometimes we attack\nWe go on the attack because we're so edgy\nWe just don't know when this this this world we live in today puts us in that terrible mood\nAnd you know I met some great people in one of them was a guy named Vance garrison who was the roof or doing the work at the house and I have a conversation with my said look we're on vacation he says no we don't want to mess with your vacation when are you leaving\nI sit on Wednesday he says will see on Wednesday did enjoy your time off and it was everything just worked\nIs what I'm telling you you get it back and he's with royal roofing and restoration those guys were unbelievable\nAnd they're listening on W. while well right now one oh one FM news talk in the Panama City area was fun I got to listen to my own show\nAiring down there while I was sitting there having a nice big fat cigar listening to the lay waves lap up on the shore a couple of weeks ago and I really appreciate the help from those guys and everybody vast amount of love you guys you guys have a great job thank you store people like you were just restore faith in humanity so nice to meet good people and their fans of the show what does that tell your right\nOkay so that's some fun stuff let me give you the guest line up we're going to jump right into it\nAlan Gottlieb is going to join you know I have so much to go over with and we're going to keep them for a couple of segments I've got a surprise call coming in\nFrom Rob Pincus about a video you got to squeeze in in the final segment so let's go right smack to Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation Alan how the heck are you there is faith in humanity out there isn't there out and there are great people out there when you find the right\n[noise] yeah they're all getting honors [laughter]\nThey are all gone if I can attest to that I Know Vance and the rest of those guys are where we had some just fantastic conversation and you're right they absolutely are\nBoy but it was it was a it was kind of an eye opening thing you go in and you think bad attitude and then what do you do you draw bad things go in with a great attitude and great things happen so I just wanted to just kind of want to throw that let's start with this this is the gorilla elephant whenever you want to call it in the room cabin off you've got to tell me how you feel that if this bruising think\nWell I feel really great I think get an even guides community should be on cloud nine ah this is a very important battle to the teacher gun rights\nAnd that specially static because we have to search petitions from the second and punishing heading at the U.S cream court this term and of course a cat and I was in that it would give us a lot of problems in in getting those a cert petition either heard or you know\nUh getting a confirmation for the Supreme Court to correct the lawsuits\nSo I'm kind of excited on the on pins and needles the session\nOf the two important cases one man's coming out of the ... circuit will be one of the trial court level and then lost by one vote and bought panel and the ... circuit that's the suit get knocked out for a while at least the interstate ban on sales handguns and Atlantic she fit ...\nYou know since we're using the same lob ah\nInstant background check all across the country there's no reason why you could buy it should be able to buy and get anywhere it's the same background check and then our second suit is Kenya California in the Ninth Circuit\nWere overturned a you know again I live by panel in the Ninth Circuit [noise] uh and that's the one that deals with California so called handgun roster that's turning diminishing ever hang guys are a lot for sale in California every year\nA and virtually no new hangers get added to the list old fall off it's less less choice for buying hanging in the state of California and also deals with the so called micro Stanford requirement or where any new new handgun has to be able to the show micro stamping out on its wanted you know you're fired cartridge\nUm and and the technology it's unproven and only as a single source provider to it [noise]\nUh and it's a real problem so I'm kind of excited about both those cases and and now I have I'll have to look forward to this coming year\nOh my gosh you know Alan I have to listen to your [noise] those are pages of notes of things that I Want to talk with you about and you kind of it's so easy for you to just make it easy for me to crumble was up from way okay let's go down some of the rabbit holes that you just opened up their let's talk briefly about the two cases now that Kavanaugh is on the court\nWhat I heard and I'm speaking on behalf of my listeners just make sure that they understand what I heard I'm going to give that get that information from what I understand now\nThat with these two petitions now waiting that the court is getting ready to look at the\nDoes it or you're getting ready to file these where are we\nThere filed a we're waiting for the ... were waiting for the conference assignments right now I'm so I'm kind of ... they should be or you know there should be hopefully they'll take Kate is an uncle have argued that so we're going to wear on pins and needles right now [noise] All right\nSo let me play a little bit of devil's advocate\nWe know what happened with Gorsuch and with Thomas at the ... when they when the court did not grant start to that what I felt was a very very important case out there in California I really wish I know all of us in the gun rights community had bought and hope and pray that they were going to take they did not and of course Gorsuch\nAnd Thomas ... skating I guess the descent as to why they should have a you know blaming the fact that the courts have been\nAfraid of the second amendment as of late treating it as a second class right having said that\nIt does this if either of these two cases get in to that pushes back further for any other cases that might be upcoming in other words will the court look at this and say you know what we don't want to take these yet or if we take these maybe not pick one of these concealed carry cases down the road do we have to be concerned with that [noise]\nOne never knows no one knows what the logic is like take this all I can say is that you know as most of your listeners probably know it takes four justices I typed decide to hear a case right but it takes five it takes five to win and usually it's therefore don't think they have the vote they don't want to take the case\nSo one would have to make the assumption that the reason why brutal was it take you weren't they weren't sure they had the ...\nI'm hoping now we have this is talk\nAll right we're going to call this segment one for

have had severe doubts about President Trump this does bring Republicans together because the point is if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nHe is about as mainstream he's not somebody who's out there and we had um a fairly distinguished lawyer at our at our table who had been part of the Ted Cruz campaign\nAnd uh he was at our table over the ... and he pointed out that if you look at the names on that Heritage Foundation list\nBrett Kavanaugh was the most moderate person he could've possibly picked if you look at his judicial record he is not someone on the extreme right at all he is\nIt's a down the line like Samuel Alito like a Antonin Scalia he has a mainstream normal very distinguished conservative so if they are going to make him a victim of this kind of character assassination that due to anybody\nThat do it to you but\nI I feel like as a conservative and the reason I was a never Trump mainly because I wanted to conserve conservatism or the long run I was
