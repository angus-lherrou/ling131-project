Americans we are one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all we are am ten Seventy the answer\nReturn to our regularly scheduled program on cayenne th Houston and came to seven Seventy FM Houston\nThen I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nSo therefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that is called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by whole myth that is a I heard or I call because I've heard it\nAnd that is that if you sell you know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money a while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing and that's like the silliest thing I've ever\nHeard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go over with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nDoing very well beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we\nTalk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very uh what's the opposite of greedy I'm\nGiving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm a kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and this puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she's like a big dog you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\n[noise] and uh so the the update because people apparently are interested in this I don't know why is that\nA noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is is the mission pie think it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she slots and boom a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she peas right on the patio and colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but I Hope so [laughter]\nAnyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week or looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy's producing right now there's some talk that\nThe unemployment rate has rates are low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely it's going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days would that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio um you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because the longer term bonds\nBonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market the difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market we're falls and crashes\nIt's like there's this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a ... a couple of months ago we\nReduce the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh uh put half of our bond portfolio into government or the cash equivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up\nAnd ... because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we wanna we wanna make sure that we can\nMake money when you know to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd there's a link on there that says meet with an advisor and if you click on that then though you know we'll sit down with you and we'll talk about how to

in forty three states and we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stuff\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that but again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our class who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collected\nIt's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference\nIn ages difference in income different in health all those kinds of things there are actually eight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nSo how do you figure that at\nAll well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our firm we put we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listening to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so\nBe that as it may I Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait until I'm Seventy\nAnd start collect Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually start when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait\nFor every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six to seven eight increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nThere's an incentive there to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what are we believe to be the reasons why you may want to wait to your Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy then\nIt to your Seventy because band the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me\n[laughter] if you don't want it I'll take it [laughter] but uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that the you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut ah there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period\nThan we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement\nSo here you got two options won it and they all start with going to our

out there in the Houston area and a first of all my trust the engineer Jim here's where the real nice Astros shirt white and blue and white shirt with blue and orange trim and he got big shiny glittery goal letters the Astros and\nHe's ... he's I Want to give the flip around and\nGet so I can see the back of his shirt that a number a ten gr yell and uh uh and by the way Jim I Want you to tell our listeners 'cause you're a big fan of Gary I'll tell our listeners what grail did this week uh ... just ... just in case they don't know ... ...\nUm and uh that is going to be\nA white seven twenty you could watch it on NBC Houston is a won't unfortunately started out uh\nA downside with three losses bounce back with one way and last week so I Want you know it's better than go at all and for and we beat the Indianapolis Colts and uh in overtime and that's going to be um the so we're one in three now and\nThen we play the Dallas Cowboys they're two and two and I want to share with you a memory of my going to the very first Houston Texans game I'm not talking about pre season I'm Talking about the very first scheduled I'm a regular season game and that was in ...\nSeptember the eight two thousand and two over at what was at that time called reliant stadium you remember ah right near the Astrodome announced energy stadium and up until that point\nOr two thousand and two it been since Nineteen sixty one says a an expansion team in one its very first game that was the Minnesota Vikings with brand park and you ... you may remember and uh so it had not been done in forty one years and in fact that's the only time it had been done and only one time ever in the history the NFL\nThe new team when it's very first regular season games uh and we were playing the Dallas Cowboys on nationwide broadcast TV on Sunday night\nAnd I went to that game I grew up in Dallas Cowboys fan um that was an avid fan of uh Tom Landry in fact I met coach Landry shortly before he passed away I met him in Austin\nAnd I've met rushed all back who was a you know a big hero mind as quarterback I met him years ago at a church function that he actually spoke at it uh\nUm he's he's Catholic himself but he actually spoke\nSpeaks a lot of different you know even juggle Christian churches and he's a ... a very fine Christian man be spoken a Baptist church they used to go to Dallas when I Lived up there\nAnd he gave a great um inspirational talk there and uh I met him at two told Jones and and but Tony Dorsett I've just met lots of the Dallas Cowboys I met a Troy Aikman\nUm and uh met met Jerry Jones the current owner and Jimmy Johnson who was the coach for a while\nBut I used to be an avid avid fan um and by the by the way a little quick note side note about Roger Starbuck before um I go on a um you don't you know the term um well in fact I'll just wait for the ... hold off and say what the term is\nA he was playing in a game I forget the situation but when he was playing for the Dallas Cowboys and they called him Roger Dodger 'cause he had an amazing ability to run from\nWhoever was a scramble around the backfield while people were trying to tackle and they just throw like a touchdown pass\nOut of nowhere and uh there was one game where he wanted a last second you know bought a pass where he just he the way down the field into a crowd of people in the\nDallas Cowboy receiver caught the ball and afterwards a reporter said Roger what were you thinking when he threw the ball up in the air and Roger said I did a couple of hail Marys and just pray that somebody can get another cowboy catch it\nAnd that reporter seized upon that phrase that he's had a couple of hail Marys and he called the Hail Mary pass\nAnd to this day that's where the phrase Hail Mary pass comes when he's the one and you've probably seen your fair share of those uh you they rarely work but one time when once in a while do you know maybe one of the most famous ones ever or one of the definitely\nA possibly the most famous one every college football anyway was Doug ... uh with Boston College\nAgainst a Miami Hurricanes was a um Bertie cos are both of them were expected to be like the top two finalists for the Heisman Trophy that you're a lot of people predicted that whoever won that game that team's quarterback with when the ... when it was on\nUm I don't remember if it was actually on Thanksgiving Day of Thanksgiving weekend but I remember I was home from\nA for for the holidays and was watching the game and I'll never forget I was [laughter] that don't don't tell my ... mother about you know that I'm a announced this but we were playing poker [laughter] I'm from a good Baptist family and my mother would would would would would probably cringe jaws promoting poker but we were playing poker\nBut it's just for pennies I think my dad and my brothers and I and we were watching in the game was back and forth it was like over a thousand yards of off in between Boston College and and um\nAnd a Miami Hurricanes and on the very final play the game a Boston College lined up I think about like his own forte yard line and I turned to one of my brothers I said I'll bet you a hundred dollars Doug flew to use ... throw a Hail Mary pass and win the game\nAnd my brother stuck his hand out to me and I chickened out and put my hand back in the last second didn't shake on it and that's exactly what happened I missed out on one at a hundred bucks back battle the bed but Doug ...\nThrew it down the field and he didn't even know it was a Hail Mary pass and the whole big crowd of people from Miami and Boston College players jumped on the air he\nDidn't know who caught he signaled a touchdown and then it was just a throng of people went out on the field and that's what he did win the Heisman Trophy that season\nBut uh anyway I'm Doug ... he was interviewed by someone and about you know I write for the game but for reporters came around and they started asking him you know different questions about the play and he said first of all tell me who caught it he didn't even know caught the ball it turned out it was his roommate got him but are feeling I Believe was his name\nAnd ah so that would that play goes down in college lord but that was called a Hail Mary pass just as you've seen in other games\nLike that and that came from Roger Starbuck say and he'll Marion thrown a past a on the field the Dallas Cowboys but back to Dallas I used to be a cowboy fan\nBut when I moved to Houston there were numerous reasons why I had um I I'm not going to say anything to negative so I'll just I'll just say there were\nSeveral things that have happened over the years is started dampening are putting a damper on my enthusiasm about being a cowboys fan I'm not the least of which is when they fired Tom Landry an ceremonies Lee they are but just a bunch of different things happen where I was less than enthusiastic about being a cowboys fan and I moved to Houston\nAnd the Houston Texans I'm teen the they had a contest for the name and they announced it was maybe the Texans and ah they were building a stadium which at that time was a reliance stadium\nFor became energy and they were getting ready to gear up for their opening season I thought you know if there's ever a time there's a legitimate time to get away with that just seemed like a total loser [laughter]\nUm if the you know a total turn coat and a traitor if there's ever a legitimate time to change or sports sports allegiance for a a chain it's when you're the charter fan of a brand new team because they got to get their fan from somewhere okay so I thought you know what\nI Do also always have a little bit of cowboy blood I mean especially when they play the Redskins\nI'll I'm going to become a charter Houston Texans fan so I decided to do that got me a Houston Texans Jersey\nAnd it was all ready to you know and I edited interviewed a guy named Chuck banker who was a recruiting coach for the Houston Texans they interviewed him on TV show had used at that time and he was talking about the upcoming season I said by the way who is our very first like real game I guess he says he gets the Dallas Cowboys I Gulf I thought oh my goodness I've never rode it against the Dallas Cowboys in my life well\nI got a last minute ticket and I went to relate rely at stadium and I I I was feeling like some changes of guilt but excitement to but I'm going to go to root against the Dallas Cowboys\nAnd I went in to the stadium and they were just the Houston Texans ... you know everybody was wearing shirts that didn't have any stains or anything on a brand new clothes or by bought as new fans of the first season\nAnd uh as we are going yet as I say it'd been forty one years and only one time ever in history had an NFL expansion team won his first game and\nUm everybody was yellow obey the cowboys you know all this stuff but you really didn't sense that anybody actually thought we would be America's Team the Dallas Cowboys\nOn a Sunday night game but everybody's watching on our very first gave you really didn't have anybody really believe that and our very first Dr we scored went ahead seven and nothing and all of a sudden the sense of confidence built up\nOr you could just ... cents every by everybody was saying we can really do this and\nWe never looked back we were never behind and we won Nineteen to ten and my my engineer Jim has led putting up here in the store because I think he's hardly tell the story a few times on the air but\nThat that was on a Sunday night everybody to go to war it's theoretically anyway strobe will call in sick for the next day but uh uh everybody to go to work on a Monday morning and I left\nThe uh ... what was as I say called ... said he would that time I left the parking lot about two or two thirty in the morning and there were still thousands of people celebrate them out there about the when one of the biggest you know moments in sports history in in Houston being the Dallas Cowboys I mean we'll never you know that's something we could always uh\n... what will never forget that there's something we can always claimed to or ... you know matter no matter what our record is against the cowboys and the future we can only say our first game ever we beat you guys so we're playing the Dallas Cowboys tonight\nAnd again that's getting bit seven twenty pm Sunday Night Football be the only game on TV and I'm the only with football game in Houston right now is one in three Dallas is two and two but I see what this game is way beyond the records and it's a regardless of what you know have figures into our\nYou know chances for playoffs or anything like that which is not like a great right now but obviously it'd be a good step towards that if we win tonight but it's totally not about that as a bragging rights for the state of Texas\nAnd um the uh\nYou know we were I Wish they schedule the story play Dallas is a regular game every year you think they would do that I just don't understand why they didn't but we only play every several years and so and only a ... you know in every other time once here in Houston and the next time in Dallas\nSo it'll be it'll be the first time in quite a long time I think I I Can't remember how many years but quite a few quite a few years that we've played them here in Houston is a regular game not not just a scrimmage gamer preseason game\nBut the anyway I'll be at seven twenty night go Houston Texans and stomp those cowboys [laughter] so ah anyway um that's that's my little Houston Texans a story about meeting the cowboys and just a minute I'm going to tell you about some things have happened in college football that\nThe centers yeah anyway so Texas is now I'm a ranked uh let's see there are five and one and they've now moved all the way I Oklahoma fell for number seven to eleven but ... has moved all the way up from number Nineteen to number nine\nSo we have a chance to knock off I say we are my favorite bears have a chance to knock off the number nine team in the nation\nI'm In Austin so that would really a win some respect if we can do that in that game is going to be at a\nA two thirty pm on this coming Saturday you can watch it on TV on ESPN but might want to go off to the beginning but you can also hear it right here I Am ten Seventy the answer at two thirty pm early June and a half hour early and hear the pregame show with Jon Morse and I know you there's a lot of Aggie fans out there if you didn't hear about this game oh man\nA Texas ... played a Kentucky there was number Thirteen going into this game yesterday and the game which overtime\nKentucky tried to kill people going over time the ball hit the cross bar bounce backwards and so it was no good and then I Am a got their shot in overtime and scored a touchdown they won twenty to fourteen\nAnd a and M. is now going for being on the right to be number twenty two of the nation\nThere now for two and the record they're going to play South Carolina this coming Saturday October thirteenth at two thirty PM same time that our Baylor Texas game will be on

information you need there about getting those tickets\nAre just a little bit of time left to tell you about a few more of our sponsors that make our show possible you could find those listed on my website Houston and beyond\nLined up for you but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am Kendall right the host of money matters with chemical ray [noise]\nBecky jak I've been a certified financial planner professional\nFor the last twenty marvelous wonderful in very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas that we talked about with our ... and most valued clients and we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is an honor it is a privilege\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so if you would like to learn more about us you can find us on the Web we are at money matters dot net and one final\nThought is not to\nBrag at all but uh recently actually for the sixty year in a row I was named one of the top one hundred a financial independent financial advisors or by parents and\nSay we love you baby\nWell thank you and uh but without our clients we would be nowhere so therefore I put that one I give it to them now let me go over with your what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances so first of all I'm the economy is strong\nOkay by all measures we got a um uh the employment data looked a little softer than people thought but that's okay it's still pretty strong about two hundred thousand jobs a month now which is an economy our side that's pretty darn good\nAnd so the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and we saw that the ah the ten year went to which is the most watched interest rate that ah traders look at has gone up and now it's looking like it's going to hover around three and a quarter if it stays there that's a big thing so I Want to talk\nWith you about have you review your bond portfolio lately\nOkay because if you have and you you are you should I think so we'll talk about that also [noise]\nSince we are a retirement planning specialist we talk with our clients about planning around all of the things that we can think of that have to do with achieving their goals having them we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay we want you to go play and have fun and just relax and enjoy\nAnd so to do that we believe you need to have a a a plan in place that addresses all the things that could harm you\nAnd believe it or not when you are retired there are actually Eighteen risks that you face they're Eighteen of him\nAnd properly designed plan in my opinion is one that addresses all Eighteen of those so we're going to talk about risk number seven this week which is financial elder abuse okay so if you have an older family member or someone in their seventies eighties\nUh or or older I Want to talk with you about that it's a big big deal uh unfortunately now also we're gonna talk about Social Security this week so ah we're going to answer the question when should you wait until you're Seventy to start collecting Social Security\nOkay so there are reasons why you may want to do that and so we want to help you understand that\nUh that strategy now also from it from an investment standpoint you know\nWe want as I said we want you to enjoy your second childhood so whatever that means to you if you if it means playing a lot of golf if it means traveling if that means spending time with your grandchildren whatever that means to you that's great we want to help you achieve that\nBut if you lose a large amount of your money in the next market downturn than I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nTherefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that is called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by whole myth that is a I heard or I've called because I've heard it and that is that if you sell\nYou know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing and that's like\nThe silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and that's what I Want to go with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial ...\nDoing very on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till\nWe will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your\nGreedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very ah what's the opposite of greedy I'm\nGiving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive ends up before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting jak jak as my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm a kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and just stop be now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she's like a big dog you forget that she was just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd it'll be the update 'cause people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and ... a gallon a pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she peace right on the patio and colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but\nI Hope so [laughter] anyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong now the strongest some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now there's some talk\nThat the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that the unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy strong\nAnd so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months\nNow now\nThe the question I Would ask you is have you review your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bond even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are gonna lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market where it falls and crashes it's like there's this general decline that last for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a couple of months ago we\nReduce the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of ah accounts goes up\nAnd ... because it's

states and we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who I retired a retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family and ...\nHelp you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stopped\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisor for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collect it\nAnd it's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kinds of things there actually eight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question\nHow how and when I take my Social Security\nAnd what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter] so how do you figure that oh well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our farm we put a we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws change I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listening to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right\nDecision so be that as it may I Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy and start claim Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually start when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so\nYou can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you are going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy it increases by eight percent per year the benefit that you received us okay so it there's an incentive\nTo wake cause the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that but let me give you generally what are we believed to be the reasons why you may want to wait\nYou're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay so if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait to your Seventy\nBecause then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your debt your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter] if you don't want and I'll take it [laughter] but uh anyway yeah so if you if you feel that the you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse\nCan collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon\nIf you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period than we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help

financial\nAdvisors a and actually for the sixth year in a row\n[noise] a flyby thank you but you know what without our clients so we would be absolutely nowhere so all the things go to them now one of the topics that we do talk about with our clients are very frequently is estate planning which we call how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving\nAirs the fruits of your labor and the reason why you do this is because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does it not Baton Rouge sports happy\n[laughter] and you weren't happy squirts okay let me tell you something unhappy square it's not good don't want that you weren't happy squirts anyway so this is the time we normally we talk about that but this week we're going to deviate from our normal appointed task and we're gonna talk instead about you're giving the\nOpposite of greedy I think a very clean not on washed and I'm very deserving spouse okay and so we're gonna talk about how to ah protect your spouse in the event of your dad how to create a trust for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust just like\nThe thing you stick in your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property and so we're going to go over that but jak can plant and no one\n\nWould say\nMy ... am\n\nAnd\nOf course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our estate tip of the week\nSo but this week as I said we're deviating we are going to talk about your blood and most valued spouse okay so we're going to talk about a Q tip trust so what is a huge\nTrust will basically your if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your state for a state tax purposes and all that you're half of the state is what would normally go into the Q tip trust or\nSome portion there up okay now the ... trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of this trust or set up for their benefit\nSo what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decide where the money's invested your spouse decides on distributions from the trust\nSo there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse that's number one there is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's called hams\nH. E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how you to find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that you're south needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed\nTo a a Toyota lifestyle\nThey can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter] okay [laughter] so they have to they have to live within what they were living before but you know most houses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you wanted to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the cutest trust and they can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried then the new ... husband or wife that that is in the picture can have no access\nTo this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distrust can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but cue tips easier to say\nAny way hum if you'd like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website it does money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor and what we'll do is scheduled time to visit now when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon okay so that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire\nFinancial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions we want to help you with that retirement planning decisions uh", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
