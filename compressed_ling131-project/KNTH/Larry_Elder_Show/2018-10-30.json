mine things but I Will share thought or two when you go about this [noise]\nIn when I was an undergraduate and are good for them in any event they they took the survey asked this question\nHave you ever had a professor or course instructor who is used class time to express their own social and political beliefs that are completely unrelated to the subject of course\nPeople were able to say either often are not often sixty two percent said often\nA forty seven percent said not often that's amazing I mean again what they're talking about is people who in math classes or an art history classes\nWould come up with an expression of political belief now this is very difficult when people are paying as much as they are for the privilege of attending colleges and universities\nBecause if you're talking about a sociologist expressing a political opinion or even a a historian but what is the historian is talking about colonial history and wants to try to\nBring some of the lessons of colonial history oh I don't know about the Salem witch trials forward to the current day that's unrelated ... often but that that's not even this this is worse than that because this has completely unrelated to the subject of course\nBut here's the worst part a majority fifty three percent in this survey said they often felt intimidated in sharing their ideas opinions or beliefs in class because their ideas and beliefs were different from those of their professors\nA slightly larger majority feared expressing themselves because of differences with classmates on\nThis question fifty four percent said they often felt intimidated and expressing themselves when their views conflicted with those of their peers compare to forty four percent who said they didn't often feel this way\nNow this clearly is a reflection\nOf left wing intimidation does anyone believe that even at a conservative leaning college like Hillsdale\nThat liberals get intimidated or with expressing their opinions I I don't think so because it is so ... the whole surrounding culture and particularly in academia\nIs so very clearly to the left that um I ... it\nIt seems to me hard to imagine by the way if somebody's out there who uh is a liberal student who was felt to yourself intimidated by classmates or by professors\n... the double standard is is so remarkable because again you can see even with Jeff Sessions trying to speak\nThere are people who will absolutely justify the or the idea of trying to shut down the attorney\nGeneral of the United states from a liberal point of view [noise] imagine how people would have reacted if there was an attempt to do that to Eric Holder or a low Loretta Lynch in the Obama administration and meanwhile has a double standard been applied to a new

the media last no time into ... and if there's a connection between Trump's so called hateful rhetoric and what happened in Pittsburgh indeed what happened with respect to the pipe bomber\nCan we um\nAnalyze that are searching for a second\n\n[noise] was there ever any administration that spoke more harshly against the police and the Obama administration\n\n[noise] his AG Eric Holder\n\nFalsely argued that the fact that a black criminal defendant who commits a crime compared to a white criminal defendant who commits a similar crime gets a longer sentence and that's true the U.S Simpson commission says a black from the defendant versus white cream defend it gets incidence about twenty two percent longer\nWhat holder didn't tell you is it the very same sentencing commission to which he referred also said the reason for the longer sentences is that the average black criminal defendant compared to the average white from the defendant has more arrests\nAnd judges take rush into consideration when they're determined the sentence so the U.S take a mission to which Eric Holder refer to making the argument that the longer sentences\nOr an example of quote pernicious racism close quote failed to mention that the same commission also said the reason for the longer sentences has to do with legitimate factors\n\nRecall of course President Obama said that if I had a son he would look like Trayvon I Know George Zimmerman was not a cop but he was operating as a\nNeighborhood watch captain Obama in his speech\nBefore the United nations invoke Ferguson and said something to the effect of yeah you know we've got our own problems here in the United states at a place called ... and hands up don't shoot with a complete and total lie\nAnd while the Obama administration completely exonerated the officer in question they also hold the Ferguson police department institutionally racist why well the biggest finding was that the city of Ferguson is about sixty seven percent black\nYet about eighty five percent of those who are stopped on traffic stops are black a gap of what Eighteen percent or go against Eighteen points or go racism the problem with that argument is that as I said before\nCity of New York about twenty five percent of its population is black get about fifty five percent of those were stopped on traffic stops black dirty point gap\nFerguson police department almost all white three or four comfortable black the NYPD street cops majority of them are people of color\nWhy isn't the NYPD if the gap between population and percentage of those stop by cops is an example of institutional racism why isn't New York city twice if institutions racist as Ferguson\nAnd the answer is you can't do it based on just those numbers you have to look at what underlies those numbers\nIn twenty Thirteen during the Obama administration the department of justice has a research arm called the national Institute of justice and they put out a report about race and traffic stops\nSeventy five percent of black motorists admitted that they were pulled over for quote legitimate reasons costs world\nAnd the study found that you named bill sent whether it's speeding driving without a license driving with a busted tailpipe driving wasn't expire tag you name it a black motorists was more likely to commit than a white motors and the twenty Thirteen report put out by the Obama administration\nSaid that the differences and stop it you have to do with quote differences in old fending period close quote\nThe\nRabbis at a synagogue where this massacre took place in Pittsburgh have said they don't want Trump to come to Pittsburgh until she renounced is quote white nationalism close what\n\nPresident has many many many times denounce racism denounced anti Semitism and when somebody said that his assertion that he's a nationalist meant that he was a white nationalist nudge nudge wink wink she said I have no idea what you're talking about\nI have never suggest that I'm a white nationalist I mean national ... in the sense that I Am a pro American guy and type ... global the sky nothing would ever to do with race but then of course has not stopped the left of saying that the president is spending it quote dog whistle close quote to races\nListen very carefully and hear the ... are you hearing it now what is your friend Chris Matthews some say admitted\nMainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\nNow Chris Matthews\nIs most white people would not vote for racist\nYou're suggesting that most white people are therefore not racist and it's a country is majority white you're suggesting that the majority racial group in this country is not racist\nAnd I'm sure you feel that black Senate races in Spanish not racist in Asian or not racist so you are really saying is countries not a racist country\nWhy then stay with me here Chris I Know I Know you listen to the show why then with the president's in a quote dog whistle close cooperation if as you started\nFor white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\n[noise]\nMeanwhile in New York City there is an inter face memorial for the eleven people killed or this murderer guess who won guess who is one of the keynote speakers\nAl Sharpton I

publication called the trumpet\nMade share a con man of the year put him on the cover of the magazine a magazine than Obama claims he never saw\n\nIn the sermon where Reverend Jeremiah Wright suggested that nine eleven was retribution for our support of Israel I'm acquainted never heard it\nIsn't the same Obama who had Al Sharpton in the White House at least Seventy times trucked in clean for a hundred times the same sharply refer to Jews diamond merchants\nAnd he suggested that the Jews should ... coming from my house and get it on in the Nineteen Ninety One crown heights right\n\nSame Farrah Khan by the way who when Jesse Jackson refer to Jews is Jaime in New York is Jaime town\nAnd it was written about by a Washington Post reported named ... who happened to be black\n... called Coleman for trader suggested she should be killed so Obama's pastor is a good friend with a man Farrah Khan who suggested that a reporter should be killed for reporting\nObama has a photograph that was apparently taken two thousand five two thousand six\nHim in a smiling Farrah Khan Alan Dershowitz a lifelong member of the Democratic party says Haiti it seemed that photograph before the election he would not have voted for Obama and now Obama is lecturing us about anti Semitism\nThe rational black caucus and many of the members have close relationship with Farrah Khan and they haven't announced their relationship and aside from Jake Tapper I don't recall anybody on the mainstream media and I said scream not stream it may scream media even caring about the issue\nHow is it there were denouncing anti Semitism but many members of personal black caucus have a good relationship with Farrah Khan Obama took a picture with him smiling photograph within which didn't surface

appreciate it\nLarry ... is always a pleasure to be on with the great the age of south central\nLa thank you I Want to talk to you first about the caravan then I Want to talk to you about President Trump's assertion that he can change the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment which has been interpreted to allow an illegal alien to come to this country have a child on American soil and that child on memory becomes an American citizen but first is talking about the care of them\nTell me what legal authority he has to put troops on the border\nAbout being a true stopping an invasion of the United states has one of the primary reason we have troops\nAre dating back to the civil war there's a federal law called the ... the comet hot attack that says the U.S military can be used in the interior of the United states for regular police activity but that's not what President Trump is proposing to do is proposing to put them on the border to stop folks from illegally invading our country\n[noise] professor how come previous presidents haven't done this I mean this this so called invasion as you put it has happened year after year after year not quite as large but why haven't other presidents on this\nAbout because they don't like our immigration laws and they're not willing to enforce them and they don't they don't think about the consequences of what this lawlessness is doing to our society\nLet's talk about consequences professor what happens if somebody gets shot\nWell that's a terrible thing and you know uh uh I'm hoping that that doesn't happen that's clearly what the laughter is funding this caravan is hoping\nWill happen or even better in their view would be that it were a child so we can get the nightly news running constantly and tell them between now and election day but the fact of the matter is these people are putting themselves and their children in harm's way abide violating the laws of this country\nOr they claim that they are refugees and we have an international law obligation to consider their claims for asylum but as far as I've been able to tell not one of them is making claims that actually fit the definition the legal definition of refugee they're not fleeing their countries because they are being persecuted because of their political or religious\nOr race or ethnic view\nThey're fleeing their country because they want to go to a place that has a better economy that's not one of the ground for refugee status\nWhy hasn't Mexico stop them even after Donald Trump has told them to even after Donald Trump has said he's going to withhold aid from one of them all in Honduras my resume I have some sort of economic punishment to Mexico Hochul Mexico hasn't stopped them\nWell in the same international law that were require us to consider their claims for asylum required Mexico they consider their claims for asylum as well or an ethical should be stopping them because that was the first country that they entered into really early to make these refugee claim\nUm but but some of them have and I think Mexico with private processing knows but some of the we don't want to stop and\nMexico we want to get all the way the United states with your guest further proof that this was an concern about perfect the ocean in their home countries if they want a different economy to live and and that's not a ground for refugee status\n[noise] what would happen professor if we're allowed fourteen or seven thousand so called migrants took to transport themselves to our country to go all the way up to Canada\nAbout candidate would stop 'em as well same reason that you know there there are legal processes in place here and countries have the ability to define a you know what their immigration and naturalization policies are\nIf if you don't allow that in their ... you have no such thing as a nation you have no such thing as sovereignty President Trump is absolutely correct on that Without Borders you have no nation\nExplained the grounds for which people can apply for asylum\nWell you've got to have a credible claim that you are being persecuted or under threat of persecution based on your political views your religion or your um your race\nYour ethnic background those sorts of things just being poor and wanting a better life has a lot of ground for refugee status for asylum under international law and certainly not under any other law the United states\nThe president a professor has said that there may be some bad guys there including maybe people from ISIS or even al ... is there any basis to believe that\nWell we we've seen some reports of that I I'm not privy to the intelligence but it wouldn't surprise me what that border porous and if you're stopping people at the port of entry on the east coast in New York or what have you and vetting them properly\nUh than than folks that are aiming to come here to the United states to do with terrorist harm\nWhich would be more court entry and that Mexican border is right now the poorer than tree so it wouldn't surprise me to find\nA significant number of potential terrorists in this group\nMy guess is professor John ... Chapman University school of law professor what about funding you mentioned that this Margaret a caravan of being funded by the last what do you mean\nAbout you know it may take a lot of money to transport seven thousand people to feed them every day uh you know over the span of faith that they've gone and it's ... I Want to know\nWho's funding it and if they were felt poor in their country that they couldn't you know you gotta living who's paying for them to eat on the ... along the way somebody must be doing it and quite frankly it promotes likely\nYeah you you just kind of go to the explanation that makes ... that it's most likely somebody that is trying to interfere with the U.S election by setting up a confrontation that then to meet new media can turn a contrary to President Trump and his supporters\nLet's turn to the fourteenth amendment here's what President Trump said\nOnly immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without tensions ... have you thought about that is telling all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member\nOn and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that human emotions well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us history they just and it has to end have you talked about that with the council young where in the process in the process it will happen\nWhen an executive order that's what you're talking about but I was thinking about I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I said I was the only one China's guess couldn't get\nSense that you shouldn't do this with an executive order\nWill either leave because let's let's see if you're a first principles the president cannot amend the constitution by an executive order\nCongress can amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling in a cave\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nIt's anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction mean\nAnd it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete them at all in the lead into the country being part of the body politic and that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that is what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear\nAnd the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nWe now felt so that would mean that the children of citizens\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment but the children of temporary visit or whether it's a tourist visa or student either\n... or or or certainly the children of people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and the president is trying to faithfully apply that clause that it was drafted in ratified in an ad that meant that the people that path\nThat forty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do they called ... that do and it's the ridiculous case that said that states have to provide\nFree education to the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause and excited a footnote that says what they're they're they're awful citizens if they're born here so that was not a holding as\nThey say it was hot it is in that case it was just what we call ... ... is that the Supreme Court just the back of the had added something\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's ... there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about this and they're looking for government to to put in place policies\nThat will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got to fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how do you know the cost of regulation is what'd you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking the exhilaration the benefits of these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection and it's supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market [noise] when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers um let's take California's\nLatest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required to have solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home a by about thirty thousand dollars [noise]\nAll for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to kick solar power offer hand around around noon in one PM [noise] um that type of regulation feeds into [noise]\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun to be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so\nThe residential housing market in California is not a place regulations really benefiting the consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor ... teaches economics in speech he co wrote his call California
