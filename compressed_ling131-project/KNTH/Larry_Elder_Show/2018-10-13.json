have won the day John and I know coach will probably tell them we had we should have to sit in her church it out and that was overturned by James he's the head of the less they did get one today so that's for two weeks as you think some of the harm you\nPut in and starting to come back here this is this is probably not the biggest issues of the game but it's got it's a huge one because you're the fourth quarter\nFull thirty five to go you T concede momentum going back to school or with any type of points so a so called snow here you have to be thinking\nHey look you know we've got we've done pretty well getting personal boost shell but they're going to probably run the bow early spring this fourth quarter\nAnd try to try to hit a deep so\nLet's see what the caller but I I wouldn't be

tackle\nOut across the twenty five twenty seven\nIs going to be close to a first down maybe just a little bit short\nIt is the most or if they're if they're down in one\nThey had them in you know they'd be one of the quarterback power he is if they do the same shape the Rio third\nLess than a yard bought the twenty seven of Texas twenty six and a half as where it's spotty\nBegan watching\nDid get much but he didn't need much you might be enough for a first down\nLike a yard gain their bravery on Roy gets up off the bottom of that pile for the\nBears the baby was doing a decent job usually like\nCat and mouse game backed out of it you may rentals on ... what you want to run that is to\nRun that it's going to call that it caused a long way to read about it or break\nNumber forty\nFive you're apparently\nMan just back as the pool back he's got a struggle to think of a couple of big hits and I think he's you know I'm not a lot to do anything wrong with it but you don't think they'll be get sometimes you just off kilter called points in there and that's going to push it UT back person Fifteen and of course Herman the corps\nHas any desire to be without a starting quarterback of the game\nSo back him up first down Fifteen from the twenty two for the long horn sand out to watch it again right side nothing doing their\nCapital yards maybe to the twenty four\nSo tough sledding there the running by Trey watch than\nIt is either that's Ira is our Lewis good a great job inside James which inside these won't within like DJ confidently agent James Lock on overhead you will\nJames Lock card in there for the bears that left defensive and spot\nSecond down at Thirteen for taxes from the twenty four [noise]\nWho shell to throw their side college out\nHere that lead Texas three yards short but just on that covers you know James has just give it up as you just seems like on that\nYou give it up too much of a second down at fourteen gave up a nice easy seven eight yard route to\nCall in generally he can run by God you've got to push a little bit to try to get away from you and ask her down and for those\nDown for Texas thirty three short paths clear society is caught by Johnson the gang tackled by Baylor this sort of planned on forward progress it's going to be really really close\nEnough oh they got it out for a first down and that's and that's how big is different from a cat and mouse game when\nYou just said to the second and third team they're not throw the ball way down the field they don't try to get the big body so if you give them a seven eight yard route like ... like they do like ... on that process that for the down the series of one right there\nFirst down Texas nine twenty and counting fourth quarter\nA flag is down it's going to be a good way of game against the bears a\nYear and that's not a good one because going that way your money to the when you\nKick the ball well the last time he kicked it that way but I just don't want to

they're\nGay let's boots this went away wow beautiful pine high point\nJones takes a fair cash at the seven gene yard line\nSo Texas has the ball back with four forty six to play\nBaylor defense got

recreation post game play your interview like actually the second leading tackle or for the bears today he had ten lasted only by a clay John students Thirteen was on the day so one tackle for lost by Blake Lynch priests and a Rick uh are you\nWith us you back some here aren't Rick's there and you're right in the middle of the Baylor locker room I'm guessing a that's a good sign these guys aren't there is no moral victories these guys are pleased with coming here and play in close uh sounds like a really quiet are disappointed locker room\nIt is and I we were just more uh I think there is a Portland and the fact that they couldn't get it down there and ... and when the ball game I don't think there was any satisfaction at all with Brian where or plainclothes are playing the number nine team in the country\nA touchdown I think it would just more of the fast food disappoint right\nThat's a good sign\nI let us know if you get somebody else say we've got the final stacks looks a share those with everybody Jay Jay\nEverybody had Seventy four plays for three hundred twenty eight yards a well below their average going against problem with the best deep as they face\nTexas Rand eighty place for three hundred and eighty nine yards on the afternoon Baylor had two forty through their only eighty eight rushing yards on the ground Charlie have Thirteen cared for twenty two yards of course there was a Saxon there\nThe next twenty two it's unloaded five years twenty three yards under Twenty one your column I trusted\nRead at sixteen as well as your microwave sixteen yard so\nReally struggle to get things going on the ground and they probably at this rate of that because of the way Texas a place up front there really\nPhysical really strong ah do their Charlie\nWell below us completion presented twenty\nOr thirty nine yet the interception there are at the at the end of the first half one touched down as well to a man with two in forty yards he was sacked three times her was fifty percent Texas ...\nBetter at twenty seven minutes and forty two seconds composition Texas thirty two medicine Eighteen boating turned up all over what a shame we turn the ball on the interception\nOf there about a billion dollars Raleigh too hot up Gabriel an opportunity he was twenty or thirty four four hundred eighty four yards at a score same shell the sec want Salinger finish the game four or five thirty five yards\n... he was probably the difference because he came in on the ground with Texas really what do you win his will on the ground he you broke ... thirty are run there but he finished with a hundred and ten yards on Nineteen carry on a tray Watson who had a ... forty one on Thirteen carries\nA of course in ... was brought up the detailed and there was more when you're already a but we'll go ahead and go to the next interview John Will finish a separate interview\nI put a bookmark there will come back to it let's go back down to the Baylor locker room visit with Blake black mark our department of health human performance and recreation post game player interview\nLeaders department of H H PR building future leaders with a passion for health and wellness and Blake ... to visit thanks very much a tough game you or you've been through a now for ... against taxes but a what a drive there at the end to put yourself in position to pull off a big boy in\nYeah it was a there was a you know as an intense game and that was no position we knew we were going to be and all we are nearing the end of the game for court or we're going to be in a position to win and the next time we just need to finish better punch in [noise]\nWhat was the what was the mindset what was the thought process when you have had to start at your own three yard line of drive\nA to that right the right if I go down the field for the to win the game or a third of the other uh doesn't matter\nIf we started at the forty or at the for a you know it's a mentality of what's what's next you know and we're just focus on you know ... for next play as we're we're going to have to do to move the ball\nTough sledding or running the ball today\nWasn't it yeah yeah they had a good skiing drawing of a we had some\nSuccess early and ah so good to get down there with our big packaging movable a little bit but we definitely need to do better in or out of a just kind of our base from plays and get some more move 'cause run the ball opens up ...\nAs you could see last weekend Kansas to you know make a good thing happens so\nThat's a that's our focus right now is often so we well Blake talked a little bit about\nThat with the duty do differently because you guys did move already on the ground some base packages they didn't really slow down there that second\nI yeah I mean there are bringing in some different a line plants and stuff like that none\nNone too crazy but it's just you know one more thing you have to do before you can\nYou know you get to the second level gets alarm backers and we had a lot or appealed to the uh tags all for the most uh blond movements so it was a you know and we haven't seen before we just need to do better picking a little faster moving vertically\nAnd would you say like I mean I mean through the through the first six seven games was this the type of deep is probably one of the best ones are the best one you guys are the face of the season\nUh yeah it was a good defense um at the end they comes down to a you know it's all it's about us you know we should have\nWe should have made more players we should've walked to the better of front and moved to move the ball\nThat's on us you know it's it's nothing but it's not rocket science what they did you know we just have to stop it better\nAnd like my last two years as one of the veterans that you've seen a lot here you know just where do you think this team is as far as you know getting back to where you know just to get to where do you think it will\nYou know right now we've got a lot of guys that are currently starting to open their eyes and see where we could be and\nNow it's about getting from that you know having flashes of good stuff happen and are making that happen day in day out every play and making it happen much more consistently 'cause you know we're [noise] we're in there and every day of the week we're grinding were portion of\nIt's all about you know we're not doing anything other teams are than where in the in the game with position to win and are we just need to kind of get over get over that home take the next step and start choking teams at the end of the game and when the game [noise]\nLike ... to visit thank you very much for alright Blake black mar with a senior officers who've lineman for the bears following the twenty three Seventeen lost by the bears to the longhorns today here in Austin Janey other uh stats will pass along\nYou know read job we talked earlier about the penalties are you know the village ended up eating out better had ten for Ninety two I said even it out\nThat the eight for fifty two and when you play on the top notch team thing I thought that a a better probably could have clean that but most of that was in the first half but the but overall John it was it was a very evenly play games you missed a couple of field goals\nThat was good to see caught him wanting to come back you build a a long way to think that was about a forty seven forty eight yard or\nAre there and the first half of that he ... through a thought it was good to see him he didn't have any problems on a on extra points\nForty six year old or for the call tomorrow and so it's good to see that in the overall effect this team is hitting the right direction I and I said a couple of times that I really thought that they do you gain it didn't seem like it I thought it did something for him and I believe we're starting to see that next phase happens to this day\nOver the bears here today you heard it

Seventy FM Houston\nTo go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and then the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to ... ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life the drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one

five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up in Houston ... and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said it earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you could reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\nThat what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of each of these examples for our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were come after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked June or your training before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great uh after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are\nPretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another give away yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here oh right right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really reached that financial", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "13"}
