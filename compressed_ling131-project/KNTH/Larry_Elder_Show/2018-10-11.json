them\nUneducated you can call him a not terribly literate call them what you want at least he gets the big\nPicture he also understand that there's a connection\nBetween the welfare state and the demise of the family my friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the black family after slavery a black kid\nWas more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof with his biological mother and biological father them\nToday and after slavery because for years it was illegal for slaves to marry there was a huge uptick in Mary\nAnd if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely\nTo be brought into the world\nWhere they biological mother and a biological dad under the same roof than a white kid\nMore likely and then along comes the welfare state and dependency and the LA Times\nAsked both poor people in non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they asked the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again or in twenty sixteen\n[noise] do you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet\nAnd they asked poor people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that he gave you a stepping stone or to get on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare which harmful\nAs so that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at that's a topic worthy of discussion is many poor people think that welfare is bad or ethnic it's good and about eight percent or so have no idea that don't have an opinion one way or the other\nThat is a boatload of people on welfare who believe that it's created dependency and that's what Kanye West was talking about you don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left because you have to look into the mirror and say oh my goodness what have I done to destabilize families to change values to change incentives\nMy dad used to many people are

Eighteen negro\n\nDemeaning term and he knows it but most people watching the program probably aren't aware of it that's how are you able to get away with the the the only group that you can beat up malign attacked insult more than white males\nWhite a white Republicans or black Republicans\nNow what's the line we hear over and over and over again I watch a lot of MSNB hee haw so that you guys don't have to watch a lot of CNN to that you guys don't have to\nAnd I will tell you they're driving theme is Donald Trump got elected by appealing to white races Donald Trump got elected by appealing to white racist what advantage I won't say\nWhite glass [laughter]\nThat is a constant theme present Trump's of racist\nFurther trumps of racial because he said Maxine Waters have low IQ never mind he said the same thing about Robert De Niro over the last time I looked it's not black but\nThat's relevant print from the racist\nPresident Trump question whether or not Obama was from Hawaii therefore he's a racist never mind Hillary's first one who started this oh yeah it's always campaign did\nShe's the one who started the birther movement and somehow her hands are completely clean fingerprints left anywhere nevermind her top instrument Sidney Blumenthal went to the McClatchy Newspapers\nDid an editor went public and said yeah he came to me and he told me that Obama is from Africa and we put a report on to track down the rumor turned out it wasn't true but it but a Sunni Blumenthal absolutely ... said that to us he is from Africa\nSo here we started it\nAnd no one calls her a bigot because of it but Donald Trump because he picked it up is now did the ... over and over and over again isn't it\n\nThat President Obama stirred up the racist based in the in the heart of American mostly American white males I guess and that's why Donald Trump got elected\nNever mind seven hundred counties they voted for bronco bombing two thousand eight in two thousand twelve of the seven hundred counties never mind that two hundred switch to Donald Trump did they become racist\nDuring the years when a President Trump was in office and then they realize they were or are there racism go into recession my cancer I mean what what what what are you talking about\nI'm white or that couldn't be my problem\nThe city over one hundred that most voted for Donald Trump was apple lean eighty percent voted for President Trump\nGas which city just elected its first black mayor happily now explained to me how is it that Donald Trump got put into office by all these white racist who didn't turn around and voted for black guy\nTo be mayor of the city because the point is that white people are nervous about a country that's becoming increasingly our country of color and therefore they're panicking they want somebody in there to stop this when they want a Nazi in their right\nListen to what Chris Matthews who frequently makes the same argument I just not a deal has conceded she doesn't realize what he said listen to this\nBut I Do understand President Trump to it as much as any of us\nTalking about why it is that President Trump invited Kanye West into the oval office\nBut I Do understand President Trump to it as much as any of us do he always shoot Simone he does that say it does the thing and they get in a contest of ideas in politics\nThan the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is it's got some sort of bizarre politics that are fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the idea that he's a racist it runs against the either Trump does like minorities that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you will and politics\nAnd it sort of a racial way and areas flipping the computers in people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for most of them that they think they're racist\nMost white people won't vote for a guy\nIf they think he's a racist ... why

yourself that got hit by a white people will vote for a black person in the\nBeginning I I that's the opposite of what you guys have been saying\nBut I Do understand President Trump to it as much as any of us do he always shoot Simone\nHe'd do is to say it does have thing and the getting a contest of ideas in politics\nThan the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is it's got some sort of bizarre politics that does fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the idea that he's a racist it runs against the either in terms of like minorities that he's going after her Rona going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you will and politics\nAnd it sort of a racial way in areas flipping it can be used in people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist show of his show you're not in some plaintiffs cartoonish way you get some off the hook you know what I'm saying\n\nWhite people comment at least most of them comma won't vote for somebody if they\nThink he's a racist is this a game show\nI'm Chris doesn't that shoot a hole in your theory that the reason President Trump got elected is because white racist rose up\nI might have any role in the short Georgia city or dosing Iraq\nNever mind that Trump got a smaller percentage of the white vote bend in Mitt Romney\nNever mind that Trump got a higher percentage of the black vote then did Mitt Romney higher percentage of the Asian vote then did Mitt Romney represented to the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney\n... over at CNN and MSNBC or eat hall has been through the last two years this is a country whose racism has been awakened by a racist name President Trump and now you're conceding Chris Matthews\nThat white people won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist\nOr are you saying most white people are are are are are are are not racist\nThank you Larry does that include why
