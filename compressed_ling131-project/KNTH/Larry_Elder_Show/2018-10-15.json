Brunson\nReleased from Turkish prison you know\nWe've been praying for him for a long time either graduate of wheat and college back in the nineties I think it was how he's been he's been a pastor over there and um\n\nAnd in Turkey doesn't get a turkey which is on the coast for many years ago there were charges against him they were trumped up charges a totally totally false and finally he has prevailed after thirty seven months\nIn prison it and then I go to ... ... yeah\nYeah ... ... and a lot of ways I mean and in fact he he was at the White House yesterday I think it was a praying for praying with President Trump um [noise] but you know we were super super ... super excited 'cause we've been praying for him for a long time and\nThere's been a lot of I guess a diplomatic kinds of terms in order to try and get him out of prison\nDavid you you know the inside scoop did they are these charges up just put the fear of God into all the other Christians Christians in the community or not I don't know I Would\n... I don't think so uh uh there was a there was a I mean he he was there under terrorism charges and having affiliates with the Google end movement\nWhich is a Turkish movement of soup the loop but over there that the president claimed was behind the twenty sixteen coup that was no evidence that all that that's the case\nThe rebels and like the guy we interviewed a long time ago\nYeah yeah yeah yeah we we've had ... supporters and members of his movement ... all the radio with us on a number of occasions Mohammed ... US law go on and others eating\nA ... and and they uh turkey has become a very different kind of place I'm really pleased about this this is a kind of a change I don't know that it has anything to do but it's possible with uh the supposedly murder of this Washington Post\nOn Saudi Arabia and Washington Post ... a a journalist or this past week and turkey in America are sort of work in tandem\nTrying to figure out what happened to this to this journalist may have something to do that but I really think they were trumped up charges and the people who would step forward earlier\nThan to make claims against him as a state where they were mistaken for that uh you know their memory was faulty or they abetting from Asia and those kinds of things actually this chart charging weren't totally dropped\nThe court the court ah decided that the time he had spent in captivity\nThirty seven right there in ... for the charges ride served but\nThey still found them guilty because they\nCouldn't just given back to him the sensation sure so see we're right he's guilty beyond\nBy right\nA lot of people are pleased I'm just excited he you know he was claiming at the very end in trial courts island and let's see human being and then they sort of tabs off by saying I Love Jesus and I love turkey\nThose are direct quotes from his testimony there at the trial\nRoller do grueling and some of these other people's political reasons give arrested in just doesn't lead me to want to go travel not their ...\nOh I'm pretty much everywhere when you know just fail you other places in the United states are still want to see a\nMother's plenty to see the good old us of age or not we have this program here we college co waiting in the holy lands policemen three weeks\nIn Israel and they spent two weeks in Turkey and used to be turkey to Greece and then a week or oh it's great trip six weeks\nBut we have the last few years because of all of the\nOf the problem there waves always sort of suspended the turkey park you are and so they they spent two weeks in Greece and they all of ... and some of the Greek isles it's a great great you know a lot of early Christianity takes place\nIn Greece ... uh the founding churches letters in St Paul in such a lot of stuff happened to the early on so it's ... it's a very important place for us\nYou know okay but you're traveling in Turkey I don't know that I Would go right now because of what's going on there and wouldn't\nYeah uh yeah ... de la ...\n... ... he looked at me like I was from ... absolutely no idea what I was talking about the junk just completely went over his head and every every one of the rabbi was looking at me like I Can't believe you just do that [laughter]\nUm I generally don't hear my better day I Can't believe you did it either but I Will tell you\nOne of the scariest things I ever saw was I was sitting in a Barnes and noble and just you know reading a book or something killing some time and this woman comes out curing sixteen copies\nOf ah the damn brown yeah the da Vinci code\nAnd I looked at her I was sitting in a chair and I said man you must really liked that book she's ... oh it changed my life and I'm giving it to every high school graduate I Know this year\nWhile I thought\nOh good did you say she met him have you ever heard the word a historical fiction [laughter]\nNo it has made it if\nIt's not even historical no one really isn't because because historical fiction is based upon real events right and tries to fill in that drew hot sweaty dialogue that kind of thing it's it's a complete work of fiction you know it's like everything about that is what we used to say that Jesus had a wife\nThe fact that he had shoulder and that he had a you know that the idea\nThat that's why you rise fiction section trials right exactly you guys don't know I'm just ... [laughter] you know obviously you do now but I'm the junkie\nRight okay so anyway yeah\nI uh speaking of things are Jewish and I think he you open the fate you open it up on political on it you know we've talked about\nThe possibility of of us visiting together you have a viable yes ah the one and it's almost a year old I think it's coming up on this year anniversary pretty safe and uh\nEverybody sort of knows that it's been founded by the Graham family this billionaire family\nFrom the mid west that started the Hobby Lobby and people love Hobby Lobby they buy Hobby Lobby stuff everything\nShall I didn't I didn't know it was odd yeah yeah yeah the great that's\nWhere the green family my as my their their their money right they probably have other business interests as well\nBut there's been a persistent criticism of the the the museum of the Bible say two Protestant and and clearly has this kind of evangelical church but they have they gone what's I found interesting they've gone\nA to a kind of change out of the leadership structure and two months ago they quietly hired a director of exhibits who is a Jewish woman ... that\nThey recruited away from the U.S Holocaust Memorial Museum okay she was she was in charge of the traveling exhibits\nAnd so they hired her to be kind of one of their main strategic thinkers in planters and all of that kind of thing so what they're trying to do is they're trying to have more um you know they're moving toward a more inclusive view of the Bible [noise] um\nAnd it's it may have all kinds of ... I haven't seen it yet I have prince him saying they say it's just really lazy\nBut I'm a ... it I thought it was interesting that they had hired a longer strategic planners Jewish woman clearly Jewish or not a Jewish Christian you know as we talked about before but really Jewish\nAnd she's going to become one of the the key kind of leaders and\nThinkers about are you aware of that Stewart and all you know about that and\nNot at all and I must tell you I didn't know that was Hobby Lobby and I do this or the family agreement as amusing to me I Know that was Hobby Lobby\nYeah\nYeah that that's it that's who it was so there'd been a lot of assumptions about the library um but they're you know they're open to everybody and and and such it [laughter] they have I think less of an agenda\nThen people will have to have complained about they have a lot of Jewish advisors were part of it are including large shift in\nWho's out it was a very famous professor right Hebrew and she liked studies at New York university um ... ... this is a quote from him I thought was really interesting that'd be advisors she says are constantly coming up with better ways to do things\nAnd the point he's making if this is a healthy kind of discussion that people have to have about ... museum\nUh in in ... so he he looked at is a very positive kind of thing that he's a he's a Jewish scholar hey thanks it's really important for us to have those kind of conversations and things going on\nNow like your podcast\nYeah yeah like early is going to be so hard to come very edge I Know you've got to go to break right\nUh but I but I Will say so you can't retort is we're going to go to rich because I'm so funny uh I'm sure all the ah older Jewish goes wherever they're going to be nice liberals so this is Sean\nSaid some movie right now there are number of orthodox Stewart said oh there was such a broad brush\nOh why not that's the fun part just to see Iraq All right we'll be right back\nWould you like to get some great ideas about restaurants festivals concerts live theater special dance museums spores and other things to see and do the Houston area and it's interesting travel destinations howdy this jak chambers inviting you to tune into my weekly radio show Houston and beyond\nMy gas and I also talking about topics like health and wellness real estate business seniors and even pass\nHouston and be on airs live on Sunday afternoons from four to six PM [laughter] right here on AM ten Seventy the answer you could also listen to the live shows and the recordings of previous conditions of my shell on my website Houston and beyond dot com [noise] Houston and beyond his brought to mind great sponsors including\nApartment world mess hearing aids illusions bill rap real estate he's the medical testing services Jake sports mark the shell Brian estate improvement attorney red wing ... which was air heating and air conditioning Scott Hi many\nOkay Leanne just soccer practice for my hand sex Katie has softball\nWeight in Turkey today or tomorrow I hear\nYou aren't always thinking about us but we're always thinking about you and all true we're creating more weight you battering from a new hospital to expect when you need that you'll have more than you are lying\nFocused on you look at some future all true\nInstead of going to go [noise] oh [noise] guy got fifty minutes good safety fifty percent or more on motorcycle insurance ... brand new day messages and inspire hope and life in space of transformation and safety\nSo you to go and you're saying Hi this is the key to from the ban ever and if this sounds like something you think he's a Christian radio dot com mission radio dot com is a place where you can find so when it seems there isn't on now with all your favorite media stations can go with you wherever you go\nOnline media was downloading free mobile apps today Christian radio down\nYou go to the worst in the morning you have plenty\nOf choices however only one morning show an informant entertain you at the same time teach this Sam Malone show we take issue seriously and trying to smile on your face to alone with Jay ...

responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast theories your host farmed American radio bar\nWalls or\nThe monster broadcast this week\nOn the road remote you know I Love getting out on the road and here I find myself in my favorite place on earth the value of this on Phoenix, Arizona you know I've been loving coming out here for a number of years so why am I here the Arizona citizens defense league meeting and like I Love this this is a this group is home to me this is family to me\nI Am a lifetime member ended is always an honor to be here thank goodness it's in Phoenix again this year but as an Arizona citizens defense league member and a big fan of the organization\nWhenever I have the opportunity to come out to speak and they're kind enough to ask me to speak again this year I'm going to jump on it it gets me an opportunity to come back to what I consider to be home that being\nPhoenix because it's just in my blood\nSo as I'm setting up here today it looks like I'm at a table where everybody's got their name cards out and everybody thinks I'm working here and having to I'm trying to have to explain to everybody that I'm not working here and because I'm not working here I really can't help people with their name cards so if you hear us get interrupted on that and I have to break away for just a second we're just trying to be\nReally friendly to the best that we can so here we are at the Sheraton crushing in Phoenix, Arizona for armed American radios monster broadcast\nThe week of ten fourteen let's get started as I'm sitting here setting up and then a man into an individual walked up to me and did basically the same thing I was just telling you about asked me a question about the cards that was done enough to computer and the the portable remote studio and I shook his paw and he introduced himself to me as\nA combat Vietnam veteran but your your name first mark\nDo maestro marked on my show mark let me you introduce yourself as a combat veteran ladies and gentlemen the reason I Want to talk with you a little bit about this and I've asked mark ... we've not met before have we know what you are Arizona citizens defensively if that makes us brothers and I'm a life member and you say you've been a member now for about two and a half years\nFirst off let's go with a combat veteran you began telling your story fascinating I asked you to sit down and I appreciate it if you tell listeners stormed American radio on two hundred plus radio stations around the country right now your story how'd you get here to ...\nI served in Vietnam for the United States Navy\nReverse supply bowed out of a deep water port of Da Nang\nOur mission was to bring supplies to the troops in way than dog on a perfume and probably a reverse [noise]\nGoing up and down those rivers getting shot at it with shrapnel\nFiring our weapons throwing grenades\nWe needed to do that because the troops needed their supplies and you could not send the soldier out the army and Marine Corps out without their supplies and we were carrying supplies from the deep water port up to nine\nHours in way during the Tet Offensive I lost three guys from my riverboat and they were good guys they'll and Larry were Twenty one and Mike was Twenty years old how old were you mark I was twenty young kid I'm fifty years now I just got back fifty years ago I just got back from Vietnam\nBut I'll tell you I Know what you mean by that but I Want you to explain that\nMy guys didn't die in vain\nOur children our grandchildren freedom and liberty are worth dying for\nConcept here in America we're losing it\nHow many outlets get deep here for just a second us okay we've never met so I'm going to do anything you want me asking you questions at that you know if I'm if you're uncomfortable let me know but I don't think he will be no that's why you're sitting here ... you made a comment\nAcross the table right before I ask you to come on that made me say hey man get over here and how would you joined me for segment\nAnd that was the comment that you made was they won't let you tell your story in schools right today this is a very dangerous time in America today I think you'll agree with me we're watching very harsh rhetoric come at us from the left threatening violence from what are\nWidely regarded as Democrat leaders we've heard him from Hillary Clinton she can't be civil with us\nWe've heard it from Eric Holder no I don't consider Eric Holder leader of the Democrat Party I consider him a loud mouth opportunists who will do and say whatever he has to do to stay in front of a camera because he apparently has political aspirations but he says when we go low\nThey're supposed to kick us you've got a story to tell\nBut my ... different ... explain that\nGot chooses the color of our skin and guts uses it for a man or woman and God chooses our parents or brothers or sisters and God chooses the nation we are born and and I don't judge judge choices that makes no sense to me\nAnd it takes the race card right off the table well they don't the liberals don't want to hear that sentence that just simple sense well they don't want to hear that sentence because it wakes up part of their agenda takes got out of the equation it takes\nA the race card off the table that takes a whole lot of things\nTry and teach the kids just look at God's work just look at their work how perfect the world is and look where we are yeah come amazing\nBook how beautiful displays yes this is the most beautiful places in America and there's more loving world and there is hey\nWould you would never know that if you were just watching TV or if you were turning on the quote unquote news or if your head was buried in the quote unquote media and I've been teaching people for years to try to get their head out of this garbage and go out and live their lives and look around where they are and see what they see\nBecause guess what happens when you do that\nAll of a sudden you find out more people think like me and I'm told all day long it's not as bad as being told all day long I really am mainstream isn't that right\nThat's what you need to understand [noise]\nYour purpose in your place in the world\nAnd if you can't see God's work who who will look at yours\nWell we'll look at your work nothing happens in this world by itself you know the political left will never push us that way they're trying to terrorists now they're trying to keep us from\nBecause they want to destroy freedom in America why because socialism is their goal\nOf socialism has been part of their agenda they've been quiet about it there's just been building for decades\nJust but here's the lesson from Vietnam that they don't speak about\nThe great lesson from Vietnam was\nThe communists were supplying the north Vietnamese with a everything they could to defeat us and they realized they couldn't beat America through our military\nCouldn't do it but they saw the weakness at home\nWe elected bimbos ...\nAs our leaders\nAnd they were the ones that lost that war wasn't our economy so it was so happens is now here's of\nThe concept the communists learned that they need they could destroy America from within by supporting these idiots propaganda that we elect\nAll right now let me let me stop you for a second because you're going deep I could keep you for three hours but we have other believe me I I really could I Do it's an honor to sit here and talk with you but as a propaganda that we're talking about is what you're talking about they can beat us from within and they did it during the Vietnam War you know that first year doing if they're now that's where I Want to go with you know you're seeing that regenerate aren't you\nBecause the God the United states has a covenant with God that people don't speak about and the covenant is we're supposed to be the greatest nation economically militarily and spiritually\nThat our enemies would cower in our shadow in the world would be a safer place well thank God for Donald Trump he's making us stronger\n... you're not you know you watch Ninety two percent negative coverage and in today's day and age what again with how do I get to see how how do we get to\nAnd my job I Believe my mission was to get to those many high schools as I couldn't speak to his many young people as I could to give them

Trump was not wrong about grant here is a pretty good university on Ulysses Grant here\nWas Eighteen sixty to America was in the depths of the civil war\nLooking back it's easy to believe that a union victory was inevitable\nThe north had more money more population more industry but no one thought that at the time\nIn the first year of the war it looked as if the south would win a series of high profile victories in the east convinced many that confederates were better fighters under better leaders where with President Lincoln signed a battlefield general who can do for the union what Robert ... was doing for the confederacy lead into victory\nThe man he found the man who save the union was delicious esque grant he wasn't Lincoln's first choice or second or third\nIn fact when the war started in Nineteen sixty one Lincoln had no idea who you listen to grant was hardly surprising since at the time grant was selling hatched farmers wives in a small town in Illinois\nHis rise to glory as one of the most amazing stories in American history born in Ohio on April twenty seven Eighteen twenty to grant had no ambition to be a soldier\nHis father pushed him into it thinking he wasn't suited for much else\nGrants West Point career wasn't especially distinguished either but during the Mexican American War Eighteen forty six to Eighteen forty eight grant proved himself to be an officer of an unusual ability he was cool under fire daring but rarely reckless even more important than men under his command trusted him\nAfter that war grant returned to St Louis to marry his fiance Julie a dent the daughter of a slave owning Missouri farmer grant was never happier than when he was with Julia and he was never been happier than when he was not unfortunately in this period

drinking got the better of him he\nResigned his army condition to avoiding embarrassing court martial it was downhill from there one business venture failing after another by Eighteen sixty thoroughly humiliated and with no money and no prospects he was back working for his father in a small town of Galena, Illinois\nThen the civil war happened the union was in desperate need of experienced soldiers grant volunteered his leadership skills were immediately obvious he quickly advanced through the ranks\nIn a little more than six months he scored two major victories at Fort Henry in Fort Donaldson along the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers he followed these up with victory in the largest battle in American history up to that time the battle of Shiloh making him a true union hero in a cause that was starved for heroes [noise]\nThere was nothing flashy about grants general ship all he did was when unlike the overly cautious generals that drove President Lincoln to distraction grant battle plan was to always move forward always put pressure on his foes any advantage to union hat and technology are manpower he employed to the fullest\nLike Napoleon ... was a superb breeder of maps he could identify the enemies vulnerabilities and exploit them as he did in his brilliant Eighteen sixty three campaign for Vicksburg a campaign that is still studied at war colleges\nIn March Eighteenth sixty four Lincoln made grant commander of all the union armies it took more than a year of the wars hardest fighting before least surrendered and the war finally came to an end\nBy this point the president and his general had developed a close bond shortly after ... return to Washington Lincoln invited the grants to join him and Mary Lincoln at Ford's Theatre\nGrant accepted Julia

looks\nAs if we did a preemptive strike by surrendering her security clearance as opposed to having get re vote Byron York as a conservative writer and a Fox News contributor\nOf a key issue of course a in her a secret email server was that uh she did send classified information\nUh over this unclassified basically an secured a system and there's really no doubt about that I suppose you could argue
