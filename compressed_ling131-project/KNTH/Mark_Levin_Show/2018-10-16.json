A. G. Tripoli mentioned in one to four three President Trump also was on sixty minutes at a number of things including that he did not make fun of Dr Christine for we're going to have that later on but first the president as you know in Ohio\nReferred to General Robert he we as a great general refer to Ulysses Grant and incredible that part was left out and NBC had an issue or a correction\n\nAnd Trump was not wrong about grant here as a trigger university on you must have this grant here was Eighteen\nSixty to America was in the depths of the civil war\nLooking back it's easy to believe that a union victory was inevitable the north had more money more population more industry but\nNo one thought that at the time in the first year of the war it looked as if the south would win a series of high profile victories in the east convinced many that confederates were better fighters under better leaders\nWhere with President Lincoln signed a battlefield general who could do for the union what Robert he was doing for the confederacy lead into victory\nThe man he found the man who save the union was delicious esque grant he wasn't Lincoln's first choice or second or third\nIn fact when the war started in Nineteen sixty one Lincoln had no idea who you listen to grant was hardly surprising since at the time grant was selling half to farmers wives in a small town in Illinois\nHis rise to glory as one of the most amazing stories in American history born in Ohio on April twenty seven Eighteen twenty to grant had no ambition to be a soldier\nHis father pushed him into it thinking he wasn't suited for much else\nGrants West Point career wasn't especially distinguished either but during the Mexican American War Eighteen forty six to Eighteen forty eight grant proved himself to be an officer of an unusual ability he was cool under fire daring but rarely reckless even more important than men under his command trusted him\nAfter that war grant returned to St Louis to marry his fiance Julia Dent the daughter of a slave owning Missouri farmer grant was never happier than when he was with Julia and he was never been happier than when he was not unfortunately in this period army life force them to be separated sometimes for many months\nTo assuage his loneliness grant started to drink while in a distant posting in northern California a thousand miles from Julia his drinking got the better of him he resigned his army condition to avoiding embarrassing court martial\nIt was downhill from there one business venture failing after another by Eighteen sixty thoroughly humiliated and with no money and no prospects he was back working for his father in a small town of Galena, Illinois\nThen the civil war happened the union was in desperate need of experienced soldiers grant volunteered his leadership skills were immediately obvious he quickly advanced through the ranks\nIn a little more than six months he scored two major victories at Fort Henry in Fort Donaldson along the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers he followed these up with victory in the largest battle in American history up to that time the battle of Shiloh making him a true union hero in a cause that was starved for heroes\n[noise] there was nothing flashy about grants general ship all he did was when I'm like the overly cautious generals that drove President Lincoln to distraction grant battle plan was to always move forward always put pressure on his foes any advantage to union had in technology or manpower he employed to the fullest\nLike Napoleon ... was a superb breeder of maps he could identify the enemies vulnerabilities and exploit them as he did in his brilliant Eighteen sixty three campaign for Vicksburg a campaign that is still studied at war colleges\nIn March Eighteenth sixty four Lincoln made grant commander of all the union army it took more than a year of the wars hardest fighting before least surrendered and the war finally came to an end\nBy this point the president and his general had developed a close bond shortly after ... return to Washington Lincoln invited the grants to join him and Mary Lincoln at Ford's Theatre\nGrant accepted Julia however had developed an intense dislike for Mary Lincoln and insisted that her husband get out of the commitment embarrassed grant did that night in that theater Lincoln was assassinated\n[noise] let

Monica Lewinsky wasn't adult\nAnd therefore it was not an abuse of power [noise] and Trump on sixty minutes\nSo he did not make fun of Dr Christine for all of that and more triple eight nine to one S. A. G. E. triple late nights every once in a two for three but first is this is the Warren\nSays she took a DNA test and according to the Boston Globe the DNA test found quote strong evidence close quote a warrant Native American ancestry going back to six to ten\nGenerations you have very very special people you are here long before any of us were here although we have the representative in Congress who they say it was a long time ago that caller Pocahontas but\nYou know what I like you because your special your special people you are really incredible people and I'll have to from the heart\nNow the Cherokee Nation have responded to report or the results of orange DNA test and what the Cherokee Nation said it was quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA testing not even distinguish where the person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA test can be used the term lineage such a fraternity to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any other tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong he makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses\nWhile also just honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and his heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continual claims of tribal heritage into quote\nHistorically whoever is president I don't know why this works but whoever is I guess people get complacent with just one of the President's Day that two years later we have an election so they come in place of and then we always win and the next one which is as you know the presidential election\nSo\nI see those ... days before my eyes\nWhile I was sleeping I Love the show\n[noise] [noise]\nOh God God [noise]\nI got more in their blood in me how God [noise]\nAccording to David Hearst sunny at the conservative federal is that the Boston Globe report was quote Luther ludicrously an skeptical\nAnd said that the percentage of Native American\nBlood in her is quote a far cry from any reasonable threshold to embrace minority status for job close quote but that's exactly what Warren did she applied for a job with Harvard and mentioned that she was Native American\nChipping in New York Times said\nQuote the average white person in America has nearly double the amount of American indian DNA as Warren there's little genetic data available for Native American and these tests merely rely on some guesswork\nBy referencing the DNA to people from South America to suggest warrants dubious ancestral claims had been vindicated is an assault on recent into full that's in New York Times\nDid you step across the aisle and and maybe a try to convince Senator Warren from Massachusetts to come in and be the ambassador to Tom gossip or someplace like that [noise]\nYou know she wouldn't be my first choice yeah there's there's been a very very poor senator she has which are away little legislation she has been you know the funny thing about Elizabeth Warren she's been a lousy center to see that terrible yeah because I'm In in a low of this president's yeah where she she's not necessarily every\nAiring Greg calling Pocahontas the regret that\nDo I do regret calling a folk artist because I think it's a tremendous insult the focal ... celebrating chose to focus on this I Would like to see if I so I don't see a lot of reaching across the aisle but who knows [laughter]\nMeanwhile Hillary Clinton has surrendered her security clearance\nAnd any of this all goes back of course of the state department's ongoing review the mishandling of classified information related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and it also kind of gives you an idea of how slow some things moving government because almost a year and a half\nAgo and the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the state department asking about the status of Hillary Clinton security clearance in that letter Grassley stated that any government workers who possibly engaged\nIn such serious offenses ... at the very minimum have their security clearances suspended\nPetting an investigation well three weeks ago the state department finally responded to Senator Grassley twenty Seventeen letter saying quoting here\nAt her record as former Secretary Clinton security clearance minister was drawn on August thirty is twenty eight teams letter went on to say\nThat on September twenty it's the security clearances of five other Clinton researchers had also been ... vote only Clinton name's Cheryl Mills was listed on the other foreign names were redacted of course at the time of the pro\nHillary Clinton was running for president and no charges were filed this summer President Trump revoked the security clearance a former CIA director John Brennan\nAnd at the time the White House said it was reviewing the clearances of several other people so about Seventeen months after Grassley sent a letter\nHe finally got a response from the state department\nSo it looks as if we did a preemptive strike by surrendering her security clearance as opposed to having good revoke Byron York as a conservative writer and a Fox News contributor\nOf a key issue of course a in her a secret email server was that she did send classified information\nUh over this unclassified basically an secured a system and there's really no doubt about that I suppose you could argue whether it was super important stuff or not but the the fact that it was classified\nShe did send it in a casual way over and an secured system seems pretty much beyond dispute now\nNow speaking of Hillary Clinton did bill abused his power because of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky the Internet there are people who look\nAt the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual\nRelationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made\nWow you see your husband was not investigated because he had an affair and the oval office was being investigated for whitewater\nAnd that came up during the investigation and he would not have been impeached not lie about it under oath\nAnd which he dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and it as I Believe came out in the right place\nAnd once again Hillary was not asked about the allegation may find that we had to write survivor named Juanita Broderick the two weeks after the alleged rape by Bill Clinton you Hillary Clinton verbally intimidated her that somehow never\nCame up he didn't do that to the men\nThe Kavanaugh hearing also turned attention back to the me too movement which complicates Clinton's place in women's history\nIn the Nineteen nineties she stood by her husband Bill Clinton as he denied allegations of sexual harassment\nAnd assault what role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct check out her answer what role did you play in orchestrating the nuts or slug strategy against bills conclusion accusers\nYou were accused of being the ringleader in a book by Barbara Olson called hell to pay you are accused of being a ringleader and a book by Christopher Hitchens call no one left ally to what role did you play doesn't listen to her answer\nNon numeral I kept unbelievable unbelievable we Hitler reclaiming on she said she was a ringleader but when the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no yeah well I take responsibility for my life and my answer on the leaf [noise]\nWhat about what what are you to project said two weeks after all if you really intimidated her what about that\nAlready have their opinions about not\nKnow why the hat on for a minute\nOkay I Know that what I was going to happen because you know you kind\nYou know it from the get on this\nMemorial Day from you\nNeed to reach African American right thing\nAnd I I don't know you know I uh [noise]\nBut I mentioned he did a rap called cop killer and I could take a pig out and blank blank blank and now plays picks on the TV and I just mention\nI really think I'm a very simple\nYou know I think he would never go\nAnd you would stand by that because you have but that bringing bringing in comparison to call you about that they're all like in in a way to the husband and wife by the white stand by her husband\nAnd\nI Want to become you know can still meeting Trump and you know with her agenda but you know like when it comes to it's a hurricane\nSerious issue meeting with the\n[noise] I Wonder what kind of activities were going on when President Obama was meeting with rappers like common and\nPIN Jay Z\nOh darn Brazil way down on ... um when she's not revealing the questions for debate I guess you have time to observe popular culture\nBased on this is an interesting thing and maybe maybe Trump is is bucking the trend have seen other president cheated people get tired of looking at them\nGeorge ... novel is\nTired of looking at Clinton I got tired of looking was involved\nIn the lining Bill Clinton's accuser but don't get me started\nAt Obama they certainly got turned George W. Bush will they get tired of watching president ... absolutely you've already I mean the other night\nCSPAN CSPAN stopped covering the rally he never came all the networks and present as self absorbed and I thought it was like another episode of the car dashes runs a featuring Donald Trump um it was embarrassing that that's the best I'm going to say and\nIt was embarrassing from a woman who gave Hillary the debate question at the end of time therefore shifting Bernie Sanders shaft in the other Democrats who wanted a fair competition does he gets the nomination but again\n[laughter] and look
