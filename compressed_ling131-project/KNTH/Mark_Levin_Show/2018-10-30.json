responsibilities\nMaybe as as working men and women or fathers are mothers or painting or whatever you're doing a we gather as one will unite in prayer we lift up those who were lost in this massacre in the Senate God\nAnd we ask God's blessings and wisdom we asked for his healing love we asked for his guiding light and we we hope knowing that it'll never happen perfectly because human beings are imperfect but we hope for enlightenment and love\nAnd all the good things that humans are capable of\n... drowned out of the occasional moments of outrage when you're never supposed to forget you're never supposed to forget we're never supposed to um a shell of these things and I'm a big forget they happen we\nWe should we should we should remember what happened at a church in Sutherland Springs Texas we should remember what happened in Las Vegas we should we we remember\nBut as we gather those things and keep them in our minds and wrap them around our hearts is the responsibility of the community of America or to step forward to to move forward\nAnd see what we can do a ... to\nWill never prevent them but to reduce situations like this now we we can't magically work our way into the brains of leaving hateful anti Semite and say hey stop hating Jews um people people are going to do what they want to do attitude and only\nThe things that we might be able to do is provide I'm a

if there'd been an armed guard a tree of life\nHe is undoubtedly correct is that a guarantee that there'll be no death toll no of course not never any promises of life but ... and and I hated it sad churches\nChurches are supposed to if there's any door that supposed to be all but it's funny last hour we were talking about I mean you don't leave the door to your house open just let anybody wander in and you don't leave the borders of your of your nation open so that just anybody can wander if but if they were supposed to be a place if they're supposed to be locations in American Life\nWhere the doors are supposed to be up where just anybody is supposed to be able to come in those places are called churches and synagogues and mosques\nWorship is supposed to be open to all the method of worship that takes place in society as up to the faith that as being practice there and we didn't have a choice as to where we wish to go to have our our our our freedom of worship\nIn this in this nation of liberty we also have the freedom to own guns and that's where the next level of scapegoating came well this guy at Twenty one guns you know what is what does anybody need Twenty one done this for\nWell that's exactly the wrong question to ask\nWhy does anybody need ten cars why does anybody need Fifteen private jets why does anybody need you know seven hundred pairs of Nike's\nDoesn't matter what anybody meat is because they want him and you have the freedom to have them and that's what the second amendment is about there is no correlation none between the number of guns owned and some of the bill ago linkage to sinister intent I Know a lot of\nPeople with a lot of guns there's some of my favorite people\nThere's some of those soul to the earth magnificent folks that I Know so

there\nAnd seeing the good of America in in the various ah a a ton of synagogues had events right right here on the DFW area we had a bunch of synagogues had some memorial events last evening and and and as Sarah Sanders spoke about this\nShe choked up in in the process and as any human being might and then\nIn the course of doing her job she didn't open the floor for questions and the assembled jak holes in the White House press corps began to badger about President Trump's tone\n[noise] let's spend a moment about tone up\nNo act of violence no murder no bomb scare of packages in the mail no misbehavior of that type is ever the fault of a politician admired by the person who did it\nThe congressional baseball shooting in June of last year was not Bernie Sanders fall\nThe Pittsburgh
