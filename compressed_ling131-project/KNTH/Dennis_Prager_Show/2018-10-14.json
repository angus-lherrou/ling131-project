formula does so much for us we have an even touched on the incredible brain benefits I mean some of these studies you sent your absolutely incredible the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shines pack your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty percent\nOf your body's energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for\nEnergy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge because this is a naturally

it supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat\nJust five days of eight grams of creepy and supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asked them\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't Korea Team didn't fatigue as quickly mentally so this is amazing stuff it re chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea teen to stay fit strong and healthy but you say\nKorea teen is going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week she does the\nFree weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that and then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll sweat and now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at\nHer age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is that her medical doctor recommended for your team for and that just goes to show how much more mainstream this is it's called every strong and it supports\nThe muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this kind of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and the researchers looked at the\nBody of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nHave an exercise so I'm quoting here\n... supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly\nThey go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly\nCould potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective pat\nWhen you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with\nThis ever strong formula\nNow listeners can only get ever strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right Oh absolutely\nI Know it combines decree a teen with the vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit ... be more on it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure creepy and that's it purists find this pre teen from Europe and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D and it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not misprint that today that with purity products because today\nIt for your job is to be one of the first thousand calls you could you be twelve and is your milk and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights do whatever you do\nSee if you don't feel better I was talking about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take and it can people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottom today\nYeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at days are days and making a protein shakes on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop dumping right into your juice pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that\nStuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this for teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us this information we were bouncing\nOff the walls this is so exciting the researchers call this a seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula the product we are talking about right now to\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took our ever strong powder for one month no exercise nothing different in one month they were banging the golf ball for\nTeen yards further pat not only that\nSix percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster ...\nPeople shouldn't just how how about this this is amazing because this was a golf study but more explosive than is more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board\nI Would just got a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team would you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nYou know one pack my one concern with the show\nIs it literally it sounds too good to be true right when I\nTell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up\nYou know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen I almost couldn't believe it I said to myself if it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how I'm everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's as simple as this year we're going to get on the restaurant\nYou're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror and see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up and of course we didn't just a a decree a pure Korea teen we're the fruit XP remember that joined health\nWeight of the coffee Barry extract the nominal antioxidant that's more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful antioxidant protection I added the vitamin D because it's\nSo important across the board great for bone health but also for seniors vitamin D so important for muscles especially as we get older for strength and coordination so this is a very comprehensive formula again this would easily cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks to replicate on your own but today it's free\nAnd not only that let's not forget about the beach twelve energy males 'cause we're talking about energy here today and when you think ... you think be twelve B. twelve is critical for making red blood cells to carry oxygen to the two shoes the by attending there is great for the ... and they also just make sure you're one of the first thousand callers\nGet your free bottle of every strong your freebie twelve energy ... six Ninety five that's it you're just paying for the shipping and if you don't notice the benefits that we've discussed today purity happy to give you back your six Ninety five but that's not going to happen it never happens people love this formula you to tell your friends relatives loved ones you're going to fall in love\nWith the ever strong and to be twelve hundred ...\nFascinating information as always thank you for your time thanks so much for having me back\nInvestors do that costs them time and money and the fact is time is money your time is the most

unnecessarily [noise] so I Want to give you an opportunity do now is the best time during the show to call in and ask your question so you can ask\nQuestions about single family or apartment community real estate investments anything you want to talk about we're here to help you out\nLifestyle some limited is eight nearly thirty year old real estate education and mentoring company we can help you

investments my guest surround Warren is also an active investor is a single family mentor\nAnd surround will you tell us a little bit about you and your story\nGood morning and I'm happy to be here thank you very much yes I have been a member for five years I joined in twenty or so I spent thirty plus years working for a while and like a lot of salespeople Abby ups and downs of\nThe roller coaster sales was making good money some years a lot of money from years then that's a really great years a couple of really horrible years also during that time I didn't say well enough for retirement and uh try to catch up when I was in my early fifties\nRunning and it's a road blocks I actually ... years old I kind of fun to plan that I was going to work until a year ago and for money and have a very nice retirement point that would be Seventy years old\nAnd each year I Will live by the first things I couldn't the best of Iraq already because I made too much money to buy them for ... statement from the government I guess\nAnd then I um I was considered a highly accomplished in my country there's there's a limited the laws that have a lot face and I was trying to catch up but they've kept happening\nAnd I heard lifestyles radio show one day and I heard all the benefits far outweigh shoot like many of those extra for a minute I was kind of thing so\nI was very intrigued and I\nWent to a free workshop thing we heard the radio program\nJoined us a challenge member\nStart buying houses and two years later I became burden member multifamily and Seventeen years ago I had it for years I was able to\nMake my my\nCorn and I was able to retire from my job\n\nKnow so it just that that short little summary there of the journey that you've been on that was that was jam packed full of information so the first thing you experienced was what the majority\nOf people our age are experiencing right now and for those of you that are younger boy it's in your future if you don't do something to prevent it and that's that that concept of the four oh one K. the IRA being able to invest in those vehicles through the stock market\nAnd this idea that you can make up time like that\nAnd you're right there are significant restrictions on how much money you can put in and high income earners would maybe often choose to put in a lot more than they are allowed to each year because you're differing the taxes\nAnd the government really doesn't want you to do that they they would like to have that tax money now and so they restrict how much you can put in there and for those of you you know Surella and I are in our fifties and ... you know for those of you that are younger you are still being pitched on the same broken retirement vehicle\nThat cat that we experienced and lost money through the cycles\nOf the up and down market and if you come into your fifties not prepared for retirement\nYou have to do something else and so you might as well get started early if you're younger if you were like ...\nThen there's no better time than today rights are out in order to get started you talked about coming to a free workshop and if you would like to do that if you already know that you'd like to just come and find out who we are right know commitment whatsoever we're just going to tell you who we are and what we do because we have a very specific investment model\nAnd a belief system about life and\nInvesting and real estate investing and preparing for retirement how to create wealth and passive income\nCan find out what it is the is it matches if it rings true for you ... ... and I and you can register for the free workshop at lifestyles unlimited dot com lifestyles unlimited dot com and go there and you can\nLook around on our website you can look at radio podcast and you can also sign up for free workshop\nAnd you mentioned that you went to the free workshop then you went to the two day seminar at that was in the middle there probably and in our two day seminar it is I think the best deal in real estate investing where we spend sixteen hours telling you exactly how we do we do we have nearly Thirty years of experience thirty eight thousand members\nAre teaching them how to invest in real estate and then you chose to have some additional education and mentoring with our challenge program and before we went further with your stories for all I wanted to explain what that program is that the challenge program\nIs available for people who want more education mentoring when you come out of the financial freedom seminar the two day seminar\nYou have at least one year memberships sometimes to to your membership at lifestyles you can go back to that seminar monthly if you like you can watch it on line you can go lives across the country but absolutely in Houston Dallas San Antonio and Austin\nAnd you can attendant as many times as you want which is an unusual thing there's no additional costs for doing that because we know that people don't retain all that information and they need to go multiple times to build on what they learned last time and learn more and more\nBut typically when you come out of that first weekend you know more than most real estate investors do and you can go out and buy a single family rental or small multi family property five ten unit\nAnd you can do what we teach coming out of that but if you want more help locating properties if you want more help with the hands on mentoring that we do stepping you through the process\nThan that challenge program is our single family program and of course that's your babies around right in Houston you are you are one of three mentors there\nAnd so why don't you tell us a little bit more about your story and what retirement it's been like for you and why why you're mentoring a when you could just be sitting on a beach or on a boat somewhere like you did recently\nAnd at the Tufts a little bit about you know your experience with mentoring\nYes\nWhen I I I I work in the travel business for the last two years I Love to travel olive oil and a product of the nations are all kinds of people in cultures I Love that that's just part of my life and that's what I was really in my last job and then when I retire\nThe bugs are for about a year or it\nIs to watch the whole I followed a lot and the ... the ... the word ... which will retire was rudimentary\nKnew nothing about real estate investing and the people who walked me through and they\nGet to where I was able to retire during that period so when the opportunity came up I was happy to come back and give back to them and help other people do but\nBut you know does model is not the money is a lifestyle I enjoy very well to continue to live a lifestyle which you just mentioned are what I was boy did I\nI'm In the position that I can I Do a lot of my mind that during it helping other people but cold and but\nI can do that from anywhere recently took a trip to Greece and with my close friends and we try to fill those little weak properly or some of the smaller group I was\nWhen I was able to respond to voicemail and middle type like coal this members while I was sitting on a sailboat sitting on the bottom of the group\nThat's kind of combining both worlds I could help people get to this but there are there with them go and I guess I could live a lifestyle while I'm doing that [noise]\nYou know and that's that's the interesting thing about people think about retirement and everybody's got a different picture in their head but\nMost people that I talked to view retirement as not working\nAnd if you talk to people who have retired oftentimes they'll tell you about mhm seems like two or three months it's not very long after retiring they're bored and they don't know what to do with themselves and you might hear them say that their spouse can't wait for them to find a hobby that takes him out of the house [laughter]\nForward and\nAnd we let all out and then I'll talk to them a month later or two months later and they have done something\nAnd\nWe have one of the benefits of the membership off road trip from what we think members off to property\nKind of a combination of educational who go to a home that's owned by members of the ... century have we go all the details of them are on the property so it all the due diligence\nChecked all the contract a bit and then got through that process started and then we go to houses for sale and then real friends are there and they present other house and so we had a road trip just shifted\nThis a lot of fat and I'm Talking to a couple of members who are are not following the math\nAnd yeah and it's you know we're up against the phrase shovel let's talk about that when we get back is what is it in our human nature that makes us do things different than what we know we should be doing\nYou don't want to miss the next segment we're up against the break

you can get so upset they leave and you've got to release the property so\nOne of the things that we do as a mentor is is help the whole people on track\nYou started the show by talking about sitting down with real estate disasters and helping them create a map that gets them from where they are right now because you can't start anywhere else right with us from where we are to where they want to go and then\nHolding them on to that path just like a GPS right just turn right turn left right go straight merge onto the highway and get to your destination which is creating wealth and passive income\nAnd what you're talking about is the difference between active income or real estate doctors are running around or go into houses are working on him themselves they're constantly taking calls are constantly looking for tenants are constantly having issues and the real estate investors like us who you know sitting on a boat with nine of your closest friends [laughter]\n... in Greece add ... you know we may take a couple of calls a year usually over simple things that we can tell them how to fix on the phone and\nIt's it's the difference between owning a model and making sure that all the numbers are they're up front so you can see it and if the deal doesn't works around what are they need to do\nWhat they need to\nStay in touch with us except for the way and then before they make a decision that's going to be called fleet week in week is Germany west\nAnd medicine that they do all day long hours all of them yeah and we do all those numbers and they don't work you have to have the discipline to not by heart\nBut we'll now does work and the members that are correctly ... yesterday one of the member that hosts the road trip she joined in November last year she's on her fourth house and she has plans to retire next year she feared for quite for income\nAnd here he is Mr McKinney welcome to the show thanks for having me bill and all that stuff people first of all if they haven't heard about you but some people what you do yeah so\nSo I'm I'm a huge historian and that's my focus I focused strictly on Houston itself and in Harris County surrounding areas but mostly uh Houston and really it's a the Houston history or bus that is kind of um bought more attention to what I've done the last sixteen years since January two thousand to work with high school kids in middle school kids intellectual kids and\nTeaching them about local history their local last year we all focus on micro history\nAnd when we think about history you've been involved you must love history I'm going to guess but also what is it about Houston history or were you born in Houston\nBorn and raised in Houston is so like Texas was a colorful state a colorful city a lot of fun players you know over the years and you know it's so great that I'm On your show because real estate has has an important part of Houston's growth and Houston's\nA past that you can't really talk about these different characters different stories without focusing on the real estate communities they helping to develop or the business community help to grow\nAnd I'm fresh off one of your tourist yesterday and I loved certainly that part of the city for people listening we did your bus tour and it was post\nOkay Trump started at Nineteen eighty posed a gift that's our Stewart corporate office also the corporate office for Houston uptown\nSo anyway we took the ... every intersection every space between intersections there's a piece of history that particular area of town was just farm land I mean it was just wagons and produce as it\nGoes back to Beijing twenties with the German population settling the area just south of the Braves by a couple of value rather\nA tally community coming down the Eighteen eighties Eighteen Ninety so you have different communities that were there long before it was an iconic shopping district you know when Gerald behind and the Sacco which\nFamily come in here and put the little sprinkle a little magic touches a but I've always said you know every place in every space has history and what we do with the Houston is your bus as we basically use the mobile classroom it's got a flat screen TV and therefore power for presentations I've got phone boards I've got the pleasure of sitting on the border that Julie Addison\nFriends with ... library so we have all these archival images that you've probably seen and different publications and whatnot and it's so great to be able to showcase so we can go to a parking lot you know and and and show it used to be there you know a hundred years ago a hundred and Twenty years ago Victorian Mansion and now they used to be a building and then now there's a parking lot\nSo it's a fun than and our experience for young people but also adults\nAnd when we're on the tour yesterday we've had Robert Sacco is on the show many times and he tells the story as you mentioned his store on the tour yesterday he said that his dad they did a very high tech marketing study where he sat on the corner of West timer and post ... cars are right so we love that story\nBut that's used in history that also you focus on well a few things before it hit some of the other parts of town\nThat you mentioned that the bus helped elevate the efforts that you're bringing forth and bringing forth attention so people knew what you're doing interesting how\nMarketing ideas like that and by the way your bus when people look at your website it and you have a very large here it has no top it's open air so we can look around and you got people as we go along the way\nYou and it's like hot I took a page that are ... book I mean judge high fives we all know the boy wandering Houston he's remarkable character and Houston's pass\nSomebody who most famously is known for you know inventing creating the Astrodome that we know today but you know he did so much more than that it was a lawyer Nineteen state legislature a twenty two is Harris County judge a twenty six\nHe was the mayor of Houston that time was thirty nine years old and a million other time was forty so he's a remarkable character and and this idea of doing something outside the box him in totally different and unique\nIs kind of what I focused on what the bus is a school bus it's yellow and black psychotic school bus in the top is cut off so really we drive these different neighborhoods and we showcase pet parts of Houston's pass you can see something you're not you know hurting your neck looking out of a window that\nWe've got to the glasses you take a regular tour bus company you're in this experience and we really focus on realtors and we focus on folks uh you know that want to learn about Houston's past not just kids but when it comes to adults you know I Love the idea of Houston growing because of our real estate market and if we can focus on getting realtors people excited but we do that's a great thing\nAnd we're all excited about Houston, Texas we think about the growth we talk about it on this show all the time the fourth largest city soon to be the third unless ... in case they want to follow along Mr mechanic the website that they can buy at all the things that were engaged your services and take the ...\nOr a lot of what we do if you rent the ... the cost involved but most of what I Do is free to the public I go out there and work really hard to find sponsors individuals to cover the cost of the operating expenses so we could offer these free tour so we've got an issue in the heights\nAh recently boulevard wheels you support us with that effort and we did the height you know and uh Eighteen Ninety One to present day so they're celebrating in Nineteen eight member annexed by the city of Houston switched liberty a hundred years of being\nAnnexed by the city of Houston we just finished doing those doors were doing the histories and fire department which is taking place the last two weeks of October October Nineteen twenty ninth\nOnboard the Houston issue but she got Mr McCain dot com to reserve your seat and you actually get to pick what date and time you want to go I Mr McKinney dot com and we'll have those links up in a couple of days so definitely check out Mr ... dot com and want to go basis\nThan we do need that called marry me and says Mr McCain use stoning hotel clubbing spot were actually touring John stop mansions and the history river oaks which goes back to Nineteen twenty three\nSo just a great opportunities that Mr McCain dot com and we do encourage people to light and follow our social media platforms on Facebook Instagram and Twitter\nJust lots of rated Twitter page I'm at\nA Houston history buff and of course at ... H. O. U. uh same thing is true with Instagram so you just Google Mr McCain E. M. I. S. T. E. R. always Mr like Mr Rogers Mr spelled out you learn a lot about Houston's past and like I said most of it's free I really feel that education should be accessible to everybody and free of charge that's my focus and and we do all the time\nAnd certainly I'm calling you Mr McKinney why am I calling you Mr\nMcGahn that that people have called me Mr McCain IPO last Eighteen years now working with youth\nI with parents so it's kind of stuff but you know it's a brand I really focus I Want people to Google mister Kenny like Mr Rogers 'cause they'll see everything I've done\nI've got the pleasure being on TV I've been on TV since two thousand eight on cage to use a great day Houston with Deborah Dunkin' has a resident historian and go on Houston life on a regular basis while KP RC and then the news outlets will typically had me speak as an expert on Houston's passed\nI also lecture Rice University's ... school and and like I said ... going to H ... spring branch highest the uh for a number of years now teaching kids about local history so\nThe the minister begin to name just gotta steaks and it works really well and and that by focusing goal is to really be a you know one of the go to people when it comes to Houston's history\nAnd how do you stay on top of all this history because there's so many parts of down we've already mentioned the height post the ship channel all these different areas\nHow do you know all these things and do you have to keep up with it because history has always moving along\nYou know you're right I mean I mean it may may listeners are gonna remember a lot of contemporary history we are going to remember what he used it was like back in the seventies eighties and nineties for example and there's a whole new generation coming out of the great thing about Houston is people are constantly moving to the city there is no shortage of an audience for me there are six point five million people in the greater Houston area and my market is not\nTourists I I get a lot of phone calls her folks warning of take towards expecting me to be a tour company and I'm not I've got it as a point them saying you know I I don't know toward this week about how about next week or next week either but I've got a schedule of Mr ... dot com and it's free\nAnd they get excited about that aspect but um but I really focused on Hugh stony and so there is no shortage of places that we can cover you know I get I GET requests all the time to go to different neighborhoods and I do specially tours also for the Jewish Federation I did a tour of a three hour long toward the history of Jewish Houston\nFor the fifth war community the fifth word CRC Kathy paid our team over they're hired me to do a whole tour about the history of fifth ward\nA which is important because most people we talk about the black experience we focus on fourth war or or third war you know Friedman town of Fort Worth as well but not really the fifth word so these are opportunities to show ... I Will miss district or every year in March so we focus on women's history so there's just no shortage of things that we can do to educate folks\nIt's very very exciting and ... when you talk about ... versus tours the interesting thing\nIs I got to Houston in Nineteen eighty two I think and what I Love is that the historic as you mentioned yesterday in Nineteen eighty ... corporate offices or steward title that since I remember being drawn to that building and within the first month that whole ... area back then Nineteen eighty two\nI was interested in photography I took a lot of pictures of that building and look how it's changed but\nAlso look how that building his stood up Nineteen eighty postal ... as far as that modern structure back then how it stands up and it was ...\nWhile project with Gerald behind and he and Jody Hice Phillip Johnson the architect and Gerald beehives really shaped our city\nEyes are remarkable man he's still around and and still still working and I saw that active with the company but just for Marco man so you're right that building is absolutely timeless its its iconic it's beautiful it really kind of showcases the luxury of post goes very very well with the arches we talked about yesterday a and everything that makes the postal carrier really special\nAnd let's go right to the center of the city give us a few tidbits of history in downtown Houston\nThat's well you know it was on Houston is a former Capitol touches so technical his own country for Eighteen thirty six aging forty five and what is nice about you know downtown Houston there's so much history that still preserve yes we've lost a lot yet time has gone\nOver and Houston as a civic he's growing evolving one of things to keep doing is tearing down a parts of Houston's pass so what I Love to do is teach young kids about the importance of preservation and as a strong preservation of somebody who's out there serving on the board of numerous nonprofit some historical museums\nYou know that's my passions tells you about how great downtown Houston is how we cannot continue losing and we are losing courting mansions in jeopardy being demolished so it was a Nineteen twenty three automobile dealerships on ... street\nI mean these are things that are going to go away if people don't step up and and and say something\nThe negative that could come out of situations is always trying to capitalize on opportunities that I had on the field\nAnd the other thing that kind of you mentioned the idea of the coach to coach the hierarchy everybody's under pressure their bottom line is you want to win right right right and real estate you want to win\nNot just selling asked would you want to do you want to close the deal yet that closing table yeah that's a win and it's even a bigger when ... when the person that may have purchased a home from you or you found a home for them come back\nFive years later and say markets can you help me again yesterday\nBut there's a lot of pressure like that\nBut as far as coaching does what I'm thinking about is\nBeing a professional football player you have to be comfortable right has to be called ... same thing with a realtor Yes sir now did you see along let's take the football experience along the way did you find some maybe great players that they all day and he admitted themselves by not\nOf being ... did you see that ah\nHonestly I didn't you know my first time I play with it I got to spend a lot of time with Calvin Johnson mega Tron so he was a real humble guy who didn't see is a better than anybody and he was willing to help I was fortunate enough to have them type of players every team I went to\nAnd that's interesting you say that because when you work for a broker and in this case Carnahan property property is you have to work with a company where when you go to that season to realtor that very successful person that have been in a Twenty years ago and asked for help not everybody's going to hell right along the way I guess it's just the same scenario\nYeah man and like my first time sitting down ... sat down with the c._e._o. honor miss ... and a man I just felt like this was where I needed to be\nBecause you know they talked about teach and I'm not a real estate professional right now you know I'm In the learning process I Try and buy them inviting me to class that they're continuing education classes on Mondays I was like man they really want to see me six feet and it was kind of kind of reminded me of\nLike we just talked about the Calvin Johnson that I ran into in the NFL you know helping me along the way helped me become a better football player and current wants to help me become the best real estate agent that can be\nAnd that's exactly right and also in leadership like that even like the football team these are people that have vision and through the years\nThey've seen a lot of people and they say this person we think has the right stuff right and then that's how they make their decision and decide to share of all it right there\nIn your role as football you were a wide receiver was again let's say someone's not familiar but the wide receiver is a very unique and very important position let's tell people about the wide receiver what you did ... ability\nRight where are the reason that we we've known for catching the balls but not only that were known for extending around plays you know if the runner bag gets gets passed a line of scrimmage he's relying on us to be black and formed down to ...\nSo being a former quarterback it helped me become a better way receiver because I can read different defense since I knew what was coming so that kind of gave me an advantage when I did make that switch and was able to give myself an opportunity at the next level so wide receiver is a very important to this\nAnd then when you were a quarterback that was in college\nPart of college and high school career\nThat is a cool position as well though you there you're kind of got to know\nHow everything fits together and when the play\nStarts yeah I mean you've got to be thinking all the time each player does rice or your caller let's say all the way the other thing I was thinking about the wide receiver there are times that you missed the ball ... that measures I was going to miss it a couple of oh yeah for sure\nEven Michael Jordan missed a few days or even Michael Jordan okay so let's to people and let's let's say even amp up the drama just a little bit and that is let's say you're like really far away I don't know how many yards but\nYou're far away but you're in the clear over the quarterback throws you the ball and you catch it not only do you catch it but you go for the touchdown what does\nThat still see it on TV all the time but what is it be like\nOh man this feels like I Can't explain it man it's it's a filling this is almost as good as catching the fish I can explain it but to me um is the celebration manage this\nIt can be that it can be the game changer the game can you know certainly can do this so it's like I Can't even put it in the ... to be honest\nAs fascinated because you're you're right I'm reflecting myself not being a football player but I'm saying that that's a ...\nIt could change the game they couldn't win the game but even if it doesn't do that it's still a gigantic part of the ... war it's a part of the battle and you just exceeded and a major way as did the quarterback ...\nBecause of that he wasn't looking at it and you are I mean there's a super example there can be so many that as a super example of team or people connect wearing from ... ... a lot of yard be doing other\nMen not only the ... hour fever and a quarter back what you got the office of law and I play their part and protecting the quarter back to get the ball to the wide receiver so it's a lot that goes into that one touch though\nIt is amazing and the more you analyze it and when we think about sports analogy is like this and then a lot of it's absolutely fascinating and it is it and even the even when you're not playing his ... just came into my mind when you're not playing professional football\nMost people watching on TV but what's it like before the game even start when you walk on the field that I Do get goose bumps give the goose bumps on now\nI get the butterflies ... it was like you get the butterfly still matter what game it was whether it was a pre season regular season I always got the butterflies\nAmazing uh so so there you go and then the bright lights the whole deal and a lot of us forget sports football but it's entertainment not many people are out there you're you're executing of a very specialized skill but yet it is still\nPeople are there and their fans are going right along they're happy with their teams winning their guys ruin whatever right yeah yeah\nWell so as you anticipate here we are now we're thinking real estate right so along the way
