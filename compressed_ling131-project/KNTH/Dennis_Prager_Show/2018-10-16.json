{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "We have a poll out of Pennsylvania this is a brand new poll that came out a couple of hours ago NBC News marathon will look at that a double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania hardly the first double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania this is the third one we've seen in a week or so Donald Trump\nPennsylvania is a big target but all the evidence we have right now\nPennsylvania is still favored to be a democratic state\nTo actually you know they they just wanted to say that I Know for for Hillary Clinton [noise]\nWhat about Ohio we have a brand new part of Ohio Donald Trump doing a little better here but he's still down in Ohio a five point gap\nAgain right now Donald Trump targeting Ohio just like he's targeting Pennsylvania but he's not there right now Clinton still meeting in Ohio\n[laughter] your production right now the Trump shrill oh\nAnother one brand new NBC Marist Poll out of Iowa today again a little bit closer\nBut a four point lead for Hillary Clinton this is supposed to be a ripe target for Donald Trump he at his convention he's had chances here he was out there in that for the caucuses early this year he is still trailing in this poll in Iowa closer he could turn it around but again for right now is Donald Trump ahead in Iowa not in this poll\nProjects Donald Trump will win the state of Iowa\nWe don't have new polls today but Wisconsin Michigan these or other state Donald Trump is talked about flipping with the rust belt strategy we have not seen a poll that puts him ahead nice state\nThan an opportunistic Donald Trump sharing this with Dr electoral votes you\nKnow again the building is still on Donald Trump to show that he can do something and Mitt Romney in a whole bunch of other Republicans over the last generation or so couldn't do and that is actually when the state that's the first thing that's going wrong for Trump the bigger problem is this though these are the blue state he thinks he can slip\nHow about the red state he needs to hold how about the state's Rodney one in twenty twelve the Trump maybe it's just assuming he's been a whole will check this out\nBrand new numbers out of North Carolina North Carolina was Mitt Romney state in twenty twelve well right now in this poll Hillary Clinton has delayed very close certainly Donald Trump could still win it I called a tossup states but we have seen polls putting Hillary Clinton ahead there it is possible\nHillary Clinton could end up flipping North Carolina making it a blue state\nOf another so projected as I say to vote for a lot to say it's on a Donald Trump Fifteen electoral votes [noise]\nTrump's problem no gets a lot worse than North Carolina look at this Georgia new poll seven point lead here for Hillary Clinton not the first poll that we've seen putting or hadn't Georgia this is the state the last one democratic back in Nineteen Ninety two again Donald Trump could still take Georgia but Hillary Clinton certainly has a chance to flip\nGeorgia project for Donald Trump will carry the state of Georgia [noise]\nBut if Hillary Clinton could sustain the kind of wean she has leaked out to an end to this race you could see other state that suddenly get crazy states you wouldn't have even imagine like a South Carolina even attaches they could at least\nBecome competitive and what it would mean doesn't mean Hillary Clinton's going to win all the it means we could add more competitive states than we ever imagined\nYou think with these with the south Carolina and Kansas you would think those would be not as likely that likely slash slam dunk slash and guaranteed slash obviously this is ruby red South Carolina and Kansas but instead they're like read there just lean Republican now\nSouth Carolina leans Republican\nState of South Carolina has gone Republican [noise]\nLeans Republican Donald Trump we project will win Kansas with six electoral votes [noise]\nAnd if those are the top states can do the math associated with all the electoral votes from all the states that they go that way you have to lean Republican and the likely Republican go rent and the lean Democrat and likely Democrat and go blue [noise] signed those out that way and\nThen you say that Donald Trump has the best day in the entire world completely\nOut performs expectation and he wins tossup states he wins\nAll college\nAnd then he's after he went to all of the top so to be insane because nobody wins all of the states [noise] even if Donald Trump dead when all of the top said he would still is\nToo harshly with the best intentions\nIn terms of what's going on up there is only five states that are still considered a toss up right now Florida [noise]\nScience fair projects Donald Trump will carry the state of Florida\nProjects Donald Trump will win the state of Iowa within six electoral votes [noise]\nUnder estimate the good citizens of Gotham City chief\nBut look at the polls Batman and the Democratic calling a farm but this is a real calling from this is legit methodology\nPoliticians trust the voters not supposed\nTo say some well crushed standing by a cleansing that corner\nMy correct and wonder here from John some\nWhat we now have had it over here again about that if the campaign has largely gone darn\nWell over an hour and\nTime zone as they come in earlier in the evening he was looking for any sign that there was a casual when\nIt comes out of her pain in the house for now really silent saying he's playing and the way here what happened\nI ain't never want to believe that the polls could be wrong about other candidates who trusted too much of the polls Marilyn said and they found out that it's the votes stuck out\nThere is how so many Hillary Clinton supporters are reacting in natural thing to campaign town yeah come on and saying go home we're not going to saying how can I mean it's true that there are five races that are either too too early call\nThey don't mind if people are basically good robbing they're merely reacting to their surroundings\nWorn Donald Trump may\nTwenty eight or nine [noise]\n\nShortcoming an overture sorrow and dean that's why they're\nWilker covering the Clinton campaign Kristen [noise]\nHave now confirmed that Secretary Clinton had conceded to Donald Trump concussion took place in a phone call we anticipate just moments ago [noise]\nUh and as we are waiting Donald Trump taking the fans here that is the news at this hour Secretary Clinton has seeded Donald Trump\nOr the constitution is the cornerstone of a\nHelp it agree even if Donald Trump dead when all of the top said he would still is\nWe can now reject the winner of the presidential race in a project Donald Trump wins\nDonald Trump elected president of the United states\nExperienced teachers slowly rough [noise]\nThe cost of many mistakes\nEighties a stunning and shocking development particularly for her supporters who waited hours here at the Javits Center here from her when it appeared as though the path was cutting too difficult\nNumber of them broke out into tears started leaving early\nGrief started to set in one of her supporters told me this is a political upset a huge huge magnitude of course she was holding the event here because you have to have the glass ceiling\nSomething that she was hoping to break through the night to make history\nIt was not to be against\nAnd the Democratic calling farm but this is a real calling from this is legit methodology\nElections are not won by pose commissioner or one by votes at least in this country [noise]\nYou're not having a terrible terrible dream also you're not dead and you haven't gone to how\nThis is your life out this is our election now this is us this country\nSo much for joining us here I Am ten Seventy the answer but that might Gallagher show people here all day long for news opinion Patrick you better spray gr

the ability of people on the left why\n\nThe the ask just asked remember a A R prefer clarity new agreement just ask people to you and your family\nOr a cause I don't want you to fight people in your family as you know but just to see it in order to better just to understand where you're coming from\nFred a\nAlexa\nJust tell me the do you believe that Elizabeth Warren is a Native American\n\nThat's ... it's ... just to ask people is is that what they believe and then you see it's important for you to understand the world of self deception that permeates the what\nThe ... to make believe world it's and it's all its upside down in Israel as the villain in the middle East that America is a villain in the world\n\nThe most accepting country in the world that read my column today how I first learned America was exceptional when I told the story\nAnd I won't repeat the story now but it's based on a personal story that happened to me when I was twenty six years old\n\nIt took me a while so to speak to appreciate how wonderful this experiment called the United states of America is\n\nSo you just ask people\nDo you do you think that Elizabeth Warren was right in claiming that she's a Native American\n\nThen they'll say well no she doesn't say she's a native well she did it's not true she did say that\n\nAnd now it turns out that it's between one sixty fourth one one thousand twenty fourth but even at it's at its best to one sixty fourth you're not you're not that at one sixty fourth there were sixty three other things you are more than that\n\nYou're looking at me you don't think that's how the metaphor if you're one sixty fourth Belgium and you are sixty three sixty fourth ... English you're you are English\nIs that fair a\nCorrect there is no guarantee the other sixty three are one thing that is correct but I'll bet they are overwhelming\nBut let us say okay fair enough let us say she is one sixty four sixty four different things\nShe's one sixty fourth Cherokee one sixty fourth or or do a Pakistani she's one sixty fourth Jew she's one sixty fourth uh Anglo saxon okay let's say that's true\n[laughter] so then she sixty four things [laughter] even even if there was\nNothing that predominate so wow what are you and then you know it will take about three minutes to tell you just to see the names of the sixty four things she is\nHave we\nHave we entered I mean we just came off a\nDisgusting spectacle and American history of taking a beautiful human being and raping his name I use the word deliberately names can be raped reputations can be raped not only bodies\n\nJust like you can kill a soul not just kill a body\n\nWe just got off the staggering disgusting absurdity\nOf of of of a a an alleged sexual assault by a man in high school thirty six years earlier thirty four years whatever it is after leaving by all accounts of elderly honorable life\nAnd now this oh she's really a Native American president using Pocahontas user racist the New York times approach my country has become silly not to mention mean\nClose minded thanks to the left my country has become stupid fifty years ago people would be\nThat all of this shocked thank God you can't go on a time machine that to the future\nPeople from the past and America would have come to now to see what has happened in American public\nLife they they they would shoot themselves they ... they don't or they would\nGet back into time machine as fast as possible and kiss the ground that came from and he said well what about racism in the past\nYou're right that's disgusting but it's not my point it's just the point that you would raise in order to invalidate what is a valid point\n\nWell that's what that's what it is it's absurd it's a Russian collusion ... get a little lie that has prevented our society you understand the absurdity in which we have entered the ... to read a newspaper is to reach stupidity\n\nThis is what they do\nI Am now I'm personally a living through it as as I have a previous occasions if you you get a new word but it doesn't it doesn't help\nI\nI I mean you were to attacks or they're they're just they're part of the of of the vocation of trying to influence society that I have in gate that\nOh you understand that you can't have a billion views of something you've helped create and not be attacked a guy Kevin can I have a national radio show and not be attack I get it but\nStill ... here's this is from the Colorado State university newspaper\nThe latest attack because I'm coming there or what am I coming there are Tobar twenty ninth was today the sixteenth Thirteen Days or if you know anybody in the area it'd be very important for them to come to the speech ... nothing but not to mention if you know a student there\n\nSo some writer for the peace to the student fees shouldn't be used to bring Dennis Prager to see if you\n\nThe last thing many students should see as you want is their student fees to be used to bring a racist homophobic speaker to campus\nShe's real good writer listen listen to this ah A.

convictions\nDo you think that ... does he think that the military budget should be smaller or larger\nRight center is that a conviction does he think the the United Nations is a force for good or not\nDoes he think that Israel is the villain in the middle east or the Palestinians and the surrounding Arab states are more villainous I mean these are pretty significant questions\nNot who has a

water is one of the big issues the big issues have always preoccupied me\nIn high school I remember writing an essay on the moral necessity of the afterlife\nNot what most of my friends were thinking about on the other hand I Do want you to know folks I went to hockey games every week just I did I did leave a normal like semi normal\nAnyway the ultimate issues our I'm Dennis Prager and I have a truly a terrific guests man I have tremendous respect for Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle\nOr would you tell people I think it's important given that we're going to talk about science and face so 'til people don't be humble about some of your credentials in the in that arena\nSure um I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientists or run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle uh uh my PHD is in the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge in England prior to that I worked as a geophysicist and uh\nDid a double a physics geology or science degree in an undergraduate and I'm\nA written a couple a couple of books one signature on the cell and the question of the origin of the first life that in the second one called Darwin's doubt\nA which is a question of about the origin of the first animals which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra diction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin for for animal life so your life has been immersed in science\nBy the way just I've never asked you this and all our time both privately and on the radio in public what does the philosophy of science mean\nIt's the it's the discipline that addressed as scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and uh [noise] basis of human knowledge that what's called in philosophy pissed about how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of university origin of life\nUm [noise] and these are the ... the the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have encouraged to believe philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have to learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of it\nA great combination did you enjoy your time became ... really if you have to do if you have to do something as grueling as a PHD is nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford with a lot of cultural compensations and wonderful people and the weather helps the weather's awful but I'm going to the adult so I was\nAll yeah already not LA that I never thought about\nHis latest book which he edited is a collection of essays and don't let the title but in any way intimidate the is the evolution a scientific philosophical of the logical critique in other words they use the revolution is\nThe attempt of many and in very good will people to reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical of that position of that position so let me get to that the book is up a dentist Prager dot com\nAnd obviously I mean if you interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting so\nI mentioned see right before we went on the air that I until really I met you to be honest\nUh my my view was\nI didn't really care about evolution if it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of the heavens in the earth the God of genesis one and if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway\nSo that in a in a nutshell then I I read to you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly who's loews or a fair amount of his you know about evolution and and uh it has become less and less tenable not for religious reasons but for scientific reasons to\nUh to endorse the evolution as it is generally taught so before we get to garden evolution\nI Know this is ridiculous in the time that I'm getting it give you a couple of minutes can summarize\nEvolution and why it's not always might be skeptical about well not not only we run you know take a bus but scientists right this is what you are but in my mind to scientists are having trouble with that but right right okay go ahead so quick\nDefinitions of the term evolution for orientation first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been change over time or the kind of small scale variation we see in Galapagos finch beaks are peppered mobs or a bacteria that acquire ... antibiotic resistance is sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition of evolution is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one or very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument the origin\nAnd the third and most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations that can produce all the new forms of life that have emerged in the history of life the producers all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism hum is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge\nSo those are three key definitions the first is innocuous nobody doubts that the second is somewhat controversial the third is where do you stay on a second on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the the universal common descent there's a lot of continuity in the fossil record and in the genomic a patterns that we are now observing\nA but the key issue and the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning is the idea that the mutation selection mechanism as genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life ah so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA mutation selection explains the survival but not the arrival of the fittest explains a small scale variations but nothing major innovations and in virtue of that uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference that the of the royal society in Britain the oldest ah\nIn arguably most August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern neo Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk at the conference by ... leading Austrian evolutionary biologist\nEnumerated several key what he called explanatory deficits of the modern version of Darwin's theory neo Darwinism or a number of ...\nThe the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis bombing the the royal\nSociety what is the full name the royal society of London it was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first president was yeah yeah just reading about them yesterday okay\nSo they faction credible they had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation where\nWhere most if not all of the talks were were exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement complement replace\nThe standard mutations election mechanism the odd thing about the conference however or was that uh there were a group of of ah what they called themselves the third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nA ... but they reject standard near Darwinism so they're looking for another approach they have a there was a one group of scientists is known as the ultimate burger sixteen and one of the scientists who was involved in that who have called the conference declared at the end of this world society conference\nThat it was interesting but it was characterized by a lack of momentous nests\nIn other words they did a good job of critiquing the neo Darwinian mechanism but nothing really was offered to solve this problem because they rejected rejected out out of hand intelligent any kind and guidance any any any right mind or purpose in in in the process by for rises\nSo where those flaws might be and then the issue of reconciling if possible God and this and evolution my guests Dr Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture the discovery Institute in Seattle now edited the is the evolution\n... when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ...\nPre eminent scientists of the last hundred years who have believed what you now say is that kind of all what does that say if you are right why does that say about scientists\nThat science like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to groupthink or to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments in particular in the debate about\nBiological origins there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle donors methodological naturalism and it says it if you're going to be a true scientist you have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanations for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates\nWhich will be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered at the foundation of life we've\nDiscovered digital code a Bill Gates still our local hero in a in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program will be much more complex than we've ever device but where does software come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligence\nUm activity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um\nAre a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information and know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe most likely all some aberration was born and prosper because it was better than the previous ... a ...\nA a a plausible theory and the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level\nOr in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then there's the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that were there any other realm of experience point to designing intelligence that the principal of methodological naturalism has prevented many scientists from considering the obvious as white Haitian\nOkay I'm totally on board the ... the question that you have taught me to to ask is\nOr even the people who only believe in a naturalist X or a material explanation are they starting to question traditional\nThey are All right hold on that's what we'll get the answer to
