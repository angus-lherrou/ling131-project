rights\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd uh you know are for money matters is that we are a retirement planning specialist and so we work with people that are over the age of fifty primarily and who are retired or retiring soon and we are so so very thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd recently barons named more your paypal host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors a and actually for the sixth year in a row\n[noise] a flyby thank you but you know what without our clients so we would be absolutely nowhere so all the things go to them\nNow one of the topics that we do talk about with our clients are very frequently is estate planning which we call how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nAnd the reason why you do this is because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does\nIt not Baton Rouge sports happy\n[laughter] and you weren't happy squirts okay let me tell you something unhappy square it's not good don't want that you weren't happy sports anyway so this is the time we normally we talk about that but this week we're going to deviate from our normal appointed task and we're going to talk instead about you're\nGiving the opposite of greedy I think a very clean not on washed and I'm very deserving spouse okay and so we're gonna talk about how to uh protect your spouse in the event of your dad how to create a trust for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust\nJust like the thing you stick in your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property and so we're going to go over that but jak can play it I Know I\n\nWould say you\nKnow my fog and may be\n\nFan\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed it take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nSo but this week as I said we're deviating we're going to talk about your love it and most valued spouse okay so we're going to talk about a Q tip truck so what is accused of trust will basically\nYour if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your state for a state tax purposes and all that you're half of the state is what would normally go\nInto the Q tip trust or some portion there up okay now the Q tip trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of distrust are set up for their benefit\nSo what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decide where the money's invested your spouse decides on distributions from the trust so there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse\nThat's number one there is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's called hams H. E. N. S.\nHealth education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so if they\nIf they are accustomed to a a ... Toyota lifestyle they can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to they have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you have the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the cutest trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new husband or wife that that is in the picture can have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trusts qualified terminal interest property a cue tips easier to say\nAny way hum if you'd like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website it is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit\nNow when we visit this is for those of you

and we have seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much\nInsulation today we're going to talk about extra special offer the lists reserved for later\nWe're going to talk about why should insulate now what the insulation is going to do for your home long term effects on your wallet as well as your home your great investment and how can you translate into higher home sales are better prices are less customer actually got\nTwenty thousand dollars more than they were asking on their home and we hit insulated their home less than a year ago\nSo not that the insulation alone was causing factor but it sure didn't hurt so think about that and then we're going to talk about solar addict fans why this is a good time of year to do it we most thing that is so erratic fans is there to remove heat from the attic and it certainly does a good job at that\nHowever we're going to talk about how it also removes moisture odors sometimes you have some funky orders in your attic whether you had a critter that died up there or you had a we went to a house that actually had a fire and unfortunately\nAnd they had mitigation and they had all of the cleanup there's\nNatural with any kind of incident like this St got everyone in the home was okay but there was still and they're still was at a lingering smoke smell so wouldn't that be a great great cause suicidal addict fan\nSo we're going to talk about all of these things and of course we're going to talk about baffles and why we give them to you for free why do we clear this office so we can get air coming into the house and much more so we're going to talk during the show about all of those things\nGive you a great offered that you can not turn away from [noise]\nAnd then help you get scheduled for your free attic inspection and ultimately get you on a schedule so we can make your house great again this is the energy our my name is Dave brown and we're talking about energy efficiency in your home why does it matter at all [noise]\nWhere do you lose most of your energy in your house is it the walls\nIs it the attic is it the ... we're going to talk about that I'll tell you I'll give you some facts we always talk from a factual based um knowledge database here I guess you when you do it so long you become a bit of a nerd which I have over this information\nBut ultimately when you warming you're home during the winter insulation is the thing that's going to take care of keeping your heat in your house now when you went back to happen\nOr would you want to just do your hard earned money out into the street so insulation is always going to be your first line of defense in terms of keeping your house to heat in the house [noise]\nAnd then when you want to keep that heat out of the house insulation again is the same exact cancer\nAlways try and toxic always at every show about what our value is now I don't mean oh you are not our values it's are like the letter our values\nAnd then you hear are bad you've thrown around when when you're talking about insulation any type of insulation are that you as always going to be discussed whether it be\nA blown in insulation batting insulation whether it'd be spray foam insulation each material has it's different set of our values so let me tell you what's the harm means our means resistance resistance to what days\nResistance to the transfer heat so\nWhat that means is if you have a higher our value you resist the entry of heat in the house during the summer months and you resist the accent of your heat or the leaving a heat from your house during the winter so our values key\nIn every area has its own code that says this is what we deem as the right amount of our baggage and a half\nSo they get a house can be energy efficient so if you're feeling that maybe you're addict is not\nUp to snuff this is a program for you to listen to keep listening is going to be great show and we're going to give you some special just for being the listener that only listening as of this show can take advantage of\nAnd we're also going to give us a very special offer if you plan on going any home and garden shows so stay tuned ah my name is David Brown decision the energy our [noise]\nAnd I'm the owner of advice you can visit us at addict buddies dot com\nThat's addict buddies dot com where your friends and insulation business a whole motivation is to help you received the most you can for your dollars of course while giving you the maximum protection\nFrom the transfer of heat in and out of your house if we do that then we\nWe've really done a good job I always like to say that we don't want to do every single house we just want to insulate your house so stay tuned we're going to take a quick break this is the energy our my name's Dave brown and you're listening to the energy our with ag buddies dot com\n[noise] you are listening to the energy out with his aides browse check out they've rounded buddies that I'm for low rates on installations lady embarrass solace addict as CIA\n\nYour what would you you if you're a he was running all day long why that's easy I call adding buddies addict buddy George\nLoves them welcome back this is a round and this is the energy our so we talked about re embarrass solar fans out against lesions how we can save you money on\nYour energy bills week after week after we\nSee [noise]\nWelcome welcome welcome energy\nWhat a word now energy it kind of ... it really involves everything that we do on a daily basis now heat energy is really\nThe robber of our physical bodies right if we get to how we get tired I Know I I get tired when I'm sitting on the heat\nAnd when we in our homes were we supposed to be really the most comfortable it's pretty annoying when our house won't cool down and it certainly and knowing the other way around and we can't heat our house sufficiently enough [noise]\nNow this time of year what kind of in that zone where it begins to get cool and you may not need your air conditioning as much and you're not quite running the heat and would you be surprised to know that this is the best time to insulate your home\nWell we you could think number one prices of insulation are actually more affordable during this time so this should be the ... term for insulation\nOr for doing a insulation job on your home this should be the time that you take advantage of the prices number one\nOf the fact that it's actually cooler so you can get more work done and if you want to be kind to the people who are doing the work right but you also gearing your house up and getting ready for the next heavy season\nSo if you do it in the middle of the season you're really won't feel the full benefit it's really important that you insulate during this time because\nYou're preparing your home for when it's going to need and use more energy which brings us right back to the song that we heard coming into after the break which is energy now\nInsulation the properties of it is that it had our value each substance has all that you know the blown in insulation which is what we use primarily an addict\nHas our bags of about a three per inch so you'll see that code is about Thirteen fourteen inches you multiply that Thirteen times three that's going to give you a value of our thirty nine\nThat's like putting on one of the most comfortable downer feathered blankets on a winter's day\nOh gosh I feel so comfortable or vice versa it's like putting a shade trees\nOver you on a hot day it doesn't allow the Senate penetrate and so when you slow down the penetration of the sun into your into your house you're cool down your house now what happens with your energy usage and this is where we\nWant to talk about the benefits of how your energy bills go down because\nIt's not fighting your AC unit or ... H fax system is not fighting against this heat\nIt's really a thermostat that is doing all of the [noise] the brain work telling a track system hey it's getting hot we need to kick in because whoever set that temperature they said it for Seventy two and it's starting to feel like Seventy five so Mr age back go to work\nSo now if you have more insulation you can give Mr age back arrest and we're we're all kind of veterans of things and break at the most inopportune time\nIsn't it funny how ac units tend to go out when it's the hottest right\nMoist damp addict can be a breeding ground for dust mites and mould\nDust mites feed off a mold and dead human skin and they are just horrible creatures to having your attic if you were to install\nToo so addict fans based on your square footage of course sometimes only one you would see drastically reduced chance of getting mode and your addict call addict buddies eight three to four or five eight four zero three six for free estimate welcome\nBack this is a round and this is the energy our what we talk about ... fans attic insulation how we can save money on your energy bills week after week after week [noise]\n\nThank you please thank you\nThank you [noise] welcome welcome welcome\nBack this is Dave brown I Am the energy our host and it seems like they're applauding all of the special rates that we announced only for the listeners\nSurgery just tuning in we've been talking about a special rate on insulation I'm and we're going to give away some more free stuff but you got to listen to the program to get all of the benefits now the first thing we talked about was\nEnergy efficiency we tried to educate gee I always try to give you a nice framework on white different things you do and why you really need them\nAnd then I go into the details of how it really really works\nAfter that then I give you an opportunity to take advantage\nOf some really great specials that's why it takes kind of an hour to really build up all this information and then allow you to take part of the things that you think would benefit you the most\nSo we talked about bone and insulation special rate of Ninety send a square foot for 'em by the way we use John Mandel insulation that typo allergenic can anti asthmatic it's the best product on the market I've seen other products and it's just not as good as this John man but products so we use that\nBlown in product we also do some really value added things that really help you along the way with the free baffles are we clear yourself at then so that keeps breathing now once we've done all that we insulated addict and we have\nAir rated it and let let the air coming more now what we want to talk about is adding some active air flow at the Airflow what are you talking about days\nActive answer is the installation or a solar addict fan so why should I Do that Dave\nWell I'll tell ya [noise] ridge advance just are not enough ... will allow air flow to come out at a very slow rate\nMaybe fifty sixty cubic feet per minute and it just doesn't keep up with the pace of the heat buildup and yet even\nDuring the cold months so you want to introduce active Airflow now if you have a really steep proof you probably won't need\nAn act of Aslam as much because this deeper the root for the greater the draw kind of like a woodstove when you have a longer um type you get more air coming through their woodstove and so the fire burn higher right\nSo addict gives the same way if you have a steeper roof you have a lot more draw that's coming through the addict so in that case if it's super steep you probably won't need an active air flow but most homes\nIn this region have shallow roof pitches and if\nThey have shallower roof pitches will Dan there's nowhere for the heat to go and that ridge vent that's pulling air at about fifty cubic feet isn't no match for the Ames credibly powerful dirty wide Remington so addict van pulls at Fifteen hundred and fifty cubic\nFeet per minute oh my God [laughter] that's just so much that night and day\nSo you you've ever sat in front of a fan on a hot day and how did that feels when when you've been hot and you sit down and you get a nice breeze come across well that's exactly what you'd be doing when you add a soul addict fan is you're adding active Airflow so can you imagine how your age fax system is gonna really love it now\nYou know imagine what an age back at the age back system could talk what would it say\nI have a feeling and have a deep voice and it probably be like hey you may believe me up and it had to go all the time I'm ... that's just my rendition of what what what age back good sound like [noise]\nAnd jokes aside anything that sits in hot environment and it breaks down much more quickly so just just imagine if H back was human and how much we love the idea of you at him and wanted to Seoul addict fans\nJust to cool down environment it would feel exactly how you feel on a hot day and then you feel that nice cool breeze\nIt would feel relief so many tell you exactly how this works the sole addict fan takes energy thumbs converts it to electricity and turns of fan that sucks the air out of your attic it brings it in due to soften vents I remember when we talked about those free baffles that we were going to put into your attic\nWell that's where they come in handy they come into play I should say they allow that air to continue to flow all the way up to the soul addict fans which is sucking air do at Fifteen hundred and fifty cubic feet per minute and if you have to that's three thousand thirty one hundred Cuban people committed pulling air through your attic\nCooling the air and the headache\nExtending even further the life of the eight track system cooling down the interior addict therefore the heat transfer does not happen as much through your installation and ... and a layman up your roof doesn't get baked all day long\n[noise] it is a God powered which I Love to using that term\nSo that you don't pay for the electricity every month like a wired band it's also lifetime ... and it comes with a built in thirty percent federal tax credit so therefore\nThirty percent of the price of the fan is given back to you in the form of cash\nAnd that's not a good deal I don't know one\nBut I Want to make it a lot more clear and let's talk about the fan itself it's Eighteen by Eighteen all the way around Eighteen Inches by Eighteen Inches and it has a fourteen inch diameter hall so you have a four inches of flashing all the way around these are leaked proof\nThey go under a layer a shingles and on top of the other layer so they really act as another layer of shingles to keep the water\nFrom coming into your attic and of course when the egg buddies grew installers them we do I use ... silicone so that we actually have another layer of protection so that you'll have to worry about that as possibly being a problem\nSo we talked about thirty watch all the fans Fifteen hundred fifty cubic deep committed an error getting sucked do yeah addict cooling down the addict\nI'm at the rate of Fifteen hundred square foot per hour you're turning over that air right when you do that you reduce the chances of mold and moisture [noise]\nIt has a beautiful censor that hangs in to the attic and reads the true temperature not the surface temperature 'cause it's always going to be had at the surface but it's going to be a nice little dangling censor hanging in your attic\nSo that it reads humidity and temperature so humid if the humidity or rises above Seventy five percent it kicks on the fan if\nThe temperature rises above eighty five degrees which is almost every day\nThe fan kicks on that's the kind of real protection you went in your head now once you do that here's what we want to have to you just as an added value this\nSolar added fan installed as to digitally and regularly nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars okay it's not going to be that much\nWe're going to take off are actually two hundred dollars so it's going to cost you seven hundred and Ninety nine dollars installed but don't forget you're going to get to thirty percent federal tax credit so that's going to take another additional two hundred and some odd dollars I haven't done the math\nSo you were talking about is just a little bit about five hundred dollars per\nFan and that's of value that you really can't say no to and if that is not enough we have instituted in New\nService that we want to unveil right now we're going to blow your roof off of pine needles and\nLead if we're already up they're installing solar fans why wouldn't we then turn on our blower\nAnd blow off all of the debris deck and first of all cause leaks in your roof\nDebris on your roof cause so much problems and this is the season where you can have more of it so the value of that is normally typically we charge ten cents per square foot so now you can just call us if you want roof blowing will be happy to do it is ten cents per square foot\nAnd many of your roof area is going to be a lot larger than your addicts or if you are an advocate Fifteen hundred square feet your roof could be about the thousand square\nFeet\nSo Weibo that offer free when you get to a more fans installed so how's that I mean that's a real good offer [noise] I if you combine that with all the other offers the insulation if you get the installation and the ... you're talking about uh you know almost a thousand dollars off whatever services that we're offering you\nWe'll call just the opposite and then of course up a cat is not meant for you it's meant for the sun right so we're not talking about one two three ... gonna knock out the sun and if we knock out the sun we are\nReally we're protecting our home then you know this is like giving your home a big hug\n'em if you really love yourself you tend to be home if you love the country and your family you tend to love your home it goes hand in hand so these products are expressions of love\nFor your house insulation if you have your house properly insulated if you've got a Eli de lights where they need to be ... you shall we love to your house or you've got your home air tight as much as it can possibly be you're you're showing love for your home\nYour show love for HPV access to your show in love for yourself you're showing love for your investments\nAnd you know I work pretty hard for the things that I have accumulated over the years um they don't necessarily make my whole life but if I'm going to buy something and let him take care of it right [noise]\nSo we're talking about another way to take care of your attic with radiant for you know some companies use to spray laundry and barrier\nAddict but he says the green company so we stick with products that won't harm your house there no off gassing or any problems that might occur if you were to\nBreathe in uh the material right so for that we don't abide by the spray on radium Barry we use attack on radio point\nThe radiant ... has a Ninety seven percent effective rate versus the eighty five percent rate that you would get from a spray now here's the downfall of the spray the spray on is human dependent so if that person is in the attic and just as feeling lazy that day\nAnd they don't want to fully cover\nThe wall the decorating well then\nYou're not going to have a fully covered addict will you the beauty of the radio for is that you cannot get away with ... or ... um [noise] I'm trying to think of a polite way to say it but doing half\nJob [laughter] right family show so we'll we'll talk in terms that everybody can listen\n[noise] you can't get away with that with the radio for him so we're talking about a product that is going to be more effective and you can't cheat in any single way and and it doesn't give off any gases or anything the super tough durable\nUm radiant for oil you know it looks like so before but it's not cheap\nIt's really really durable I mean you can't rip it with your hands [noise] it would take a you know an act of Congress to poke a hole in this thing and then of course you'd have to have it had to be something super super shark we have to use\nBlade to to cut sheets and then we install them right on the um [noise]\nThe ceiling Joyce so that whole entire interior of the attic is covered whereas when you see them spray those Joyce never get sprayed just in between the Jewish\nSo with that being a an issue you're really not getting your money's worth with the ... and you're getting a product that can harm you and your pet send your children so that's why\nWe chose the radiant for it's a lot harder on us I can promise you we can move probably at the rate of about two hundred three hundred square foot per hour so could be a multi day job on\nSome addicts some addicts don't need it to be quite honest I'm not ... it's really an assessment case by case thing\nRight so not every addict needs it so we only recommend it to people they need it and he was a little secret uh I'll tell you a secret if you're not going to live in your house forever [noise] maybe you don't want to spend the money on the radio barrier a lot of people tell you that\nIf you say you need it they will do it I think that that is a not in your best interest and I think that's not good there's\nSomething wrong with that in mind and with the whole goal of\nHelping you increase the value of your home we have to do and bound to do what it in your best interests so\nIt doesn't mean no one should get it because we are just recently did a job in a house that really couldn't get any other protection and this was different for homes all the conditions were right and then we said hey why don't we radium berry this particular area it'd be an attic\nAnd then after I had if we can take care of that with solar addict fans and they did the job it did the job they immediately\nThe comfort level increased um [noise] the room that was hot it was now not hide anymore it was neighboring aside attic and we also put some um some batting up on the wall\nAnd the whole entire house felt immediately better [noise] and we love it when we get those reports um so here's what we charge for the radiant barrier for all right it is two dollars and fifty cent a square foot\n[noise] and it is a little bit more expensive than the spray on\n'em at the same time the value is much higher with the attack on and if you're going to do something you you probably want to do it right so it's two dollars and fifty seven square foot was attack on us\nAnd more than be sent to add that to a proper insulated attic\nSo addict fans\nRight and you ask your roof thrown off so do you have any potential fire or any leaks that can occur from needle pine needles or to breathe so forth\nYou really made your household again and this is a really important thing to do in the off season in the season when it's not burning up\nBecause the prices the labor and all of the benefits are going to be much more affordable right\nSo let's go back and look at everything that we talked about so we started out learning about our values our value is the resistance to the transfer of heat we want to keep it out during the summer we want to keep it in during the winter\nWe talked about how ah we can add our values and what it does to the different devices that you have in your house how it extend the life that I liked the H. back system how it extends the roof [noise] ... I've seen roofs that looked like\nA you know like a a a ripple ... or ... potato chip [laughter]\nYou don't want to hammer ruffles potato chip roof\nOkay so we talked about that never talked about some of the great special that you get when we come out for free estimate with addict but he's number one you're going to get a free estimates which is the first whole idea of it all Ninety send a square foot rate on insulation\nOr you're going to get free baffles free software Cleary right and then if you get to solar friends installed you can get free roof blowing up needles and pine needles and everything else that can really damage your house right and then the radio barrier speaks for itself it's two fifty square foot\nWorth every penny works better than\nThe spray on and it will do your addict\nSome good it creates a barrier where\nThe heat actually never enters into the ... is a low in Mississippi the rate of ... products so that means on one side all the heat would be behind it if you put your hand on the interior side you won't even feel the heat that's called very low in Mississippi rate trying to say that fast\nIt doesn't even Mitch\nAre transmitted date through into the addicts or your cooling dang addict you're extending\nThe life of all of the wonderful things that you say step in there okay so we had last thing we talked about is special home and garden show rate\nNumber one if you come to us without going to their home and garden shows because unless you got other things to to look at I Would say go take a look but if you're going to home and going to get insulation definitely come to us first you don't have to walk anywhere you can just pick up the phone dollar number\nAnd get the home and garden shows special bring us any literature if you do go and will be dead price would average price it is and will give you a lot more service\nAnd we'll give you the experience of a company that knows exactly how to install insulation properly which free baffles that keep the air flow going us off at clearing\nWe'll give you a really good advice in terms of what you need and what you don't need a it's not about giving new stuff it's about prescribing the right things that we'll hope help extend the life of your home ... system all these expensive devices to give his car fall that at\nEight three to four six four seven one seven six\nBut not in the region but Larry's back with us today do you guys are with us last week we had John O'Donnell\nHe's the chief now jobs are we calling the rain maker hear it on trade he kept me\nFilling in for Larry's big shoes here on the income generating show now one of the things that we love to talk about here is we love to talk about making more money hence the name right we're all about income here it's all about driving more income now it always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for for really whatever we want but it's all about having more income so we can do the things we want to do rather than do the things we have to do now inside of our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spent a lotta time on this show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about he sheds a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent income in the market and it really starts with a consistent approach and all we mean by consistent approach is the marks go up down and sideways so we've got to have\nA strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money up down or sideways right now we've got that Bush bias where some of the greatest consumers of all time but Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team are really having the student's focus on right now to generate money and to be able to identify those down opportunities and they'll sideways opportunity\nWell it really comes out of the things that's about awareness and basically emotion right now\nSo the awareness is a lot of people want to make more money they think that making money is simply working another job which is something we don't want it to where more importantly most millionaires you and I said this over and over again to have five different income streams\nWell you can imagine a millionaire and just want to go out there were five different jobs they learn how to generate income passive income or active income they just want to pay check coming over and over again and so a lot of our students learn how to go from being very emotional\nTo being very strategic and the way you do that is by following people who are already doing what you want to do and what course referring to the big banks and so a lot of what we teach our students is\nHow the banks make money and most of the ways to make money is not just by going long where most people learn a trade that way\nBut also by going what we call shorting the market\nAnd that's simply means in the markets go down it's not necessarily a negative thing it's an opportunity and so we think self aware is understanding that there's more ways than what you might have been taught to trade and as a result you now simply learn which most people don't understand that their way to trade money in the markets\nIs really simple it's a transfer money for people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nYou know when you're talking about shorting I Love that you brought that up because you know we have that Bush by us where we already know how to make money when the market goes up we buy low and sell high but the interesting thing is\nHow you make money as the market's going down the shorting concept you were talking about what what a lot of time get disconnected from that is it is still buy low in so high it's just in a different order is so high and then buy low\nAnd so that's one of my favorite things about the half the class and and whenever I get a chance to actually teach one I really spend a lot of time really tried to shift our mindset and then the mindset that the average investor has out there which is totally normal\nIs down markets are bad right we we we even hear it on the news and bad news they say oh it's such a terrible day on Wall street the markets went down the Dow went down four hundred points\nWell on days like that like back in February you know Goldman Sachs had the two hundred million dollar day on a down day just like that right so one of the things I Love that I was just getting started off onto with with my point is I Love being a part of these happy classes and being able to really introduce people to how to make money as the markets go down\nSo they don't have to fear the bear right you don't have to be afraid of embarrassed market bears markets just like Bush markets\nAre great opportunities to make money and even\nEven sometimes greater opportunities to make money because at which a speed the market goes down\nIt's that whole fear and greed pits principal the up markets are driven by greed the down markets are driven by fear and you know I I remember asking a class once you know which which which motion was more powerful fairer agreed\nAnd I had some you say I I I think it's greed and we chatted about it because most of the class thought it was fear and one of the points that I came to was if it was greed everybody would do everything in their power nothing nothing would ever standing anybody's way of making money but it ends up being fear 'cause the fear of the unknown the fear of trying something new\nConsistently stands on the way of people's people's ability to make more money and it gets back to your point of that is why most people go out and they just get another job rather than generating another stream of income like passively are actively via the markets because that's a safe zone they already have a job to get another job while it's not the most appealing thing\nIt's a little more safer for our psyche so those are some of the things we help our students overcome a so I'd love to you went down the shortest path there\nBecause that is a great way to make money as the markets are going down and one of the things that we could do to help get a few people get started really being able to see the opportunity and embarrassed market is we've got a big stack of tickets here that we are going to give away today what you say we pull a couple of these out and we give them away some more listeners get some people educated\nAll right well right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area\nAnd at the half the class and really it online training academy ... we focus on generating income as the markets are going up in the markets are going down\nBut the half day classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to be able to do that now have take classes are about three hours long your investment is going to be three hours of your time to come in and raise that financial like you to help you get better returns in the market in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three that data and eight five on seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston ... and see if you can ... passes there\nLarry's we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got that down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the ... by us that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a expand on that went for our listeners and even even anything else that that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right on the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated now it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around to some education the problem is it's a very costly less and why would you want to spend all that time energy and money\nWhen you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to try to get like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shorting the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the court can only go and drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be a pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the markets are going down to what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process to system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's coach ... somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my my mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused\nOn the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times we tried to put the cart\nFront of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching a different things like that can can can really help but you know too many times we we approached the markets and and when I talked to people is very normally the did they say\nI say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for them and say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income scale has to come first and if the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody a successful or not it's just like I I I compared flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane of across the country that's a that's a whole different conversation and\nWe would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves\nAbsolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to ally spend more time at your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job maybe one of volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so\nThey're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses\nSo one of the ways you could look at this as as you mentioned are students realized that they can be trading and this is really about them so you if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what are you trying to attain because a lot of times you'll sit back\nThat puts you at a time machine like let's say we put them back in the delorean right back to the future do you go back two years and you it's made some goals for yourself how many people actually go ahead and achieve those goals probably very few and two years from now what's going to make it any different that something will change instead\nWhat if you could learn a skill that allows you to generate daily income weekly income monthly income\nAnd you don't have to spend extra hours doing it we have to call three hour traders\nThey get up in the morning when the market opens and they want to be out of their trades within a couple of hours and they got there\nThe day to spend with their family their friends taking vacations the key that I find is that it really is about like we've mentioned\nFreedom how are you going to find a way to ease your time to allow you to do the things that you want and the biggest single obstacle that most people have that prevent them from becoming successful at it for natural your life is fear and so we help our students kind of get past that by\nReally breaking this down in a simple way where students can figure for the first time how banks make money and more importantly how they can make money too\nYeah and really procrastination ends up being that largest nation in the in the world right procrastination putting things off but you you're touching on fear there and that's what made me think about procrastination procrastination is like the result of fear\nRight is what happens when we're afraid we just we put it off all you know what I'm I'm fearful of this and I I Know that I Need to do it so internally we say I am going to do it just not today when really that just means we're not going to do it right so we were procrastinating we're putting it off and that helps kind of take some of the pressure off\nOf fear but one of the things about pressure is that's how diamonds are created right\nDiamonds are created out of massive amounts of pressure and when you think about things like that great things\nCome from that activity and it it boils back to a few more of the old cliche saying where if you always do what you've done you'll always get what you and we could layer upon layer those\nThose conversations but it really ends up being how are we going to react in those situations where we know we need to go we need to make a right hand turn even though the left hand turn looks a lot easier right it's doing what needs to be done so that we can get the financial freedom\nThat we want he had imagined what your life would look like if you could actually achieve those financial goals are hoping for\nA lot of our students to give you one example and coming up in a break Ryan where her name was Maria single mom she wanted to put our kids to school very very nervous you wouldn't have enough money well she learned how to trade not only was she able to put her two kids to college but she bought herself a new cars so\nPeople that have goals are able to commit your coach of all you have a high probability of being able to achieve the things you want in life\nThey always say if you're why is big enough you will find your how that's right\nWell one of the ways where we can help you get started his by introducing you really to the step by step process on how to generate more income and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is\nIf you can follow a simple step by step process this is something that you could do now and now before we give away these passes though I always check in with Larry to make sure it's okay with him I think so right now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and\nA half day classes where you going to see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income those multiple streams of income inside of the financial markets\nNow included with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit they're packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about\nThat hit us up at Houston ... dot com and see if you could forces we've got to take a quick break Larry what's on that just talk about what it was really worried about what happened to have another major correction how will you be able to protect your fighting we got great retirement conversations around the brake stick with is right and there will be right back [noise]\n\nIf you can

A. dot com\n[noise] you are listening to power trading radio now that the show\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director of instruction development in half and structured on I mean really shed some light on income we talked a lot about multiple streams of income we talked about different types of income passive income active and come a little\nWhile ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active\nIncome and and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow in and that income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment talking a little bit about the retirement accounts\nAnd so one of the things that maybe you miss out on that last segment as far as talking about more ... more generating more income well don't worry we're going to be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation whether you're tuning in for the first time\nYou've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot of social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRose got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot number one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ... one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and to correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier on the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing market starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first thing we got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade and mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world at Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss has set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K.\nIs not protected in fact we think about a congressional people and senators they don't have for one case they have pensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes\nWill right now you should be thinking about especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira or four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. that became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended than we ever seen that index of been in the past\nAnd there's simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this four one K. won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nAnd the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low opera opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher\nAnd over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for ah for for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the market's going higher and higher", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "06"}
