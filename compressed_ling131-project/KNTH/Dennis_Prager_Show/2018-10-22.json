ten Seventy the answer [noise] Mm\nRoom\n\nMy Gallagher there is such good news happening economically in this country one of the big\nIssues is uh is the concern in the issue of drug prices there's a origin Frank Luntz pull out that revealed an eighty percent of Americans think drug prices are on reasonably high the American people believe drug makers are putting profits ahead of patients\nDo you know Americans spend forty percent more on prescription drugs then Canadians and then our medication prescription drug costs just keep sky rocketing farmers spent more money on lobbying than any other industry in America over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars worth the American people believe that the system is rigged\nAnd it's rigged because of the big drug makers undue influence with their lobbying dollars\nYou know the fact of the matter is the monopoly pricing power of the drug makers can only be countered by action in Congress drug makers have to be held accountable there needs to be accountability but the skyrocketing costs of\nDrug of our medications Americans want accountability drug pricing and we want Congress to take action\nThe prevailing sentiment there was you know all the polls is enough is enough is enough already Americans want these solutions to prescription drug affordability and want them now it's time to hold the drug makers accountable put the patients ahead of profits they have their lobbyists\nAnd there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories in our votes\nIt's time to end the drug makers monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all the patients ahead of profits we will be telling you how to do that in the days and weeks to come you're going to be very impressed with this partnership that we are proud to roll out with you now that's all coming up I promise a and you'll find out or\nAs we do this or that a great call to action for you as well keep has some concerns about this NBC\nOr Wall Street journal poll which I think is very encouraging joined President Trump in a forty seven percent of rating was higher than Obama was during this stage of his presidency and twenty ten hey Keith what's up\n[noise] or that they aren't sure just just a current mayor when you're talking about that back\nI only believe that Charles oh numbers are all ordered bother Grammar Girl was over report it\nStarts in two thousand and you're dealing with the Obamacare failure dealing with that and God and the Democrats got slaughtered in\nTerms of that concern you at all\nOh my gosh been guys he was a blip on the radar for the mainstream media are you kidding me\nThe only people that were covered bin ... were were conservative media outlets that are\nThat bothered or dared to go up against the Hillary narrative on that the media gave that a big pass it was a giant yawn and Obamacare for the mainstream media was a you know like a curing cancer they thought that was the greatest thing in the world\nNo not even not even a little bit no comparison no comparison whatsoever you know you look at the polling numbers do and I I Want to go back to the story about this is really interesting analysis from that of all places CNN this is an analyst or analysis rather from a CNN reporter\nThe house forecasters ... the Democrats win two hundred and twenty six seats and the house majority Republicans will only when two hundred nine seats\nThe forecast percentage and this is CNN talking now [laughter] although we haven't generally presented a percent probability the model that we have showing that Democrats hold the house I mean not take over the house is about Seventy two percent chance\nSo Harry Anton over there and says\nIt's not as if all hope his last for Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control again remembering that the model gives Democrats about Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house that's among the lowered chances than most models give\nBut it's in the general ballpark he asks you know who else had about a Seventy two percent chance of winning\nYou guessed it Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHe says it's not too difficult to paint a scenario in which the Republicans maintain control of the house maintain control the house rather let's say Republicans when all those seats where they are favored as well as the streets were democratic candidates lead by about a point or less in the CNN forecast\nThat would leave Republicans with two hundred and twenty seats\nTo Democrats with two hundred and Fifteen sheets\nSo to ... to rule out to say that there is no no chance in hell that Republicans can control the house so it's not really accurate what even CNN says there's a scenario\nHere where Republicans can keep the house [noise]\nThat scenario is very real [noise]\nBe the first

you actually show where he is advocated marital rape\nNo of course now I wrote an article\nWhich is a well known to you my theory on this from the male female aerobic column about ten years ago\nTo park column\nArguing and suggesting is that if a woman loves her husband and he is a good man\nThat she not allow mood alone to determine whether or not she will have relations\nWith him sexual relations for those of you promote aware for relations meant in that context that was it that was made the context that in general\nBut it's a bad idea to allow mood to determine whether we do good things and it's a good thing for your husband even if you're not necessarily in the mood but I'll be ... it's so obvious the whole point was you've got to be a good guy and you have to us to say yes it's [laughter]\nIt's ... bucks and I I just ask you see that what bothers them is\nThat\nThey have grown up thanks to the left which is in the moment the beep nor system with no concept of obligation to others\nAll it's all water my rights so the I hear that a husband and wife have mutual obligations is foreign to so many students who've been touched by left wing narcissism\nWhere you're only question in life is what is my right\nSo if I even argue you might be even consider that you have obligations these are foreign concept\nWhy so much prefer the Jewish or Christian education for kids because you learn that life is obligations oriented towards other human beings not rights oriented\n[noise]\n\nThere's an NFL a skirmish year apparently the wire reports here\nYesterday and it was a game between the Carolina Panthers in the Philadelphia Eagles\nEagles\nEric read and Panthers Malcolm Jenkins got into a heated exchange spurred by the national anthem protests that ultimately required teammates and referees to separate the two\nProtest founder and now ex NFL or Colin Kaepernick the guy who was the big poster boy for Nike\nNike another major corporation the loads this country and they'll say oh that's disgusting we love America if you love America you don't make a poster boy out of the person wouldn't even stand for the national anthem in the flag okay\nYou're full of crap don't live my friends don't lie to yourself still alive yourselves\nSays this is paying on every ... every American black white Hispanic Asian who died for this country and\nFor that ... what it is All right\nSo just just understand that you you fools Nike\n\nWas on the forty niners when Kaepernick started the protests and still refuses to stand for the anthem slowly held a grudge against Jenkins for his role and redirecting some of the protest energy into more direct action by a deal with the players coalition which Jenkins cofounded\nJenkins who endorses the cause behind the protests agreed to stop the arm feel protests if the league would invest about a hundred million dollars into quote unquote social justice causes\nFor that read has labeled Jenkins a sellout\nAs the two teams went out on the field before the game Sunday reading Jenkins began to draw a moment caught on camera things got tense enough that reached teammates had to restrain him\nKaepernick quickly chimed in to express his support\nFor Eric read after the game read made clear to reporters why he has so much animosity for a fellow NFL player\nWho actually agrees with the larger cause\nJenkins he said it's just sell out and then Neal colonialist because he co opted the movement by working with the league to raise money for social justice rather than continuing to protest on the field by the way this proves that guys are like read\nA load of this country\nHe would rather crap on the flag publicly in front of millions then have a hundred billion dollars go to causes that he cares for so why does it prove it proves that his mission is to is to have contempt to show contempt\nFor America that is what it is when you do that okay let's be honest\nYou you will go down to the ground rather than stay standing for the flag and the national anthem is eight is\nOnly to say I have contempt for that flag and the national anthem that is more important for me than a hundred million dollars to causes that I Would agree with\nThat makes perfect sense that's their cause is not pro black their cause is anti America\nThat is true for all of the left the left as I pointed out a thousand times the left around the world loathe America right there is no exception to that liberals are\nDifferent group the left loads America always did she ... ... ... if you're an American leftist you would have to

America oh all of a sudden the left this is no longer a leftist oh I Love America but I agree with everything else on the left her gender\nPlease please don't still don't lie to yourself part of being

an impact on on my on me and my wife\nOr to speak correct English on my wife and me that I actually\nHave written my Tuesday column comes out tomorrow or alone on this subject\nWalked among the things that most\nGo up to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling among these all all of them young mostly males a sales sales people at the if the car\nDealerships it was it was remarkable I asked some truly basic I mean really basic questions and the answer in each case was\nAnd anyway jumping from SUV and I very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way be whatever it is if I'm now as we're having a new experience to having had in a while ago even car dealers him I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do it by Internet or want to know what to do with the you know with car dealers\nWant to give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there were almost all young men with whom I took the test drugs I think in every instance of five I think for four or five five young men but\nThe thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is it all representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered because hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that is you can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the ... of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like ... all I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued why do you need to know what he's being if you could just\nPull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need

passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these ah salespeople again all the young I didn't have any sense of that but they were passionate about cars\nIt was it was they might as well have been working in a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people I'm not ... not a character challenge it's just a statement of a
