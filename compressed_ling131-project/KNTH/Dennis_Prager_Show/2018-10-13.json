of course I Am your host chemical ray\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states infinity\nOn beyond yes indeed\nAnd uh you know we specialize in working with people who are retired are retiring soon so our focus is on retirement planning\nAnd ah we would love to work with you if you are so if you're in that demo as they say and uh so recently barons named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors actually now for the seven year in a row\nAnd I'm very proud of that designation but without our clients I Would be no aware at all so all your clients listening right now thank you so much\nA if you're not a client I encourage you to go to our website that has money matters dot net money matters dot net you can learn more about us we have podcasts of this show you can go back to listen to a we have articles on retirement planning topics we have videos on the same so we have all kinds of stuff on there that I think you can benefit from\nUm this is the part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your\nLabor and we do this because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does it not right on sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts\nLadies and gentleman you don't want to see unhappy squirts that's not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirts anyway this is a time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it ... can you play it\nYou know I\n\nWould say you\nKnow my ... am\n\nAnd of course is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite we don't want that to happen to you so therefore\nEvery week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold\nThe inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and state taxes during that entire time so wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIs in its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create it during your lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will show up on your debt they read the will and it says create the trust so it can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust as what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it will be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and estate taxes why\nWell because for example let's say that uh you know your your daughter gets a divorce\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trial to inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child or not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes and state taxes in in the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generation skipping tax trust because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money has trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support hams H. E. N. S.\nAnd you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind\nTo they're greedy and washed undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest if they are real estate or something like that so talk to your uh financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\nWell\nDorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to one of our our financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you know what go to our website at his money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there Dorothy guess what people will get they will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunks cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip chips made with ... they form and they formed the chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate that melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or does because our our topic drunk\nAnd while you're at it you're learning about your finances man\nTo deal you can find nowhere else to go to our website\nMoney matters a net now on the off chance that maybe cookies or not what you want to go to us that are for although I Would highly recommend it at the semi we're gonna talk about three of the worst enemies you have to your financial well being we're going to talk about inflation\nGoing to talk about income taxes Barry markets we'll also talk about how to calculate your magic number which is a if you have enough money to retire on\nSo that if you come to us instead of going to the home and garden show you're going to get a much better price and you won't have to walk around and have sore feet\nAnd pay for that expensive food [laughter] why does food costs twice as much at home and garden shows and potentially you might have to pay for parking so we're going to talk about\nInsulation today we're going to talk about a special special offer them lists reserved for later\nWe're going to talk about why should insulate now what the insulation is going to do for your home long term effects on your wallet as well as your home your great investment but how can you translate into higher home sales are better prices are less customer actually got\nTwenty thousand dollars more than they were asking on their home and we hit insulated their home less than a year ago [noise]\nSo not that the insulation alone was causing factor but it sure didn't hurt to think about that and then we're going to talk about solar addict fans why this is a good time of year to do it we most think back to ... ... fans is there to remove heat from the attic and it certainly does a good job of debt\nHowever we're going to talk about how they're also removes moisture odors sometimes you have some funky orders in your attic whether you had a critter that died up there or you had a we went to a house that actually had a fire and\nUnfortunately and they had mitigation and they had all of the cleanup there's natural with any kind of incident like this St got everyone in the home was okay but there was still and there's still was at a lingering smoke smell so wouldn't that be a great great cause suicidal addict fan\nSo we're going to talk about all of these things and of course we're going to talk about baffles and why we give them to you for free why do we clear this office so we can get air coming into the house in much more so we're going to talk during the show about all of those things\nGive you a great offered that you can not turn away from [noise]\nAnd then help you get scheduled for your free attic inspection and ultimately get you on a schedule so we can make your house great again this is the energy our my name is Dave brown and we're talking about energy efficiency in your home why does it matter at all [noise]\nWhere do you lose most of your energy in your house is it the walls is it the attic is it the ... we're going to talk about that are so you I'll give you some tax we always talk from a factual based\nA knowledge database here I guess you when you do it so long you become a bit of a nerd which I have over this information but ultimately when you warming you're home during the winter insulation is this thing that's going to take care of keeping your heat in your house now wouldn't you want that to happen\nOr would you want to just do your hard earned money out into the street\nSo insulation is always going to be your first line of defense in terms of keeping your house is he in the house [noise]\nAnd then when you want to keep that heat out of the house insulation again is the same exact answer\nI always try to topic all wave at every show about what our value is now I don't mean oh you are not our values it's are like the letter our values\nAnd then you hear are value thrown around when when you're talking about insulation any type of insulation are that you as always going to be discussed whether it be\nA blown in insulation batting insulation whether it'd be spray from insulation each material has it's different set of our values so let me tell you what the farm means our means resistance resistance to white days\nResistance to the transfer heat so\nWhat that means is if you have a higher our value you resist the entry of heat in the house during the summer months and you resist the eggs and have your heat or the leading up heat from your house during the winter to our values key\nIn every area has its own code that says this is what we deem as the right amount of our bag you have\nSo they get a house can be energy efficient\nSo if you're feeling that maybe your attic is not\nUp to snuff this is the program for you to listen to keep listening it's going to be great show and we're going to give you some special just for being the listener that are ... of the show can take advantage of\nAnd we're also going to give us a very special offer if you plan on going any home and garden shows so stay tuned uh my name is David Brown dust as energy our [noise] and I'm the owner of advice you can visit us at addict\nThat addict buddies dot com where your friends in insulation business a whole motivation is to help you received the most you can for your dollars of course while giving you the maximum protection\nFrom the transfer of heat in and out of your house if we do that then we we really done a good job\nI always like to say that we don't want to do every single house we just want to insulate your house\nSo stay tuned we're going to take a quick break this is the energy our my name's Dave brown and you're listening to the energy our with ag buddies dot com\nYou are listening to the energy out with Dave rouse checkout they've rounded buddies that I'm for low rates on installations lady embarrassed so as as\nCIA\nYour what would you do if you're a he was running all day long why that's easy I call adding buddies addict buddy George loves them\nWelcome back this is a round and this is the energy our what we talk about re embarrassed solar fans addict insulation how we can save money on your energy bills we sat there we have to we\nSee [noise]\nWelcome welcome welcome energy\nWhat a word now energy kind of ... it really involves everything that we do on a daily basis\nNow heat energy is really the robber of our physical bodies right if we get to how we get tired and I know I I get tired when I'm sitting on the heat\nAnd when we in our homes where we supposed to be really the most comfortable it's pretty annoying when our house won't cool down and it's certainly an annoying and the other way around and we can't eat our house sufficiently enough [noise]\nNow this time of year what kind of in that zone where it begins to get cool and\nMay not need your air conditioning as much and you're not quite running the heat and would you be surprised to know that this is the best time to insulate your home\nWell we you could think number one and the prices of insulation are actually more affordable during this time so this should be the peak time for insulation or if we're doing a insulation job on your home this should be the time that you take advantage of the prices number one\nOf the fact that it's actually cooler so you can get more work done and if you want to be kind to the people who are doing the work\nRight but you also gearing your house up and getting ready for the next heavy season so if you do it in the middle of the season you really won't feel the full benefit it's really important that you insulate during this time because\nYou're preparing your home for when it's going to need and use more energy which brings us right back to the song that we heard coming into after the break which is\nEnergy now\nInsulation the properties of it is that it had our value each substance has our that you've now the blown in insulation which is what we use primarily an addict\nHas our value of about a three per inch so you'll see that code is about Thirteen fourteen inches you multiply that Thirteen times three that's going to give you a value of our thirty nine\nThat's like putting on one of the most comfortable downturn feathered blankets on a winter's day oh gosh you feel so comfortable\nOr vice versa it's like putting a shade of trees over you on a hot day it doesn't allow the Senate penetrate and so when you slow down the penetration of the sun into your attic\nInto your house you're cool down your house now what happens with your energy usage and this is where we want to talk about the benefits of how\nYour energy bills go down because it's not fighting your AC unit or ... H fax system is not fighting against this heat it's really a thermostat that is doing all of the [noise] the brain work\nTelling a track system it's getting hot we need to kick in because whoever set the temperature they said it for Seventy two and it's starting to feel like Seventy five so Mr H. back go\nTo work so now if you have more insulation you can give Mr age back arrest and we're we're all kind of\nVeterans of things and break at the most inopportune times isn't it funny how ac units tend to go out when it's the hottest\nCIA [noise]\nMoist damp addict can be a breeding ground for dust mites and mould\nDust mites feed off a mold and dead human skin and they are just horrible creatures to having your attic if you were to install too so addict than based on your square footage of course sometimes only one\nYou would see it drastically reduced chance of getting mode and your addict addict buddies eight three to four or five eight four zero three six for free estimate welcome\nBack this is a round and this is the energy our what we talked about re embarrass solar fans out against ... how we can save money on your energy bills week after week after week [noise]\nThank you please thank you thank you [noise]\nThank you [noise]\nWelcome welcome welcome back this is Dave brown I Am the energy our host and it seems like they're applauding all of the special rates that we announced only for the listeners\nSurgery just tuning in we've been talking about a special rate on insulation I'm and we're going to give away some more free stuff but you got to listen to the program to get all of the benefits now the first thing we talked about was\nEnergy efficiency we tried to educate your hours trying to give you a nice framework on white different things to do and why you really need them\nAnd then I go into the details of how it really really works\nAfter that then I give you an opportunity to take advantage of some really great specials that white chicks kind of an hour to really build up all this information and then allow you to take part of the things that you think would benefit you the most\nSo we talked about bone and insulation a special rate of Ninety sent a square foot four by the way we used John Mannes insulation that type of al ... an anti asthmatic it's the best product on the market\nI've seen other products and it's just not as good as John man but product\nSo we use that blown in product we also do some really value added things that really help you along the way with the free baffles and we clear yourself it then so that keeps breathing\nNow once we've done all day and we insulated the attic and we have\nAir rated it and let let the air come in more\nNow what we want to talk about is adding some active air flow at the Airflow what are you talking about days active Aslam is\nThe installation I'm a solar addict fan so why should I Do that Dave well I'll tell ya [noise] ridge advance just are not enough ... will allow air flow to come out at a very slow rate\nMaybe fifty sixty cubic feet per minute and it just doesn't keep up with the pace of the heat builds up and yet even during the cold months so you want to\nIntroduce active air flow now if you have a really steep proof you probably won't need an active Aslam as much because this deeper the root for the greater the draw kind of like a woodstove when you have a longer\nPipe you get more air coming through that woodstove and sort of fire burns higher right so advocates the same way if you have a steeper roof you have a lot more draw it coming through the attic so in that case if it's super steep you probably won't need an active air flow [noise] but most homes\nIn this region have shallow roof pitches and if they have shallow\nRoof pitches then there's nowhere for the heat to go and that ridge bent that's pulling air at about fifty cubic feet is no match for the Ames credibly powerful dirty wide Remington so addicts and pulls at Fifteen hundred and fifty Cuba be permitted oh my God\n[laughter] that's just so much that night and day\nSo you you've ever sat in front of a fan on a hot day and how good that feels but when you've been hot and you sit down and you get a nice breeze come across\nWell that's exactly what you'd be doing when you add a so erratic than that you're adding active Airflow so can you imagine how your age fax system is gonna really love it now\nYou know imagine when they age back at the age back system could talk what would it say\nI have a feeling and have a deep voice and it probably be like hey you may believe me up and it had to go all the time I'm ... that's just my rendition of what what what age back good sound like [noise]\nAnd jokes aside anything that's it's an environment and it breaks down much more quickly\nSo just just imagine if H back was human and how much it would love the idea of you adding one or two so addict fans just to cool down environment it would feel exactly how you feel on a hot day and then you feel that nice cool breeze it would feel relief\nSomething let me tell you exactly how this works\nThe so erratic fan takes energy from the sun converts it to electricity and turns of fan that sucks the air out of your attic it brings it in dues soft advance I remember when we talked about those free baffles that we were going to put into your attic\nWell that's where they come in handy they come into play I should say they allow that air to continue to flow all the way up to the soul addict fans which is sucking air do at Fifteen hundred and fifty cubic feet per minute and if you have to that's three thousand thirty one hundred cubic feet per minute\nPulling air through your attic\nCooling the air in the attic extending even further the life of the age ... system cooling down the interior of the attic therefore the heat transfer does not happen as much through your installation\nAnd ... and a layman of your roof doesn't get baked all day long\n[noise] it is a God powered which I Love to using that term\nSo that you don't pay for the electricity every month like a wired band it's also lifetime warranties and it comes with a built in thirty percent federal tax credit so therefore\nThirty percent of the price of the fan is given back to you in the form of cash\nAnd that's not a good deal I don't know one\nBut I Want to make it a lot more clear let's talk about the fan itself it's Eighteen by Eighteen all the way around Eighteen Inches by Eighteen Inches\nAnd it has a fourteen inch diameter hall so you have a four inches a flash in all the way around these are leak proof\nThey go under a layer of shingles in on top of the other layer so they really act as another layer of shingles to keep the water\nFrom coming into your attic and of course when the ag buddies crew install them we do a use clocking silicone so that we actually have another layer of protection so that you don't have to worry about that as possibly being a problem\nSo we talked about thirty watch all the fans Fifteen hundred fifty cubic feet committed an error getting sucked into yeah addict cooling down the addict\nI'm at the rate of Fifteen hundred square foot per hour so you're turning over that air right when you do that you reduce the chances of mold and moisture [noise]\nIt has a beautiful censored ... into the attic and reads the true temperature not the surface temperature 'cause it's always going to be had at the surface\nBut it's going to be a nice little dangling sensors hanging in your attic so that it reads humidity and temperature so humid if the humidity or rises above Seventy five percent it kicks on the fan if the temperature rises above eighty five degrees which is almost every day\nThe fan kicks on\nThat's the kind of real protection you went in your headache now once you do that here's what we want to to you just as an added value\nThis solar addict fan installed is traditionally in regularly nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars okay it's not going to be that much\nWe're going to take off a actually two hundred dollars so it's going to cost you seven hundred and Ninety nine dollars installed but don't forget you're going to get to thirty percent federal tax credit so that's going to take on another additional two hundred and some odd dollars that haven't done the math\nSo you're talking about is just a little bit about five hundred dollars per fan\nAnd that's of value that you really can't say no to and if that is not enough we have instituted in New service that we wanted to unveil right now we're going to blow your roof off of pine needles\nAnd lead\nIf we're already up they're installing solar fans why wouldn't we then turn on our blower\nAnd blow off all of the debris deck and first of all cause leaks in your roof debris on your roof cause so much problems and this is the season where you're going to have more of it\nSo the value of that is normally typically we charge ten cents per square foot so now you can just call us if you weren't roof blowing will be happy to do it it's ten cents per square foot\nAnd many of your roof area is going to be a lot larger than the addicts or yard attic is Fifteen hundred square feet your roof could be about the thousand square feet\n\nWe build an offer free when you get to a more fans installed so how's that I mean that's a real good offer [noise] uh if you combine that with all the other offers the insulation if you get the insulation and the solar fans you're talking about a almost a thousand dollars off whatever services that we're offering\nAre righty on down with that we're gonna talk now about radiant barrier radium Barry is\nIt is the third punch in the one two three punch you ever watch a good boxer right they they usually do the right across the jab to write cross them up All right\nWe'll call this the upper ... and then of course of a cat is not meant for you it's meant for the sun right so we're not talking about one two three ... going to knock out the sun and if we knock out the sun we are really were protecting us from like you know this is like giving your home a big hug\n'em and if you really love yourself you tend to be home if you love your country and your family you tend to love your home it goes hand in hand I'm so these products are expressions of love\nFor your house\nInsulation if you have your house properly insulated if you've got A L E D lights where they need to be your shall we love to your house or you've got your home airtight as much as it can possibly be you're you're showing love for your home\nYou're showing look through the HPV access to your show in love for yourself you're showing love for your investments\nAnd you know I work pretty hard for the things that I have accumulated over the years um they don't necessarily make my whole life but if I'm going to buy something and let him take care of it right [noise] so we're talking about another way to take care of beer with radiant\nFor you know some companies use the spray on radium barrier addict but he does the green company so we stick with products that warm harm your health there no off gassing or any problems that might occur if you were to breathe\nIn ah the material right\nSo for that we don't abide by the spray on ready to embarrass we use attack on radio point the radiant ...\nHas a Ninety seven percent effective rate versus the eighty five percent rate that you would get from a spray now here's the downfall of the spray the spray on is human dependent so\nIf that person is in the attic and just as feeling lazy that day\nAnd they don't want to fully cover\nThe wall the decorating well then\nYou're not going to have a fully covered addict will you the beauty of the radio for is that you cannot get away with ... or ... um\n[noise] I'm trying to think of a polite way to say it but doing it half\nA half behind jobs [laughter] right family show so we'll we'll talk into\nIs that everybody can listen [noise] she can't get away with that with the radio for him so we're talking about a product that is going to be more effective and you can't cheat in any single way\nAnd and it doesn't give off any gases or anything the super tough durable um radiant for oil you know it looks like so before but it's not\nCheap like that it's really really durable I mean you can't rip it with your hands [noise] it would take a you know an act of Congress to poke a hole in this thing and then of course you'd have to have it have to be something super super sharp we have to use razor blade to to cut sheets and then we install them right on\nThe um [noise]\nThe ceiling Joyce so that the whole entire interior of the addict is covered whereas when you see them spray those Joyce never get sprayed just in between\nThe Joyce\nSo with that being a a an issue you're\nReally not getting your money's worth with the ... and you're getting a product that can harm you and your pet to send your children and\nSo that's why we chose the radiant foreign [noise] it's a lot harder on us ducking promise you we can move probably at the rate of about two hundred three hundred square foot per hour so could be a multi day job on some addicts\nSome addicts don't need it to be quite honest I'm not ... it's really\nAn assessment case by case thing right so not every addict needs it so we only recommend it to people they need it and he was a little secret uh I'll tell you a secret if you're not going to live in your house forever [noise]\nMaybe you don't want to spend the money on the radio bear a lot of people will tell you that\nIf you say you need it they will do it I think that that is not in your best interest and I think\nThat's not good there's\nSome of\nThat in mind and the whole goal of\nHelping you increase the value of your home we have to do and bound to do what is in your best interests so\nIt doesn't mean no one should get it because we are just recently did a job in a house that really couldn't get any other protection and this was different for homes all the conditions were right and then we said hey why don't we rainy and Barry this particular area it'd be an attic\nAnd then to add if we can take care of that was so addict fans and\nIt did the job it did the job they immediately the comfort level increased um the room that was hot it was now not hide anymore it was neighboring a side addict and we also put some um some batting up on the wall\n\nAnd a whole entire house felt immediately better [noise] and we love it when we get those reports are so here's what we charge for the radiant barrier for\nAll right it is two dollars and fifty cent a square foot [noise]\nAnd it is a little bit more expensive than a spray on 'em at the same time the value is much higher with the tack on and if you're going to do something you you're probably want to do it right so it's two dollars and fifty cents square foot was attack on us\nAnd more than be sent to add that to a proper insulated attic\nA similar addict fans\nRight and you have your roof thrown off because you don't have any potential fire or any leaks that can occur from needle pine needles or to breathe so forth\nYou really major household again and this is really important thing to do in the off season and the season when it's not burning up\nBecause the prices the labor\nAnd all of the benefits are going to be much more affordable right so let's go back and look at everything that we talked about so we started out learning about our values our value is the resistance to the transfer of heat we want to keep it out during the summer we went to keep it in during the winter\nWe talked about how ah we can add our values and what it does to the different devices that you have in your house how it extend the life of a life of age ... system how it extends the roof [noise] the under ... I've seen roof that looked like\nA you know like a a a ripples\nOr Russell's potato chip\n[laughter]\nYou don't want to have a ruffles potato chip roof\nOkay so we talked about that and then we talked about some of the great special that you get when we come out for a free estimate with data base number one you're going to get a free estimates Richard the first whole idea of it all nine descended

the attic so your cooling dang addict you're extending the life of all of the wonderful things that you play stuff in there\nOkay so we're the last thing we talked about is the special home and garden

us today\nJoining me as always is my great friend director restructure development\nAnd top instructor down they trade is everyone\nTo be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure but I\nLarry out here and Larry first question for you is how the heck are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing I'm doing wonderful\nExcited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun are doing this show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get\nYou know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to\nHow to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I and I know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets whether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down with the market's going sideways and\nAnd that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that and we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things where I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really for going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach at stake last year it on a training academy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to be down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well that's so bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased\nAs markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd ... it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now or to help people become more consistent than less directional independent inside of the market\nWill just last week it's been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wished that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you can actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling in the market\nAs opposed to most people who buy the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do I'm gonna lose money to wow I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing with the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money when the markets go up down sideways and with a lot of our students see and we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you buy learn how to trade in more than just one direction\nYeah and when you look at even the difference between let's even just say a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and their mutual fund\nIs generally just investing into a long position and they called a mutual funds because it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money is the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful and that that product has never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those funds are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved there to be invested into that fund you look at the hedge funds type strategy and and that word hedge is pretty critical because\nHedge is meaning that there is a position that process on the way up and there's also protection or even a position to could profit on the way down now so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down on the sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of like that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways\nAnd you're one of the things I talked about one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't imagine if you went to work and they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think he'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a you know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bolus direction anytime the market's going sideways or retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the markets are going down our retirement account or income account as is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down but what are the things that we can do is always okay with you every one of the things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away\nAnd we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that our to our half the class is what do you say let's do it\nAll right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area that have take classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways now they have their classes about three hours long\nIf you would have set up passes through these half day classes that is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time any financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sound like a good investment\nTo me on just a second you're gonna have a chance to win instead of these passes or one of the happy classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over included with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause centered twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at Houston ... dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of the ... consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market's going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you could always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the market's going somewhere either go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here is it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short a bond short gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down to a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply Shorty in the market now that imagine that we just have a little piece of I'm not going to be greedy right you know but if you start to learn how to trade like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later but\nOne of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse you're going to go in a lot of circles adventure\nIt there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirect chili ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life\nThere's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook\nClass right the law to check but I just dated myself but it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals truly guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions they say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that that's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the\nNumber is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up in Houston ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we are kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that\nThat that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start\nPeople off with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and with ... once said as you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly well sent out at all in fact most of them are instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right but don't want to do that because we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart well that's not how people who make a lot of money I think\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent no\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and said about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you may get a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income\nBut if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nIs going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses\nSo a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that's simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself and hopefully we'll listening right now and see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money out of the gate and just you know I Want to\nI Want to take this dollar turned into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay that's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up as it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness in any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to at first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick program\nThen half the cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nAlso said to add to that because I Love where you're going you also can't be someone who doesn't take action\nYou don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not coach of all those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill that can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nYeah if you're looking to build some skills in the financial market and learn how to generate a greater source of income\nAnd you're willing to put in the time as Larry says well then I think you may be our next caller to win a set of these passes but first I've got to get Larry submission to give away let's do it All right we're right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that extra source of income really build out those multiple streams of income side of the financial markets\nAnd it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of these passes to have to class gets phones ready if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit and this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons

you've dreamed of learned more visitors on line at Houston O T H ... that's Houston O T H ...\n[noise] you are listening to powers trading radio show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director instructor development and half instructor it online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of income we talked a little bit about\nPassive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago leery about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm going to practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying\nNow unfortunately it ends up being that same ... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in the segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it was a slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck when we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight in the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they could do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "13"}
