Americanized if it's just that you have to come to an appreciation of what we have here\nSo if this was a seminal moment when I realized because I knew Jewish history so well again I I had been teaching and I'm a college level and wrote two books on it and I realized how unique unique not rare unique America was\nIn Jewish history and everybody else's history because it didn't matter that I was a Jew and I was a young guy my twenties joined it was very small city them semi Valley California it's Rotary Club the only Jew there it didn't mean to sing\nIt was just it was Dennis ... and they

flight to the moon\n... one of the central moments was planting the American flag on the moon and it's not in the movie it gives you an idea of the the way in which Hollywood generally loads this

you congratulations on your book back when you ... the subtitle is deceiving America's enemies with no apologies you're referring to domestic and foreign\nThat yes so it's a it's kind of two parts of the analysis\nOf all the threat we face right now Russia China ISIS and so forth and then into ... what I call vignettes\nOf great American heroes to instill enough and understanding of what we stand

reported because I a lot of my listeners knew this you may even know this but I did one of my cold was brokers to buy attention\nThat the American astronaut Scott Kelly is his name yeah cited Winston Churchill that there should be a ... in in victory there should be magnanimity and he was he was widely criticized attack\nFor siting Winston Churchill the latest in the great people deposed by the left for being racist et cetera\nAnd I I actually treated a response ... because if this was absolutely one fish\nMay have been a very brave man but a to try and attack the president with a quote from Churchill and then given to surrender to the slow flakes when they called Churchill a racist and I bought him into the\nWhite fish gender privilege sorry if there's anybody who was the man of the century\nIt was Winston Churchill Winston Churchill who in the wilderness in the Nineteen fifties was telling everybody the threat that fascism and it represented and then who who stood alone on the night to the island in the face of\nThe ... convinced America to no longer maintain an isolationist stuff and we have an American astronauts apologizing for Winston Churchill and his helping to save the Judeo Christian civilization ... these are the stakes involved in in next month's election Dennis\nMiller kidding divide the way I I tend not to ... I almost never make a prognosis that I'm not making one now but would you do you feel comfortable and making one or what do you think will happen\n[noise] um I I don't\nDo 'em predictions but I I listen to those who have a very good track record [laughter] very few so President Trump's victory in sixteen but one of them was Larry Schweich out\nUm and and I've been texting back and forth to Larry Larry says not only do we gained seats in the Senate we might gain seats in the house is Larry Larry ... is is is optimistic ...\nThat is look at what happened in sixteen the mainstream set Hillary has it in the cat on\nA New York times Huffington Post set Ninety five percent chance of victory and what happened a silent majority trounced or\nIn the last year and a half how could it possibly be\nThat the silent majority hasn't grown just for economic reasons alone let alone the fact that looked at the statistics for African Americans that approval rating of the president has doubled in just the last year so how could the result not be better I find that hard to imagine all\nThe uh what I I heard about the black Americans vote was a ... he he may get a about twenty five percent which is that where the case that would end any democratic chances\nYeah if if I've seen figures as up to thirty\nPercent uh it's it's stunning and indeed what happened last week with Kanye and and the White House and how the quote unquote mainstream media came out of the woodshed and its most bigoted hateful fire shell\nMinstrel show event you know liquid for why you need to grow yes and the new light\nDoesn't read rifles he puts on a red might have looked for institutionalized racism and you'll find it on the left today\nThat that is exactly right so right now do you think this is by sixty four thousand dollar question and I I ask that last hour of my listeners\nDo you believe in a ... and I'll have to ask us I asked myself no wishful thinking here Mm okay this is not what we're doing okay All right not what we want but what do you think do you believe that there will be or we have reached\nA tipping point where the left will simply do something so egregious I think the capital humans would be that example but others would differ\nWhat do you believe we have hit one or we'll get one or will never hit one that is the proverbial lobster or frog being boil do doesn't even though he's being boiled alive what do you think\nI think it's already happened I think the fact that we don't talk about James Hodgkinson every single day and that most American have most Americans have no idea who James Hodgkinson this let's remember that the Steve ... was almost killed by a man who took a rifle in my hand go\nTo a Republican majority baseball practice session but when he was killed by those three brave kept to police officers what did they find on his body\nThey found a hit list they list of solely Republican congressmen that this individual was going to assassinate the stunning that you know we forget all the people who are on that field\nFried butter on post hey Jeff Place so maybe my question wasn't clear I Know that there will be individuals who was tipped over right is there a point where Americans non left wing Americans\nYeah we'll have their tipping point and say oh oh oh the last ... really is dangerous\n[noise] [noise] oh it's happened I think it's happened and I don't think it's wishful thinking I just look at the social media and in the last three weeks with a capital hearing I I was in Manhattan last week for the for the launch of why we fight\nAnd an older couple recognize me as I was waiting to get on the train back to D.C and they came up to me and they said we're just quite people living our lives in in in Trenton New Jersey but we've had enough where we're going to vote we're going to support down ticket Republicans because what they did to the godly man\nThat that absolutely you know right just individual was truly filthy and disgusting so yes I think we have reached the tipping point when you have\n... senators like Feinstein like book or like a Kamala Harris impugn the reputation of a man who who is wider than the driven snow I think we've already arrived us\nWell they would say yes that's the problem use whiter than the driven snow [laughter] that's how sick it's become that that that's probably a ... a a a phrase that will be renounced but yes so you think ... so I Want to get this clear you think that\nI Do too I think that for a not for all Americans but for a very significant number of the Kavanaugh hearings worth tipping point to say the left and the Democrats have gone too far so that it that is your position\nIf if you if you're on the middle ... who's sitting in some ivory tower and being brainwashed every day if you're just an average American and you look at the first five minutes of the cabinet hearing\nYou've had enough I mean ... that was righteous indignation power excellence and I think that's the capitalist\nWell that's the hope that I so want to fight of ask you this prior to the cabin or hearing do you think that there was a tipping point before or you really do believe that's the key one\nNo I I I didn't I didn't see before ice\nWhile so this is dramatic to you what happened\nOh my gosh I looked as if it's in it's in the it's the last chapter in my book it's with a good chambers and I I didn't know what was going to happen with Kavanaugh but afterwards I said my gosh we need to wake up because this is a new mission shock anybody\nThis isn't just book this isn't just parents taught us they've been doing the left has been doing this since Nineteen food\nWriter what you're saying is America oh there are millions of Whittaker Chambers right now\nThat are waking up yeah OK\nFrom your emails to God's Ears anyway from your from his pen to your mind Sebastian Gorka is book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies it is up and Dennis prayer dot com\nWe continue the dentist Prager show\nThe list this president I'll tell you another thing that the Kavanaugh hearing revealed to me although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation but\nA confirmation I should say more than anything else and this will really shocked a lot of people who loads of man I think he has a good heart Donald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what drives the left and say and they will never believe it whether it's\nInviting the survivors the victims of the Parkland shooting to the west wing to talk to them or or whether it's holding the hand of that the African American grandmother whose son had been killed\n... this is who he is and and the shocking thing that I can tell because I worked for him and I you know I write down the influences and and why we fight us the evidence of this he he is compassionate\nTo you as an American whether you voted for him or not he doesn't care he doesn't see skin color you don't see party affiliation if you're an American you deserve to be safe\nAnd to do this to prosper and fat a friend who never going to be alive by the hardcore left\nFinally a in why we fight your\nBook and again it is up a dentist Prager dot com my friends and you ... if it's Sebastian Gorka eroded it's pretty self recommending [laughter] but I I have been saying for years\nAnd I think I was one of the first and I'm not saying this to brag I'm ... I'm seeing it because it's now become common place or more so in any event that we are in a civil war how do you react to that\n[noise] [noise] coming from people who lived through war my parents as children lived on the mobs of your patients and my father was tortured imprisoned by the communists [noise]\nI I find it difficult to use that phrase and I also remember that the ... the great this

Bullock\nAgain I I respect that so I was using shorthand my listeners Bill White I've almost always add and thank God it's non violent right so if I attached that adjective\nAnd I and without not okay I was just getting away with only agree with you because it gives you feel polite I really want to know what you're saying\nNo ... without a doubt when you have the eating members of a two party
