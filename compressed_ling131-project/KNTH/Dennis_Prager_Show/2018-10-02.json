question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... for you and I and\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old the where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at ... university\nIs unanimous wanna find human being family man community man this person has been and then uh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same trucks\nOK I Would ignore them\n\nAnd it's clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school\n\nSo that's the question that's the it's in how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\nNot not not a thirty about twenty five but in high school\n\nOne ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow\nI don't have I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy and high school I had a lead an anti cheating on tests campaign that was elected the graduating class president I I was a bird was a good guy basically but I'm I'm\nSure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think is a possibility or in the case of Brett Kavanaugh but happen or not happen [laughter]\nThey ah they were kids in in high school who were uh near new wells and who ended up fantastic adults\nSo ...\nWho cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act in high school I acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five\nThat's a separate issue you you because you you want to form a good person as early as possible I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWhat how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nOne aide Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business who knew what a terrific person misses and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you ah you you robbed a a candy store right that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot not simply shop lifted some candy bars but did you threaten the owner and and you rub it\nBut it is obvious you turn your life around or otherwise what is what one is saying is\nPeople cannot turn their lives around we will at no point to acknowledge that you're turning your life around\nThat's far religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity is so rooted in the importance\nOf penance of forgiveness\nOf tissue vi in in in the Hebrew of of return or that's repentance\n\nThere's this famous Hebrew statement that\nI'm ... I'm literally translated from the Hebrew where a Pennington stands\nThe most righteous person cannot stand you were a higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turn their life around and it's been good the whole time\nThat's how that's how and and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass\nAgainst us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people sins and forgiveness\nAnd uh the uh Judaism holiest days the day of of a panic tense day of atonement Yom Kippur so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorsed the notion that when you are already in middle age and the lead a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd ... where's your cutting cutting off line is el is elementary school\nRight well you know elementary school well yeah but that's what people said until recently about high school\nOr when a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis\nPrager I gotta I\n[noise] well I guess\nI could just tell you a little story um I was a high school through college uh yeah I did go live in California there the whole thing whole party scene drugs and you know pot and coke and everything\nAnd uh was later lasted for a dealing and went to jail\nAnd uh it was kinda funny 'cause when I before I got you know for you got to that site on your side to get away from that and it was easy and uh when I pulled away and pulled out and I kind of caught at the last second kind of a deal and uh all that\nAnd said you know about five six years and I like that for them or just impossible and very difficult thing\nBut you know work hard and you know turned my life around with and I've been married for twenty five years I've raised three great kids uh one's graduated from college works for major tech company one is a prime your last or the other one is just a sophomore in college\nYeah so I was in Iraq you're perfect living example\nOf what I'm Talking about the dentist Springer show from the relief factor for you\nOkay\nSharon in Dallas either Sharon\nHi how are you real well thank you\nGood [laughter] okay so I'm On on the same page that never stops creating and um I had five boys seven of them were really good in high school some of them I prayed making close to God\nAll of them would be\nGreat jacket so you know I I think it's you know the big lie in the media\nPrincess shattering thing isn't it if it doesn't matter how you've led a full adult life that's what's being that in the United states of America\nThen I work at a school and I was so sad when people see I just even young kids\nI was like these kids are going to be good you know I think I'm just be a good parent and do the best they can and you know ... got in there and you got it right\nI think it usually does thank you I contended for many years that my mother\nCouldn't believe I didn't end up in prison\n[noise]\n... you have no idea how often when I was in elementary school she ... she she thought I was going to end up at J. D. that was the term in those days as Sean you ever hear the term J. D.\nNo right if they if they die it's a very interesting\nJuvenile delinquent not a doctor or a jurisprudence\nSay be that's what she thought I ended up at J. D. why don't you think I Would end up at jail because they didn't do any homework\nAnd if they want to work in high school either too busy uh learning about life including teaching myself how to conduct which turned out well\nBut you don't you don't know you just gotta you gotta you gotta strive you got to work on your kids and then you don't know what's gonna happen but in retrospect you've

good life\nIn comparison to almost any other person\nDoesn't matter what happened in high school but the question\nWould it matter to you and hiring somebody ever again I I Am\nVery clear in my belief about this it says if it does it means there is no such thing as being able to turn your life around\n\nNow if you were going to hire a guy at Twenty one and charges were made about Seventeen that's a different story that was four years earlier you don't know that the person has turned his or her life around 'cause they didn't have a life\nTo live there for years but when they have thirty six years
