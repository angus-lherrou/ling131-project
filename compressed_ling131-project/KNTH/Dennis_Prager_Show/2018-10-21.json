questions or genocide that mission retirement dot com you might answer one of the questions on an upcoming shall we gotta get questions doubts that are you ready\nI'm ready to go to like a game on today less than our first question kind of a certain gab in great way she says I'm really enjoying my dad right now as it for a ... but I Know cutting up on my Social Security benefits I make decent money and I would still like him pull my Social Security is stats possible\nAnd I am about six months some turning sixty sex what do you think should I start the paper work out\nWell do you have this what I tell ya I first of all the window of time is three months prior to when you when a poll and have your benefit starch so if you're six months out I Would ask you would it make a dramatic difference financially to you if you waited three more months and then file\nThat three months prior so in other words if you do now you're going to be going to be six months prior to when your full retirement age as him and that's when you would not have to incur a reduction I just would think that if you could wait another six months but what I'm trying to say is how free much prior to when you what your benefits start and I think you'd be\nSpot on because then you wouldn't be incurring ridicule which is going to last\nFor as long as you receive Social Security so I don't think I mean you you got that like in the tunnel you can see the finish line I Would say\nMy goodness unless it's just a a dramatic difference which is not just so you know I'm ... I mean because you're talking about dollars just a few less than ten dollars a different uh waiting\nThree months of what you're talking about for the six months so I Would say hang in there girl you get a job because you're doing a lot better job than those people do because there is a a dramatic difference between how many people style for Social Security\nWhen they first get their benefits which is sixty two\nVersus your full retirement age which in this case for her and most people is a ... a six oh hanging there Dave I think you're almost there but I Would definitely wait to your age sixty six and then file three much part of that\nAnd why are you filing three months prior\nBecause that's what the government recommends for them to get their paperwork together so that the benefits would start at that particular time\nOkay so that's a good just roll or something for everyone and\nYeah that's that's that's whenever you know whenever you want your Social Security benefits to start then file for much prior now that also applies to I just if why I Am inside bar a for Medicare to so a lot of people they may work has sixty five but they may want to\nFile for their Medicare benefits are the only reason why you wouldn't is if you have benefits at your work at your employer that would allow you not to have to file for Medicare but those are the two areas Medicare\nAnd Social Security where you wanna fall free much prior to when you went to benefit start if\nAnd if you want more information how Social Security plays a bigger role in to the overall retirement strategy she's going to have when she steps away from her job as a professor you walk your clients through you put it all together kind of like a puzzle\nYeah because we have software that does all the heavy lifting and just another side bar thing is whenever you\nAre gonna pull Social Security benefits prior to your full retirement age\nYou can only make a certain amount of money or is it going to take either a dollar or a dollar for every two dollars or a dollar for every three dollars so it just depends on when you're going to be filing and were that land you into how far you are close you are to your full retirement Social Security eight so\nAgain yeah we have a lot of calls and for Social Security because so convoluted so in in my opinion when I to my workshop I tell people that I think the government has purposely made this confusing so that\nPeople make mistakes and when the stakes it costs them money so yeah we can help people with that we do it all the time\nAnd you know we're on the subject we're dead we're talking about Social Security and what is Social Security you know it's just a privilege that you're able to get your fair share like contributing to the system as long as you've been working and that's a snapshot last thirty five years and that you\nQualified for ten years or four corners so it's about cash isn't it it's about it's about supplementing your lifestyle in retirement that's what it's all about it's about cash flow\nBecause it serves as the lifeblood of yours in my retirement existence it's about the distribution of your wealth back\nIt isn't it I mean let's call it what it is what will your retirement vision is my question to you will your retirement vision be returned reality and we're prepared here just from Hopkins associates to help you with that vision right now if that's of interest to you you can give me call my name is Joseph ... got almost thirty nine years of experience you reach me up one eight hundred\nNine to five three one three six again this one eight hundred nine to five three one three six\nAnd you can find Ghana stuff online as well mission retirement ... Khan is the website\nRemember that's where you can submit your questions for jealous that if you have a retirement question no question about your finances or even saving for retirement he can help you I Want to make sure you have the phone number\nIs eight hundred nine to five three one three sex and submit those questions to the website at mission retirement dot com here's a question that came in from Ron in sync a ranch and he says that\nI recently retired I moved from Arizona to Texas I could be closer to my children and grandchildren welcome run [laughter]\nAnd he says I'm a little nervous moving my money over from my previous jobs for all and K and if you out of retirement accounts because of taxes I wondered is it okay to keep them where they are or should I Try and move them what do you think I should do\nWe get this luck but Ron there's no there's nothing says you can't move your money or not move your money and keep it where it's at a we have a little sane and industry and that is\nIf you're no longer with your last job either should your money and frankly\nYou're just a an accounting burden to them they'd rather you move your money someplace else out so I always tell people this in my worst shops and also in the radio that you know you only have a certain amount of choices you know four one K. as far as where you can allocate your money in about a third of and we see\nAre in target funds and there's nothing wrong target funds is just that a third of monopolized by target fund so you know it's just a matter of\nWhat you want your money to do for you if you want a just an endless amount of choices than we were a command that you transition your four one K. for three before with four fifty seven money into an IRA self directed and then you have\nEndless amounts of choices I mean hundreds of thousands if you would than just having a in this little\nBox that you have choices which you're four one K. few it and then as far as your ... you know it if it's a big brokerage house from it it's it's no big deal the reason why a lot of people when they do transition into Texas from another state if you would is like the opportunity the convenience of being able to sit down with someone that's\nFairly close to them that this the privilege of having somebody that maybe in your neighborhood that uh you don't have to call one eight hundred help or one eight hundred Joe or whoever your\nLast broker advisor was so that's the advantage to consolidate maybe that might be a good idea now that you have moved in your when you get close your grandchildren you want to concentrate on them and you don't want to have like a scarecrow um where you're like that in the wizard of Oz where his strong throw it all over the place you're Charles everywhere [noise] bring it all in\nAnd we see that a lot of people like to do that as well but you know and there's nothing that says you can't keep your money where it's at\nThe only reason I'd tell anybody and I'll put to carry out on that is the only reason I promote anybody not\nTo move their money from a four O. one K. into an irate\nIs if you need to borrow the money but then what we find Megan has a lot of companies if you're no longer with the company they don't even let you borrow from any way and just so you know you will pay the interest rate on that loan\nIf that'd be the case 'cause it's by law that they have to do that but that would be the only reason I Hope that helps Ron as far as maybe an opportunity to consolidate but there's no reason why you can't keep your money where it's at if you wanted to\nGet that I think that's terrific advice especially in today's environment where we see people job hopping a lot more than we used to do you remember friends and family who used to start at a company and then they retired they got the gold watch after Thirty years at that job that happened that much any more people move jobs a lot\nNo you're absolutely right you know when you're describing my dad to the to the tea\nOr he'll be gone I'm six years this November but he retired from General Electric Detrow forty two years and he worked himself up out of the navy up through the warehouse and into sales and he was there for\nA zillion years is my son says and and he did retire with a gold watch matter of fact ah I Am the benefactor of that that watched that still in my\nIn my um drawers home but long story short yeah that's going to be in the history books for for most of our youth hearing somebody it's going to be able to stay around that long even the even the oil and gas which has been you know a great staples for so many people\nIt's a lot of turnover in our industry or in in the Houston area so we got plenty of clients that are in that exact position they were expecting to stay for a long time\nBut unfortunately with the ... you know what the transit that we deal with today that that they ah you know they're twenty plus years into it and then they are shown the door so that's unfortunately unfortunately uh for the industry but yeah you're so right just like pensions\nAnd if you just take the time is this is what I tell people in the workshop west westward I say\nPlease don't let me care more about your financial future than you do and if you are that person if you do care I'd be more than happy to help you you can reach me right now my name's Joseph ... it's one eight hundred nine to five three one three six you can get a hold of me one eight hundred nine to five three one precincts\nThe website is mission retirement dot com you've

mission retirement\nDot com Joshua writes you from Richmond here's this question\nHere's his question jumps and he says I currently work with an employer where I contribute to a four O. one K. while still working can I take my four oh one K. and transfer it to my life insurance\nNormally no and the reason why is because a four O. one K. A. is qualified sons and that means you had\nNot paid any taxes on it because you were able to contribute those funds pre tax through your payroll now if you're over fifty nine and a half years young then you can roll it out you can transfer it\nTo a traditional i._r._a. with out incurring the ten percent penalty by the Irish so I'm assuming that Joshua ... is over fifty nine\nAnd a half or it wouldn't make a zero sense for you to do anything with the money because remember that not only in hiring the ten percent penalty\nFrom the Irish but you're also having to incur whatever tax bracket taxation that you're in that particular year so for example if someone is say in a twenty percent tax bracket\nAnd they were younger than fifty nine and a half dozen there and getting for thirty percent taxation our withdrawal of those funds or before you see Seventy percent of what you own and that is not good in prudent and by ... in in anybody's book in in my opinion so\nAlso life insurance it doesn't allow qualified and money to go in and it come out tax rate the government is not going to let that much about a transition from a to Z to happen so any money going into a life insurance product normally has to be non qualified funds meeting after tax dollars to come out\nTax free because anybody comes out of a life insurance product it's tax free so it's kinda like when we can use those products just ... and we do this for some of our heart networks clients is we use life insurance as an asset class\nNow he's kind of scratch your head on that well what does he mean by that is because you can contribute a certain amount in a life insurance products in it and if as long as you don't ... it is called a modified and down the contract and that acronym is Mick if you don't create a Mac than anything you put into a life insurance product\nWhatever funds come out whether it be alone or a death benefit or men's in in a lot of our cases a long term care features benefits come out and all that money comes out tax free but the government's not going to let you put a hundred percent\nTaxable money for it to come out tax free so hopefully that'll help or Joshua ... know normally it's not going to be the case where you can take\nNow there are situations where you can slowly take money out of four I'm Kate pay the taxes on it and then put in that product there's some people do that but that's just you know then you're talking about a lot of extreme and in a lot of people are willing to go through that accounting nightmare so to speak you know\nIt it it's about planning that that's what Josh was trying to do is trying to plan maybe for a an advantage that he might have in his favor in retirement planning you know it's the process\nOf identifying your long term income\nDetermining your intended lifestyle which a lot of people you have that in your mind\nAnd defining how to ... see that's where a lot of people don't they they like the idea of what lifestyle they might have but they have no idea how they're going to reach it\nHave you define how you reach retirement goals and if not I would ask you I'm going to say it ... ... and do something about it right now while you have somebody of industry that in your favor this one next in his ... to donate this time\nTo help you if I can help you I'm I'll tell you what's in the first

provide would be greatly appreciate it\nSure it will you know I this is not an area of expertise for me but I Do have associates in other areas\nAlong the way whether it be tax whether it be four wheels and trust and this is another area where we reach out to her associates in what I've found enough education to know to be dangerous I guess is I always try to direct people to look at the F\nAnd the G Plan now G stands for good in my book this I'm just trying to make sense simply a things that I can remember so gee stands for good\nF stands for fine so what what you say is that the G is a hotspot that's the one that normally most people look at and they take because the difference between a gene a F plan is basically the premium the difference of the two is basically what you'd be paying extra to get a plan so\nIt just kind of makes sense to just go with the G Plan and that's that's one that most people will do not if you're if you're short on on on your funds there is a budget that you're dealing with and and you just can't\nYou know fit into that type of plan being in the G Plan then there's other ones like damage plan out there that they have but you know I\nI feel your pain that when you get to that point in your ... my mother in law did this for for a health insurance and she get bombarded because what what happens is you inquire in one place and they sell your name digs zillion other places and you start getting bombarded by all these offerings and then it's just a\nA a heads ban you don't have any idea where you started and where you're going to end up so again I Would start with looking at the G Plan\nIf if you have an idea of what you might want and then see if she plans to get your bill that would be the first and last suggestion I Will give you right now\nThe plan and the G plant sometimes that feels like alphabet soup just that\nIt is but I Try to make it easy you know I Am [noise] gee for good effort far as\nI like it it's a good way to remember okay I said yes moving right along here and this is I I just find this kind of\nAn interesting question it's gonna I think test your relationship mediation skills and I know sometimes you have to do that [laughter] yeah well you're married how long have you been married dish it out\n[noise] um we've been married Seventeen but on this or just this this summer\nWe've been together for twenty 'cause we we were together three years prior to getting married so I just recognize that the other day and go wow Twenty years was a one woman's shoe me Christmas\nAnd she is all lovely woman and I'll tell ya you guys have three great kids so you bring not just a lot of retirement planning experience to the table but a lot of relationships ... you're going to need it for this next question you ready\nTo go this is a very unique question I Can't wait to hear if you have any experience with something like that then you've been doing this for years so there's a chance you've you've met at a client lay in this position Russ writes in from Missouri saying he says this\nI'm forty years old and I just hit the lottery not make a lottery but a pretty big amount of money I've never had this chunk of change before I don't want to lose at what should I Do with it kills have have you ever had a lotto winner before\nI had one wouldn't it wouldn't a humongous amount but it was a respectable amount of money\nBut you know you've heard the stories you can read them all day long on the Internet you get the athletes first come to mind you know they make all this insane amount of money this is what I Would do you know if you're in any kind of debt you get out of debt than I Would have ... an income\nSo you if you take the you could take the pay out or you can take the lump sum so what most people do is they take the lump\nSum and that's the best bet to take the lump sum\nI you know what it is for the time value of money I Would just have to find out how much and how many years 'cause normally the payouts on a payout is Twenty years\nUm you know I I did it because the payout is more than a lump sum if you didn't do that but basically all the payout is is an annuity that's that's that's what the payout is is there going oh you're twenty or nobody but if you take the the pay the lump sum skews me why most people do\nFirst of all you want to be able to secure\nA lifestyle that it's going to last ... on your nose and so that's where an annuity can be a great advantage you took a pay you took the lump sum but you're going to secure your lifestyle with annuity because what is the new witty annuity is a lifetime income machine\nSo you just got a gift from God and my opinion so secure that with something that you can't spin out of you can't spend enough money to to not secure that lifestyle in the future get out of debt secure your a lifestyle\nIn in the future and then start getting crazy when I say crazy start buying all the crazy toys and and that that's when we understand that you start hearing from a lot of relatives and heard from many years but any way that that would be my suggestion is secure lifestyle get out of debt and then you could start playing but do those first two things first\nAnd that would be a pretty good way to approach your future on that\nHave rats congratulations on the lottery winnings my goodness I guess what did they say just if you can't win if you don't play right just right now I've got to win that\nOwned by guys on it I it's a little cute story a you know so many people\nOther trying to get the big hit a you know to accelerate 'cause they're always trying to catch up and so there was a story where this man and woman they were you know behind on their finances and so forth and and they were on their knees for months praying to God please God let us win the lotto win the lotto you know it's kind of don't you\nKnow and then finally answer him said hey work with me here at least by a lot of\nTea [laughter] help me help you right yeah yeah yeah\nI got him he got halfway so\nNext question comes from Bonnie in ballet or she says my husband and I have three grown children and all their knees and they all have children of their own my issue is that it never fails that one if not all three are still financially dependent to some extent I my husband and myself\nWe do not have grandkids ever suffered that's why we continue to help our adult children\nBut it's getting to be too much and we're afraid it's going to affect our retirement what can you recommend we do you get this question a lot don't you\nI Do and sometimes you just gotta allow your kids do to grow up you know I mean I'm not telling anybody not to help their kids the crazy things we do for our kids because we have heartstrings but sometimes it gets to a point where\nIf you don't it's it's it's like a baby\nBirds and the mother birds syndrome you know it in in order for a baby bird to fly inevitably the mother has to do a traumatic thing she has to push the baby bird out of the ...\nAnd that's kind of like the idea and and the concept and I'm trying to get across the here as long as somebody feels like they have a life preserver a income stream that's always available to them from their parents [noise] um I mean you're not letting them fly it sometimes it takes hard love\nAnd so I wouldn't tell you you might want to start you know taking the spigot and starting to tighten it a little bit\n... have the conversation you know your mother and father or your ... your your data NIH whoever we're talking about you know we\nWe worked our bills off to get to the point where we are today and I just want you to know that we felt like we did a good job raising you you know I don't know people have college educations or whatever the case may be but it gets to a point where you're going to need to know that we can't continue to help us we have been\nYou know and that may be a you know a a front it may be um you know not completely true\nBut you gonna have to draw the line the ... in the least get dumped some backbone otherwise they're gonna be you know like a jelly fish over there and you know every you know Tom it turns around are they going to be reaching out for you and me and I\nThink that's selfish in my opinion from the kids standpoint now again there are circumstances where they may not be in a position where they're I mean one giving example the other day we're ... ... ... ... has been you know a housewife for um\nUh the family and and the husband ended up cheating on her and they got three kids and she has no income\nYou know and and and everything is in his name so that's a perfect example of you know it'd be proper to be able to help your kid but ... and try to get them back on their feet but she's gonna have to go out and find gainful employment you know and she knows that she's willing to do that but just to have somebody be a freebie I\nI'm I'm totally against that because you're playing it what you're playing with fire and you're not going to probably like the end result so I Would just say tough love and and try to do the best you can of getting them\nOff on their own so you know when referring to someone's financial future whatever whatever scenario we're talking about with anybody here today most people today unfortunately gives second class allegiance\nTo first class important but I mean by that you know the kind of putting our back burner you know they're not they're not prioritizing what is most important for their financial future I Would promote you not to be that person I Would tell you to take action now\nSomething else gets in a way you know what is that it's life\nI guess the way for everybody you know that's what we can all say that put crashed and they in certain areas in our life call me right now just so ... you're talking to ... if you don't know what that means I put your best interest over anybody else's\nIf you want the opportunity to sit down with somebody like that this was when we do our workshops so many people come in because they finally are going to be able to sit down with somebody is going to not give them you know the Kool Aid advice you know which is what they're required to sell because their company ... and you need to sell this industry is someone that has\nComplete unbiased opinion because your best interest money if that's of interest to you if you'd like to have that opportunity give me a call right now Joseph Hopkins one eight hundred nine to five three one three six again this one eight hundred nine to five three one three six\nCats have re in town ball right here and he says ness I'm sixty three and currently retired and majority of my money is in the market at the moment that crisis have two thousand eight hit me and my family\nPretty hard it that way I can keep my money with Hugh without having the same financial scare and they did back in two thousand eight while my money is telling the market\nI I Would say yeah I'm Glad that you have not\nKnow have new knees yeah that was our last\nCrash was and he realizes he is on the market which I think it's a mistake especially if you are retired now he seems to be a little bit younger um of age to be retired but congratulations to him but yeah if you if you walked away from a guaranteed income which in this case is a salary or income\nThen I Would definitely be the person that would promote you to real lying your positions\nFor your financial future I think it's a mistake\nFor you to be a hundred percent in the market because you never want to be able to risk more than you than you could afford to risk and\nYou know it it it gives you a lot more backbone or swagger like I like to say if you're still working and you could be a hundred percent in the market because if you lose ten thousand dollars nobody's going to write you a check to replace that like you have to if you are retired\nOr because you're going to have to completely depend on to come back up through the source that went down and that the market so\nIf you are no longer working then yes you need a real line yourself\nWith maybe not so much risk so how much risk and you take well it's not a matter of okay is the sky blue is turquoise what what's your feeling on what Scott what\nWe do in regard to finding your specific risk tolerance I call it your uncle point is we run you through as quick\nSoftware program it takes about no longer than seven minutes I'm not kidding and then it ... its assesses what your risk truly is and then once you assess your risk is kind of like we've just taken financial DNA from you\nThen now you've given me the opportunity to show you\nWhat portfolio would best suit your particular point in time of your life at that point now we can run or it's called a risk allies and we can run that program at a political point and you know what six months down the road you may want to change it because you may say hey I'm Still a little more swagger I Want to get a little more riskier or\nThe thing I'm thinking about maybe ... you because it's I'm hungry that they like great food and there is all the corners abused and then when you're talking about all these areas you ... we have great restaurants all over the place I think it's one of the best restaurants that he certainly in the United states if not far beyond\n... I I Would say Houston easily has one of the most underground food scenes in America you know you look at a downtown after the super bowl was here about two years ago there was an explosion of restaurants and Ninety plus percent of them are still here today and you know year to date twenty team we've seen\nTons of new restaurants come in and stay and a Texas people have refined case of course you have your barbecues every Tex Mex but it's expanding past that and the ... growing and growing\nAnd when you review your office has now been here about a year is that correct widow yes and when you think about that year give us an idea of some of the things that have have gone on in terms of real estate activity perhaps some of the things that you expected ... also a few surprises along the way what didn't you expect that that came to be\nAs your your though so we're very much a growing office we've been open exactly one year this week which were very excited about and so just in general Martha Turner so these international realty we do about two billion dollars in sales every single year uh I think the client mostly knows us in the higher end\nFor example a week ago Houston Business Journal did an article about the top fifteenth sales in Houston greater Houston and our volume by dollar volume we were very excited we were the top four out of five and top seven out as Fifteen\nBut I think most people don't understand about a company is that our media and sales price which means half above half below is actually four hundred and forty thousand so what that means when you're in certain areas is that half of our business we've done about Fifteen hundred sales are in the last year\nIn the two hundred three hundred and low four hundred a price point\nAnd before we focus more and back this whole show about cypress end this town lake area give us a word on some of the other locations like your flex flagship location inside the loop what's the other activity points and levels in your company\nYou know and that's a really exciting question and we talk about this a lot right and so when someone would say so health town like doing it it's that's a very hard question to answer because there's always sub sections within a community right so to say how it's pursuing you would say well how is the two or three hundred price point\nVersus the million plus price point and\nWe monitor we've all sorts of statistics and ah we have all sorts of reporting available to all of our agents which they in turn can deliver to their clients on a weekly or more than that basis and so we love doing is drilling down to the specific price points within the neighborhood so we can tell the story that we need to tell\nAnd speaking of price points let's go to the top price point the million plus how is that going right now you're in the last quarter of the year\nRight so the last quarter that's really strong heart just put something out so hard to find a the high end as anything seven fifty seven hundred fifty thousand and above that was the only price point in September to increase from the year before now we love doing your comparisons as you know up around a little over a year ago we had Harvey\nWhich had which really has impacted the ability to do your every year so now we say okay if we can't do a ... year to year comparison let's look at sixteen and Fifteen and that's true we try to understand these trends and then we take that and then we share it with our ages and then our ages can then take that knowledge and deliver it right back to the client\nAnd for those that are tuning in on YouTube\nRight behind us as a bow to sitting still right now we're getting back to take off you're in a little bit but your location is right in the background\nSo if you want to tune into the to the Youtube video you can see that if you're listening in the car driving just imagine we're on a boat with the Martha Turner set the bees international real deep team and their location is right behind is that's that's just a great you everywhere we look around here on the lake right ball\nOh yes you can see are twelve foot signed directly from the bark of Cyprus road we overlook the lake we overlook the visitor center so if in the summer months you're standing on the beach and you look up you can see our break beautiful blue sign looking right back at you\nYou have such a competitive edge in so many categories and the real estate world However I'm just picturing someone that is interested maybe they haven't even been to Cyprus but they want to learn about it they may want to buy a house and they\nArrive at your location and I think this area probably puts them in a tremendous mood to begin that real estate adventure or continue it or finish it\nSo it was so we've been active our company has been active in this area for years and years and years and decide which has grown to a point where we realize you know we really need a brick and mortar and brick and mortar is they're still very important in the real estate industry because you want to place to meet your clients you want a place to spread out the paperwork because buying a home can be a complicated process it's emotional\nSo you want to bring someone into something that's comforting or an area where you know you can have coffee and water and\nAnd just have a place to have a a long conversation if needed and you know maybe two years ago or so the building they didn't even exist and so we've been looking out here for a while and we waited for the right opportunity and we're very happy with our fraternity were happy overlooking we have a balcony we'd do events out here and it's just a great fun place to be\nAnd you talk about the real estate transactions the complexities of it but throughout that process beginning before you even think about buying a home all those things the mindset is so important and I think whether you are right here on a lake setting like you are or any other location\nGetting people in their right mind set to prepare is so important I think your your accomplish accomplishing that right here in a major way\nYeah we're trying hard to do that and a lot of the buzz right now in the real estate industry is about technology technology brokers and current brokers that are just instilling technology into their\n... into their packages and offerings and I think as a client you have to understand what that really means to you and at our company we like to protect talked analogy in the hands of the client right so\nAh so these international realty was the first to come out with the virtual reality app called ... where you just simply downloaded you if you're in a vacant room and you don't understand what to do let's say you're a buyer you want to buy a house and one rooms a little awkward\nYou pull up the app and it automatically places different types of furniture traditional modern whatever you want to choose from in there you can make it bigger or smaller swat something out\nAnd you can stand there and within three minutes you can totally understand and have a perfect vision of of what you want to do that\nHopefully that translates into a sale for which were totally comfortable with you say you know what I seen what can happen there this isn't going to work for me and that's Martha Turner so that these international agent you can just say okay I've got ten more to look at here we go\nAnd Paul what's the feedback that you get from this location when people arrive for the first time or they do a transaction here or they major agents what do they say about this\nOh without a doubt they're they're impressed they like it you know we tried very hard with the design to make sure that it was a combination of both our agents but also to the clients coming in like I was saying before we have a patio up there with furniture so on nice days you can sit up there and have a conversation and\nYou know each client is different and I think to be successful aging you have to understand your client we talk a lot about communication right some clients like to talk on the phone so I'm like the tax them like the DMV or you know there's all different ways of communicating so it's not about\nYou as the agent how you like to it's about understand your client and delivering service to a client and we talk a lot about that at our company delivering the service\nAt ball before we conclude this segment what else would you like people to know\nJust come on out here um we are relatively new from a brick and mortar since we've been in the ...\nImmunity for years and years and years if you did not know we were here please stop by the boardwalk a town lake uh they do events all the time we had a

the Cyprus location Dina welcome to the show and thank you ... it was great to see you and let's tell people a little bit about how you approach your real estate progression out here in Cyprus Martha ...\nWell I knew here at Martha Turner and I've only been here about a month but I have been so impressed so far\nThe management is just super they are just taking the by the hand and walking me along with all their new systems and um I just really I'm under your had a good time having a good time\nSo you have made the right decision for you and the the thing that I'm picturing if I were real estate agent and joining the dream certainly out here in Cyprus or any of the locations they have Martha ... international realty has so many resources for you to to use and to help your client your buyers and sellers right\nYes yes they they have an email system they have an email system\nAnd print and they're getting the all set up on their on their uh\nTheir plans you know to automatically sent farms and things like that\nWell one of the things that strikes me is that we mentioned is every now and then and that is the real estate when people see the TV shows\nAnd they see realtors driving nice cars million dollar homes and all that sometimes it makes the profession look easy but in reality it's not necessarily that easy you have to be systematic you have to always\nPut the client's interest first exceed expectations how do you go about the service part of your role whether you're helping bars are so it was one of the things that you keep in mind to to do a great job for the category\nI think listening listening to what their needs are what their expect expectations are making sure that they know that I care about them that they're my number one priority\nSo that's a lot of things to keep in mind from your perspective in making this change your being at the company for a month of some of the things that you're seeing as far as the marketplace how is it as a brisk is are there more sellers or bars out here right now well\nIt's a seller's market and and there are buyers out there uh looking\nYou just have to have the right marketing and uh and price right\nSo the key for the seller I'm thinking is there's so many things that are involved with that if you're going to sell your home we want to make sure that it has to look right the right protector for uses those are some of the things that you help people with all the time right\nYes yes he always used professional photography southern ... also has a department that make sure that the photography look even better than a professional photographers do so that's a that's a plus\n... always taking things to the next level to help clients buying or selling right yes yes\nSo someone came to you dean and we're talking with Dina Everest I just wanted to say your last name again 'cause that's super fun but let's say someone came to you from I don't know Pennsylvania they found out about cyber say her name they should Dean I want to buy a home here in this\nIn this general area of the town like let's say or maybe even on the water water or the price points or let's say they came to you and said look I have five hundred thousand dollars to spend given give us some idea of the type of home what they can get for that amount of money that we're that value goes right\nWell here in the ... the area and town lake or the price ranges from the two hundred up to over the millions a\nFor getting us up or two hundred yes\nThere's a section in in town like that you can get and it's an entry more entry level would that'd be a new home or an existing oh probably ... an existing home but this neighborhood is very new so it wouldn't be that old I Would say a brand new house you could get in the three hundred\nSo now I'm pretty good about that five hundred thousand I might get some extra\nYes it's a possibility that there are some houses that you can even get lakefront for that but that's where I was going to go right\nWhere do we where do we begin the pricing if we want one of these homes that again people are driving they may not be able to see but they can imagine we're on a boat we're on water and there's almost right and left do us part I'm up at six hundred can I get on the lake for six hundred\nYeah sure I think so yes yes there are some sections that have like little canals\nAnd and you can get in there for that price\nNow the other thing that we're not seeing all the water but I'm imagining are there are some of these gated communities by the way\nYes yes the custom home sections gated\nThough that sounds pretty good yes so let's tell people what are some of the other things that you tell people that may not know about cypress for let's say you meet somebody along the way and you're saying well you know I work in the Cyprus area and they said well I've never really been out their\nPain a little bit of a picture beyond what we've already done we're on a boat but what are some of the other things that are distinctive about cypress\nWill Cyprus does not have a downtown it's all ... pretty much a interesting [laughter] we're only an hour and Fifteen minutes from College Station so if you're an aggy\n[laughter]\nIt's day trip cypress ... has older sections to very nice it's it's a one of the largest growing areas and they say that will be like a hundred thousand people and the next ten years or something like that\nThat's always interesting if we imagine turning the clock ahead a year or five years from now any of these areas in the shoe scenario is amazing because what if what it'll be like is I don't know if we can imagine that except that there'll be more traffic already we have a lot of that right\nWe have a lot of that but to Ninety will be complete very thin and right\nNow it's a little bit of a headache but a lot of it is all complete and soon it will be so easy to get downtown working downtown\nFrom a buyer standpoint water some of the things here as we're in the two thousand Eighteen getting into two thousand Nineteen soon what are some of the things that people are looking for in homes these days as a bar than say they didn't years ago mhm what do they like\nWell a lot of people are liking their winery\nAnd that's kind of a new one of them are wired wherever I out of it yes and really they're looking\nFor lifestyle uh the lifestyle of the neighborhoods with all the amenities that they have like for instance you we're seeing how town lake has amazing amenities they've got a lazy river\nA lot for residents only a lot of a lot of activities for residents only bridge land has amenities like panic park tree house\nWait a minute that I had a heart that sounds like it might be the relaxing relax for a deal [noise] yes yeah that sounds like fun yeah well before we conclude the segment Dina what are some of the other things that inspired you about the series that you think about\nWell I just love the cypress area because of the the new homes that great builders that they have out here uh if you're looking for a home that's already energy efficient and things like\nThat that's an advantage right their skin\nAnd as we're cruising along in our boat here we're looking to the left and there are some actually homes that are being constructed right\nNow so you see new construction you CEOs being built so it looks like there's there's no slowing down out here\nThat's right that's right it's a it's just going gangbusters\nUnless the people of all the things you could be doing you chose the real estate profession what is it about real estate that gets you excited every day to do all the things you need to do to be successful\nI get to shop for houses and I don't have to spend my own money\nGod you know I've asked that question a lot of times that's the first time I got that answer and that's a good one deal that some people how they can reach out to you in case they want to listen to your services", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
