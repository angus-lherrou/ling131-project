whether Clinton whether it's Reagan this is all powerful the cause these jobs eat you alive I truly you alive\nAnd uh let's wait and see a ... for what the reason is for the resignation\nAnd I'm Glad you said that because it's it's easy for all of us who are sort of observers\nTo say how do you 'cause I always instinctively say gosh why would you why would you leave the White House why would anybody walk away from that job and of course I can look at my own career and I've made decisions that people are said why did you do that and it turned out to be a pretty good move for me but\nYou know at the time people would say oh my gosh you're resigning from WABC radio in New York and yeah I took a chance grown into syndication and it worked out the you know you're Twenty years later pretty good I mean the people make decisions based on things like the the the brutal treatment you get\nWhen you're in that fish bowl and so I I really do get it um and maybe that's what this says it must be something though\nAs Sebastian if if if the two of them are making a joined announcement it has to be something that's positive that's good yeah you know what I mean and and people are going crazy with them on my tax line of people calling in saying things like\nMaybe is is is Lindsey Graham going to become attorney general is she going to get some position was that\nWe could I things around ... slowed down [noise]\nAnd that's how I found when I ...\nNo no no you're getting your your getting to be like the the the crazy in the mainstream you know and now that's a bitter about that Dr ... for about ... that's a big insult Dr ... and ... when when the ... goes the chaos in the white I Know that other\nGuy if if the last twenty months there's been chaos\nI Want will say oh yeah no kidding look they call them eat yeah can you look at the border you look at unemployment if it I mean people have to understand the president\nYeah the president isn't your average bureaucrats [laughter] he's not even a politician right he's a man who has been round ... be successful in the private sector\nWell you talk about chaos Dr ... you're talking about chaos bring me the kind of chaos that results in judge Brett Kavanaugh now ... ...\nIn the hill who oh in the hit\nIn the history of book his job to has there ever been a more perfectly timed book than your book why we fight defeating America's enemies no apologies because let's be very blunt here sometimes America's enemies are from within\nAnd what we call it and just over the last few weeks I I I Know you had to be as disgusted as the rest of us\nAre totally because I've lived in I mean through it you know all the accusations made against me in the White House and you know we ... we had a saying in the west wing when all this stuff was going on you only take flack when you're oh the targets but but this\nWas disgusting and the interesting thing about my book why he's fine which of course I wrote long before\nYou have an old was who was nominated right\nIs that the chapter in there by the great American Hero of the book is about all the threats America faces and what the president's going to do about them but then I have these personal stories about or amazing American heroes and the last one is a guy called ... chambers that most\nAmericans probably Ninety five percent of millennials ... never heard of but where\nThey could shame because most of the tunnel before ... was born so just just a little sound bite\nThis is a man who stood up for the food and the first televised congressional testimony ever in Nineteen forty eight right he stood up to say I was a former communist and I can tell you who the communist orange by the government and what happened to him\nThe left went crazy they accused him of having an affair they used to being a homosexual they used to being responsible for his brother's death all of it might was a lie that history of lies and\nAt the end of the day he won because he stood up for the truth so anybody who says that he was just going by the treatment judge Kavanaugh will receive a guess what\nThe Democrats have been doing it for about seven years mind\nAnd and it's gotten so bad that it's almost as a fever pitch and that and frankly I'm hoping and praying that Americans remember\nWhat has happened over the last month come November the six because you know there and they are on record you know it and we've seen them promising left and right impeaching Kavanaugh house members threatening and promising and investigation of Brett Kavanaugh they don't want this thing to end\nAnd if they get control the house in the Senate We're gonna be worrying for a world of hurt\nWe look I chose the title of the boat for a reason why we fight we now have the will to protect the republic\nAnd thinking about this for second do you remember what Harry Reid said about the lives he said he ...\nHe won didn't level and he doesn't win did he he didn't win by\nYeah that's that's what we have to face Mike yeah the last ... made a bargain with the devil they have said that\nEnds meaning getting power just defines what ever means whether it's lying about Mitt Romney's taxes or whether it's accusing a little boy scout I mean brass have an aunt\nIs a boy scout for the last fifty three years and we've been accused him of being a serial rapist gang rushed made women gang I mean yeah\nIt it it it it's pure evil yeah and if if we think\nThat they're going to stop because we want to miss one forget about it\nThey're going to ramp it up you've already seen the article saying we have to go even further what's the I mean let's let's remind ourselves who's James Hodgkinson mind I mean this is a name that shouldn't be done in the brain of all Americans James Hodgkinson\nWell they Bernie Saunders volunteer right left\nThe took an automatic rifle in a hand gun to a baseball field in Virginia with a hit list of Republican congressmen any almost killed Steve ... where did the right down the ... when does the riots actually normalized violence so whether it and she ...\nWhether it's a baseball field in a rifle this is the how should that you get when you said the ends justify the means and Mike a lesson from from my book\nIf you if you buy into that philosophy of philosophy one eventually lead to we've seen it in the last hundred years it leads to the goo lax leads to the death camps because if you'll ends couldn't justify any means then you'll do what it ... it takes\nThis is why you got to get his book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and I'm not kidding you as the as the Kavanaugh bloodbath unfolded I thought\n...

of direct politics but the subject has political direct political ramifications I have a have a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\n\nOr better maybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to pose\nAnd by my earlier statement that said realization you have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\nSo you don't like you know my answer even if you have\nNever heard before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of them have to take care of themselves now obviously up to the extreme that you you can find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\n\nBut that is how that is how people think I Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume\nFor a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human the universal human desire for freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the New York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you\nShock you in terms of its stupidity as much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days I did not mention it but I read it\nAnd I have to clean it up I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but you know kids listen to this am I ... that\n\nThat but also put it in a very general way and somewhat opaque\nAdults will understand it was an article about women who had lived under communism and then lived under freedom so the East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism\nThe article was a serious article you must understand the subs metal lampooned is not from the onion it was a serious article\nClaiming that women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany had a more fulfilling sex life than women in a West Germany\n\nYou read that correct about the argument was they were show taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of the communist state\n... by the way series of articles in the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nSo then there was another article just er let's see what today Wall Street journal what's we give up for free money\n\nI moved to Sweden for love not money\n\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also entitled me the paid parental leave benefits who couldn't object to free money handed out by the government to oil Swedish parents then I became a father\n\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave on employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of internal laced welfare programs is the government's attempt to realize a political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among Swedes that has noticed\nThree get T.
