{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "Collins [noise]\nFisher kittens\nCortez master [noise]\nAll right so you're a little bit of history being made and you hear in the eyes and you're hearing the nays are\nThe nose and uh and I don't want to kind of drag that out for you because ah what what matters is what they're going to do and we're reporting there too humid here are the yeses Jeff Flake is he yes this is the cloture vote part one\nThe second part would be tomorrow for the full Senate vote on the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh flake as he asked\nCollins is the gas and mansion gives a yes which is a big surprise\nToday a well again I I'm ... and I was speculating do shows how good I Am with productions that Heidi Heidi Heitkamp could be a no I mean are yes rather because of Heidi Heitkamp votes no she's going to lose her Senate seat in North Dakota she did announce yesterday\nThat she's a no vote which means she's absolutely going to be\nThe former senator from North Dakota she's out\nUm but there you go three of the four key senators voting yes let's get your reaction to all of this one eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four or five three great to have you here in the relief factor dot com studios as we are uh watching history unfold right before our very eyes Terry Europe page every welcome aboard what do you think\nLike a guy from New Jersey and I I think a little more of the historical view this kind of compare this situation the civil war thank God the only difference or not killing anybody yet\nNot yet why don't you want a reality ... one of them tried on a baseball field in Virginia remember\nYes absolutely but the reality is that Republicans Republican if they don't understand when you're a ... hour and you don't you lose it and they very well or if they don't you\nKnow this this idea of a civil war is very real to millions and millions of Americans and that's fair um\nI've talked about this for years\nAnd I I remember being on the stage of ... of a few months ago\nWith a colleague who sort of rolled his eyes of the of the idea that we are in a cultural war\nWe are in a war we're in a war for our nation shoals ... we're in we're in a battle over what how we want our country\nTo be what we want represented in this country what ... what are what our standards our values our laws are going to be there is a very big presumption here of guilt ... until you can prove your innocence\nWe have turned American um standards and values and mores on here by the the by the activism or the left\nAnd it's frightening you know ... and I I'm so I I was reading about a Ellen DeGeneres announcing this week but she was a sexual assault survivor and you know that breaks my heart I think she I think she was like if I saw it correctly she was Fifteen\nAnd that's horrifying that that helped define and shape\nHeard that trauma that robbing of innocence and and everybody is sympathetic and and an agonizing over such a horrible crime against an innocent defenseless child\nAnd we have had a robust conversation about women in the workplace being being abused and and treated terribly by powerful men\nBut then this me to thing has extended into the cabinet process where allegations have been made from high school and early college that haven't been able to be corroborate and in this conversation about cabinet I keep hearing the left use that term\nYou get to speak my truth this is my truth\nAnd honestly at last I'd look to find a caller who can help maybe somebody on the left and I don't mind I Would love to hear from you actually do explained to me what might truth means because my truth may not be\nThe truth and it seems very clear to me that the pursuit should be of truth\nAnd I I don't really understand that we can clear aligned Lance and see if we can get a caller who can help explain to me what it means when when when some of these um advocates and activists and voices say that Christine Blasey Ford gets to tell\nHer truth truth this is my truth this is her truth well here's the truth well it is that\nIs that kind of a a subtle acknowledgement but it may not be the truth what if Christine Blasey Ford believes with all of her heart the Brett Kavanaugh did it but he didn't\nI'm just going through a hypothetical process what if what if it was another boy what if it was a memory that she has wrong in the way she is recount in this some thirty six years later\nDoes that mean you can you can defend\nA truth that isn't the truth in other words it does hurt truth supersede the truth I think about this as it applies to Brett Kavanaugh if that's the case then a false fluids stands a man has ruined\nA family is destroyed and reputation is shattered because her truth isn't the truth hypothetically Tim says he can explain it to me how you doing Jim welcome to the gallery show\nThank you uh it it comes from the education system and the philosophy behind that education system and they operate on the philosophical axiom that perception\nIs reality so your your perception of what happened is your reality which you and I know it's not true right as if somebody believes pillow\nOr or seems a pillow as wrong ticket and after Iraq you have a they quickly learn that perception is not really\nWell that that's an interesting way of looking at it so that that but maybe you're right maybe the belief is your perception is reality therefore that stands and frankly to most Americans that's wrong that's not a normal logical understandable\nProcess breaking now on the Mike Gallagher show All right the Senate has voted fifty one to forty\nNine to advance the Kavanaugh's nomination it was a fifty one to forty nine vote and a shockingly to some Lisa Murkowski\nVoted no it was believed that Lisa Murkowski\nCould be this was again considered one of the big swing votes one of the undecideds she voted no which of course signal she's going to be a no vote tomorrow in the full confirmation process however Senator Flake Collins and mansion Joe mansion from West Virginia\nCame through and voted yes so you got a fifty one to forty nine votes if you were to lose some how in the next twenty four hours any of those three flake Collins or mentioned say one last one of them let's say I don't know\nSusan Collins decides to join Lisa Murkowski and voting no\nYou still have ... the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh because Mike Pence has the president of the Senate breaks that breaks the tie he cast the deciding vote and uh you would win by one on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh Michelle is reacting to Lisa Murkowski's vote how you doing the show\nBecause I Would actually turn your radio down for me five before the hour here again fifty one to forty nine the cloture vote go ahead Michele\nPilots ... like Herman as as you know I I left a message on my couch case a cell phone to her for that cabin out an animal and um I haven't actually I felt that that I just find it interesting that seat with ... with all these helicopters they're sexually\nAbused women are the ... to ... and like here on the other side of the story in the south I guess it'll completely brainwashed by all of that which I feel like that's how she voted today and we just got to buy it\nIt's the same it's a real shame and I and I believe again just like Heidi Heitkamp is going to be the former senator from North Dakota Lisa Murkowski is now going to be the former senator from a from a from Alaska she betrayed her voters\nAnd she said no but thankfully we've got enough yes vote so I think we're going to get them across the finish line [noise]\nSo much for joining us for the Mike Gallagher show here on AM ten Seventy the answer but don't go anywhere

attack\nEverybody that haven't haven't be happy happy happy make the world a better economy that we make the world\nWorse it is a moral obligation to act happy whenever possible yes happiness is\nA moral virtue not an emotional state that is something nobody thinks about unless they listen to the happiness our with me\nAnd I was not bragging or any nonsense like that I have zero interest in bragging ... [laughter]\nI just am interested in telling you the sad truth ... you're not going to be here that outside of this show or my book on happiness that happiness is a moral virtue\nYou know who knew what the founders knew what life liberty and the pursuit of happiness pursuit of happiness is a good thing pursuit of fun is not a good thing\nGot it or we are born here\nToday's topic on a one to ten scale of importance is drum roll please [noise]\nNine point for four or six new line for three to five\nThat is how important it is my friends we are very precise solve this program now you're some the to\nA gentleman that I work with the living martyr and a triple G\nAre thinking why does that bring come up with stuff like that is that correct yes all very good yeah you know what that dates you you're very young how do you know if there were a slide rule\nOr your father had a slide rule\nHey a a living martyr how many are guys under or girls under thirty\nNowhere to slide rule is close to zip that's so interesting how about what else well what was\nThat thing we use where you had the pain on one side and the and the pencil on the other and made a circle\n\n... pro tractor although I have not use that word\n[laughter] since ... before Reagan I Know I pro tractor I Would if you just said you will not eat until you come up with that word I starve to death pro tractor [noise] do they use that\nYou don't like I was with a bunch of kids the other day kids or college kids and I asked them how many of you can read and write cursive\n\n... remember though this was a Colorado Christian a university so I think that I got a disproportionately high number who said yeah I could read curses them I said okay how do you write a capital by\n[laughter] and\nI we get a very positive response today's subject is indeed extremely important that this was could change your life I'm like I'm not kidding\n\nVery very very very few people have a good in every area of life\nI ... I mean every important area of life let me give you a list right a list of\nAnd if I missed I mean I Would ask the two gentlemen with who I work to come up with something I missed All right now I'm by the way this is not an order of importance it solely in order of their appearance in my brain actually in my in my mind so for example health\nChildren parents spouse an overt marriage\nWork right how many people\nCan say that in all of those areas of life they have been the recipient of great\nHappiness the answer is very few\nI was with somebody who has a spectacular life\nSpectacular children in great health and a fair marriage affair marriage not a bad marriage at all not a particularly good marriage\nAnd this person I couldn't even say male or female this person or did I say great career as well that I mentioned that I don't think so\nChildren career health terrific marriage fair\nAnd the answer is with the person like a better marriage absolutely\nIs the person basically happy you absolutely\n\nBecause you have to find happiness where you can\nThat's the lesson of today's happy to shower and very few people find it in all major arenas\n\nAll right that's that's you ... you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage alright so be happy\n\nThe the ability to have happiness supplied as it\nOr by every major avenue is a rare warm for most people want any Prager\nSeventy seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nIs the number if you take this seriously you can have a happier life\nIt just it just\nDoesn't work out for everybody to have every major area they happiness producer\nSo your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work on being happy\nAnd I to me that's more amazing that people not working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's analogous\n\nYou know if if people did X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it because I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people those life deliver in all arenas\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and ... not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh excuse me I Can't believe if I Can't believe that I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've\nThe punishment room is only earned for carelessness\nNot for content\nBut I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content should should apply anyway friends\nHow am I forget that one\nSo friends health marriage I sit parents\nI ah I Know of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I it's the one includes parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life\nIs all put parents and so parents children friend's health work marriage there you go\nIf you got 'em on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an all wheel drive\nAnd be and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push any particular brand name here but you know what I mean I mean in all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\nAlright that's it's not most people can't afford it or just don't have one a Prager seven seven six I\nLike you to call in and obviously you have a question or um you see few differ you know if you don't have one of those well the truth is if you don't have health\nThat's a toughie\nI Would say of all of them that may be might might be the toughest but it depends what health means\nIf ... if the health is debilitating or not for example Charles crowd hammer the wonderful late commentator you know it was paralyzed almost fully from the neck down that's bad health\nBut he he he was a fully functioning highly functioning more functioning that most people who aren't power one\nIndividual who loved life [noise]\nAll right every body you gotta find happiness where you can and few people have it in all the ... of life that I mentioned you are listening to the happiness our second hour every Friday on the dentist\nPrager show the dentist Prager show live from the relief factor pain free studios\nAccomplished so does that make sense\nThat's really a very good answer I think it [laughter]\nOh You're welcome thank you that's the best question answer good\nTonight I I like that\nWhat if you do this is from tripled ... want to do with the other person in your life fails to realize this\nCan you be happy with someone who doesn't realize this he told me about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend\nFor ...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say your other spouse that business on board and in these matters that's why I said then you still have the hopefully health friend's children parents or work and remember or not and or\nTo be sources of happiness\nThis is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important this is\n\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I moved to ah to Baltimore oh well it was a bad choice I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding they'll be offended okay when I get married when I have children when my children get married\nWhen I Lived right right that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wedding I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n[laughter]\nThat that's the boy did all this time until when happened just wasted\n\nAnd you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die young\nJust for the record\nYou don't you don't we don't have any guarantees\n\nYou celebrate what you can now\nYes it's very important\nThe went issue or people have that\nUp that I have talked about but not as the went issue I liked that as the when issue I really could do another happiness book [noise]\n\nI I sit here and I do believe this is helping people that that gives me a joint [noise]\nYes exactly [noise]

tourists are of God and religion as you probably know\nBut I I have to be intellectually honest no matter that's number one God wants me to uh to worship him and truth so ... so what you're saying is it's not possible for a secular person to be happy\nThat's correct yeah well not really happy yeah will truly happy is an interesting adverb\nA I I don't know I don't know the answer to that\nLike I think look I I Believe that secularism has produced good government and nothing else everything else it's touched has been pretty much a disaster\nBut I it's hard it's far let me take a look here you can be secular unhappy okay so exactly I think I think I ... so\nWhat does guard and religion add I mean it's tremendously to one's happiness so maybe they can be happy but not at the same level\nAnd let's go to Tim and Rochester, Minnesota\nHello Dennis Hi ah\nI'm just wondering how you um you know\nIf you ever feel yeah you know I don't know I'm all guilty the right word but you seem to hit a

areas I Know that if I\nSuccessful and those areas I Would probably have a happy and that's our I'm On my show every every day I mean\nNow it's a ... yeah okay ... okay it's a very important and difficult question because I I really do have to open up to you I of all most listeners of a long time no I have not had a pain free life by any means I have been divorced\nAnd uh it was a very painful period in my life\nAnd if the only time in thirty five years of broadcasting where I had two years while broadcasting was when I announced the end of my marriage or my ah\nSeventeen years and I\nI went through a lot as a result of that I\n... it's not been a smooth road in my life I did not grow up a happy child I became a happy in high school but before that I I was not happy so in fact if I didn't have all of the pain that I have I don't think I\nCould do happiness our so in in the question has merit\nI think if you if you have everything that I listed with no glitches\nAnd I think about ten percent of the population does one out of ten people I think my my well I don't think you could do what happiness our I don't think I could have written a happiness book I wrote the name of my book is they give away happiness is a serious problem\n\nIf I had all these things how can I write a book happiness is a serious problem I Would write a book happiness\nWas effortless [laughter]\nThe book would have been so uh\nWhat I Do however is I live by the words that I give you advice up\nYou know very recently I took a terrible fall and hurt my eyes\nAnd it could have been a
