and you'll find out where else I appear besides fell into Dennis or\nLarry or whatever in the last star talked about the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh nomination hearings and how despicable many of the Democrats and the left we're in our and many of you ... they they're all trying to get two and a little bit I just want to for some other ideas out to you\nI Want you first to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams here's the quote it is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished\nFor guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned\nPerhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself is no protection\nAnd such an ideas that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end up security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way\nDo the Democrats ... out there know what their unleashing do they care\nThey're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic the presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nWho among us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account of thirty five years if he even committed what he's accused of as a teenager I thought we at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they haven't at the left\nThat wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offense\nBut now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high years\nAnd by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the Senate\nAnd I thought Joe Biden plagiarize while he was in college how come he was vice president and senator cotton tweeted\nCenter to watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lie for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now Blumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact as the times when the ... at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve where he used was ... was officially guaranteed not to serve in the conflict itself\nSenator Blumenthal ask Kevin off he was familiar with I mispronounced the Latin false us in you know false us in on the bus which the legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true\nExcuse me senator Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you\nOr do you have a six different now for lying\nI watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe tell me if he felt the same way if you're on the other side of I'll take your view and the other side I Want to get calls from people who disagree why it all makes sense do you want to prayer seven seven six\nNow another thing I Want you to consider this in my home state of California I suggested on Facebook\nThat Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her to publicity and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is like knowledge that my brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make\nWhether a leftist is replaced by a far left is\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum and Tweedle dum are now it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between the left and far less\nOne at least he's telling you where they stand and going for the kill all at once and the other is a phony torturing you slowly but surely\nThat Senator Feinstein California's going down the tubes anyway so why don't we let them get their quicker I live here so we might be able to pick up a piece of sooner some day or maybe if they as they've tried to do they can succeed and form their own Venezuela here\nOr member Governor Brown thinks global warming is the biggest issue we face and he is a sworn enemy of President Trump\nSo let them go for their left his utopia and let's get the pain over with what do you think of that idea let's get Republicans to vote for senator finds things far left opponent and give her some consequences for her to push city\nTell me what you think of that I did too and won a prayer service\nAnd six it's time we realize we're in a civil war with the left for the soul of this country so you could tell me what you think ... at the phone number that I just mentioned to you and just listening if you didn't hear the first hour the\nEmotions the outrage that this was captured to the American people like nothing else I don't think maybe since the OJ Simpson trial because maybe ... ... people out there are starting to realize what we're in a lie and they'll do anything to destroy somebody\nAlright I promised I go to your calls so let's go Tom has been waiting forever Tom England or you're on with mark\nMarket is great to hear you substituting so superbly for that is like and talk to you again I really miss your old Saturday Night show a few killers guile\nWhen you you got to check fish because I Do other stuff too so just to see where I Am okay what\nPhase me

pool is only one thing wrong you're insulting fool [laughter]\nOh oh that's too you know the Democrats have fallen into such an on being who he was really scary infinite lead deep\nMoral up is when you disagree with your age are no matter what the foster victim hood constantly they this days the constitution\nThey ate the free market and personal freedom we know that in the socialist state of California and the art lovers of socialism which is the government crushing people in the most vile way just look at that as a way lower and mark\nMy fear is if we don't vote them out as you suggested we must they will get a scramble whole almost in perpetuity on Supreme Court\nThey will do anything they can to push their freedom killing socialist agenda and the future of this country as a once great\nBastion of freedom that our founding fathers created will be forever gone\nThanks Tom and you said a very well I can I can feel free to say this Bill Clinton's line I can feel the pain out there it is it's obvious and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio is question or comment go ahead Josh\nI'm taking my call sure you know I just\nWanted to basically say that ah you know in my own reaction and your way to the to the testimony or at least for testimony which is I think Republicans may have gone at it a little bit\nWrong angle I think maybe that they won't when you come up you can't really questioning anybody's memory without coming off a little bit vicious especially in a time when a victim you're talking about starting to think that they should've basically just said hey we understand that you're that you're you've been going through a rough time and they must have happened to you\nAnd your incredible were not questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that\nIf this if there was a terrible situation to where somebody brought you evidence or brought you in a in a legit accusation but had no evidence what would you do and they're not giving her that often and she would have no no chance\nOther than to say that what happened is that it requires corroborating evidence in order to destroy somebody's life\nAnd if they could have gone around to that then they're going to be like that we need your help to bring some evidence that there is any evidence and then from there she wouldn't have been accused of not remembering\nI like your style that's and that's that would have been a good way to do to Los you may have different or lawyers who knows and they would have had some objections saying she's not here to answer that kind of a question I don't know you never know what but it by like your approach thanks a lot of trash and I knew you had a good comment there let's go uh let's continue\nThe really ... in some ways even though you know how I feel Jan in Marietta, Georgia you're on was mark\nHey mark thanks for taking my call sure that's real quick ... one of the thing there are many things that I I think that I thought for Dr Ford and her testimony but one really important thing with when she said like after they decided that attack 'em that she saw\nJudge the friend that was in the room and get not help her and black hair play up out what what's going on\nAnd she said when she saw him\nHe was very uncomfortable when she said hello what in teenage girl\nOkay we'll give you a little question mark I suffered in the spring\nThe courage is not there there's flake cause someone\nA costume wherever it was an elevator on the floors in the Senate or whatever\nAnd starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to suggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're we're is the courage Democrats or give them credit for one thing they circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do you really know\nWhat we're up against for them this war this is their religion this is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm just trying to say this is everything to them to get some Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate\nAnd I understand why you're so unhappy\nAh someone says something about the left than I Am maybe they dropped off and waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha in Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark\n... I think we\nNeed it provable desirable\nAnd and I go to the ... and our ... to it to all drinking ... hop on the air even irrelevant at all we were typical trick Frank insurance that\nCan be no for an

...\n[noise] I I'd like it but you're you're leaving out the part I just went over they don't have the courage they're afraid of their own shadow that's that by the way that was one of the reasons President Trump is so enduring to so many people yeah it gets himself in trouble with his tweets\nPlease like the first president to really stick up for what he believes in any you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nA and he actually says what he means kept himself in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes them so enduring that well we've been crying out for instead of these mushy Republicans and and a lot of the Collins of Maine and Murkowski of\nAlaska and I mentioned inch on just reminded me and Ann Romney goes and says I support this week to just say why Romney lost\nI'm just going to mention that to me we're we're ... we're willing to do battle see the Democrats kept this the left gets it\nAnd we don't we're Denis\nSays it all the time we're in a new war it might be civil let's hope it\nStays in a sense that now there's no bloodshed although I worry about that very much when I listen to your emotions I listened to the emotions of the other side this is a

to pull the per second door okay but you admitted that humid that you might be out there let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania you're on with mark\nYou can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter is a mark on the show and you'll find out where else I peered besides filling in for Dennis and Laurie\nIn this hour you can continue to call but I thought I Would have some political experts on to give us they're taken where this is all going and what it means for the upcoming elections\nAs well as for the future of the Republican\nThere Sean steel Republican committee men from the former great state of California you can't say that but I can and artist Steinberg political consulting pollster and writer of whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump a political odyssey well gentlemen I don't even know where to begin the callers are still there but\nTo the parents have been accused of surprise you even in the first place Arnie\n... you know if I if there were the vast right wing conspiracy which I was the head when she came forward to\nThat she would have been ... dismissed it but of course it would have been ... with the Democrats were wholesale liberals like Alan Dershowitz simply would have said do you look if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested the blood sport of gutting this nominee\nWhile we are mid eighties is or fungal swan song there when this letter came to me the staff would have looked interview per say look if you want to be anonymous and there isn't any cooperation there is a long time ago this doesn't come across threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd the army speaking of Dianne Feinstein center finds that did you I don't know if you heard me suggest that Republicans and you're the national committee men for public after Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing what she did\nThe top two primary system is another unique the listeners should know that other disasters teacher in California that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter\nOnly two people ah who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation we have no primaries anymore minor party of disappearing in California so not consequently we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing cook Democrat\nAs our only choices for us we can't even write in a terrible idea Democrat activists say the Republican activists have that certain wrist abolition folks love it and it and so what we have is a dying Feinstein or as as a left wing opponent and Sean steals not gonna vote for either one I Can't even right in\nWhat about what about mark suggests that these people are so upset I tell you this I I felt like going to measure fights aren't campaign Bill Carrick who I've known for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican do that's what we should just get it doesn't know that Kevin de Leon her opponent is more left wing than she is ... they're gonna viscerally react against Feinstein by voting for the other Democrat\nBut you do for your people naturally listening to the show they say California's a wave of the future be where what this is is that when there was a so called primary to the top two vote getters go into the general election matter what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your state when November comes you'll have a choice between bad to worse now\nThat's what it is that's why I say it's ... it's not only mine the other people to suggest that I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she won't win\nRight if you want to be Catholic school do you say okay if she gets reelected she's in her eighties she's getting less and less they don't you have just watched the way she walks to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley there who self is not super high energy there what does he get Kevin ... he's a younger person who's going to be around for years so he won't have\nSeniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us in a while I posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they did say what\nWas ... that for die and find since she was like more or less that kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as our colleagues\nBut now she's joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials in Salem witch trials relationship to save a broad right I was gonna say yeah exactly but this is an Salem, Massachusetts a sixty Ninety two they can you know there were ... there's a hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a a number of women they were hung\nA and they were accused of being which is and it wasn't even against what they did but it was it was their ghost that did ...\nFull disclosure is I knew Shaun steel when he was in high school\nSo ... you know let let that go I don't want to hear any more about that I Will do want to ask you though was she credible some listener picked on me sing all your talk shows are saying she had some measure credibility\nI she was extremely well prepared she's a psychologist she's done this are all like she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers\nAnd no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story and that was effective it was a great presentation but when you dig into and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense at all but\nYou say that and I agree with you but are Republicans they didn't say she wasn't credible and one of your callers I think the key points we always start out by giving her credibility there\nWell you know because we want to be courteous ... not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience pitch you got the wrong guy and she probably knows in her mind and her heart of hearts that you got the wrong guy but she's ... she's a tool\nOften but you know it's like our our ... they leak the fact we're going to have a women or a woman a question curve because we don't want these Republican mail\nIs such a self defeat your consult right so is that in a smart move was terrible for the first of all it was a good move that to have these senators not grandstanding ... you know ed Royce when each year the foreign affairs committee they hit it and ...\nAnd ... and I looked and it was awful but it wasn't at he's competing but every house member one have their day in the sun their\nTheir Fifteen minutes of things but there was no choreography no strategy no coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times or Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactic secondly they never should have done the traditional thing of alternating Democrat Republican and giving a process I Know that I saw the every time so assuming that she was confident I mean I've been crosses damned if you have 'em and you want to keep going so he the we have lawyers\nOn our site as their US Senators who are so an app that they agreed to this format rather say look all you Democrat's gonna go go through August up there when you're done we're gonna have are a personal question or\nThey should have had you there was a ... ... again the Republicans were in a bind they're looking at all the stats and appalled and women are angry and had been walking away a sizable number maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking away voting against Republicans because they think Republicans are but\nIn in in in this hearing I I'm going to say something a little bit unique numbered I like what Chuck Grassley is generally done\nHe's kept telling me you know and I have kept the tough schedule and look he's got a real problem at you and I don't have to face in daily life he has\nTo get eleven boast about Twenty one person committee easy task and fake flavors flaking out so the whole hearing loss for one person in the universe was for Jeff Flake ... got his hearing and he voted out and I told you like ... ... what was your flakes name before he changed it a you know what I think it was more than that way it's sad to say\nNow Jeff weasel yeah and then he changed thought it was by no less than a lucky we got to vote I got to tell you so I'm grateful for that now\nFlights got another week going on with us I think it's actually good and I'm going to tell you my cold calculating political reason yeah making my team very angry fired up their team's been angry and fired up for two years now it's about time our team wakes up understand smell the roses we have a nasty enemy here they're ... they're trying to take over the house representatives\nAnd if you think it's bad today wait till you see Maxine Waters in charge of a major committee that's really going to ... put us over the\nTop ... it's very scary she were to look at the Democrats take control it who would share that with the major companies in the house it's it's a rogues gallery of I mean when you see people who are going to be an armed service they couldn't get a security clearance ... there are people going to be having oversight or the CIA for software so the\nMessage clearly as ... as I said you've got to you know be enthused enough to go out there and vote and get everybody you\nKnow you look at it at the at the national strategy 'cause we have a national leadership there the Democrats are counting on for example getting a few seats here in California like let's say Dana Rohrabacher and you talk to a conservative and washing their not yet energized they don't realize that this is a battle out here they just look at Republican registration\nSo if you live in orange county right to you\nI come out for dinner or what is the national national implications few few how she can do and make the different anti ... and I think average voters don't understand what it means when one party controls that chamber the Senate or the house there it means that they control the committees\nThat it it is Maxine Waters there it would be fulltime impeachment twenty flat\nOut not only that Orange County as the pathway for Nancy Pelosi we've got four seats at risk we got great candidates oddly enough of the four seats we got three women running the Democrats have three guys running\nSo so so in other words we're we're we got the right demographics you've got the right approach or getting out spent two to one six to one and some of these races we need a muscle up and get serious and show up like the Tea Party get in two thousand and ten so that's the conclusion we we got to get out there to all our listeners out there where are our women candidates were born women [noise]\nOkay was judge Kavanaugh incredible that was a blessing I you know you ... you heard the ... you heard the speech was a little you know girlie boys at that that we heard in the morning and you know this terrible victim and she looked good she had to make up ... if you didn't have any makeup bond\nOr she had a nice smile or by the way our entire statement was pre written and and circulated did you know that it wasn't on the spontaneous statement she she was all written out by her lawyers the phone she ... she had rehearsed for several weeks probably for for many years of her life because\nFor some reason she got this weird obsession against Kavanaugh cabinet came through not ... with without notes\nAnd gave gave us heart and was it was a

whole discussion is all of this is on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing it sort of cattle that we have to do it there but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done properly the Republicans when they were going to have her there there would've been different for them and secondly she would have had somebody\nPlay the role of this isn't preparations
