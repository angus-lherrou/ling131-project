these bombs pseudo bombs real bombs not real bombs in the ... I don't I don't really know yet\nAnd\nThe\nThe analysis that I have a vote I offered at the beginning of the last hour is very simply the the amount of rhetoric of hate and of\nCalls for in your face physical behavior and the actual violent behavior has been so overwhelmingly from the left\nThat it it's it's almost surreal that people would say it's the president's rhetoric\nNow forgetting these this bomb issue about which we know nothing with regard to who sent them and why\nPutting putting that aside\n\nWhat speakers are threatened at colleges do you know but for the first time in my life

of pro forma thing you know two wonderful police officers would accompany me for my car\nOh but in this case I actually asked for\nThe rhetoric of hatred or that has been directed against me in the in the Colorado State newspaper is is quite remarkable\n... it is it is probably the like lives it is all made up everything about me is made up everything\nAnd it doesn't it doesn't matter to them because truth is not a left wing value wife said that my whole life this proceeds Donald Trump this proceeds\nRonald Reagan this perceives ah\nIt it emanates from my study of the left from a college graduate school on\nIt has never\nBeen a left wing value it's a liberal value to conservative value but it was not a left wing valley\nAnd this is this is a perfect example well my mind is what I mean there are there are so many and the cost of violence you wouldn't even Mika Brzezinski acknowledged Maxine Waters telling people get into the face of of politicians\nI Wonder what I'd like to know the last time that a member of Congress of the United states\nTold people\nTo act on civil e\nTowards fellow congressman of the other party\nI I Wonder if there is a precedent to Maxine Waters truly an ugly human being and I'm not speaking of her physically I never in my life talk about people's\nPhysical looks it has nothing to do with that piece ugly in character in temperament decency and morality\nAnd it it but it doesn't matter because\nIt's you know it doesn't matter\nWhat Stewart credit Mika Brzezinski after blaming the president then goes through the let me of of you know including Hillary Clinton will only be civil if we win is it she said that there was last week Lori Clinton overturned disability after we win\nYes look the or\nThe face of the left is coming through there is a way to defeat the left though there is a way to embolden liberals\nAs opposed to a leftist and managed to defeat them\nIn this upcoming election you see it will be\nIt's hard for the left to convince the Democrats other Democrats there are after all liberal Democrats not all are leftist\nThey support all left his party to their shame but they're not all leftist but they will have a harder sell hey our way is the better way if they can't even beat Donald Trump\nOwning owning the colleges owning the high schools owning the newspapers owning the cable networks except for

that wanted to remove Andrew Jackson from a twenty dollar bill is probably the most controversial do everybody you know for the left as controversial to live before them\nUh so that's not telling you much but\nWe have a scholar on here professor of history and American studies would Hillsdale College Bradley burgers or\nJust written a new book\nWhich I Will be reading 'cause I I'm just finishing sliced sheer coincidence in ... very very very very very very very long\nBook on Andrew Jackson and I know a real interested in the American president and general and so on\nBradley ... professor of history the book is in defense\nOf Andrew Jackson and professor welcome to the dentist Prager show\nDennis Hi thank you so much for having me on a great honor\nThat's very kind of you to say I am honored so the ... the\nThe indictment of Andrew Jackson is I think largely over his treatment of American Indians is that fair to say\nYeah I think that's probably at least since the late Nineteen sixty that's been the great critique of the ...\nAnd of course that's got to eat and do all kinds of culture and especially in the textbooks that children are reading so yeah that that's where it came from and generally there other things that people will argue about but definitely the Indians problem in the main problem that comes up with him\nRight so what is your defense\nTall [laughter] what a great question especially since I have a book titled that it\nWas just I agree it's a little unfair yeah\nIt it well it is and it's also kind of one of those titles at least punched me in the face by itself [laughter] right exactly but you know there are a lot of things I think you could say about Jack the terms of putting into decline tax\nWhen it comes to the actual Indian removal I think that it intentions were good but the way that it played out is just horrible I certainly would be very difficult to argue that the way that you were removed from the southern\nWas in the course of my understanding ready to go to commercial but the point I wanted to make was that\nAt that time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some simple nothing really really went after him for being and they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president as he could really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indian to put their resettled in West to a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white\nPeople so that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what that certainly the left as if I have the time it was a really complicated issue in Jackson was very worried\nQuestion he was worried that the whites and blacks would have very very high procreate at birth rate that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them out populating them so removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures\nBut at least if he thought that the again the execution of it was horrible but\nHis intention I think was generally a good one [noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book or is it important book value don't only defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I found so I think we all do that and it's true that Jackson was incredibly violent man there's just no way around that tie in every way he was but he also had really certain rules\nSo that violence never ever can be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians and white get a deep respect strangely enough or beautiful enough yet it's strange interesting respected women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times anti traits again Indian women as well as black woman and white wearing very very well but the other thing I found about him so he's got his violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found dancing you know counter so many current politicians the guy was just\nUnbelievably honest in everything he did and I think it would it kill his soul to have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that's that's how much of a stickler he was\nAbout living out this deep deep profound honesty and integrity it's really quite stunning\nHow did he get to I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound [noise]\nOh well so you had a couple of him getting quite a few good things in a number\nThe walls but he had been pre teen in that scene and a Thirteen year old he bought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured at\nJackson during imprisonment and mouth off to a British soldier that sort of it's stored and actually beat in Jackson skull or even until it would Jackson died a dope male ... finger in that ... curies\nAnd it wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that's how deep it was [laughter] that's the kind of being ... never forget by any means but I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way I I we have very little time but I ... from you was such a scholar and folks you really should read this book I Can't wait to read this\nOr is it is it fair to say I'm totally different with beef it isn't he hated the British more than he hated Indians\nI don't think there's any question about that this is yeah we just didn't cross Andrew Jackson and because that soldier did that go ahead\nJack ... never ever yeah that's what I thought you are a delight and are the folks the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson scrupulously honest guys you can see the joy to speak to him\nAnd will do it again and uh go to a prayer for Hillsdale about ...\nAll right everybody
