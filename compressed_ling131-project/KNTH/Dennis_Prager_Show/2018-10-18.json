I only\nMentioned that because I think that that's indicative yeah ... ... of the moral state of the left and on the uh the the uh ... I agree with it yeah so let me talk to you about the water issue so are you advocating a de ... process in in California\nPart of it there's a book called there shall be water by ... go which are out to write and I it outlines how Israel turned a desert into a wonderful agricultural and by the way they Israel needed to do it it was a national security issue for them I they could give their imports cut off any moment and they had to grow their own food\nLike I tell ya we need to be able to grow our own food in California as well I mean obviously we have imports their Kimble now but if we get into a war or\nYou know California is ah the producer of most of the nuts and fruits and vegetables for the entire country and in many parts of the world to and\nYou know that's a function of having water and we also need water to live in and take a bath and ... you don't have to you didn't have to add fruits and vegetables you just could have said it's the producer of most of\nThe ... [laughter] yes and that would have been a double entendre there yes exactly by the way I I this is good\nSome little off to you but I my listeners knowing serious the very fact that you would advocate be sell them as a nation would be reason enough to vote for you\nWhen when I think of what is being spent on the train to nowhere yeah time that we could be the salad leaving water we have as you pointed out the biggest body of water on earth the entire length of this gigantic state called California and and we're told that we're that we're going to have to\nA curb our bathing and showering\nAnd people will now transforming their lawns into rock gardens it's a it's a disgrace\nAnd it's also created almost a third world in the Central Valley I mean there are so many people in the Central Valley that depend upon agriculturally water for their very livelihoods in living you know I mean\nYou know the people in Silicon valley God love them uh uh doing wonderfully but you look in the Central Valley and Victor Davis Hanson is written about this very well uh yeah it's almost a third world has some of those spots and uh they're being starved of water and I got to tell them I\nI've been with so many farmers in this race so far who are just scared\nTo death of Gavin Newsom as governor or because they think they're going to their days will be number\nI I think that's true actually ... and ... and a ... it's the symbol of your campaign that built the smelt\n[laughter] no [noise] you know the simple in my campaign is somebody sitting in their car for two hours on a ... a Los Angeles or Orange County highway burning gasoline at four dollars a gallon muttering under their breath as they go over another pot hall and\nYou know blow a tire or something like that or an insane to themselves boy I Love the weather I Love of what's going on and you know with the natural beauty of the state I get to look at the ocean every once in a while but\nYou know is it really worth it I'm living in a cracker box apartment paying Fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars a month or the rent just went up two hundred dollars a month last month and what am I going to do and you know when my kids get older and they're done with school\nWhere am I gonna live and retire I my kids going to be able to live here to begin with or where am I going to live and retire these are the issues that people are thinking about Dennis and I'm hoping between now and November sixth they really hit home and people start thinking\nWe got to change this we can't continue the same path Gavin Newsom was going to make this worse yeah\nThose exactly right uh what is your website\nJohn Cox for governor dot com\nAnd people can contribute there obviously we've got a lot of people have done that Dennis and I think there are people in the state you know some people tell me well in order to change we just have to go over the edge you know I mean we just have to have a crisis in the state but you know what I don't want to get to that point\nDo you get what we have a crisis in this thing well we do what what is that the we [laughter] I can do in the middle class is leaving California I Know who are there are ... miles of homeless people I mean one ... one crisis or they are they talking about do we do we need to lose all electric power I mean I don't even understand\nThat's what I mean I think it's like the real like the frog that's being boil them doesn't know what\nYou're absolutely right yeah and you're right that the favor of the rolling blackouts that occurred back a couple of decades ago or so\nYou know at least people can see that are of course they felt that in Napa Valley this last a week where they actually have the power turned off a in part of that is because the forests aren't being managed and utilities aren't being managed but that's another story so maybe you're right maybe they should have homeless people and maybe they're going to realize that by November ...\nDo you ever special message to Hispanics in California\nAbsolutely uh you know they're being put upon as much or worse than anybody else uh the cost of housing the cost of gasoline and all the cost of living in this day and the lack of opportunity Dennis I Hope we get a chance\nOver the course of the next couple of weeks to talk about that because my opponent was putting business by Gordon Getty and the billionaires in San Francisco I struggled I had to work my way up from the bottom I think that's a message for\nOur Hispanic population to says you know we need to make sure that

I appreciate it\nI think you've done a moral service in writing this and I was I think to be honest it was somewhat of a gamble on your part because so much has been written about the Holocaust and about the Nazis and so so I'll ask you then what prompted you to do this\nEvil I'm seeing a rise and evil in America I'm Talking about\nPeople walking into schools gunning down students\nThousands shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics um abusing shouldering a this just fall pure evil across the board and um well thinking about those stories I came to the conclusion that Americans are numb\nTo the growing evil around us and the only way that evil is defeated is if people confront it\nNot turn away as they did in Germany I'm In the late Nineteen twenties and in Nineteen thirties\nUm so I decided to write killing fast because we had written killing Patton huge success and we had a lot of research material leftover we got the Israeli government to cooperate with us on ss\nOpened files that had never been seen before which is why we're able to put the reader on a step by step of the abduction of Eichmann in Argentina uh we had a lot of new stuff that's never been put in print before\nSo I decided to write it but the over arching is I Want the world not just Americans to know that he will exist and we have to confront it\nWas it hard\nBecause of a of Hitler and what they did was they have this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised ship so they set up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted a cat\nAh and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the ... the organization had a rat line what Martin guard not from Germany to Italy gentle way Italy where they got these ss guys down there and put 'em on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina government was bribed\nTo allow them in and to keep them they're protected so the red cross out of Switzerland helped the ss so to the F a beginning CIA [noise] and so did elements of the Catholic Church\nI'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in the book and then the track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered into tracking down I meant and manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's you know surprise is all across the book\nIndividual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil which has been me my story since I was in high school so I I asked the Holocaust survivor men who went through outfits\nThe rabbi Leon ... passed away and I was with him for many many years and I ... I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does she how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their seat as him\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the ... the one thing I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters with human ...\nDo you subscribe to that theory\n[noise] capsule outta these ss people didn't go to hell university and

that modern civilization has never seen they kill babies they gas when they do the most heinous evil things if anyone could imagine [noise] and then after the war they go back to the towns and they take up their farming again\nIt's unbelievable\nAnd that's why I wanted to tell everyone to reach the book and every one that I Do these interviews with that evil exists in every person\nAnd you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you and if there's anything from killing the ss that's it\nQuiet because I'm thinking of because of one way or they used to think about
