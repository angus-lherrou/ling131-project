now five year old son\nCan not believe when a nine hour judge trial over our divorce they cannot believe our friends from a broken home\nAnd it really is they are part of our environment and what we make them but one thing I noticed was\n... years to fairly and equitably or have our son um you know shared between ... and you're you're protections in property and other things that don't really matter\nBut the sooner you get the water's out of the euro why is that you can start to constantly hear the friendship relationship with your ex wife or their trials other parents\nOkay we'll and ... ... it's a new one for me\nIs how do you pronounce your city in Georgia\nThat took over Georgia\nOkay to call a high\nAt the pleasure and I I I'm certainly agree with everybody else going on ... how much they appreciate what you have to say our mind a little bit different in that um it seems like there's a phenomenon of adult children of divorced struggling with it um and I just it seems like there's um\nThis phenomenon that somebody knows about but nobody really talking I'm certainly I think my son's struggle with um\nUm bombs over there that there'll be here and um and of course are I guess in my case I'm the father seemed like a it was the one that give Egypt um it's kind of what I've experienced and but it's mostly about um adult children struggling with their parents being\nThe how old are your children when you when you divorced\nMy two older ones were let me think er and er just graduated college and ah and then I have a younger son and a six string\nWell so okay well the youngest son is obviously not an older child oh no I have some I have a lot of folks on this question and one of them is\nJust for people to think about people who stay together for the sake of their children do will divorce after they graduate high school or will divorce after they graduate college\nOr it doesn't seem to work out quite as they think and in many instances precisely for what you point out that it really a has emotionally affected them even in college or after college is that your point\nOh yeah and even into adulthood and I'm even in the Gulf okay yes okay so I'm going to just use this to say a few words on my thank you for your call\n\nThis is a very uh it's a very interesting topic and one that I I'd like to have some therapists on the show one day and not necessarily the happiness our even I Know a\nMan a very good men who divorced and his daughters were in their thirties\nMid thirties when he divorced\nAnd he stayed with their mom in large measure it to protect them and then he did that and they got very angry at him in one stop talking to him for a while\nAnd I just thought it all of that door I never met her in my life just wanted to make that clear but I I thought she was a child who the hell are you to tell you\nAre parents or your father in this case she cannot have a happy life because you want him to stick with bomb when you're thirty five years of age I I you know I Am from what I had heard I've never I've never met the other woman but you know this was a difficult woman\n\nNow you know I Am you know this notion of IM your child you owe me I'm Thirty years old and you owe me to stay intact I don't buy it\nI think it starts to cystic right and so\nThe truth is the only ideal age if there is such a thing for you to divorce is when they're too\n[laughter] All right I mean to be honest like the best is not to divorce if you if if if you can all work out a good marriage OK second best this divorce divorce when they are very very young they don't know anything different it's it's basically a non issue if you follow the other two rules of not poisoning the parent the nuts boiling there\nBut\nI I don't know how effective I don't know and I and when I say I don't know it's not a euphemism\nFor I don't agree I just don't know is waiting till a certain age better\n\nI'll Wait till they graduate high school kids whose

calls\n\nA we begin with Kevin in Cleveland Hi Kevin Cleveland\nIdentify the Pearl is the top yeah thank you\nAll have thoroughly respect everything to do so much for your ...\nWell You're welcome\n[laughter] um my one question or I guess I got tons of 'em but I guess the one on top of my mind is that if\nIt would be an advice for honoring a parent who's withdrawn or not really interested in being involved with me and my family it kind of stems back to divorce issues and what your previous who talk in the past our um but or I guess residual effects from a divorced childhood\nBut I guess in starting a new family started over its my mom has done the same and she is totally different experience but I'm with him if if I don't know if it's more\nWhen I got me going out there trying to understand something so he ... your parents divorced and then he withdrew from you\nBut I guess not not in it or not I I'm not intense sorrow for but\nThey're like oh you're\nHaving started new families both of them my father is more kind of involved with a new you know ... ... my wife\nAnd right so I didn't want to watch summarized you accurately you're saying that he withdrew from you because he became preoccupied with didn't do that anyway All right seems that way so you're asking how old are you honor him 'cause I'm a big one on honoring parents in almost every case so I don't know so\nMy my biggest one day I Believe about oh okay well that's my biggest example of honoring parents staying in communication if they don't if they are a ambivalent or if they are recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do\nSo uh you you you make you make periodic calls or you send them email just checking I mean if they don't want to respond they didn't you we have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople for me to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't behind that a lot of people would not honor their parents so since God told me the honor my parents\nAre unless it is an extraordinary situation of pure evil on their part I have to do that how they respond is their business whether I honored them is my business\nYeah I've heard him on a one party a relationship\nYou're right so what is so you know ... you send me email and that's it\nYou you will be able to uh have a peaceful life after your parent is gone you did your best\nYou will have no guilt feelings I don't know what it costs you to periodically get in touch it's not a big deal or if there's no positive reinforcement then there's no positive reinforcement my father called his mother every night she yelled at him every night\nYou put the phone on the kitchen table I'd hear her yelling at him he pick up the phone and go yeah ma yam up put it back down and he and he had absolutely no guilt feelings after she left this world [noise]\nOkay [noise] okay All right thank you You're welcome\nIt's either this is the beauty of of\nFeeling that that ... the almighty has the creator of the earth has told me what to do\nIt doesn't say on or your parents provided they respond provided they're nice [laughter] you don't need a command to honor nice parents [laughter] that's that's the whole point it's on or your father and mother even if that twists\n\nIn fact if you end up the Hebrew word for father and the Hebrew word for ... [laughter]\nThere you go you know 'cause you add letters in Hebrew letters all have in America with ...\nA day ago I'm kidding about the twist in Paris suburbs of joke okay\nBut a ... that's that's the whole point is is this is the power of ... I'll make go make a little ad for myself please get the rational Bible it'll change your life I promise if you read the book will I promise\nI'm explaining the greatest book it it means to be explained care if you're an atheist it's called the rational by all the ... uh okay I'll leave it at that ah let's\nSee here thank you Kevin is an important thing and let's go to Andy in Chandler, Arizona Hi Andy\nCode and that's a prayer it's the talk here again like you I'm I question so my son was in kindergarten and the Catholic school\nAnd I went to twelve years a Catholic school so I Know how to discipline is and I appreciate that he recently I don't know how to approach my my son's teacher because I'm\nI'm a break your parent like took a boy's hand and put it over his crotch with clothes on\nWhen I'm Sorry I Can't wait who did this to your son\nNow my son took a boy's hand\nAnd all your weight so your son took a boy's hand and put it on his crotch on your son's clash okay\nAnd so he was put in um he was suspended yesterday right and I'm having a slow initial meeting with the teacher and you know she said we're lucky that the other parents didn't want to press charges [laughter]\nI I don't know how to follow up so why why okay so how old is your son\nSick right in kindergarten\nRight okay I got you so\nUh\nWhen you asked your son why did you do it why did he say\nHe said they were looking for a marker on her table and there were a bunch of kids looking for the marker and he just\nHe just he didn't really have an explanation\nFor it so it was like a joke it was soon\nYeah yeah I don't I I don't think it was a sexual act\nIs I don't think so and they never done\nAny ... like All right well I Want to want to look I'm happy the school didn't suspend them\nA it's a it's we live in a paranoid age in this regard today\nAs Alan Dershowitz put of sexual McCarthy is in the country in the guise of liberal Democrats the dentist Springer show by the fact that\nWell I certainly will ponder that I I don't know that I I agree with that but I\nCertainly don't know exactly anyway the issue is not even agreement the issue with us how does the juicy it you know ... on on matters of face\nA you know I always say if I don't I don't expect agreement and it it's not even a significant to me so so so there's different so what what the ... it's the values that's why we speak of Judeo Christian values not Judeo Christian theology\nI agree but I guess is the book of Isaiah for example divinely inspired\nWhere God Speaks to why you say it is just as much God as God Speaking in the tomorrow but but where you have other statements that it doesn't say and God said so\nAnd it's as I said like proverbs or weeklies he asked these that is not from God\nOkay well that's a that's a hopeful clarification of differences then I I understand though\nGood God Bless you and I made it thank you so much okey\nDokey and Kevin in North Hollywood, California Hi\nYes yes Hi Dennis I have a question for you yes okay so yesterday you had mentioned the ads with laughter is um that people\nAre\nLike they enjoy being taken care of\n'em it's human nature to want to be taking care of a\nAnd so now I'm totally big fan of yours in fact I wrote an op ed called why I left that laugh I'm In a city watch LA and forty seven percent of the reason is because you\nJust felt I you know what I'm a little hurt I thought it was forty eight but okay I'll handle it\nWell no no I'm Sorry forty seven I hear ya okay and then\n...
