age ... am ten Seventy the answer\n\nWrote a book called on friended finding true community in a disconnected culture use a man of face a at a at\nJoe ... show how are you my friend\nLike I'm doing just fine thanks\nGood good I Want to dive into the reason he wrote the book obviously social media is such an important part of so many people's lives and yet there's there are real perils to being kind of trapped in that social media bubble or not\nYeah boy aren't there um you know we live in hyper connected world and we seem to be less connected to each other and our than ever before and so that's the kind of thing I always wanted to address as to what it is\nThat makes us the kinds of people we become\nRight where you know we find\n'em just is lack of civility and I've been concerned about this for years about that the climate are personal and corporate civility\nYou know and this this connectedness between families and friends so writing a book because my attempt to address those issues and maybe offer some some really good thoughts and how we might get past that\nAnd analyze why we've gotten this far and things like that so that was fun to do\nWell and I think the reason I was drawn to your message and why I liked the book so much the biggest takeaway for me\nIs is abandoning the anonymity of the Internet and and and connecting with people face to face I mean it's been tough for me over the decades that I've done this for a living at least even with a caller that I talked to on this show where there's a name and there's a person and there's a voice\nIt's not really anonymous and yet social media has elevated anonymity to new heights and\nI fear in bowl games really really awful awful online behavior Joe\nOh I don't think there's any doubt that I think we all see that and that's the problem with that entity that fosters cowardice I think at times and I think it enables us to have I'm blessed and best of our\nNature come out where we can say what we want to say um any kind of vitriol that we want to throw out there and have no accountability so part of the problem\nIs accountability right uh when I face to face with you I I'm less likely to be that kind of person that if I were disconnected hiding behind us fire wall of him personality as I call it so accountability is an important thing\nUm and I think the problem with the anonymity of the Internet is that we only become truly him and when we intersect with each other when I see in your eyes your soul when I hear\nYour heartbeat when I hear the pop 'em ... of your dream I then become more connected with you and I am less likely to be\nI'm against do when I find out that we are\nReally more alike than we seem to be and so those are the kinds of things I think anonymity breeds on the Internet and leave the elevator that to an art form this ugliness and uh the problem is that many of our young people have a bigger relationship with their cell phones and with a\nA friend and that just continues to compound the problem because we're leaning ladder against or wrong law to get to trick community and that's what I Try to deal with in the book\nJob attack Lee is with us she wrote an friended finding proof community and a disconnected culture because you can get it at Amazon and we have a link posted it Mike online dot com or to make it easy for you to order this very very important book\nJoe what do you believe the takeaways are um in in this new world we're in and this this disconnected culture what should people be doing much debt should we take\nTo try to to try to break this pattern\nI think first of all and what I tried it mentioned in the book is um [noise] well let me take a step back you know when I'm treasury agents are taught to uh you know what a counterfeit is sure\nThey do look for counterfeit they just get to know what the real thing looks like so well that the counterfeit it's so obvious I think because many people live in a counterfeit culture they haven't seen the real thing so our job is to help the looming the real thing to them that will find\nA in their hearts something that says boy that so much better than what I'm doing now and so part of the issue is trying to help people understand what is the genius of what true community is about and the genius of our country which has found it on the knowledge that\nWe find in our motto which is one for many people are but soon them right written on all of our bills and coins and the reality of that is when we understand that\nThe diversity that God has planned in the world all that's much better than just saying that scene uniformity and so\nUnderstanding that we are stronger when we respect our differences we are stronger when we engage with each other to find out what we're really like and so\nThat it's important that we have that can go back to engaging with each other 'cause then we'll ... we'll sense what we're ... and so that's important and then understanding that we're only strong when we stand together regardless of whether we believe in what we\nUm each other's opinions and and I'm a ideas and things because it's important that we hear each other and so I like and

see why he doesn't want\nWomen [noise] I've always been a big problem to me [noise] listening to the yesterday as you go on\nAll my friends then it spring or have a male or female our every Wednesday the second hour of my show known as the dentist Prager show\nFeatures the male female our I think it's the most honest talked about men and women in the media I may be wrong and by the way if I'm wrong I Will acknowledge it [noise]\nI Want us to talk I don't mean to be the winner of the honest talk sweepstakes but I think it is at this point\nAnd as I always point out to you my agenda is to understand men and women better to have them get along better I'm not a man fan and I am about a woman fan I'm a good person fat okay cut that out of the way it's been such intensity and a male female issues in the news\nSo I decided to choose a seemingly lighter subjects I say seemingly because I think it\nGoes to some interesting distinctions between men and women or an interesting distinction\nAbove it is not of the heavy duty variety of an issue that is often on the table in our show and in American Life but I think it's it's fascinating and I think you'll enjoy it when I Want to hear your take very simple subject\nI have no I Know what came to me yesterday and I don't remember what engendered it\nSo here it's very simple what do you prefer a gift for a gift card as a gift and they\nMy theory is more men prefer gift cards and more women preferred gifts and I have a theory as to why I have that theory\n[laughter] so [laughter] this is a\nTheory about a theory my theory is women if they receive a gift they see wow\nLook at the thought that was put into this uh getting me this gift that is really moving and beautiful beautiful and therefore moving men think\nHey what a great deal I now have a hundred dollars to spend at X Y or Z that I didn't have before I could buy exactly what I Want from me thank you I\nAm I speaking for you Mr producer\nBut now interesting the cars I Believe that every one if every one of the three males affiliated with the direct presentation of the show tripled gee the living martyr and I have feminine sucks I Do I Believe that and sure enough\nGees feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card after I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation [laughter]\n\nDid they have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they had cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmission\nThat that's amazing I Know I Know I Can't believe that question did they have gift cards while he was that held his that hilarious they've gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God\nIt's this generation we keep him around as like a sort of a a a you know to stay in touch with what the with what the the new folk think anyway one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nAnd that is that that's the theory\nThat I'm I'm working women love to and by the way there's no better or worse here this is a at all there there is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nWell obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know what it what is your take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add that show what is your Dennis prayers feminine side and\nI said it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I have I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a ... [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him shoot them uh dramas where you know action to action dramas men law yes Ben love high speed car chases\nThe guy shot him and this and and as it does do not explosive ... such high explosives [laughter] drive the explosions [laughter] that was great I I I I\nI I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me but a romantic comedy I Am totally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation\nI mean I Love sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted\nYes\nI Know that guys yes I you don't even have to turn it off that's right triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you liked both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit\nBut that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the loved women I have to weigh in the ... the early days and and that's right and gift cards that is correct you see Dr ... do you see that they know that there's a gift card slip through them that is exactly right\nYeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode [laughter] so everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what if it [laughter]\nSo I Am this this is a male female should is devoted to Dennis this theory on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife I ... I\nI I I you know as well as I Know her\nAnd I could say what do you think you know my wife very well why do you think a shoe would would would\nAnswer that's a tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do I Know there is a good argument in both I think\nIf she likes the gift I think she'd be very touched but I Would be touched too if I like the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting me that\n... are are very small ... who knows better what I Want then I that's my that's my rational male brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right and so it's a generous gift a hundred dollar gift\nThat somebody's spends they have fought to it\nAnd and I know they gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing people think that you're getting them a gift certificate shows you didn't think you took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all\n[noise] listen don't couples set up what do they call when they set up an account at a at a department store furniture store\nYou you know what I mean you know weight people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't mean couples marrying set up this thing what is it cold\n[laughter]\nThis is a problem when you work with men\nUh any way they set up an account and you ... that way they could get the the the dishes they want they could get their\nRegister that thank you that's right they register with the store now All right you're right I should've known knowing romantic comedies but the last time there was a registry even romantic comedy was Eighteen sixty nine first I'm a picture of the ticket [noise] so now that's an example though right that's\nLike a gift card\n... are couples are touched by that if you give in to their registry [noise]\nAll right this is my uh this is my question here we're going to take a vote\nOr spell out the name [laughter] okay we have standards at the Prager show All right Christine I'm Sorry that you were even tangentially related to this sad moment\nShe there Oh yes I Am okay go ahead it is it is\nI I Hope she didn't get in trouble\n[laughter] well see me but it's over [laughter] hey go ahead I\nHonestly I prefer cash because it gave me a much stores ... often get choir\nWhy cause pain to lose on the twenty five dollar gift card yeah\nSomething for twenty twenty three bucks to watch and that gets quiet and you're going to be low\nThat is a very good point I never thought of that money than that but you know what this thing out there it's very interesting you're so right but there's something\nThat seems a bit about well it's yeah it seems almost tacky and it and um and it's ridiculous because it's no different from a gift card but I don't know what you give a guy an envelope with a hundred dollar bill said again\nI don't you get to spend all of the cat\nYou know no you're right I I couldn't agree more\nThat you might be the car swept up in the life will get\nA big one [laughter]\nOh I beg why [laughter]\n[laughter] that's funny that's a very funny thought you give somebody gets a big box the veil open it up there's a hundred dollar bill on the bottom [laughter]\nYeah All right I agree with you\nKnow what I Want better than me and it and it at my age you know one company that by\nWhite so you're sixty three I'm forty three would have preferred a gift yeah\nAll right so I don't think the I don't think it's age related I I Do yeah I I don't I think I think it's\nMore sex related and that's my theory but I you know obviously you you do you prefer the the the money\nUh there's a there's a there's a very a hearing All right good we have a male who prefers the gift will take a thank you Christine Marty in Indianapolis, Indiana Hi\nHey data but my first time caller as well the first time that you're right

wait so why is that a female trait\nFemale because women want to go shopping\nOh and so if they have the gift card they could go shopping that's an interesting take on this\nIn a second uh three or

just want what I Want I don't I'm not as interested in you know\nBetter than if you sell your hand me a gift it's done it's over I don't have to go shopping at the very first one I got my gift I'm gone\nRight one of the chances of you are really wanting that gift as opposed to getting what you want to\nStill more efficient because then\nIt's more efficient I don't know why it's more efficient you could do it online I mean that that takes its gotta be really lazy not took that takes time [laughter] also\nShopping and they hate shopping and I\nI see are okay All right that's an argue that's a good argument okay I never thought of it obviously\nWomen love shopping so they would therefore like the gift card considered enables them to go shopping with somebody else's money [noise]\nSo that
