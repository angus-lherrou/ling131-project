the news off this morning in my hotel room for about various uh non functioning homes\nI don't think it's worthy of\nIn terms of news\nBlog way if there's nothing is going to be learned\nThe dentist prayer show weekdays right before Michael limited to on AM ten seven the answer [noise]\nVoice have Sam alone on AM ten Seventy the answer [laughter] I hate\nThose commercials on TV that show the shivering dog show the shivering dogs that show the um I Can't stand those those commercials that show animals\nThat get I mean I I'm not exactly a hunter trust me I once went hunting and I had nightmares about the quail that I shot for when I still have the nightmare\nShow a few weeks ago I was mortified when I had the video that we stream that showed the polar bear pet in the dog it turns out it's possible that the polar bear ate the dog and people were traumatized I think we've found a better video so if you love animals and you want a happy ending\nTo an animal of video I've got one in the wild great white shark meat she'll but it works out okay somebody give you time to come to the stream and Mike online dot com if you want to watch the video 'cause it's good news I think now I Can't guarantee that the\nShield doesn't wind up later being eaten by some other white shark but this one he gets the way it's pretty cool I like these major videos at least when it works out\nI mean I Am I I'm showing I embarrassed myself over stuff like this on a regular basis you know what I was doing last night other like tough macho man we're probably out smoking cigars their buddies I was watching the wicked fifteenth anniversary on NBC\nI mean that that I used to have a friend who was in wicked so I Know and I even audition wants to be the wizard\nWas not a happy story 'cause I was sick and I blew it I might have been the wizard on on Broadway ah years ago but I miss my chance anyway that their fiftieth anniversary of Christians are Christian ... who I Love and the ... who is also tremendous\nAnd it was so cheesy but it was so wonderful it was great [laughter]\nI just want to do I barest myself hey on DVD and Blu ray today nothing embarrassing about the most talked about political documentary of the year the national issues as death of a nation\nThere are only a few days we got one wait till the midterm election this movie is crucial you got to see this before you cast your vote in six it's an explosive examination of America packed with hard hitting truths\nGet your copy to their death of the nation movie dot com it's out now death of a nation movie dot com Selma was so angry about the mayor of Pittsburgh refusing to appear with President Trump today that she called his office I've told hey Selma how are you\nKnow yes Mike I remind him that loan you weren't state of the head of the country and it's telling me what it is a long time there was a veteran too many beautiful wonderful\nBut I haven't had that I'm a citizen I don't have the responsibility to comment on call him out all night or something like that that little fellows you\nSo on white on white and how dare he he's not speaking for this was a sale also that already written document and now you know\nBut yeah we haven't I've been thinking about Selma and I'm Glad you mentioned this about about the Jewish people's reaction to to this president one of the great mysteries for me Selma has been to see\nAn American Jews turn on Republicans and Republicans arguably have such a a healthy respect and and a sacred respect for the state of Israel\nAnd yet Democrats are often taking the side of the Palestinians\nAre seemingly understanding this kind of violence and horrible things that Israel has to deal with on a regular basis demonizing and vilified Israel so along comes this Republican president who literally fulfilled his promise of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nAnd how could Jewish Americans not embrace this president\nI suspect many do and I have a hunch that since President Trump fulfilled his promise to do just that with the embassy and acknowledging Jerusalem as the real capital of Israel that you know there are a lot more there's a lot more Jewish support than any other Republican would have gotten\nOr because believe me Republican and democratic presidents all made the promise to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and none of them came through until this guy\nThanks for eight minutes before the hour one open line now eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four five three I'm going to give you about two minutes if you love animals and you want to see a really cool video in the wild this is in some I don't even some body of water I don't know where to place but it was a ... a great white shark\nI'm Anna Sale\nAnd the seal gets away it's a cool videos all planned about sixty seconds\nOr so you can see it because and again I don't know that there is not an ... ultimately a bad ending for this deal I'm praying there isn't\nBut I think we can redeem ourselves with the ill fated polar bear and the dog video that went awry a week or two ago with this video where they're playing for you about sixty seconds here's Kerry Kerry thanks very much for joining us how are you\nTaking my call on a rabbi in Ohio\nAt first I Want to thank you for your ... or the Jewish people\nAnd if it's a pleasure meeting you where you are in Columbus six game just to comment on white\nJewish people are suspicious that Republicans I think it goes back to when they were mostly the party of white Anglo saxon Protestants anti Semitism was fairly common in the in that community that things have changed in the end of the folks I Know in the Christian Community or very\nPro pro Israel and they often asked the same\nQuestion you're asking unfortunately many of\nMy fellow Jews are out\nOn more concerned about progressive politics and they are about us\nLet me ask a rabbi water what are they said about this president considering what he did with the embassy in a movie that from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem are people coming around in your community\nSome of them are there's a lot of ambivalence unfortunately because they focus you know they get they get a lot of their information from the other a mainstream media outlets\nYeah and I hear what that's about it so that was on his style and not a substance\nExactly and that's and that's a downfall rabbi that many people have and that's unfortunate because you know you gotta put your big boy pants on you've got to say what's getting done like Larry Elder always tells the joke about the the two golfers what makes a great golfer\nAnd the one guy says well I like to look at the shoulders and how he addresses the ball and where his his knees are in his hips and what is his follow through and he goes on and on with some boring explanation of the other guy says\nI Want to see where the ball lands and we like the way the ball is landing with this president even though he might not swear up his shoulders and address the ball properly alright here we go this is your moment away from politics\nWere building up a lot and I hope you have a chance to check out the video streaming Mike online dot com more and more people are doing it we had up to I think Fifteen hundred people a week or two ago and it's been kind of fun\nWe're going to also introduced this new feature the after show with Eric and ... in a week or two but here's here's the video courtesy of gravy and this is a great white shark attempting to eat a seal and sometimes great whites come out of a water to to go after their prey\nWhich is often the seals this deal gets away check it out will play this as a narrator 'cause it's really cool to have we got the video playing\nThere it is this is so cool to watch\nUh the the boat has to film it and the great white comes out of the water looking at\nAnd tries to get the CEO and can't get this to the seal the deal like we're goes away and the seal is not\nGoing to be lunch for that particular great white shark at least not that day was not that time when the people in the boat were just stunned the way they captured that\nOn video isn't that cool we try to always play some uh\nSomething that might catch your eye as you listen to us on the radio maybe you'll check us out online at Mike online dot com and

[noise]\nWonderful were truly one of the wonderful people of our time\nAnd\nUh they saw there's so much to tell you all about all of them I Will I Want to reflect on some of that because it's relevant to what we're doing but I spent the last hour\nPlenty about the the wrenching of America and one of the greatest lies not the greatest lie that has been widely believed in American history or maybe there's another one I didn't I don't know for a fact that that is the greatest\nIn the sense of most widely believed\nThat permeates the medium permeates left wing groups president is responsible for the Pittsburgh murder of the juice\nIt is the use of the dead Jews for the left and he's one of the most disgusting things and Jewish history certainly American Jewish history but they're proud of themselves because getting rid of Trump is more important to them and honoring the dead that's why it's a fact\nThat is why they were Jewish synagogues ... when Trump was elected they were proud of it they actual section but means it is the Jewish ritual of morning for an immediate family members who just died\nThe perversion of Judaism into left his ... is is rampant just as the perversion of Catholicism intellectualism Christianity to left as\nMaybe one day you will understand when I say over and over that left ... has been the most dynamic religion of the last one hundred years for a more dynamic the Judaism Christianity Islam Mormonism any\nAny religion it has been the most dynamic is conquered great numbers of Jews and Christians that's right it has that's the way it is university is is is a less this temple\nIs more dissent in a synagogue up or any on any time of the study them there was a at a university\n\nRight now Michael in San Francisco to some degree which is why I Want to stay on and play the big Michael back to you height\nSo you report it to me that the the a deal said that there's been thirty three percent increase in anti Semitic communication and what else would there was another word you use so\nFrom what I wanted her favorite that I don't want to play a word game with the Anti Defamation league of the neighborhood is very very mainstream organization ...\nIt's not a main street organization we differ on that it's okay go ahead\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] okay [laughter]\nI don't trust that if I go I don't trust it but go ahead go ahead I'm not arguing with you and my only saving ... ... ... ... do you think that the New York times is mainstream reporting or left wing reporting\nI think that the New York times you're very liberal organization\nNow okay so do you think the only liberal organization\nI yell exam or an uncle or ... or ... it is about a mainstream ... as anyone could far\nOK okay we differ on that go ahead please\nOkay for what they recorded in Trump aren't your ... your there were ... or ... percent increase and the second you're seven percent increase and again I don't want to get caught up in a word going but in Akron committed ... with the threat actual activity et cetera\nAnd more important rewriting the Trump in Pittsburgh is the right wants to limit this to nothing more than an anti Semitic or however they were very different thing about these you\nBetter and rage you're certainly anti Semitism was primarily geared for collective because the favor and this is a work directly from the ... the president in Peter coming up from the board\nOkay I'm a little I'm a little confused here who said who said that these Jews Babe Ruth invaders\n[noise] the the man with a gun who killed eleven that was\nGoing okay I didn't find okay All right fine I I Believe you I haven't heard it I Believe you you also know that you say is that he can't stand the president because the president has too many Jews around him are you aware of that you\nSaid that you said that the one thing he doesn't like about him but he also agree with you know these are his exactly where\nThe invaders or coming to the water and he wasn't talking about you you were talking about migrants which was one of his favorite topic you write in Pittsburgh have a group called ... or a big part just a group called higher\nFever immigrant [laughter]\nYou want to be older and yeah mainstream group the world they started off helping Jewish refugees refugees than any other country this gentleman\nRelax with better phrase the moment this killer was enraged at you for that reason using that word I can talk\nRight why didn't kill Christians who were ... All right so lumped arts and let me ask why didn't he killed Jews accuse me Christians who opposed the uh the caravan and a vast numbers of immigrants coming in illegally\nWell I have great that you're working you're working for ... there were a grave element to it but yeah that and and this certainly that was the thing that got killed those okay you can write Carter\nSo if I'm right so if the president also if the ... okay if the president were uh were said I think it's great of caravans of about tens of thousands of people come in ... he would not have killed the Jews in Pittsburgh\nI okay so obviously you're trying to say that there is the correct wander one correlation [noise] you\nKnow I'm not I'm I'm just asking what do you think what other by the way life is\nYou know the what what am I trying to tell me what I'm trying to say because ... ... what are you may know better than I Want what am I trying to say\nWhy don't we why don't we agree with Trump ... and ... and his supporters\nWriter okay so yes so let me ask you a question what would be how would you characterize\nFourteen thousand that's two ... worth of people a A R B you or would you call them gas would you call them refugees and they would actually that it'd be have that right or what yeah okay go on are you are okay okay are you for accepting them into the country\nI'm for a second it under the appropriate I'm now with the screening that go to everybody who wouldn't be any American Kid right\nWhat what they are not what they are not what Trump and your reporters repeatedly you've been on what you call mainstream media with by looking at that time\nIs it big they're carrying electric smallpox looking radically here almost ... years ago it took me forty years ago that they\nAre like I I think okay I under your right by the way ... well let me let me see okay\nSo let me say there is there is overheated rhetoric but I Am completely opposed to letting their man\nAnd I believe that the greater threat to America frankly I think it's up to the best of my knowledge anyone who says that they're bringing in smallpox is making a stupid argument okay I agree with you I never heard it but I Believe you that it's being set I'm sure a lot of ... things are being said I operate of smallpox okay\nAll right you're right fine Okay Michael\nI I'm agreeing with you said you don't have to debate me any more if if that is one of the stupidest arguments against is the only arguments against this is not smallpox the only argument against this is just the does America have a border or not that have to control the left essentially believes in open borders 'cause it finds nationalism to beat the testable\nThey find it to test the but when you're asked the goal of the United states\nThat's not nationalism in you know it and\nYou know wait wait where nationalism is not having that nationalism is having nationalism is having borders borders is part of being on ...\nMy my Oregon that and you know that\nWhat is what is the much more that's where we may differ I don't think it's more than that I don't think that\nYeah it is your height for protection other quarter thing that not only should we protect the border with people who want to cross that border are ... there are other alien\nOkay are we going back to that al ... thing go right word I'm okay I'm a native from the credits now\nOkay that's true we spoke he when he called animals who was MS Thirteen MS Thirteen our animals if you don't believe the Amish Thirteen could be characterized as animals\nI don't know who would be okay I think you're right so the debate isn't about the debate is not over verbiage even though verbiage matters I agree the debate is over whether the United states of America like any country can have can have a a a border\nThat can protect its borders the way Michael protects his home in San Francisco and the way I protect my home in Los Angeles\nIf America is our home we have a right to to say who can come in that's pretty elementary that's what this debate is about if the president's had only use the most congenial language and by the way I Do I have said a thousand times at least\nI Would do exactly what any of these people from Guatemala or Honduras or Mexico do I would leave the corrupt countries of Latin America and try to come to this wonderful garden of eating the United states in any way I cook I'm Dennis ... the dentist Springer show\nWith regard to violence yes there are individuals there are individuals with so called right wing agendas who've committed acts act

university why do only conservative speakers neat armed guards at universities why would that be your face just as much violence from the writers from the left why why is that how can the most radical left wing speaker needs no guards at a university\nWhy did what Ben Shapiro went to Berkeley they spent six hundred thousand dollars a for a yarmulke wearing Orthodox Jew to show up at the

hour is that\nMany people have a map they know exactly where they are but they don't know where to go\nThat is by the way that's the given in life we don't know where to go we have to be guided to where it is best to go morally\nAnd terms of happiness in terms of meaning in terms of many things so this is a big could be called I guess the map show\nOr the where to go on the map show but it's the ultimate issues hour and I welcome you all again I'm Dennis Prager thank you for being with me so of course anti Semitism is in the news so let's deal with it on the ultimate issues hour\nAnd I will offer you some thoughts I have written a book it's in its third edition it has never been out of print I began to\nWoo hoo many many years ago and it's been updated and updated and updated but the central thesis is identical to the original after all it's in each subject unfortunately it is the greatest hatred in history or a greater percentage of Jews have been murdered than\nAny other uh extant group that we can is that we know of and uh it his ah\nAh the unique aspect is key unique aspect of Jewish hatred whose name is anti Semitism to banish go Jew hatred got the name anti Semitism in the seventies and Germany\nAnd the unique aspect is that it is always a ... ...\nPeople wait you want them all wiped out they don't want them in slaves were persecuted\nThey want them wiped out that's an amazing thing in every generation has been the case there's been a group that his multitude mildly two Jewish babies there for hours targeted\nThey were by the ... Jewish adults so explain a little bit about that they put the book is why the Jews the region friendly Semitism the greatest predictor of evil\nAnd I think you'll find it riveting why the Jews wrote it with rabbi Joe ... many many many years ago and again it's been updated up there in the third or fourth addition\nPublished but I wanted to buy three publishers Simon and Schuster Simon and Schuster and Harper Collins and Rick Murray regularly published by Bible commentary from a beautiful job on my bed [noise]\nSo I have a question for you\nAs I give you some fortunate to some so I'd like you to call and we are told repeatedly today that there's this tremendous growth in anti Semitism in the United states\nAre so I have two questions one do you think that that is true whether you're a Jew or not a Jew I Want you to to tell me what you think do you experience it if you're not Jewish I mean are you a hearing more of a Jewish hatred in and talk with Jews are not present\nOr if you're a Jew or you're experiencing a anti\nSemitism at work or on your dry from home or or anywhere else I I have not even my mail I mean I'm I'm\nPretty well known Jew in the United states and where to touch them in the mail I mean there are others who do I have like I'm not saying that they don't I don't deny for a moment but I get very very little and I have I've not seen any increase the people who hate me hate me because I'm a conservative not because I'm a Jew\nSo I uh I'm I'm just curious I really am curious maybe I Am not aware\nOf this increase is that is allegedly and maybe factually taking place I Know what's taking place on college campuses that that but that's all from the left and from Islamic students that's not bad stuff from the right but that is true if one if one wants to identify\nA anti Semitism and it's increasing you say well that's anti Israel yeah but there there was very little difference if the only state on earth you target is the only Jewish state on earth than I'm Sorry but that is anti Semitic okay let's please save me said me the uh the nonsense\nThere are two hundred and something countries but the only one that I work to it destroys the Jewish state but I don't dislike Jews oh okay so you don't dislike Jews it doesn't matter [laughter] anti Semitism does it mean dislike Jews means work worked to when I asked\nHim how's that\nSo yes there has been I there is an increase on anti Semitism on the American campus but that's not what the people who say visiting present Semitism talking about they they think there's an they claim is anti Semitism that is massively increased from the right\nWhereas on the campus it's from the left and from um ... many Muslim students 'cause it's it's target specifically Israel there were students who were afraid to wear a Jewish star\nThere are there are students who were afraid to where you know all the college campus but other than that do you believe that this was in on the increase and what is your take on this uh this whole issue\nWhat eight Prager seven seven six is the ultimate issues our eight seven seven you know watch on it's been too long I needed I crave it give us the eight seven seven\nJingle [noise]\nAh right very nice oh right oh okay that's good okay very good show I'm joined by the way of showing you should know\nSang that compose that and played it on every one of the instruments [noise] marketable achieving okay he didn't mark spring Texas hello mark Dennis prayer\nI honor more hot I think there is an ikea\nIs an increasing seven minutes President Obama almost a hundred percent right on the line [noise] um it ran Dale\n[noise] um [noise] well I don't get all those things in Al Sharpton [noise] mainstream and actually in the platform and does that make credit for you [laughter] money I think that any of its okay the entire oriented\nAnd I personally had um\nWe had our money around at our\nAnd that guy [noise] taken out by someone and what is all over it and we can't you know when we had to destroy the playground [noise] um\nWhen did that happen\nIt happened and the middle of the Obama years [noise]\n[noise] All right let me react I I I just want to say okay this is an important I thank you for calling I I I don't agree I don't blame President Obama for an increase in anti Semitism and I don't blame President Trump\nAnd I don't think that conservatives should play the cards that the left does even though it's tempting I don't think uh\nI'm an increase in anti Semitism and I don't think that um that the President Trump as I Do think that President Obama increased racial tension in the country\nHe could he could have been of course are busy years Reid reassured or black America that this is a really good country\nInstead he said that racism is in our DNA spoke about ... even though it could be the white policemen was acquitted by largely black jury\nOr because he acted completely in self defense with Michael Brown was not an act of racism whatsoever for the president to say ...\nWas a disgrace to have a Al Sharpton visit him as often as he did El Al Sharpton was one of the instigators will be only put Rome in American history that word is ... minute as used by brand most university historian\nAnd describing the events in Brooklyn New York and crown heights when blacks attack Jews\nAre and they they were done by Al Sharpton\nAnd neck so yes but I don't believe that President Obama is responsible for um for increasing if somebody says racial tension yes did he leave the country worse than he founded in every way possible I Believe so but not but not in terms of anti Semitism\nOkay uh let's go to\nUm [noise] uh Dustin in Columbus ohio Hi Dustin Bruce stuffed and hold on I'm not going to I don't want to interrupt you so I hear the music so we'll take you\nSo I we hear about all this increase in anti Semitism so fewer ... tell me do you think that this is true outside of a college campus I don't I don't I don't believe it is true\nBut hey I don't live everywhere\nMore than most back in the moment\nRight you're right you're you're explaining it yeah yeah All right I I think you're you're explaining it uh\nAnd I think there is that that is part of it you should all out read the Israel test by George Gilbert who was of course not Jewish and or she has five minute video at ... university the Israel test\nAnd he uh he explains that point in his unique eloquence with his unique eloquence that he is these are\nMajor ... one of the major thinkers in my in my one of the major ten thinkers living\nSo he uh he he ... resentment if you if you resent success not just financial but also financial then that's part of what\nComprises anti Semitism but anti Semitism of course as I point out has been the elimination element we will lie like that and the guy in Pittsburgh settled Jews must die\nThat is very rare among ethnic bigotry is there a million ethnic bigger trees in the world this try this try this nation hate this nation is religion hate this religion cetera et cetera but the notion that every one of them must die that is such a unique situation ...\nThat's why Hitler thought that you wish babies must die\nSo it's a it's been a\nIt's a very serious hatred but again my my question is do you think it's increasing in the United states or do you think that that's a exaggerated I I it is increasing I'm a ... but it's increasing to my opinion on the left\nAware or anti Zionism had substituted for anti Semitism anti Zionism is a form of anti Semitism or folks if if you have any intellectual integrity you will with knowledge that\nI have to say that the only state in the world the only people on earth who have no right to a country all the Jews is anti Semitic okay if you if you think Italians don't ever write to Italy then you're anti Italian even if you love pizza and you love a Vivaldi and\nYou would love a Italian opera\nYou know ... and ... it's irrelevant\nOkay even if you if you if you get a polio vaccine you could still be a an anti semi by the way these people that would give you an idea of irrationality all Jews ... Jews must I how do you see this guy might have had polio it was a Jew developed that'd be the polio vaccine in so many other medicines\nAll Jews must die but I still like to benefit from all of their medical discoveries\nBut I listen to it it's not like the these guys think rationally anyway if you read about this guy in Pittsburgh use total loser eat he even the New York times which is of course blaming Trump\nOr even they they had a whole profile of the guy he was he was essentially invisible human being zero friends on the face of Iraq and them all the Dennis ...\nFrom the relief factor main freeze new to him [noise]\nMedical Tuesday Afternoon to you it is up to one thirty now thank you are listening to him ten Seventy the answer traffic in one minute and we'll give you the latest news right now [noise] with that sort of\nNews I bought I knew in Washington mentor as Boston gangster James Whitey Bolger has died in federal custody his death comes nearly five years after he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life\nIn prison he led a largely Irish Mob that ramp loan sharking gambling and drug rackets he became one of the nation's most wanted fugitives after he played Boston back\nIn Nineteen Ninety four\nVoters are said to be mailing in their ballots are handing them and it drop off locations rather than building in a booth auto election day that trend said to be accompanied by rise concerned about whether those ballots will be counted voting rights activists want how the election officials to notify voters if they're about has been rejected for any reason\nAt all street the Dow Jones industrial average doing well right now it's up by about one hundred and forty seven points but as ... while the U.S and the five hundred a ... more details of that sort of a news dot\nCom [noise] stuck in traffic we got the answer [noise]\nIt's one thirty one thank you for listening to am ten Seventy the answer and the dentist Prager show Michael met at the top of the hour Larry Elder at five Jay Sekulow tonight at eight and we'll get back to Denison two minutes now a second to get the latest traffic\nWe accept fans have right now working ... the ease him he's a ... point boulevard to that whole branch north side of the St Louis vehicle has the right side of block to look out for an hour forty five and I feel a and bond between rap fat I'm Debbie sex and that's where the scenario is that\nThe update is brought to you by your sins saves dot net you could say that the half off on closing restaurants all unproven items entertainment and more go to Houston saves dot net for this which selection that's Houston saves dot net\nAm seven days the answer [noise]\nThis is Jennifer Horn for Salem Radio network\nJenna craft resorted to extreme measures to defeat justice Kevin ... even though they lost they apparently have no shame or intention of changing their ugly tactics Republican Senator Susan Collins much first bribed then vilified and threatening for supporting him\nWhy the ugliness as we look to the election Democrats are terrified they may lose government support for their argue supporter Planned Parenthood\nThey justify this quote protecting women's health but it's really about money and power they didn't mind risking the health of Dr Christine forward their star anti Kavanaugh witness after living in twenty sixteen and failing to stop this Supreme Court nominee that behavior after last has turned a radical and dangerous it or not the reward and\nJoins me and voting Republican on health effects\nPepperdine graduate school of public policy learned more at public policy Don Pepperdine dot edu\nPaycheck Joe Millionaire you release are without my fellow if you haven't gotten more if you really need to get one of the customers who are going to get them better night's sleep\nPilots Alexander of my fellow is a very special offer for him to Seventy five one get one free that's right you buy what you get one free day if you're looking for a great I sleep now is the perfect time to get your first\nMy pillow and call it however the semi for sixty five forty to use it for almost ...
