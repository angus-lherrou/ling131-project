always love the scene you're successful projects before we get into dive deep into depth of the nation\nAnd why it's been so warm we received by millions what can I Want to get the ... national issues or world view on the state of discourse right now you're in the arena you're fighting on Twitter you're battling with your movies your books\nUm there is a word a bad spot everybody agrees on that I watched last night a debate with a between Tucker Carlson and some little liberal um activist who said no there's no civility take away Susan Collins honorary degree getting their faces when when they go low we kick them like Eric Holder said\nDidn't actually I I I I'm proud of what I Do on the radio and proud of what you do each and every day but it is there a way we should pivot or modulate or change our approach to try to make things\nLess volatile in this country that we love the show [noise]\nI I don't like that where a kind of in a in a Lincoln moments you might call it in American politics than what I mean by that is that they can or a mild mannered\nModerate man of moderate disposition\nSomebody who would very much like to have\nBeen difficult issues of his time resolved amicably but what he noticed was that there had been in the proceeding decade a gangster is nation of the Democratic party\nA Democratic Congress men literally whipping I'm Senator Schumer a senator or a Sumner I'm In his office with a cane a ... a celebration and glorification of violent um and\nA Lincoln realize that in that environment the idea of just issuing uncalled for ... uh it's not going to work\nI mean and the analogy for today would be if you look at the Ninety five thousand roaming on the campus driving speakers off the campus intimidating colleges into canceling event or if we knew nothing\nIt's the fact that it means that day their strategy paid off and so this is the reason why when you see a gangster is based on the other side there is no alternative\nBut to get tougher and I didn't knock and say that we should do what they do um just just because they drive out because of the gap that doesn't mean we used to drive the goes off the campus right it does mean that we have to hold them accountable or the Republican Party needs to have a tougher fine\nI think that was part of what prompted trying to do and I got a look\nAnd Lindsey Graham during the cabinet hearing for example where the Republican Party that is a little bit like a invertebrate uh then it has been over the past Twenty years\nYou know I I uh I I encourage your I'm I'm thinking about\nPeople being held the restaurants and shouted down and Hillary saying there can be no civility until we the Democrats when she said until we win in November we never act that way we never do that to other people we never we would never do that and we wouldn't accept that there is a stark difference between the way\nPeople on the right and and in fact many independents react and the way these activists\nI'm behave and punish the the fact is\nThe the the lack of denunciation by Democrat leaders or the lack of condemnation over some of this degree just behavior it's a it's a it's a powerful and type it on the Democratic party of twenty Eighteen\nIt is very revealing and certainly to the degree that we can dramatize this and make them pay a price on the ballot box we should\nBut I Would go beyond that and say that if they got caught getting even more out of hand which I think it's quite likely are particularly if the Democrats don't win the house Republican hold the house and Senate and then we're on to twenty twenty um\nI only expected to get worse and I think what that means is that on certain campaign ... schools like Berkeley dropped back to end up spending and the national guard a and\nAnd I think Republicans ordinarily would find that extreme shouldn't because protecting people First Amendment rights I mean what could be more fundamental than that\nThe theme

women and disgusting women had disgusting that\nThat's just the way it is I think it's pretty even actually [laughter] okay [laughter] I think it just works out that way it's pretty even so this is pretty honest talk sometimes the ...\nThe subjects are less intense than others but very revealing today is a less intense but very revealing subject\nAre you ready here it goes deep your honeymoon correctly predict your marriage\nWon eight ... seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six did you have a great honeymoon\nAnd you ended up with we've understandable ups and downs great marriage\nDid you have a lousy honeymoon and turned out to be indeed a lousy marriage or a lousy honeymoon the great marriage or a great honeymoon and a lousy marriage\nHow accurate is the honeymoon in predicting what happens in a marriage I\nAlways ask my motto is no such thing as old but I I usually ask couples or individual actually use but usually a couple of cars they're divorced I I often ask individuals\nWho were divorced Wendy the you know it was bad it was a bad marriage and it is amazing how often I yeah I hear that you are well there\nIs to tell you the truth or the honeymoon\nI I Am quite close and it's not my my wife but I'm quite close to a woman who is that is exactly what happened\nIn her case he was a very romantic a shooter of her they got married fairly quickly and on the honeymoon and a lot of his awful traits actually appeared\nAnd she wondered\nWell I guess I'm a male putting words into her mind I I don't know if she did but I assume she wandered who did I\nMarry and it does this portend accurately or am I Am about to experience in the marriage\nAnd incidentally if the honeymoon if on the basis of your responses\nI don't find a particular\nRelationship between the quality of the honeymoon to Michael in any direction it might be a lousy hunting when the great marriage remember a I'm offering that it's just as distinct possibility the other way around\nI have a larger question that is worth it I think the exploring\nHow important is a honeymoon\nI can see a very good argument for\nRight after the marriage\nJumping into a normal life I can also see a great argument for getting away from every body of just having time for the two I\nI I'm not an advocate here about having a honeymoon I'm not an advocate for having one I think that there are good arguments for for both\nOr delaying you know for six months or something some people do 'cause they just can't get away at that time but I I don't know the answer I don't know if the honeymoon\nAnd it has been a a generally positive force in bomb being people or irrelevant or even counterproductive I don't I don't have an answer to that\nIt would be interesting study to engage in however but that's not really the question it's it may be the upshot of the hour but it's not the question of the hour the question of the hour is\nHow much related uh is was your honeymoon as if to the rest of your marriage was it a good predictor all righty\nLet's go to our best in Philadelphia Hi Beth thank you for calling\nTo talk to you good um so my husband\nAnd I we had over how do you mean by that and\nWe actually just got to go back to you that this summer for the first time after I celebrate ... years and the second time around it was\nJust as amazing as the first time um but that one one funny thing from our I thought whoa has never\nBeen together prior to our honeymoon we definitely have to get to each other [noise] um [noise] you know little little habits like for example um you know I I really like my place in like ... and and you know he'd be\nWaiting and waiting for me to what you said that we can start our days activities um but that you know the hunting for free they can get away\nFrom everyday life had to learn a little bit about each other um in in in ways that we hadn't gotten\nSo you know I Am for from what you said you were not living together prior to marriage\nFor religious reasons yeah\nSo that you you have just given me another topic for a male female our\nBecause I Wonder if the honeymoon is not more exciting if you didn't live together\nAnyway\nI mean how could it not be\n[laughter] I mean that was it that is definitely a a big anticipation for the wedding night for sure [laughter]\nI like you are as your husband is happy as you are\nOh here's an incredible man that I Know\nWow you are always gotta\n[laughter] veteran amount or that is an honor I Would love to read the two of us know when I I really my next time you you got to come to a speech but my next time in Philadelphia\nOkay All right thank you\nGod I ... I Love her demeanor that is great by the way when a white says to me that my husband is the best man there is I Can't I I Want you to know\nI feel so happy for both of them\nThat's won every man wants his wife to think he's the best guy in the world\nJust the way it is we don't have the same exact needs from one another that I have explored with you on a number of occasions I'm a male female our\nBut that and I mean and that and the fact that she's bubbly I'm happy guy really a painter but I I'm going to definitely raised that issue about so it's a it's another issue is it is the honeymoon\nMore exciting if you didn't live together 'cause presumably if you live together you've also traveled together okay and let's go to Mike in Chicago little micro Chicago Dennis Prager\nRight now to talk to you you're such a beacon of hope and commonsense freedom and I appreciate every or else they make\nYou make you know yeah it's a great topic\nFor me I met this beautiful girl I think I was at a bit of a rebound you know just trying to have someone in my life and yet broken up and a couple of weeks later she let me know that she was pregnant and so I said okay we'll get married because that's\nThe way I was brought up you know you do the right thing but I wasn't really in love with it because I was damaged good going because it might the horse and\nFill our honeymoon was a duck ... that I had planned in Arkansas which she was not interested in but it was very selfish\nOh [laughter] yeah well yeah and I hold on hold on [laughter]\nThis is truly is [noise]\nWhen real life is stranger than fiction movie back home\n[laughter] this is a relief ban for you to the\nI haven't done the kind that one I write my satellite\nYeah exactly I I think you had a better [laughter] I think so yeah [laughter] so how did it turn out how'd your marriage turnout\nRoom bad marriage and stuff around blind though I think a lot of that half of the fact that ... and then going to conduct together and the thing that we thought and there are together has man a stronger couple and\nYou're right that's right and a little bit where everything to each other well ... ...\nYes thank you what a beautiful call you know what I you know what I realized she was missing in this country because of ... people who produce or a TV and movies\n... when was the last movie or a this is not a rhetorical question I made I I'm I ... I may be pleasantly surprised by the response but when was the last movie\nOr TV\nSitcom or drama about a beautiful marriage\n\nYoung people for decades now in the United states have not\nBeen shown the beauty of the beautiful marriage\nSo it's no wonder that marriage it's one of the many reasons it's about the only woman I think the breakdown of religion is the biggest but\nThis is a big one too they can't even imagine that I mean how many Heidi's did they me\n\nIf the if the people in Silicon valley with their their tens and hundreds of billions of dollars wanted to do something positive for

approach reality but obviously with a person is it looks looks as a\nAs someone who is a\nQuarter to quarter winner and saying you know what\nI got married and it's the best thing that ever happened to me [noise]\nI think that would have a real impact\nMy God if you if propaganda could scare people about second hand smoke\nWhy can't good propaganda get people to get married [noise]\nMale female

Hi\nHi how are you I'm well thank you\nOn it and it's an honor to speak with you I think that you're in a long time was\nWonderful thank you\nGoing on now we're going to have a mom this week or next week\nAbout a Portland and about the violence of the people and the FAA and over the leftists and the police doing absolutely nothing in Portland and there's an article that I don't want to read to you from in\nToday's a or on today's National Review sites to Minnesota Republican candidates assaulted\nI predicted I wrote a column on this about a month or two ago that the left will be violent and it\nIt's so obvious that only fools can deny that the violence in this country will come from the left it almost always does there are right wing outliers of course who commit violence\nBut the right wing conservatives do not countenance shit but left wing does\nThey think it's OK and again it's it's because normal rules do not apply if you're on the left ... you know I see these things and I know when I say that there are a lot of people listening who think that it's exaggeration\nI Know that it is if it's something I I I live with until I'm vindicated later by events when I said there was a civil war in this country uh you know people\nMy respect greatly like Jonah Goldberg said at that then is is overall on this issue you know we should use that rhetoric it's not as so yes it is a civil war say always said it's among violet\nOr but it will be by what the left is violent the left everywhere in the world is violent not liberal left this or violent because normal moral rules do not apply to them that's another column I wrote recently they are Hooper mention\nLeft this do not believe normal rules apply to them so I read to you a vis a from national view today\nTo Republican candidates for state office in Minnesota had been physically assaulted in recent days leading prominent Republican lawmakers to caution their democratic colleagues against employing inflammatory rhetoric\nGood luck Republican state representative Sarah Anderson was punched in the arm last week after confronting a man who was destroying yard signs promoting Republican candidates\nIt was just insane he was charging at me saying why don't you go kill yourself Anderson told the Washington Free beacon\nTo have so much physically coming after you would attacking you is just disheartening course she's afraid to use real reason\nThe left produces evil people and this is an example of that that's what she should upset but they don't say because Republicans don't understand that they are the thin line between a decent seat and in decency\nThat is it just like the police are the thin blue line between chaos anarchy violence\nAnd peace so to the Republicans are the are the the imperfect
