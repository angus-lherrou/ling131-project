explains our free press happily I live in the country to free speech free press\nGovernment does not control newspapers do you get the truth and over the course of my lifetime and\nMore of them at this very\nRealize you're ... maybe the ideologically and is a brainwash\nThe dentist prayer show we ... news right before Michael ... into on AM ten Seventy the answer is Simone\nShow is conservative team that weekday mornings at seven AM ten Seventy Lee answer\n\n\nFreaking now on the Mike Gallagher show All right this story is developing and this will definitely change the narrative perhaps\nOf those who are suspicious of ah Democrats being behind this mail bomb story because now authorities say they have intercepted a device that was intended for the White House\nA suspicious package containing a pipe bomb that was addressed to the White House was intercepted that joint joint base bowling in Washington\nD.C law enforcement officials have told authorities atoll and told the reporters\nAdding that this pipe bomb intended for the White House was similar to the ones center the homes of Obama\nClinton and billionaire investor and major Democrat donor George Soros which was discovered earlier this week the devices appear to be rudimentary but functional\nThe White House addressed device also contained\nProjectiles also moments ago the New York city police department\nAre confirming that the time Warner center in New York City where CNN has a bureau has been evacuated was not immediately clear who the package there was addressed to what CNN evacuated the newsroom as a precaution I'm also again the\nUnited States Secret Service edited intercepted too suspicious packages addressed to Obama\nAnd Clinton or earlier this week so this is again this is why speculation as irresponsible it's not a just sit around and say now I mean what what does this do to your narrative that you think the Democrats are behind it\nOr I guess the if it's a Democrat who's behind this do you think sending a package a pipe bomb to the White House um changes that that that theory we have to be responsible let the Democrats with their stupid wild speculation about Trump\nBeing behind the murder of ... a ... in that and the turkey consulate let them run their mouths and do all that kind of crap we we shouldn't we shouldn't do that and I don't believe we should speculate but obviously many people disagree with that's okay that's where we are here for eight hundred six five five Mike\nHere's Darrow on this breaking news story hey Darryl welcome to the Mike Gallagher show how are you\nAt your very much like a cliche yes and on on the situation because it's very important that uh we don't get these people it's kind of credit because\nMore than just a a prominent party to a Democrat because they ex president former president and secretary up\nIn the United states and a crime against any former president all all high stakes you'll\nFrom the United states crime against the people you know so and in and then we have to realize that one day out President Trump is on the former president do we want things like that it happened to him you know so\nWe shouldn't we shouldn't allow them to be credited ... any party when they caught because that's unimportant they committed a crime and\nThey should just be punished but I find that they committed\nAnd it doesn't matter what your political affiliation is male one not know how to write it does it does not matter of fact you're Daryl I appreciate very much it's kind of you I again\nI but I get the speculation I understand cynicism I understand um the deeply skeptical way we're we're treating the the ... the the the arena right now we're in the arena we're fighting the top of a tough battle and there's some nasty ugly vile stuff happening out there for crying out loud somebody\nDrew a Boulder through a house majority leader Kevin McCarthy is office in Bakersfield, California um\nWe've seen the the angry mobs and the and the the viciousness of people chasing people out of rooms but again this is this is not limited to Democrats Nancy Pelosi was harassed at some of them the other day by a bunch of uh\nOf loud mouth or angry people who were cursing at her and calling her name's may assure her out so again we got to just take a breath we've got to take a step back\nAnd we need to be calm we need to be adults we need to be responsible and it's not responsible the moment there is a a breaking news story like this of reports of pipe bombs being sent to the homes of the Clintons the Obamas but White House CNN shore oh\nI've got a caller here Ron suggesting that these bombs are are are being sent to try to make the Democrats sympathetic\nWell then why would why would the evildoers why would the monster sending these send it to the White House changes that narrative you just can't do that you you you just got to have a responsible reaction to this but listen we need to be about trying to understand what's happening we need to stay focused we need to know what the stakes are\nNobody is is going to vote or not vote because of a report\nOf pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats and the White House remember according to the latest news the White House now has also been targeted so this transcends political differences let's be Americans let's stand up against evil\nAnd let you know the difference between right and wrong and not get show swept away by our political differences that we would want any harm to come to our political adversaries because\nThat that's not what America is about\nSo much for joining us here I Am ten Seventy the answer for the Mike Gallagher show people here all day long for news opinion passion you've got Dennis Prager Michael my bed Larry Elder the great Sam alone will wake you up tomorrow morning and I'll be back with Sam after that it ten am I Hope you have a great day as always\nThanks for your producer class Anderson or operations director Eric cancer and our creator services director Peter effects most of all to you\nFor joining us how great day be safe I might Gallagher God Bless taxes God Bless America\nAnd I take away reason and accountability\nTo be and I love him for\nHe almost\nOn a sec [noise] ... me a ones she doesn't want to\nSee was he doesn't want\nWomen have always been a big problem [noise]\nListening to you have to go on and on\nEverybody I'm Dennis prayer and this is the male female our\nEvery Wednesday the second hour of my show was devoted to what I Believe it's the most of us talk about men and women in the media at this time [noise]\nAnd as I often point out if it is not the most honest then I salute those who are more uh\nI I totally prepared to be in second place on this\nBut I I don't know where that might be found at this time and the reason is I don't have a male gender agenda or female agenda another man than ... than I Am a good people fan\nAnd there are just as many good man is good women and just as many awful ... ... that's just the way it is it's almost perfectly apportioned\nFor every foolish man there is a foolish woman and vice versa for every good man there was a good woman by and large have large in some societies you will find more of one type than the other I think\nBut any in any event good people do grow on trees where they're male or female my topic today\nIs the column that I Britain this week and it is largely about young men and the question of ambition one of the things\nThat renders men mass killing in the eyes of women or at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case I Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say regiment renders a man sexy it was one of the things to a woman is ambition knocked\nCrazed ambitious miss narcissism no ambition I Want to get ahead I Want to be successful\nAnd ambition\nFor all of western recorded history\nWas largely I Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children I Wish to provide for a family\nThis is one male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was what was assumed it was so so much of a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed\nWill you grow up and be able to take care of a family that was male ambition\nAnd my sense is that that has been killed for many young men because it has been killed\nIn the society the notion of raising men boys to be men first of all is it believe it or not is almost considered\nArchaic today a be a man that that is so sexist be a man or data show patriarchal or some other is unbelievably destructive adjective useful\nThing for a boy to aspire to be a man what is a man a man takes care of the family\nThat is the primaries up the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element cat will I take care in all senses of the word we'll like take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men from my generation to today even more so today\nOh we're taught that hey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family\nThere's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do the female will pull her weight as they say she will row hurt or just as much as you will roll your or you were all a boat with two or has been and so the notion that that I as a male will\nNeed to take care of a family is is considered again patriarchal an archaic\nDo you agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition\nI I Wish to get ahead I Wish to six\nYou need a I Wish to take care of a family that this is endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they exist they exist even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion\nSo if you especially if you are a woman or if you have a daughter who is dating\nOr do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat well I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who is not particularly ambitious who was more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I had the census I told you\nOr as I mentioned I didn't tell you I Am in any in any lanes but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experience is test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers in the Los Angeles area\nAnd my sense and they were all wonderful people are there was this news no knocked on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly a ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars yeah but it doesn't matter you still have to be passionate about your work even if you don't care about the particulars\nBecause the the more that you were passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nThat my father wanted to be a doctor\nHe couldn't afford medical school so became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about is far from being a doctor is you can get but he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work of all it's all too well at it\nSo the question on the table is ... young males and ambition now overly ambitious is not good overly anything if it's good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean is there there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good thing can be over done\nSo I understand you can have too much ambition because then it's not ambition to take care of a family in an ambition to do good it's ambition to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super powerful\nAnd that's not a that is not admirable that someone I'm Talking about but the absence of ambition in men is in a mask you leading characteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed I Want to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat's a good thing and it and and in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman\n\nBut I I Believe that society has played terrible tripped on both young men and young women is told them that they are at the same is told young women that they are sexually the same as men\nThey could enjoy any number of hookups just as much as men can with no emotional price paid\nAnd now what do you think why do you think of this idiocy of or rape culture charge if colleges exists why do you think it exists it exist because so many young women have had sex with the leader regretted so rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term rape culture\nThat's that's the genesis of the a phony charges of rape culture and it's by the way this proves that it's phony the proof is the parents and their daughters to college\nNo no parent in the world what's in the door to door rape culture I mean what are we always joking do we ... what ... what are we living in the New York times\n\nAnd they told me the same thing you know you know you know women women will carry half their weight and in any in any deal and not by the way guys you don't have to get married you know what's what's in it for you divorce is a fortune anyway there's nothing in it for you you know women are available\nAnd so that doesn't breed the type of man that a fair number of women would want for a mate [noise]\nMy theory if I'm wrong\nI'm happy I'm wrong [noise]\nI Would like to be wrong male female our I'm Dennis Prager\nAnd on and you know well that is that as an exceptional teacher and part of the reason I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California Dennis Prager Hi\nHi how are you at a\nWell thanks so\nAir my intellectual hero ally\nFor taking my call I think that kids today are really ...\nI think a lot of them are pointing and raising children\nAt home in studying for my parents taught college that men and women are very excited and then I got married and had cats and actually at solving now that that's not true\nAnd I think that ... because\nIt had a baby so stay home and take care of the day that went off to make money and then why didn't make her isn't really motivated to which is harder now than it used to be\nA and then everything is now we have in common than love household\nSo they're not being raised by I'm not sure who are boys and girls after school programs and I think everybody is\nWell I think that that's to a large extent except when you know obviously quite wealthy homes could afford a on a few ... or at least one and you know we can work but for the great majority of people I don't think it has worked to kill all the well\nI thank you for that and the K and live in Cleveland Hi\nKayla I've been to Europe

girlfriend who was like two and a half years and like I Want to marry her but like I don't want to I can tell I'm able to support a family\nYeah I don't happen right where you are you by the way I I don't I don't understand since you want to support a family and since you both have to live on on some income at this point\nI don't I never ... eyes literally have never understood the notion I won't marry until I couldn't afford to a show we stay on with me 'cause I admire you tremendously for your attitude but I don't understand this assumption is that you only get married when you're

my twenties\nI never lose sight of the fact people want to hear what I have to say how could I dislike travel if the reason that I'm traveling is that people want to hear what I have to say\nThat's why there was no happiness possible if you don't look at the big picture all the aspects that he is there any job on earth aspects of which people don't enjoy do that there is no there is no such job but doesn't exist\nYou like playing baseball and you're paid well to play baseball there were no aspects of of being on a I'm a baseball team that you don't enjoy of course there are talking about travel these guys do it for half the year it constantly\nAnd the work out that they have it's not it's not all farm but any baseball player who whose mind is still intact knows how lucky he is\nTo be paid to do what he loves that's the only way to go through life is to have a perspective on on what you're you're doing so too do you enjoy every single aspect of it there's no such thing it doesn't it doesn't exist\nBy the way I\nJust like to note for no other reason than I Would like to know what it is today is October twenty fourth twenty Eighteen and my late mother was born on October twenty fourth Nineteen Eighteen\nNo Nineteen Nineteen I'm wrong when my dad was Nineteen Eighteen\nI made a ... my dad was a hundred would\nHave been a hundred in July my mom would be\nNinety nine today yeah she was one year younger\nStuff\nYou know when you think about like the roaring twenties you think of the Nineteen twenties but we're going to be entering very soon we're entering the twenties again\nSo what are they going to how are they going to distinguish between the twenties and the twenties I don't know maybe they won't be roaring and that's when we'll know the roaring twenties were the Nineteen twenties and the non roaring twenties or the twenty twenties who knows\n[noise] any way mum wherever you are and I believe you are somewhere happy birthday from me from your baby\nAll right everybody\nHow to make America America again elect Democrats and win back the house\nOr the Senate the emotional basis of left wing sauce is\nSomething I've been pointing out my whole life Thomas Friedman is a perfect example of it like to repeat program and he is considered you know one of these thoughtful liberals he's not even\nHe doesn't call himself a leftist but he hates the president and this is they they hate the president to president represents everything they load the people who vote for them or low some were deplorable we are the opposite\nOf the Tom Friedman we are where it's just the fact we lived differently uh we uh many of us are religious many of us uh or like guns remember that cling to religion and guns\nOr many of us are to actually get the chills that the star Spangled Banner many of us think of this elderly contemptible to ah purposely Neal in front of hundreds of thousands of people rather than stand for the national anthem\nMany of us think that the United states is the greatest force for good many of us think that it's the least racist country in the history of the world many of us think we are blessed to be American so we're we were different than if you guys are in the Tom Friedman world\nBut I like to I'd like to read to you because he is one of the more eloquent spokesmen he knows how to use the language so I I I don't I don't want to use a\nA bad example but the best example that the left has so Thomas Friedman in today's New York times okay it's titled how to make America America again elect Democrats\nNow the very notion that you're going to make America America and abide electing a left wing party is is in itself and absurdity\nTo the left wing all over the world which is to undo the American revolution and to preserve the French Revolution me to get philosophical for a moment\nSo America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats are in power to have a more of a a far more socialized economy as an example\nReally All right so let's take some of the things he says some of the things he doesn't talk about\nThe begins what is their left to say about the terrible murder of moderate Saudi journalist ... and its aftermath by the way I don't know if he was moderate or not and I don't know if it's relevant\nIf if the guy was moderate or not moderate\nOr what was done to him is disgusting we all agree on that one of the few things left and right can agree with only one thing and I said it before but I feel it even more strongly now in the mid term elections vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats\nWhy does this have to do a well we'll we'll find out what this has to do with your Marcus jokey then he writes I don't say that because I'm particularly liberal\nOh really\nYou're not particularly liberal\nThat's fascinating is that why would you you're not even particularly liberal you you're not let alone left is you're not even particularly liberal Tom Friedman but you want people to vote for Democrats campus for a Democrat raise money\nThe Democrat drive someone else to voting stations to vote for Democrats [noise] so you want the left wing party to win but you're not particularly liberal\nOkay I just want you all to follow the logic here and wants to shift the whole country the liberal agenda I say that because I'm particularly American man I Want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy and politics\nReally the best of American values and and uh was was that was that for example on display or when the when the rock Obama pulled out of Iraq\nWas that the best of American values in international policy was the shipping of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime\nWhich is worse W. O. R. S. E. then the Saudi regime in terms of doing evil on the face of the earth evil means hurting people your case it meets a definition\nThis is not a religious terms specifically it it's not a complex term evil is the greater amount of hurt this is dumb to innocent people is greater amount of hurt them to innocent people by Iran or Saudi Arabia the enemy of\nSaudi of the enemy of Iran is\nYet Mr Friedman so if you really care about humanity why wouldn't you while we all recognize how primitive the Saudi regime is\nAnd and it's institutions nevertheless I don't have a choice between a wonderful place and the ... I have a choice between Saudi Arabia and Iran just as\nIn World War two we had a choice between Stalin and Hitler and weak correctly choked Stalin who even killed more people okay that's that's why I don't know what you mean by put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\n\nHe really takes on the tough issues Tom Friedman hey anything word there about the universities in your column you proud about what the Democrats to Brett\nKavanaugh Thomas Friedman do no I just don't know 'cause there's nothing there\n\nJust to bully trumping Republicans the same way he has them\nOh you poor bully people\nBut I'll take that chance because there was a basic respect for truth science in decency and the Democratic caucus you've gotta be kidding\n\nThe people who deny that there is male and female in the human being\nFor respect for science you're You're Joking correct truth truth\nUniversities are committed to the truth the left one is the university's Tom Friedman is there a commitment to choose their\nDecency who who who\nDecency as to what the democratic caucus did to Brett capital\nDecency\nYou're the you're the temerity Tom Friedman to speak about the Democratic party and\nDecency the left and decency\nAfter after the the ... Republican after Republican who was gotten punched while campaigning gotten shop while campaigning well no ... and the others were shot at a Wal playing baseball sorry not campaigning\nAnd what about all of the all the Republicans who have dinner and people scream obscenities in their face and you talk to me about who's more decent\nGod he was living a very very wonderful a power away from reality\nUh what else does he say I know the two more years of the GOP holding every lever power and blindly following Trump's basic disrespect for true science of decency there we go again see it is so fascinating they they they throw out these gigantic charges I it's all generalized and I generally watch that but I give you specific\nI just gave you a specific for every example\nWho's who's been more indecent Republicans or Democrats in the last two years\nTruth without power today is just background background Muzak moved back to the march of the Trump Administration you see I can write that it's vitally important\nFor global stability in the protection of journalists everywhere that those who executed and ordered the murder of cars show he be punished really it's vitally important for global stability\n\nI think they have to be punished I couldn't agree more on moral grounds for global stability when was the what did he write about the need to punish the Iranian regime for what it does to journalists\nI was just reading a report about the rape centers in uh in in Iran for women caught up were anti regime I missed out on a girl I guess in the\nIn the a celebration of the Iran agreement that rock Obama me back in the moment the dentist Prager show real\nFactor pain free studio Mm\n[noise] well that's already news I bought I knew in Washington\n[noise] stuck in traffic we got the answer\n[noise]\nOne thirty one now Wednesday afternoon with Dennis ...
