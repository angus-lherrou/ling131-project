I always have a hard time with that word and by sticking their collective heads and this and\nThe the ... Morgan is referring to the poll that came out this week the show's Trump at a forty seven percent approval rating according to the NBC Wall Street Journal poll forty seven percent\nObama was at forty five percent at the same exact stage of his presidency right before the midterms\nOf twenty ten so Trump is according to the NBC more popular than Obama was at this time in Obama's presidency how can this be happening\nThey will whale uncontrollably writes Piers Morgan what the blank is wrong with people who like him they will how do each other's kale salads\nThis was the end of planet earth they will sob in their normal understated manner [laughter]\nAll of which will be music to the years of Trump\nA man who absolutely rebels and liberal hysteria because he knows it works for him there's this new poll proves the more Trump bashore scream abuse at at about him the more fires up his base and indeed the more fires up Trump himself after all at its heart the presidents of street fighting New Yorker\nWho loves a good scrap and into each time writes Morgan he may delivered the biggest knockout punch of his presidency until recently it was widely assumed the Republicans would lose control of the house in the mid term elections\nIt was being depicted as a damning referendum on Trump and historically most presidents like Obama take a whack in the midterms but now he says I'm not so sure\nIn fact I'd say there's a very good chance the Republicans will hang on to the house as well as the Senate and Trump will move on empowered emboldened to what could very well be an even bigger winning twenty twenty why is this happening he says well first the U.S mainstream media has become the boy who cried wolf\nTheir constant collective outrage over every tiny thing Trump says tweets or does much of a driven by commercial self interest has had the inevitable effective diluting the impact about outrage barely a week goes by without some supposedly new Trump crisis fueling wall to wall cable news coverage\nAnd dire predictions of impeachment or even jail time for Trump yeah within a few days\nEach administrators shouldn't threatening scandal quote unquote dissolves into a giant nothing burger\nShe says I look at Democrats today and I see a party that's learn absolutely nothing about how to beat Donald Trump and I see a president who's growing stronger by the day Trump has become a political Godzilla crushing everyone who dares challenge him and bulldoze his way through an agenda that is beginning to pay real evidence that he goes on to list all the accomplishments\nThe tax cuts the regulations the economy North Korea trade war with China Trans Pacific part all the things and he's clamp down hard on illegal immigration\nPiers Morgan says as I write this caravan of thousands of Central American migrants most of them from Honduras is moving toward the southern border they intend to try to enter the U.S illegally\nIt's hard to think of a more powerful image to vindicate Trump's much criticized demand for a new wall isn't it as he tweeted full aperture being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border the caravans or a disgrace to the Democratic party changed the immigration laws\nNow Morgan says he's the president is beginning to really enjoy himself he is exhibiting an Arab someone who's worked out how Washington works or rather doesn't and how to play the broken highly partisan system to his advantage\nLove him or load him Piers Morgan writes in this terrific piece there is no desire to deny that he's winning\nOnce again I can only advise the Democrats to stop their ridiculously self defeating state of perpetual Trump outrage and work out how they're actually going to beat him because right now he writes Trump is kicking your\nButt\nAnd he does not use the word but he uses another four letter words it's a great piece by Piers Morgan\nI wanted to share with you here on the Mike Gallagher show want to remind you about our friends of the job creators network you and I know that off year elections are about one thing showing up or two weeks from today your tax savings or on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's great comeback\nYour jobs are on the ballot there's a lot at stake if you want to preserve the victories of the past two years I Want you to get involved good at tax cuts ... dot com number one you've got to vote that your friends to vote and then go to tax cuts work dot com the only way we're going to lose\nIs if we don't show up if we don't turn out do your part get involved get engaged good at tax cuts work dot com we're not going to let them out work\nUs in November\nYou could be involve people ask me all the time Mike what can I Do here's a piece of advice gonna tax cuts from work [noise]\nFiery money you're listening to the tennis Prager show [noise]\nAnd during the first hour I played for you just a few clips from the president's speech in Houston and how terrific I thought the war and how disgusting to left thinks they are\nSo it was worthy of extended analysis\nWhat it is they hate they hate the word nationalist as an example\nAnd I gave my supplies for you a quote\nFrom the European Union it's visitor center of the European Parliament has a plaque up national sovereignty use the root cause of the most\nPart time and the steady march of humanity back the tragic disaster and barbarism the only final remedy for the Supreme in catastrophic evil of our time is a federal union of the people see they believe the bigger the better the American\nFounders thought that since human nature stinks the\nLess power concentrated in individuals hands the better\nSo but the left police people were basically good especially themselves they know that they are basically good because they're enlightened and therefore all the power that they could have will only be used benign ally that is what they believe these people are fooled by definition\nLeft this may be sweet they may be a whole host of things but to the extent that they have left wing views they're fools and foolishness begins with the belief\nThat power concentrated in a few people's hands if they are lightened enough is just wonderful they really do believe essentially in benign dictatorship\nThat's what they believe the founders believed in diffusion of power separation of powers\nThat's why we have a Congress that's why we have an executive and that's why we have a court that is also why we have a U.S Senate to diffuse power among the states the left hates the Senate\nHates the Senate\nBecause it doesn't just reflect majority will because after all Wyoming with with fewer and fewer than a million people has as many senators is California worthwhile I don't know thirty million forty million people it's completely non democratic which is exactly what they wanted it to be\nThey did not believe in democracy that is from their perspective and its lack of faith in humanity mob rule\nSo folks this is just unknown today because you don't learn that at school who's going to teach it to you you're a left wing professor they don't even know what I just said it's not even a matter of suppressing if they've never heard that\nThey don't understand that if the diffusion of power amongst many is a guard is guard against dictatorship but\nThey walk the EU wants more and more power they're perfect example concentrated in Brussels that's why there was a ... they were shocked that that a majority of rich did not by the idea that Britain should seated sovereignty to a larger\nInstitution called the European Union if you believe people are basically good then it's great\nTo concentrate power in a few people's hands if you don't believe people were big she can be good you have to be an idiot to concentrate all that power in a few people's hands\nBut as I said they believe in themselves if they don't believe in God much but they sure do believe in themselves we know what's best for you\nEnvironmentally and sexually and artistically you name it yes indeed we know that exhibits featuring fecal matter and urine or really inspiring\nEvery year I bring the periodically a few times a year the latest great art exhibit of poop or pee literally ...\nThat is the state of much of the graphic arts and the pictorial arts in our time so\nThey yes they love the Erdely there was something beautiful about ugly anyway the president is the anti Christ to these people\nHe comes last night and he says I Believe it nationalism yeah call me a national is not a global is drove them crazy\nSo I played for you as well as the worship of God or government the guy's become ... he's a more\nSerious theologians and Ninety percent of the practicing theologians and the guy probably doesn't even know the word theology\nI'm fully ... fully capable of acknowledging that fact there were Eighteen thousand in the arena\nLet's see uh go to number five there how could the Democrats win with what they stand for\n\nThat go for I guess Vegas a\nSet of a tax cut he got out of the big news from the X. ray [noise]\nThat to me\nWhich means\nTax cuts there again law enforcement they're totally is ice and law enforcement\nAgain military and then I Do that\nHow do you win on that but [noise]\nBiggest regulation cuts in the history of our country and I'm only here for years actually\nQuite a bit less than two years ago to think about it [noise] and we've already done more tax cuts and we've already got what we've done more regulations than any other president in history and that's for you [noise]\nTo come into our country we have a three point seven percent unemployment soloist is spending more than fifty\nAll right so talking about the coming into the country here's an editorial in today's Wall Street journal the march from Honduras the caravan to know where this is revel authority\nBuild the details are murky we do know is that former hung during congressmen or pull off when dish of the left wing a Libra party\nHas admitted to organizing the caravan but that's news to me or do you think about that I Believe in ... is the party of former president Manuel ... male folks I talk to you about July a great deal I went down\nTo Honduras when that whole issue of presidents alive took place remember he was kidnapped\nAnd he was he wanted to squash the constitution of ... and take over\nThis was a big big deal at the time labor is the ... part of your former\nPresident Manuel ... an ally of Venezuela Cuba who in two thousand nine wow that's how long ago was nine years ago yeah we yeah we were there\nIn ... it\nWas an amazing thing to experience\n\nTried to override the hunt during constitution to remain in office despite a term limit\nYeah you remember that the\nConstitution advantage of of ... said you have to leave office after a certain number of years and he wouldn't certain number of terms the Honduran Congress\nHis own party I remember this now the Supreme Court the national um ... and the Catholic Church opposed his power grab he was removed by the military and never return to power despite the efforts of the Obama administration\nNumber that to the Obama administration tried to put it back in power\nSomebody asked me recently on myself the worst president in American history was and I said right now my theory used to tie between Andrew Johnson and Brock Obama\nI have often said bronco bomb was the worst and I could make a good case for it but it's okay if he's tied for worst\nBut the as when you have the entire media backing you up\nIt's very hard for people to perceive much damage you do every time he said for ... and we knew that\nHe wasn't interested in furthering black white relations he was furthering and he was interested in furthering black anger\nThat whatever their plight they cannot stampede over America's southern border that's correct\nYeah\nIsn't that isn't that sort of why would that be obvious why why why feeder of foreigners\nSee the fold while you were racist why are you at any of these things if you oppose thousands and thousands of people coming into your country illegally\nMaybe that's the difference between the nationalist than than a nationalist you are allowed to ask by the way ... ... people to say what is best for me\nWhat is best for my family what is best for my community what is best for my nation and what is best for the world you\nYou weren't allowed to do that but here's the beauty in general what is best for the United states has been best for the world not because I'm an American there my saying that I'm saying if because it's turned out to be true\nNot always by by no means Americans have been ... have been myopic at times there's no question about it\nNevertheless you would have to ... anybody would have to acknowledge what is it in world interest that the United states when the Cold War was it in the world's interest that the U.S when World War two was it in the world's interest if the U.S when\nThe uh World War one was it in the u._s. interests for that matter that the U.S defeat communism everywhere\nWhy why you see in the world insurance to have communism ever victorious unless you don't give a damn about the people who suffer under communism\nAll the global list you rooted for Ho Chi Minh that's the irony the American nationalist rooted for America in the Vietnam War the world's the world global lists the world's global lists rooted for Ho Chi Minh\nSo let me ask you a question which was better for the globe a communist victory or an American victory which produced more suffering an American victory or communist victory\nSo they're full of bologna even in their concern for humanity they're much more concerned and hurting the United states in helping humanity\nHow else\nHow else do you explain the fact that people rooted for Ho Chi Minh all over the world all these global lists wanted this Vietnamese Stalin to win\nIt's a moral fraud all of that stuff it's just the fraud but it sounds great oh I care about humanity\n\nThat's what turned me off to

Alam in uh in Ohio makes the same point thank you Alan\nAnd let's go to die in Cleveland hello Diane Dennis Prager\nHi Hi Denny I'm my comment is about the caravan of town and it sounds silly\nBut really um why couldn't look at it and complement to President Trump's presidency that found that people are my team to America and I just think that's probably\nWell it's certainly a complement to America the truth is that it happened it all under a under President Obama and the economy was was not good\nYou are right that there was a if they know how good things are in the United states in how low the unemployment rate is so that they could most likely get a job but uh if it's remember ... look let's be honest compared to hunt derision Guatemala the American economy is always robust [laughter]\nSo if these people aren't sitting down with the wall Street Journal and checking out the stock prices that they they know where it's better here is the point though that's the key point\nAnd that is just should be made every single day why would these people want to replicate the failed societies from which they come\nBy the way I Know again for the left who in their superficial little intellectual bubble think that to say something is a failed societies to engage in racism it has nothing to do with race that is one hundred percent values zero percent race\n\nWhy can't people ask why is America prosperous\nIs is that if you want to ring Guatemala\nYou every one of you listening if you weren't grow out of Guatemala and and see there during the hunt Doris around El Salvador\nAnd watching or in Brazil doesn't matter any Latin American country essentially and watching your society just be mired in poverty and corruption why wouldn't you ask the single most obvious question why is America affluent\nThere was no other question anyone in Latin America thinking about the economic situation there are other situations but thinking about economics there is no other question to be asked\nWhy does America work why don't Americans asked that question why does America work but they don't\nInstead the left asked asks why is America so racist and Xena phobic and homophobic and Islamophobia could cetera\nWhat you what people who care about people as opposed to get just care about anger should be asking is why does it work\nThe question in this question intelligent people thoughtful people ask if not why even Americans have slaves it's wide in America abolish slavery\nIt's not why use their poverty in America it's why use there so much affluence in America every question asked is the wrong question\nThat's that's the point that needs to be made something just that just came to my mind I was just reading about the likelihood of Americans of different Americans when I was speaking about Americans complaining on the left\nThere was just a survey done about who is most likely to demonstrate\nAnd it the the results were fascinating and it

thirty six percent of Americans report having quote ever felt the urge to organize to participate in the public demonstration the poll fine\nBut if that crowd more than half of Democrats and nearly

fool in my opinion some people escape on harmed but many failed and secondly because they teach you implicitly from up explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n\nWalk to what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender\nWhat does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department\nIt shows a lack of wisdom because he wrote the wisest please written in the English language but it's not value\nAll that matters is not wisdom but in this case race and gender so they they dismissed him because he was a white\nMale and they put up a female I don't know what color\n\nWisdom without wisdom you can't do good\n\nVis and good is what most concerns me good versus evil you can't be a good person if if you're a fool\nAnd the food is the opposite of the ... person and those of you who are biblical you oriented build up the word fooled is used pretty often\nWhat does the fool the food was the person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nYou with me if it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if only that sinks in in making political social policy for\nA society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion compassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassion that doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion compassion without wisdom is overly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies were going to continue the discussion about wisdom but I give you an example here I\nFeel bad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits\nBut the ... pursuit asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is it compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with the wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is in talks wisdom isn't\nSoft it isn't taught because it isn't soft\n\nI Believe ultimately that the radical secularization of western society is at the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nWhen I get calls this I have I Know I mentioned before when I get calls here from let's say twelve or Fifteen year old\nAnd the kid talks about important things of life I Am certain that they are in a religious home and in every case that it's turned out to be true\nThe twelve or Fifteen year old if they would even listen to discussions of grave issues like I have a my show even if they even will they were called in about let's save the planet\nThey wouldn't call in about an issue of wisdom\nThey would be worried for people they would be again compassionate without wisdom\nThis is the great problem they realized that in college so I have all these professors who are very very bright very very male legible and totally on the wall place they didn't understand life\n\nI fear for a society that does not value wisdom and that is happening in all of western society\n\nWhen a Prager seven seven six is the number
