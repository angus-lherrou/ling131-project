keep fighting the good fight I might Gallagher\nGod Bless Texas and God Bless America\nAnd it is [noise]\nHello everybody I'm Dennis Prager and this is broadcast every week because life is a challenge for the vast majority of people\nI Would say there's a tiny sliver of people for whom life has been pretty much a walk in the park I knew\nTo such people\nAnd then it to the last years went on a walk through the park but it's very it's it's um it's unbelievably rare unbelievably rare\nIt's for people it's varying degrees of challenge but that's that's the way it is that's the reason I ever happiness hours reason I wrote a book on happy as a result I lecture on it\n'cause if you can bring people to understand certain things than you can increase their happiness and if nothing else at least have them act happier because that's a moral obligation not to inflict bad moods upon other people\nSo today's subject is a as a life change or if you take it seriously\nWe determine how others see us\nYeah you get that\nPeople think that some objective reality determines how they are seen by others but the truth is your behavior determines how you were seen by others\n[noise]\nAnd I'll give you an example you you may recall the the show which is a remarkable woman\nGail McWilliams who is blind and who if you meet her\nYou don't think about her blindness you just think about jail\nTo scale is charming and Gail is full of life and\nThat's in other words she's not when you when you deal with her you're not thinking the whole time she's blind you're thinking the whole time she scale\nThere are blind people with whom you would think the whole time\nThat while I'm On I'm dealing with a blind person\n\nThere are people who have I'm giving you some pretty dramatic ones and the issue here is not blame or anything like that it was just to tell you the truth about how you are perceived and I'm going to give you other examples all of them are sensitive by the way everyone was sensitive example\nAnother one is ... parents who lose a child\n\nThat can become and I'm not blaming or anything else but I'm just describing the reality that can become their identity\nThere so and so\nShe lost her son she lost her daughter he lost the daughter she lost to some\nOr that is part of their by auto biography but it is not the defining element in how they are perceived because that's not what they radiate\nWhen they meet you\nWhat ever it is you or the one who determines how others see you\n\nBut it's also true we'll give you another example for minorities whenever the minority might be racial\nOr sexual or\nA a religious you determine\nBy and large certainly in the United states and the United states you determine how you are perceived\nIf you are a racial minority and you are\nOr your self perception is as a a primarily a victim of racism you will be regarded as overwhelmingly a member of that group\nRather than as John or Susan just take two common American names\nThey're probably not that common now frankly you want to look up the most common names I should learn what they are and use them now what's the most common birth name of the last ... for girls and boys\nThis is this is a big big deal\nYou you are a you are written a religious minority you you\nAre the one who sets the agenda on the house majority will regard you\nKnow people and minorities don't think that way they think that that's how they're perceived the whole time\nI suspect that there are\nNo we haven't we have the names there the link or going to need to link though I mean it was the main but it's okay it's okay you did you did or\nNot now no no no no no I Know that are here we are baby ... dot com and the answer is\nFor ... nuisance okay here we go for like ... I don't believe that Liam\n\nLiam is the number one baby named for boys this past year\n... you don't believe it or why would they make it up\n[laughter] who has a ...\n[laughter]\nPeople break up the cause they ever ... but ... it's ... it's very that now number two I Do believe below\nWhat what\nWait a minute now the female number one is Emma I Believe that number two was Olivia\n\nVery very nice and what is there we go number forty\nIs savannah how many savannah is the you know\n\nAnyway All right so that's what I'll do now from our I'm OK Liam or ever right go by the way of John even on the list\n...\nJak is yeah I Know but I don't put all there is no joke it's amazing with Susan on the list\n\nThat's uh you got to go to Nineteen sixty to give Susan ...\nFeel terrific [laughter]\nBen is on the other hand you have to go to the nineteenth century\n[laughter] you\nKnow it's not there are no young ones I'd anyway\nYou on the one who sets it you know I I have been since I was in my twenties I have often been in places where I was the only Jew and I realized very early on it is up to me\nTo make everybody relaxed 'cause they ... it was a great it was a great revelation to me that the the obligation\nIronically 'cause I I I Believe Americans of goodwill and couldn't care less your religious ethnic racial background doesn't matter you want if you're gay you set the agenda whether do they see you\nAs Liam how's that act or as a gay guy you set that agenda\n\nDo they see you as primarily black or Hispanic or in my case as a Jew or do they see you as Dennis\nIt doesn't deny that you're a Jew doesn't deny if you're a black and doesn't deny if you were gay doesn't deny you if you want every minority group here in it doesn't deny it but you don't wear it any more than you where I'm blind or you where I have lost the child\n\nIs almost impossible for me to overstate the importance of this subject because we have it all backwards we think that that's the task of the majority to make the minority person or the person who was different\nFeel great yes to a certain extent but without their cooperation if they wish to wear their identity that\nMakes them different

Khan one in in Nebraska I how do you hear what you owe your community you know an effort to get them out there and an Asperger's antisocial behavior or you just\nWalk away ... ...

I don't have an answer to that are that are the only thing you could do is ... is really sort of acknowledge while I always say the elephant that is in the room say look\nObviously we really differ on these matters but it's\nVery important to me that we we just continue to feel good about each other in every way possible and be loving\nAnd if you are on board with that I'm On board with that and and let's just let's just put this stuff aside because we're not going to convince each other and what does do is is cause tension and its gratuitous tension because family\nIs is a given you you know you you you don't want a divorce members of your family and and I think you could beat up\nA Frank about that\nShe she er and hope that it moves the person does that sound reasonable [noise]\nYeah you're on going after it so\nThat well if you're the only one who makes the effort [noise]\nThings you know then you ... you you have to debate whether it's worth it ...\nPerson like that doesn't hang around opposition they usually go back to their you know there are going\nThere no I Know they do run affirmation of what the issue was your relations with that person not whether the person will
