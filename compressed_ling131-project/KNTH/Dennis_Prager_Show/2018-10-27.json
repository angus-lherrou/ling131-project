media focus on the wrong story again that actually\nTurns off this morning in my hotel room for some ... million homes\nI don't think it's worthy of around we our coverage\nIn terms of news\nAll the way if there's nobody wants to be worse than this radio show we knew right before my limited to own a um ... the the\nOnes who will be a million\nHave flashy flunk he's every were why she's one\nCountry yes they are done ...\nThan\nWe are wallowing in champagne this is money matters with Ken rape but of course I Am your host ...\n[noise]\nThat could jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved\nAnd most valued clients and we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states infinity\nOn beyond and you know what buses right we want to help more people\nDo their retirement planning than anyone else that is our goal and uh so um because of bad we primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that as you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nAnd I ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that went on that might give it to my clients well this is the part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you know I\n\nWould only say you\nKnow my ... may be and\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay\nSo as I mentioned the gift tax\nExemption is Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] ah almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon\nYour death then it goes to whoever um and they wanted attacks so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax it all happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they died as no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we are going to tax\nIt anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realize that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with this with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can give to\nAnd as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as you wish to the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd by the way if you exceed that Fifteen thousand a gift tax is the same as the state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count\nMy advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college I'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo ostensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember the bury the ones that got the berries something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are from that uh we uh we ... we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon and so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website\nAnd when you're there you have a lot of options one is you can get my market alert email which I send out weekly and uh you can get that so that to you know if we decide it's time to get out of the market or whatever you'll be ... will be a a telling you that as we did in November of two thousand seven we started to get out\nA well also what when you're there you can sign up for one of our seminars we have seminars near you know if you go to a Center You're going to get one now one of our world famous oatmeal raisin chocolate chunk cookies and these cookies or one inch thick there six inches in diameter folks I dare you to eat more than one of them they're a meal ended up themselves\nPerfect time to insulate your home\n[noise] now if you're interested and you're going to be listening to this program you are special individual because you're going to get a special rate so on top of the lower prices are doing due to the seasonal low prices you're going to get some special so stay tuned in listening closely [noise] All right so\nWe just being the time to insulate what are we insulating ... we're going to be insulated with John's man vote fiberglass inflation is the best in the world it feels like cock and it doesn't scratch doesn't itch it's ... allergenic\nAnd it will not mess with your asthma anything like that so it's a great product and it offers you an hour value almost three are value per inch [noise]\nNow the code in this area is Thirteen inches so if we added Thirteen inches at three are valuable and you're going to be at our thirty nine\nYou might say well Dave I already have insulation will I just need to add a little bit more on top or do we ... the old stuff out\n[noise] yeah most times you're just going to need to add a little bit on top so\nIf you had lived in your house for a while you've never had your house insulated chances are you going to have some shrinkage especially if it's older insulation\nThe product that we use is guaranteed not to shrink more than an inch over ten years so you have a product that is going to keep its our value and that one little inches really negligible we're talking about a three are value so you won't feel it as much\nSo let's just say over the years you've lived in your household and you know that your installation is woefully under insulated [noise]\nAnd you have about five inches of inches insulation we're going to come in and measure everything assess we your energy losses and then we're going to recommend probably an eight inch ad\nNow you're going to get that special agent injury rate that we have only for listeners of the energy our so take down this number and keep on listening to the show\n[noise] our phone number's eight three to four six or seven one seven six when you call you're going to get a friendly staff member that's going to take down your information is set you up with a free estimate\nThan would've are professionals is going to come out we're going to take some measurements we're going to look at the condition of the attic and we're going to recommend some improvements that can help you ultimately you're the boss you are the foreman and so you decide how much how little you need to do and will give you the recommendations\nThe best thing that you can do in this season's going to be added solution\nAt some air flow if you do those two things you're going to have an addict that is definitely going to hold back the heat keep the heat in your house when you spend a lot of money so you might as well hold on to that money and the short term investment uh is definitely worth the long term gain [noise]\nThen we may recommend a so addict fame which is going to pull out the moisture from yet\nSo that you don't have mode and more ship building up again our number is eight three to four six four seven one seven six so you're going to get a free estimate\nYou're going to get a Ninety sent the square foot rate low price now that low prices only for you because you're spending some time with me right now and I really appreciate it by the way [noise]\nAnd then we're going to also offer you some special other other special things such as free battles to keep the air flow going through your attic is again another mode preventive tool\nAnd then within also if you get this or addict fans which by the way have a two hundred and fifty dollars deduction because you're listening right now\nWe're going to give you free roof blown that this is the time of the year when you have pine needles and leaves on your roof so since we're already up there we are going to do it for free I stay too so here's what we're talking about we're talking about added insulation during the most\nOpportune time to do with which is these next two to three months\nWe're going to offer you a great great because hey we want to say thank you yeah you could be doing a lot of other things there's a lot of the stations you can be listening to but you're listening to the energy our with Dave brown and that's pretty cool thing and\nWe're going to reward you for that now with top of that we're going to show you exactly step by step scientifically what is going to happen when we make the changes to your home\nImmediately when we had eight inches to your state five inches we're going to get you to our thirty nine [noise] and I have thirty nine is basically the are as I always talk about every show means resistance it means resistance to the transfer of heat so now you're not going to leave your house\nAnd guess what's going to happen during the summer months the heat stuff going to come into your house\nAdded installation during this time of year is the most important thing you can do to get your home energy efficient more comfortable and habits saving money rather than spending\nHeart and money if you could say fifty dollars a month that it's at the end of the year\nSix hundred dollars that you can use to it many other things so most times you can get out of your investment in less than two years I'm Dave brown disadvantage era stay tuned [noise]\nYou are listening to the energy our with Dave brown check out they've rounded buddies that I'm for low rates on insulation slate embarrassed so it had a sad scene\n[noise] hey\nYour what would you do if you're a he was running all day long why that's easy I'd call adding buddies addict buddies George loves them [noise]\nWelcome back this is a round and this is the energy our so we talk about the way in our solar fans addict insulation how we can save money on your energy bill\nWe ... we have to we see [noise] yeah\nWelcome welcome welcome my name is Dave round this is the energy our\nIt's called the energy our because it's an hour of informing people just like you on how you can reduce their energy usage\nIn your house and save money and keep yourself comfortable because ... really has a huge connection to energy if you are under insulated in your room you're certainly not going to be comfortable right so we're talking about saving\nYou energy not let you lose your energy to the to the wild you don't want to heat up your house and inhabit just pass through your walls and do your attic\nSo quickly you rather stay there longer now he's what happens when you have a properly insulated home the heat stays in your house longer\n[noise] it also then doesn't have to run the third the uh the heater as long because hey it's already warm so once your house heats up to a specific temperature that you set by the way [noise]\nAnd that he stays in the longer well what happens to the heater it shuts off it just shuts right off so since that shuts off now what are you doing you're saving money and you feel more comfortable to his what happens to a draftee house if you have a draftee house you know what I'm saying [noise]\nYou can have heat is so you turn on the heater\nIn aid will run and run and run and it will run\nIn your bill is going to come back and you know holy cow what is going on with this bill you're going to hold it up like a piece of paper and you're going to say to yourself [noise]\nWhy am I doing [laughter] right so we definitely want to reduce that with the added insulation ad insulation ads are value our value as a resistance to the transfer heat we're not worried about the cold the cold is going to take care of itself we're concerned with the keeping our heat in the house [noise]\nSo you do it now during this time of year and then you can track your progress and see oh wow I save money this month oh look at my bill this month [noise] holy cow I say fifty bucks\nYou do that long enough you out of your investment most homes especially at our special radio rate of Ninety send a square foot and all the others specials that you get the free baffles um all of the things that help preserve your household right\nWhen you combine all that now you're really saving money\nAnd and at that low price you can typically get out of that investment within about two years or less depending on how much energy you're wasting if you had no insulation in your ad insulation oh my gosh your bills are really going to reduce so\nLet's talk about our value again our stance for resistance to transfer heat degraded the arm value the better resistance to the heat\nDuring the summer you want to keep the heat out of the house during the winter you went to keep the heat in the house so this is right as the perfect time to get it down now let's talk about our solar addict fans we have\nThirty watched Remington solar addict fans lifetime warranty by the way free replacement if there's any damage their hair resisted these also come with a thirty percent federal tax credit so anything that has a solar panel attached to it\nIs a available to take advantage of the I. T. C. credit which is an energy credit study percent of the price of install now today what we're going to do is take off two hundred and fifty dollars for the radio listeners only so you have to call in doing the show if you call an actor and fortunately does a special go away [noise]\nDust mites feet off the mold and daddy human skin and they are just horrible creatures to having your attic if you were to install\nToo so addict fans based on your square footage of course sometimes only one you would see it drastically reduced chance of getting mode and your addict addict buddies eight three to four or five eight four zero three six for free estimate welcome\nBack this is a round and this is the energy our so we talked about re embarrass solo fans addict\nInsulation is how we can save money on your energy bill ... [noise]\nThank you [noise] thank you very much [noise]\nHow ... how old it thank you\nThank you thank you very much welcome welcome what this is\nDave brown and if you're clapping you probably laughing because you know you're hearing some stuff that is making sense to you and your no dummy you're very intelligent and most people that they have done studies in most people that listen to talk radio I tend to be more intelligent people because they\nLove to learn and talk radio is about information so this information is probably the most important information you can apply towards your home to make it energy efficient I mean before you get a new stove or a new flooring and\nReally want to live and how much energy efficient um it it's going to really set the tone and how you feel in your home in how you feel in your home as vital as we all know [noise]\nSo you'd be surprised exactly how much insulation changes the way you feel inside of your home and dealing in your room comfortable is everything right\nSo let's fix that let's fix that with some some knowledge some information in some action and so the information is we already got that coverage we know that our value improves the\nAh in Mississippi or the transfer of heat it slows down to the transfer of pizza that you keep your eating your house and then it keeps the heat out during the summer\nSo we know that the higher our value which is what insulation provides\nAnd again I'll let you know we use John's men all blown in insulation and it is the best on the market the best on the market because we compared it gets all the other products and do some of them are actually cheaper for us to buy John's Mandel cost us a little bit\nMore\nBut without transferring that cost you you were giving you the best product the lowest price\nJohn's man's though\nA bloated insulation gives you the highest our value preach\nYou add in eight inches on top of your already five inches you're going to bring your installation up to our thirty nine are thirty nine by the way it's the code in this area so you'll be a new house level efficiency when it comes to insulation\nAnd so now we're talking about more comfort you're talking about being warmer after you get out of the shower because you're he hasn't left the building so fast we're talking about a lower energy bills because you're heaters not running\nIs starting to feel good I could hear the music playing behind this [laughter] so\nOnce you do these things you're creating an environment in which you create an environment that environment sustains you and makes you more comfortable it makes you happy\nSo that's the magic of insulation right\nAll of the other products that say the solar addict fanned radium barrier that is the support product that goes into helping the overall health of the home radium barrier rejects ah the radiate heat\nAnd solar fans sucks out the hot air and it also sucks out the moisture\n[noise] with our solar fan it's made by Remington so it's a brand that you can trust [noise] it is higher and or the solar addict fans at thirty watch not ten or twenty ... thirty what that means it has a strong demoted it's going to suck more air at higher rate [noise]\nFifteen hundred cubic feet per minute means that if you have a Fifteen hundred square foot attic every hour even exchange completely off the air and you stick\nSo what are the chances of you now getting mold or any kind of Moshe buildup\nShould go down shouldn't it\nSo that is what you're talking about when we're talking about the addict buddies program the the insulation the radiant buried the sole acting this is what we're talking about [noise]\nAnd there's a way that you can easily take advantage of all these things including getting two hundred fifty dollars off the fame and free uh estimate the free baffles the free software clearing\nA and that's just not giving us a call ... three to four six four seven one Seventy six we have professionals there on staff waiting to take your call they will take a call doing this program only to get the ah the benefit a desk eight three to four six four seven one seven six\nNow want to talk to you a little bit about a product that we have called the buddy box the buddy boxes of stair way insulated ... is our brand made by addict buddies it goes in the stairwell and it is your first opened in peels back\nAnd here's the reason why this is a vital tool for any home number one\nTypically what happens is you lose a lot of energy to the pool down the addict stairwell because there is no insulation over that if there were insulation over that every time you open it would fall on your head wouldn't it [noise]\nSo the stairway insulator insulate the stairway it's it does what it said we call it the buddy box because it looks like a rectangle box that zip is open and its metallic and reflective so it has our value and it has also radiant reflectivity [noise]\nAnd it has that low in Mississippi so if you stood under the stairwell on a hot day you would not feel the heat\nAlso if you stood under during a cold winters day you will feel that you heat is staying in the house so back stairwell is probably a major you're losing probably three to four rooms of energy every single day do that stairwell\nWhether buddy box will put a stop to that right\nNow we've got a value price for the radio listeners is normally two forty nine installed but to which you're insulation install we're going to give it to you for Ninety nine dollars so that is a huge discount we're going to say be quite a lot of money so\nTake advantage of that as you can get the buddy boxer Ninety nine dollars than Ninety send a square foot rate of in St insulation a you will get the free baffles which are super important for keeping air flow otherwise if you didn't have battles and you're blue in insulation you could possibly stop up the uh the Airflow step up yourself a dense [noise]\nSo you get that and then you get the free stuff at clearing along with that and you're going to have a nice beautiful energy efficient ask my name is Dave brown decision to energy how are we talking about insulation I Want to talk about different forms of bin Laden before I give you a chance to give us a call into the show\nI wanted to talk about ... ah we definitely have the one of the most professional\nInsulation crews that install ... we have the best crew a it is a highly skilled install job so you can have different levels of spray phone a talent when it comes to installing miss so if you don't have a pro crew\nYou could end up having to redo the work later on aids right from insulation it's very expensive and you don't want to play around with the debt right [noise] so which vary from you're going to have\nTwo types of a spray for me to have the dense closed cell installation er it's crazy and it dries of cures I should say it 'cause it's not that it dries you but it sure is chemically\nAnd it cures dense you get about seven are valued ... inch she'd get a really high our value added that now the\nOpen south breeze and allows air to go through it and you get a lower our values but it still can be used in certain applications such as would in homes you want to use an open ... or the wouldn't know breed on a metal on metal building you want to use closed out because a metal building sweat\nSoon to keep down any transfer of moisture in most cases you definitely want to have a seat in the space so that you can demystify the air and keep some of the humidity down so it doesn't get transferred into the spray from\n... from his kind of all the rave everybody's asking about it nowadays are we do the underbelly of buildings we do the walk cavities we do the addicts we do every part of a home or any building with spray from that can make an energy efficient for you [noise]\nSo we have special rates for that as well are those are not going to be mentioned it during the show because they do change a little bit more frequently than the blown in insulation\nRight we'll call this the upper ... and then of course up a cat is not meant for you it's meant for the sun right so we're not talking about one two three punch we going to knock out the sun and if we knock out the sun we\nAre really were protecting at home you know this is like giving your home a big hug\n'em if you really love yourself you tend to be home if you love the country and your family you tend to love your home it goes hand in hand I'm so these products are expressions of love\nFor your house insulation if you have your house properly insulated if you got A L E D lights where they need to be you're showing love to your house\nOr you've got your home airtight as much as it can possibly be you're you're showing love for your home you're showing luxury HPV access to your show in love for yourself you're showing love for your investments\nAnd you know I work pretty hard for the things that I have accumulated over the years um they don't necessarily make my whole life but if I'm going to buy something and let him take care of it right [noise] so we're talking about another way to take care of beer which radiant for you know\nSome companies use to spray on radium barrier\nAddict but he says the green company so we stick with products that won't harm your house there no off gassing or any problems that might occur if you were to breathe in uh the material right so for that we don't abide by the spray on writing embarrass we use attack on radio for him\nThe radiant for Iran has a Ninety seven percent effective rate versus the eighty five percent rate that you would get from a spray now here's the downfall of the spray the spray on is human dependent so if that person is in your attic and just as feeling lazy that day\nAnd they don't want to fully cover\nThe wall the decade\nWell then\nYou're not going to have a fully covered addict will you the beauty of the radio for is that you cannot get away with ... or hacked to\nUm [noise] I'm trying to think of a polite way to say it but doing half behind job [laughter] right family show so we'll we'll talk in terms that everybody can listen [noise]\nYou can't get away with that with the radiant for him so we're talking about a product that is going to be more effective and you can't cheat in any single way and and it doesn't give off any\nIs there anything the super tough durable um radiant for oil you know it looks like so before but it's not\nCheap like that it's really really durable me you can't rip it with your hands [noise] it would take the act of Congress to poke a hole in this thing and then of course you'd have to have it had to be something super super sharp we have to use razor blade to to cut sheets\nAnd then we install them right on the um\n[noise] the ceiling Joyce\nSo that the whole entire interior of the addict is covered whereas when you see them spray those Joyce never get sprayed just in between\nThe Jewish\nSo with that being a a an issue in really not getting your money's worth with disparate and you're getting a product that can harm you and your pet send your children so that's why we chose the radiant for [noise]\nA lot harder on us ducking promise you we can move power will be at the rate of about two hundred to three hundred square foot per hour so could be a multi day job on some addicts\nSome addicts don't need to be quite honest I'm not ... it's really\nAn assessment case by case thing right so not every addict meat so we only recommend it to people they need it and he was a little secret uh I'll tell you a secret if you're not going to live in your house forever [noise]\nMaybe you don't want to spend the money on the radio bear a lot of people will tell you that\nIf you say you need it they will do it I think that that is a not in your best interest and I think that's not good\nSo\nThat in mind and with the whole goal of helping you increase the value of your home we have to do and bound to do what eight in your best interest so it doesn't mean no one should get it because we are just recently did a job in\nA house that really couldn't get any other protection\nThis was different for homes are the conditions were right and then we said hey why don't we rainy and Barry this particular area it'd be ask\nAnd then to add if we can take care of that was so addict fans and\nIt did the job it did the job they immediately the comfort level increased um the room that was hot it was now not hide anymore it was neighboring aside attic and we also put some um some batting up on the wall\nAnd ... house felt immediately better and we love it when we get those reports are so here's what we charge for the radiant barrier for [noise] [noise] right it is two dollars and fifty cent a square foot\n[noise] and it is a little bit more expensive than a spray on\n'em at the same time the value is much higher with the tack on and if you're going to do something you you're probably want to do it right so it's two dollars and fifty cents square foot was attacked and war Debbie sent to add that to a proper insulated attic\nSomewhere addict fans right and you have your roof blown off so do you have any potential fire or any leaks that can occur from needle pine needles or\nTo breathe so forth you really made your household again and this is really important thing to do in the off season in the season when it's not burning up\nBecause the prices the labor and all of the benefits are going to be much more affordable right so let's go back and look at everything that we talked about so we started out learning about our values our value is resistance to the transfer of heat\nWe want to keep it out during the summer we went to keep it in during the winter\nWe talked about how ah we can add our values and what it does to the different devices that you have in your house how it extend like I like to age ... system how it extends the roof [noise]\nThe under ... I've seen roofs that looked like a you know like a a a ripples\nOr Russell's potato chip [laughter]\nYou don't want to have a ruffles potato chip roof\nOkay so we talked about that and we talked about some of the great special that you get when we come out for free estimate with data base number one you're going to get a free estimates which is the first whole idea of it all nine descended square foot rate on and so they should\nUh you're going to get free baffles free software Cleary right and then you get to solar friends in stone ... get free roof blowing up needles and pine needles and everything else that can really damage your house right and then the radio barrier speaks for itself it's two fifty square foot\nWorth every penny works better than to spray on\nAnd it will do your addict some good it creates a barrier where the heat actually never enters into the attic\nIs a low in Mississippi the rate of this product so that means on one side all of the heat would be behind it if you put your hand on the interior side you won't even feel the heat that's called very low a Mississippi rate\nTo say that fast it doesn't eat Mitch\nOr transmit the through into the act so your

and let's see who's going to be losing would be with us today and we see that I have to take a look I think Larry Elder will be here Michael ... bed\nLast night in Dallas we had Sean Spicer ... very good guy\nAnd Larry Elder and\n\nLet's see Mark Davis anyway it's these are wonderful evenings if you can get in I don't know if you can get in right now I think it's I think it's still there but that's why I'm here and it's been intense week as you can imagine every day different city\nBut I have the\nPrager elder mid voted in Minnesota okay thank you that's that answer that\nIn life you take the uh you're kind of take the the perspective it's a big factor in my happiness my own happiness and in in my happiness approach him in my book on happiness you\nWith out prospective happiness is impossible there are many things that are necessary for happiness so it's an art happiness really is an art in fact I think there was a book about his book the art of loving look there's a book the art of happiness the probably is but it is an art\nAnd one of the things necessary for this artistic accomplishment is to have to be a a perspective\nAnd I think I mentioned this I I it's hard for me to remember everything that I said for three hours every single day but I think I think I mentioned this just this week as soon as in light of this every job comes with difficult parts every job is no such thing is it's not possible\nSo you have to ask yourself is it worth it\nIt is the ... is the\nEr the rewards whether financial or moral or emotional\n... or so many others ... ... is is it worth it I mean it's not worth it then\nYou have to if possible seek another job\n\nBut it's it's all of life is like that you have to take the bigger picture\nIs if you concentrate on the the pain of the moment it's a problem so Megan Kelly is have been fired from NBC sixty three million dollars or something like that\nAnd I I I did\nTalk to knock her I just thought it was not a fan so I'm not saying this because I was a fan I'm saying this because I'm a fan of\nOf a a society that has a ... still retains the ... the notion of safe you made a mistake in eastern surely apologize it's over\n\nShe said something to the fact they were talking about Halloween costumes ... think they should be politically correct met her white can do looked like a black a black and look like a white\nAnd then she got fired even though she apologized profusely she cheerfully the next day because of the racist history of blackface states\n\nSo that's what ah yeah we could play let's play a short I mean if people should should here but this is what the woman lost her livelihood over\n[laughter] actually you get in trouble if you are a white person or a black person if I kind of why we like that that was okay as long as you address character [laughter]\n\nOkay so if you addressed if you were dressed as a character in other words you were dressed as a specific human being\nSo\n... you could say it's foolish you could say it eats it it it it's insensitive\nTo the history of blackface in America but worthy of losing your livelihood is the punishment especially after an apologies the punishment not\nFar greater than the crime\n\nOr looked so here's here's her ears are appalled this painful for me to hear the ... the what the left forces it's really like these re education camps and communist country where the\nThe person ... after ... for the for their life as it were in in noting how ... of terrible they works book tear it goes\nBy making Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of a one way to dress up as another black person making their faith later or white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume it's old okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great types of sitting in his chair and stay getting to discuss different points of view and things I talk and sometimes I ... I won't say I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface ... awful way by racing country it\nIs not okay for that to be part of the old costume Halloween or otherwise\nWhy didn't end there\nI Believe that that's what she did learn I ... I don't I don't I don't get it\n\n... why why isn't she forgive him I had ... the a couple of weeks ago on the on the whole issue\nOf forgiveness\nAnd how it's like it's become a a a last item in the United states by the way I think it as an example I Do think\nI think people become meaner ... in the in in America they have become meaner as they have left religion I Do believe that not everybody not every religious person does kind that every secular person as me pay for those we went to graduate school and don't understand the concept of generalization I gave you that\nThe information but there's no question in this regard\nThat it\nIs just such a big feature of both Judaism Christianity forgiving the sheer panic in a if you don't think that she wishes she here in in her\n... ... ... then then\nWe have a different breed of what happened obviously\nKnow Abby now I'll give you an example which I totally understand is not analogous I understand that but we remember it's gone crazy because we now talk about cultural appropriation where a white person can't wear a white man can wear a ... for example a a a a Mexican hat\nOr or\nOr I don't know I guess you can't do a Greek dance so I don't know I I tend to be night put on by churches these beautiful spectacularly impressive evenings of Mike to salute Israel might to honor Israel\nIn churches around the country put on by the

their dances the Jews who were there are\nOverwhelmed by by being moved 'cause I wasn't there are regional context and she said as long as it's respectful\nNow maybe there's no such thing as any longer than that and what I mean they may possibly be given the history there's no such thing as a respectful\nAre appearing as a member of another race specifically white as a black may well be right but it was ... it was so obviously not meant in a racist\nManner lose your livelihood the next day after apologizing remain replace folks that you can think the left\nI it's like I bring you the meanest that this is the core of left his ... constantly\nThey destroy lives would the ease with which you eat breakfast\nThat's their business destroying lives\n\nYeah look I I I'm the recipient of
