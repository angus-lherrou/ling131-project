Gallagher God Bless taxes\nI mean they make the world\nHave any of the\nThat's right everybody happiness of all obligation is not really an emotional state on decides to be happy like one decides to do anything else in life\nThat's right it's a decision for the for the great majority of people some sometimes it's not but overwhelmingly\nIt is a disease you'll boil eggs there'll be a small sick G A two man no ... and ...\nThis is you know\nWe are definitely flipping out and when you were engineer flips that we view it is not a good sign the only one of us should flip out at any one time I Dennis Prager I've written\nA book on happy days are lectured on happiness all over the world even to penguins in the Antarctic that is correct we should put that picture up actually\nI spoke to penguins in the Antarctic a Mitt to subject happiness and ethical monotheism\nAnd they ah they were equally interested in both there was one paying window of the hundred or so looking at me the others most of the others had their nose under the butt of their partner\nStrain fest\nWhy does that make me strange 'cause the beat they don't have ... okay they beaks paint which ... which have beaks right oh yeah I guess you're\nRight in their ... their birds they're ... birds I guess All right everybody\nAnd this is the happiness our today's subject I admit at the outset\nSo here is a trigger warning we need you know what we need a musical\nOr some sound effect\nIt's not a dog whistle it's a trigger no there's not a dog whistle this is a trigger\nFor the sensitive\nSo but they will know that they may be challenged or even a God Forbid really God Forbid offended that knows that works so here it is every body\nAnd\nThat oh one thousand or so times 'cause I have a lot of theories about\nWhy I've been hearing that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer won a parade or seven seven six but first hear what the identities are\nAnd they are in no uh in order imports just three identities that I think are\nThey are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a low doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they're great contribute towards towards happiness a sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity I think\nIn my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them because it's for happiness our on everybody to listen and everybody would\nBe as comfortable as possible but there are those who are working to\nNotify those identities and say that they they really are not real and if they are not even good\nBook that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population by knocking these identities won a Prager seven seven six\nSo that I Believe that the more comfortable you are\nWith being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl and that is that is a serious part of your identity sir\nIt will be totally over by a graphic here I have always been very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with being mail\nI've never wanted to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and I I celebrate ... to ... to whatever extent that celebrate a ball I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgender and I'm not even attacking the trenches on the contrary was not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr then your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course at something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try still to maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you've got a really did my reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness\nWe're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female so that's one identity I identities in fact almost been given a bad name oh he has an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity\nI think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd ... and\nI think uh I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness\nAnd I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I'm a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is my thesis of this happiness our the more you identify with the the\nGreater your chance for happiness and third as your religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is good for Christians obviously the majority great majority that you're listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're a Mormon if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant that fewer evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every ... if it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n\n... nothing is a guarantee of life\n\nYou can be a you can be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio\nI was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show my breaking\n\nI was the moderator and there's a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then there were members of fourth religions\nAnd I\nWould get calls people would call in and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me so much so that at one time there were so many people who identified themselves as hey Hi Dennis I just want to say to the priest I'm an ex Catholic or I'm a recovering\nCatholic and I I I I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves that nobody called up to say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter]\nSo ... that we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called that he was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would do is apparently raptors knuckles with a ruler when he was when he was twelve I told them you know I Am and I'm not Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up\n\nAnyway I I Know that in my life those three identities religious national and sexual have been major contributors [noise]\nAnd I know that there is a sort of a war against those identities today and I think all that will do is decrease human happiness I take your calls eight seven seven to for three triple seven six the happiness our problem is that is for your show\nWell look I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits over was you'd be very lonely it would be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits about New York city isn't that interesting I mean of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she says she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting it's a very interesting defining element in the ideological\nRift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that uh ed in Chicago hello ed Dennis Prager\n... thank you so much for taking my call longtime listener\nI Am driving with my son who is Eighteen years old who is away at college and they're\nDriving in the car in both your shows and radio show and then you're you're used to bring your university and with regard to identity his name is eat them and you want to talk a little bit about his identity issues that he's in college in California\nYeah yeah pretty much I I grew up in\nChicago and then I I just moved to California I pretty much when I'm In a classroom quite some time to talk about that\nBut I only like a lot of questions like out there and if I if I buy on that like I get back way\nBack when I was like a lot of like it at all\nRight All right I'm going to answer you I'm delighted that you're both at such a nice thing a father and son listening to the show in the car I have a very sweet image of of the two of you think you\nLook this is again does transcend specifically the happiness issue but my general approach is to clarify where we differ it comes across as extremely non aggressive totally non defensive\nBoth so you're not defending you and you're not in attacking them just say listen\nOr you know we're both here to study and we're both students and or you know we're good guys and so on and so what I like to do just what I like to do is I like to figure out where it is I I might differ with somebody\nSo then you just you you could ask a if a few questions or a ... and one of them might be you know I celebrate\nI Wonder do you celebrate being male this this identity issue would be
