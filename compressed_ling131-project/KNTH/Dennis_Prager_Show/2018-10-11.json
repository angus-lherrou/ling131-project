secretary for the national Republican congressional committee I Want I Want a big picture take on a\nGradual races because we are twenty seven days away from them again I Know it's a cliche I hate even saying these\nWords but it truly is the most important election in our lifetime if the Democrats take control of the house and and or the Senate we are in major major trouble but you've got to see the way the Democrats are behaving and I know we've got a lot of people standing by for this video or about to we're about to play it for you here out of Seattle, Washington\nA protesters and demonstrators taking on police officers you know brutal way it is so profoundly sad or so just standby for that we're going to play that for you in fact will play it even while we're talking to Jesse Hunter\nHe's a former communications director for Senator Richard Burr Scott Brown press secretary for the national Republican congressional committee joins us\nWe speak cage as you have any other show how are you not bad thanks for having me\nHelp me understand thank you give us a thirty five thousand foot view an overview of the congressional races what's at stake what we're up against because quite bluntly I'm I'm tired of hearing well the Republicans are going to hold the Senate but they're going to lose the house is that a foregone conclusion\nAt this point in time we are seeing a very volatile environment so from the outset of the twenty Eighteen cycle when you is going to be very competitive Democrats are very energized or they want all out obstruction bad is that is their their their overall agenda right now what we're seeing\nWith twenty seven days to go is a resurgence of Republican enthusiasm post a Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing\nA that is due in large part to Republicans coming back home\nOnce who who might have been a little uh disinterested in in the mid term election but are seeing what the Democrat that plant we're already seeing Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats are lined up a litany of potential investigations they plan to undertake if they get control the house\nAnd we see on a regular basis their candidates talking about issues like\nAbolishing ice undoing the GOP tax plan and protecting sexual cities if they're able to regain control the house that is what's at stake in this election and I\nIt has a way of turning off independent voters and motivating a Republican base letters\nYou know I I heard of it last night on TV made my blood runs cold Kevin McCarthy pointed out Maxine Waters will become the chair of the house financial services committee if the Democrats take control the house\nLike gosh I I I I think that just motivated about three million people to crawl crawl across broken glass to vote for Republicans in November to have that doozy in a chairmanship position anywhere I mean we're seeing the difference the stark difference Jesse between the angry mob\nThat as being embrace by the Democrats you heard the comments Eric Holder Hillary Clinton were not going to be civil and less until we when my gosh the the protesters and they are all Democrats Jesse these are Republican protesters\nOne hundred percent we know Maxine Waters is someone who who kicked off this a reprehensible behavior of saying that they should go in a cost of the White House officials are cabinet members are Republican elected officials in their in their whole you know near their homes in restaurants at gas stations wherever they are\nIs that is the type of rhetoric that's being used by the Democratic party day and that will become a\nKind of common practice\nIf Democrats getting in trouble that's why it's so important for Republicans to get out there and vote to match that democratic enthusiasm because this is what they want we saw they put you know you had the\nPotential twenty twenty presidential candidates up on stage you know during the judiciary hearings to break out or you saw the way that they behaved and that is going to take on a more of an emphasis\nAs we move past the mid term elections in it to the presidential years of that you know if you combine that with a a a house led by Nancy Pelosi in a democratic presidential primary going on you're going to see some really a a porn behavior from the Democratic party if they're able to regain control\nJesse ...
