men and women [noise]\nIt's very simple white so honest am very open on the subject [noise]\nAlmost nothing is taboo him if anything except boots only because\nWe're on free radio so it's pretty rare\nBut it does happen the other is I'm either a fan of men or women\nThey were\nWonderful man and wonderful women in ... in an awful women and they're pretty much\nI Would say ... ... be much the same\nProportions same fractions of their sex so welcome indeed to the show today's topic is one that just noise at\nMe and\nI Want to bounce off you the messages that we give to young women and have by the way since I was in college so this is not new\nYou should pursue career and that should be the primary\nConcern that you have as a young woman and\nYou've been not as a young woman as you as you get into your thirties which is still relatively\nYoung young young and\nYou know or somebody a good man comes along and that's fine that's great you know you're you're\nNobody says throwaway but that's not where you're\nAttentions and effort should be directed they should be directed toward a fulfilling career a successful career which means making as much money as possible it's what the word successful generally connotes unfortunately but it does\nSo I Am curious if you're a woman who followed that advice\nAnd you know moral a single minded leap pursued career success was that good for you in the long run secondarily\nI'm asking what do you think we should say to young women cause I'll tell you what I Would say to a young woman this is the prime time for you to find a good man you should be at least as concerned with that as you are with career success\nThat's why I ask well by the way the phone numbers one age Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six that's why I ask young women when I meet them so often a waitress or even somebody sitting next to them an airplane\nAnywhere wherever the opportunity arises I have no difficulty effect they love speak to strangers so relevant to me so so you could I ask you how old are you this is a a twenty five bucks a perfect so here's my question\nAnd some of you've heard of this all ready and the question is if you could ... be guaranteed one of two things which guarantee would you take I always tell them is no right answer I'm just I Want to know how you think\nAnd I also tell them that even though one is guaranteed that doesn't mean the other can't happen it just means only one is ...\n... so if you could be guaranteed a great career or great marriage which guaranteed well would you choose that that's the way I put\nSo\nThat's my question one eighth Prager seven seven six so they're really too well one is what if you are a woman what message did you get and what did you follow\nIn this regard\nTo what do you think the message should be too young women because I Know what the message is the societal message is\nPursue a pursue a vocation pursue a career\nAnd it you know for a white man comes along well that's just great that's by the way that's often how they put it to me\nI'll say well the the you you you're you're looking forward to getting married or do you you're says look you know the right man comes along and that'll be fine\nIt's not either they're not telling me the whole truth\nAnd they really would like to get married or they really think that it's not that important\nAnd I think that society I look I'll tell you where I'm coming from but I think you know but I'll just say it anyway I think that society has\nPlayed with terrible tripped on young women and has since I was a young man I've this is not new with all this this is part of the transformation of society that took place in the late sixties and then the seventies\n\nIt it was the if the dream of most American girls\nWas about their wedding this was mocked out of existence\nFor a young ... for a ... a high school girls to save the day you know I I periodically just badge and my wedding\nAnd it's very exciting to me well aware and who will be there and\nWho the man will be and what it will be like that ... a girl wouldn't see that today she wouldn't say to her shelf\n\nIt's been it's been so to speak it's been embarrassed out of existence\n\nNo ... I saw at an airport it's been so many airports in the last week and a half I don't remember which city was put different airport every day\nSo it was a big a big billboard you know they have these ads up an airport some airports\nSo there was one and it was something I Wish I took a picture of it because I'm so bad at memorizing these things so showed a young woman interestingly the young woman was wearing a sort of I think I'm a Muslim type a scarf over her head\nAnd she was not white she was not black\nSo I think I think it would have been at a Middle Eastern origin attractive woman young woman with a scarf over it but that's not critical I'm just describing it to you and the message was something to the effect\nYou should both read history and make history something about effect so I was thinking at the very moment what if\nWe put up we being Craig are you what if we put up a bill I didn't even tell this to anybody Prager you because they would\nUh think I was out of my mind but I this is one I was thinking how about a one in ... in almost the same configuration of a young woman and something like something to the effect I don't have the words yet but something to the effect\n\nIf you find a good man\nMarry him\nThat will ultimately bring you more joy than career\n\nAnd I have no I have no problem with women and careers I mean we we have a woman\nWho CEO of a particular you who is indispensable so well aware of the contribution that a woman could make but for the most part I Would still make this by the way she would agree she's she's married and she has three kids\nRight three kids\nThe message that is that we have sent\nNo I Would say yes\nRight so the the true says the reason you're not married Asian financial it's because he has an ask yeah\nYeah okay that was fun\n[laughter] she's truly that was sort of detective work [laughter] uh Taylor thank you for the call yeah that's the way it usually is\nPeople it's a very hard thing for any of us are just for bees is believe me as much as anyone to see\nReality for what it is not always\nEasy thing\nBut I've never I never understood when men call and say the same thing I've never understood this without financially ready I don't I don't quite understand that if you're not financially ready simply\n... why is that\nDifferent from not financially ready marital late when Meryl you'll share expenses you won't have to pay to rent isn't every if you're not financially solvent isn't ... ... is a marriage a better financial idea\nOkay a\nMix to mix mixed mixed dancey in Denver the famous ministry of Denver Hi\nHi Dan I'm going to get some invite ... young women um I was a woman at the seventies I got my last Thursday we were going to go out and be liberated will be educated and I really did enjoy the work that I did in my seven in the Seventy gotten on them and then I got married\nThe early eighties and got the for 'em and needed to go to war to support my child no doubt so um I got my job\nAnd it was intellectually Wilma lady and emotional emulating it started in the late eighties\nAnd I climbed up the ladder I'm at work\nAnd I really got involved with my work I needed to do it as like that emotionally and intellectually but I didn't focus on finding another man for myself I thought that my son and I worked up my son was like OK\nWell non ... than it is now man in my life and I'm currently okay with that\nUm that my son is grow he's married he's often in his life\nI'm Alone and my ... not well good well I had the foresight to get a long term care policy\nSo I'm somewhere that I people that can help take care of me that I'm tired I don't have a really big income because the field that I was in it for buy me a\nA what I like that pension and I don't have a man and I in the world\nWe live in the early ... off ...\nAnd um I look back I guess they hear why made tension I have many men who wanted to go out many men who all but ... why did they say that I was focused on the career than the career and the child and I made a mistake in terms of that my decision\nThat will let you go but I ...
