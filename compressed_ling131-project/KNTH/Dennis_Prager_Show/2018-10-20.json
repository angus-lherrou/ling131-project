{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "I gave them a man\nA\n\nMan of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kinda stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the theme of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago we were not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we do not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important then guiding them in helping them to have financial security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in art from well he called vision one hundred million one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only that the the Mr Spock but also very logical um and so that's kind of a ties in with this segment of the show which is on estate planning and passing\nOn to the next generation and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserve a lot of you give love always okay\nYou it's not you don't get along because you think you're going to get it back you give up because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life because then your happiness\nIs not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of life then somehow and you know ... different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more alive you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it will continue to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the law that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so a state planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death\nYou leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word truck they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite the cutest ... there for your spouse to be able to have access to the Mike for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do is protect them\nFrom if they get divorced and remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but good habits or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt that all the money that's in the Q tip and the trust for them is is protected from all that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the cutest trust\nSo you think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them happy for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to pick it up so shall we talk a lot about all of our core values I Hope that you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nA website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I feel

that so it's a great product and it offers you are in our value almost three are value per inch\nNow the code in this area is Thirteen inches so if we added do teenagers that three are valuable and you're going to be at our thirty nine\nYou might say well Dave I already have insulation will I just need to add a little bit more on top or do we ... the old stuff out\n[noise] most times you're just going to need to add a little bit on top so\nIf you had lived in your house for a while you've never had your house insulated chances are you're going to have some shrinkage especially it's if it's the owner insulation\nThe product that we use is guaranteed not to drink more than an inch over ten years to have a product that is going to keep its our value and that one little inches really negligible we're talking about a three are value so you won't feel it as much\nSo let's just say over the years you lived in your household and you know that your installation is woefully under insulated and you have about five inches or I've been to insulation we're going to come in and measure everything assessed sway your energy loss it and then we're going to recommend probably an eight inch ad\nNow you're going to get that special agent inch rate that we had only for listeners of the energy our so take down this number and keep on listening to the show\n[noise] our phone number is eight three to four six four seven one seven six and when you call you're going to get a friendly staff member that's gonna take down your information is set you up with a free estimate\nThan one of our professionals is going to come out we're going to take some measurements we're going to look at the condition of the attic and we're going to recommend some improvements that can help you ultimately you're the boss you are the foreman and so you decide how much are how little you need to do and will give the recommendations\nThe best thing that you can do in this season is going to be at installation at some air flow\nIf you do those two things you can have bad addict that is definitely going to hold back the heat keep the heat in your house\nWhen you spend a lot of money so you might as well hold on to that money and the short term investment or is definitely worth the long term gain\n[noise] then we may recommend is so erratic sandwich is going to pull out the moisture from your attic\nSo that you don't have mode and more ship building up\nAgain our number is eight three to four six four seven one seven six so you're going to get a free estimate you're going to get our nineties sent the square foot rate low price now that low prices only for you because you're spending some time with me right now and I really appreciate it by the way [noise]\nAnd then we're going to also offer you some special other other special things such as free baffles to keep the air flow going through your attic is again another mode preventive tool\nAnd then we're going to also if you get the solar addict fans which by the way have a two hundred and fifty dollars deduction because you're listening right now\nWe're going to give you free roof blown that this is the time of the year when you have pine needles and leaves on your roof so since you're already out there we are going to do it for free I stay tuned so here's what we're talking about we're talking about added installation during the most\nOpportune time to do it with which is these next two to three months\nWe're going to offer you a great rate because hey we want to say thank you yeah you could be doing a lot of other things is a lot of other stations you can be listening to but you're listening to the ... hour with David Brown and that's a pretty cool thing\nWe're going to reward you for that now it's time for that we're going to show you exactly step by step scientifically what is going to happen when we make the changes to your home\nImmediately when we had eight inches to your state five inches we're going to get you to an art thirty nine [noise] and I thirty nine is basically the are as I always talk about every show means resistance it means resistance to the transfer of heat so now you're not going to leave your house\nAnd guess what's going to happen during the summer months the heat stuff going to come into your house\nSo added installation during this time of year is the most important thing you can do\nTo get your home energy efficient more comfortable and habits saving money rather than spending your heart any money if you could say fifty dollars a month that it's at the end of the year six hundred dollars that you can use to it many other things\nSo most times you're going to get out of your investment in less than two years I'm Dave brown disadvantage era stay tuned\nYou are listening to the energy out with Dave brown check out they've rounded buddies that uh for low rates on installations slate in various so it had a sad scene\n[noise] hey joy\nWhat would you if you're a he was running all day long why that's easy I call adding buddies addict buddy George loves to\nWelcome back says this is Dave round and this is the energy our so we talked about re embarrass solo fans addict insulation is how we can save money on your energy bill ...\nWe have to we see [noise]\nYeah welcome welcome welcome my name is Dave round this is the energy our\nIt's called the energy our because it's an hour of informing people just like you on how you can reduce their energy usage\nIn your house and save money and keep yourself comfortable because comfort really has a huge connection to energy [noise] if you are under insulated in your room you're certainly not going to be comfortable right so we're talking about saving you energy\nNot let you lose your energy to the to the wild you don't want to heat up your house and then have it just pass through your walls and do your attic\nSo quickly you rather stay there longer and now here's what happens when you have a properly insulated home he stays in your house longer and also then doesn't have to run the ... the uh\nThe heater as long because hey it's already warm so once your house heats up to a specific temperature that you set by the way and that he stays in the longer ... what happens to the heater it shuts off it just shuts right off\nSo since that shuts off now what are you doing you're saving money and you feel more comfortable to his what happens to a draftee house if you have a draftee house you know what I'm saying [noise]\nYou and a half heat ... so you turn on the heater in aid will run and run and it will run and it will run in your bill is going to come back and you know holy cow what is going on with this bill you're going to hold it up like a piece of paper and you're going to say to yourself [noise]\nWhy am I doing right so we definitely want to reduce that with added insulation ad insulation ads are value our value as a resistance to the transfer beat we're not worried about the cold the cold is going to take care of itself we're concerned with the keeping our heat in the house\nSo you do it now during this time of the year and then you can track your progress and see oh wow I save money this month oh look at my bill this month [noise]\nHoly cow I say fifty bucks\nYou do that long enough you had a beer investment most homes especially at our special radio rate of Ninety send a square foot and all of the specials that you get a free baffles um all of the other things that help preserve your household right\nWhen you combine all that now you're really saving money\nAnd and at that low price you can typically get out of that investment within about two years or less depending on how much energy you're wasting if you have no insulation and you add insulation oh my gosh your bills are really going to reduce so\nLet's talk about our value again our stance for resistance to transfer heat degraded to our value the better resistance to the heat\nDuring the summer you want to keep the heat out of the house during the winter you want to keep the heat in the house so this is why this is the perfect time to get it down now let's talk about our solar addict fans we have\nThirty watch Remington solar addict fans lifetime warranty by the way free replacement if there's any damage their hair resisted\nThese also come with the thirty percent federal tax credit so anything that has a solar panel attached to it\nIs a available to take advantage of the I. T. C. credit which is an energy credit thirty percent of the price of to install now today what we're going to do is take off two hundred and fifty dollars for the radio listeners only so you have to call in doing the show\nIf you call it after ... fortunately does a special go away\nSo calling during the show to eight three to four six four seven one seven six eight three to four six four seven one seven six\nAnd tell them you are listening to the radio program what time and then we'll get your schedule for any free estimate now we're ... we're also assess the Airflow\nElation how we can save money on your energy bills week after week after week [noise]\nHow ... you can hold it thank you\nThank you thank you very much\n[noise] ... this is Dave brown and if you're clapping you probably clapping because you know you're hearing some stuff that is making sense to you and your no dummy you're very intelligent and most people that they have done studies in most people that listen to talk radio\nI tend to be more intelligent people because they love to learn and talk radio is about information\nSo this information is probably the most important information you can apply towards your home to make it energy efficient I mean before you get a new stove or a new flooring and\nYou really want to live and how much energy efficient um it it's going to really set the tone and how you feel in your home in how you feel in your home as vital as we all know [noise]\nSo you'd be surprised exactly how much insulation changes the way you feel inside of your home and dealing in your room comfortable is everything right\nSo let's fix that let's fix that with some some knowledge some information in some action and so the information is we already got that covered we know that our value improves the\nUh in Mississippi or the transfer of heat it slows down to the transfer of heat so that you keep your heat in your house and then it keeps the heat out during the summer\nSo we know that the higher our value which is what insulation provides and again I'll let you know we use John's men all blown in insulation\nAnd it is the best on the market the best on the market because we've compared it against all the other products and do some of them are actually cheaper for us to buy John's Mandel cost us a little bit more\nBut without transferring that cost you you were giving you the best product at the lowest price\nJohn's man's bill a bone in insulation\nGives you the highest are valued bridge when you add in eight inches on top of your already five inches you can bring your installation up to our thirty nine are thirty nine by the way it's the code in this area so you'll be a new house level efficiency when it comes to insulation\nAnd so now we're talking about more comfort you're talking about\nBeing warmer after you get out of the shower because you're he hasn't left the building so fast we're talking about a lower energy bills because you're heaters not running is starting to feel good I could hear the music playing and behind this [laughter] so\nOnce you do these things you're creating an environment and what you create an environment that environment sustains you and makes you more comfortable it makes you happy\nSo that's the magic of insulation right all of the other products that say the solar addict fan the radiant barrier that is a support product that goes into helping the overall health of the home radium barrier rejects ah\nThe radiate heat\nAnd the solar fans sucks out the hot air and it also sucks out the moisture\n[noise] with our solar fan it's made by Remington so it's a brand that you can trust it is higher and or the solar addict fans at thirty watch not ten or twenty ... thirty what that means it has a stronger motor and it's going to suck more air at a higher rate [noise]\nFifteen hundred cubic feet per minute means that if you have a Fifteen hundred square foot addict every hour even exchange completely off the air and your attic\nSo what are the chances of you now getting mold or any kind of Moshe build up\nShould go down shouldn't it\nSo that is what you're talking about when we're talking about the addict buddies program the insulation the radiant buried so act they this is what we're talking about [noise]\nAnd there's a way you can easily take advantage of all these things including getting two hundred fifty dollars off the fan to free\nA estimate the free baffles the free software clearing a and that's just not giving us a call ... three to four six four seven was Seventy six we have professionals there on staff waiting to take your call they will take a call doing this program only to get the ah the benefit\n[noise] a desk eight three to four six four seven one seven six\nAnd I want to talk to you a little bit about a product that we have called the buddy box the buddy boxes a stair way insulated ... is our brand made by addict buddies it goes in the stairwell and it is the first open in peels back\nAnd here's the reason why this is a vital tool for any home number one\nTypically what happens is you lose a lot of energy to the pool down the addict stairwell because there is no insulation over that if there were insulation over that every time you open it would fall on your head wouldn't it [noise] so the stairway insulator insulate the stairway it's\nIt does what it said we call it the buddy box because it looks like a rectangle box that the first open and its metallic and reflective so it has our value and it has also radiate reflectivity\nAnd it has that low in Mississippi so if you stood under the stairwell on a hot day you would not feel the heat\nAlso if you stood under during a cold winters day you will feel that you heat is staying in the house so back stairwell is probably a major you're losing probably three to four rooms of energy every single day do that stairwell where the buddy bucks we'll put a stop to that right\nNow we gotta value price for the radio listeners is normally two forty nine installed\nBut which you're insulation install we're going to give it to you for Ninety nine dollars or so that is a huge discount we're going to say be quite a lot of money so take advantage of that as you can get the buddy box for Ninety nine dollars than Ninety send a square foot rate of in St insulation\nOr you will get the free baffles which are super important for keeping air flow otherwise if you didn't have ... and you're blue in insulation you could possibly stop up the uh the Airflow stop up yourself a dense [noise]\nSo you get that and then you get the free stuff at clearing along with that and you're going to have a nice beautiful energy efficient ac my name is Dave brown dishes energy how are we talking about insulation I Want to talk about different forms of ... before I give you a chance to give us a call into the show\nI Want to talk about ...\nAh we definitely have the one of the most professional insulation crews that install spray from we have the best crew\nA it is a highly skilled installed job so you can have different levels of spray phone a talent when it comes to installing this so if you don't have a pro crew\nYou could end up having to redo the work later on aids right from insulation it's very expensive and you don't want to play around with the debt right [noise]\nSo it's very from you're going to have two types of a spray for me to have the dense closed cell installation ah it's crazy and it dries cures I should say it because it's not\nThat it drives the basic chores chemically and it cures dense you get about seven are value ... and she'd get a really high our value added that\nNow the open south breeds and allows air to go through it and you get a lower our value\nBut it still can be used in certain applications such as would in homes you want to use that open sell to let the the wouldn't home breed on a metal on metal building you want to use closed out because\nA metal building sweat\nSoon to keep down any transfer of moisture in most cases you definitely want to have a seat in the space so that you can do humidifier air it keeps some of the humidity down so it doesn't get transferred into the spray from\nSpace on this kind of all the rave everybody's asking about it nowadays are we do the underbelly of buildings we do the walk cavities we do the addicts\nWe do every part of a home or any building with spray phone that can make an energy efficient for you [noise]\nSo we have special rates for that as well are those are not going to be mentioned it during the show because they do change a little bit more frequently than the blown in insulation\nOr to take advantage of us or take advantage of I take advantage of us I wouldn't mind just take advantage of us call us at eight three to four six four seven one seven six [noise]\nCall addict buddies at eight three to four six four seven one seven six\nSo we've got blown in insulation batting the rolling rolling installation which by the way bats typically will go in on in the walls and bloated will go in the attic spray foam can go on the underbelly of a building or\nOr your house insulation if you have your house properly insulated if you've got a LAND lights where they need to be you're showing love to your house\nOr you've got your home air tight as much as it can possibly be you're you're showing love for your home your show ... H back system you're showing love for yourself you're showing love for your investments\nAnd you know I work pretty hard for the things that I have accumulated over the years um they don't necessarily make my whole life but if I'm going to buy something and let him take care of it right [noise]\nSo we're talking about another way to take care of beer with radiant for you know some companies use the spray on radium barrier\nAddict but he says the green company so we stick with products that won't harm your health\nThere no off gassing or any problems that might occur if you were to breathe in ah the material right so for that we don't abide by just spray on radium Barry we use attack on radio for him the radiant for Iran\nHas a Ninety seven percent effective rate versus the eighty five percent rate that you would get from a spray now here's the downfall of the spray the spray on is human dependent so if that person is in the attic and just as feeling lazy that day\nAnd they don't want to fully cover\nThe wall the decorating well then\nYou're not going to have a fully covered addict will you the beauty of the radio for is that you cannot get away with ... or ... I'm I'm trying to think of a\nPolite way to say it but doing half half behind job [laughter] right family show so we'll we'll talk in terms that everybody can listen\nYou can't get away with that with the way in for him so we're talking about a product that is going to be more effective and you can't cheat in any single way and and it doesn't give off any gases or anything it's just super tough durable um radiant for oil you know it looks like so before but it's not\nCheap like that it's really really durable I mean you can't rip it with\nIt would take a you know act of Congress to poke a hole in this thing and then of course you'd have to have it have to be something super super shock we have to use razor blades to to cut sheets and then we install them right on the um [noise]\nThe ceiling Joyce so that the whole entire\nInterior of the addict is covered whereas when you see them spray\nThose Joyce never get sprayed just in between\nThe Jewish\nSo with that being a A N issues\nAnd really you know getting your money's worth with disparate and you're getting a product that can harm you and your pet send your children so that's why we chose the radiant for\nIt's a lot harder on us ducking promise you or we can move probably at the rate of about two ... two hundred three hundred square foot per hour so could be a multi day job on some addicts addicts don't need to be quite honest uh ... it it's really\nAn assessment case by case thing right so not every addict means so we only recommend it to people they need it\nAnd he was a little secret or I'll tell you a secret if you're not\nSo\nThat in mind in with the whole goal or how can you increase the value of your home we have to do and bound to do with it in your best interest so\nThat doesn't mean no one should get it because we are just recently did a job in a house that really couldn't get any other protection and this was there forever homes all the conditions were right in and we said hey why don't we rainy and Barry this particular area of beer\nAnd then I had if we can take care of that with solar addict fans and it did the job it is the job they immediately a comfort level increased um the room and it was hot it was now\nNot hide anymore it was neighboring a side addict and we also put some uh\nSome batting up on the wall\nAnd a whole entire house out\nAnd it is a little bit more expensive than a spray on\nOn the same time the value is much higher with the attack on and if you're going to do something you probably want to do it right so it's two dollars and fifty cents square foot was attack on an worth every cent so if you add that to\nA proper insulated attic\nA similar addict fan right and you have your roof learn a so you don't have any potential fire or any leaks that can occur from needle pine user\nTo breathe so forth\nYou really major household again\nAnd this is really important thing to do in the off season in the season when it's not burning up because the prices the labor and all of the benefits are going to be much more affordable\nRight so let's go back and let's look at everything that we talked about so we started out learning about our values\nValue is resistance to the transfer heat we want to keep it out during the summer we want to keep it in during the winter we\nTalked about how are we ... our value and what it does to the different devices that you have in your house how it extends to like a like a track system how it extends the roof the under ... I've seen roof that looked like a you know\nLike a a a ripples Russell's potato chip\nYou don't want to have a Russell's potato chip roof\nOkay so we talked about that never talked about some of the great special that you get when we come out for free estimate with addict but he's number one\nYou're going to get a free estimates which is the first whole idea of it all Ninety center square foot rate on insulation or you're going to get free baffles free suffix leery\nI in Dan's if you get to solar friends installed you can get free roof blowing up needles and pine needles and everything else that can really damage your house\nRight and then the radio barrier six for South it's two fifty square foot worth every penny works better than a spray on and it will do your addict some good it creates a barrier where the heat actually never enters into the ad\nIs a low in Mississippi the rate of this product so that means on one side\nOr the heat would be behind it if you put your hand on the interior side you won't even feel the heat that's called very low in Mississippi rates trying to say that fast\nIt doesn't even Mitch or transmit the through into the act so your cooling day addict you're extending the life of a a wonderful things that you say stuff in there\nOK so we'd go last thing we talked about is special home and garden show rate number one\nIf you come to us without going into their home and garden shows because unless you got other things to to look at I Would say go take a look if you're going to go home and garden so to get insulation\nDefinitely come to us first you don't have to walk anywhere you can just pick up the phone dollar number and get the home and garden shows special bring if any literature if you do go and will be that price would Arabic priced it is and will give you a lot more service\nAnd we'll give you the experience of a company that knows exactly how to install insulation properly with three baffles that keep their slow going us off at clearing\nGive you a really good advice in terms of what you need and what you don't need a it's not about giving new stuff it's about prescribing the right things that we'll hope help extend the life of beer ... H sexism all these expensive devices\nTo give it a scarf all of that ad eight three to four six four Seventy one seven six\nEight three to four six four said that one seven six this energy our my name is Dave brown were coming to a close I don't want you to miss out so much for your call during this broadcast to get all of these special so again I might give you the number [noise]\nFirst of all act

much talk to you again\nThe energy our husbands lots\nFrom a column and then I Will go to a second call I'm going to have a feminist column in the Washington Post where are women who are feminists or or one I think in particular feminist columnist writes and I was reading\nSome of them on the plane last night and I I some of them we've you know some of the quotes\nI think that these are so important to understand the damage\nThat feminism in each make believe world ... all is it instead of emanates from the left or make believe socialism is make believe and feminism is make believe you ... them is make believe it's all make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological it ... it's there's no other explanation there is a deep deep\nDeep\nUh [noise] unhappiness\nMaladaptive miss to reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them they have contempt for the world as is\nConservatives understood chance of making the world worse or is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a idea\nMaking the world incrementally better is ... that's what we should be doing in every generation but the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is one character respects the character respectable I\nRemember from the boat fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen\nShe writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read all of her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a model leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nA priest thing that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or other women riding in this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so Middle East to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a buck cheat the there is no mention of of marriage so she wants to which way you show loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing temporary are fleeing would appear\nFrom what I'm reading the divide between men and women is never felt so wide and I have never been so lonely to walk the she described that I Know what I ascribe it to\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch she said whatever you're comfortable with\nAnd now I reached to read from her over the course of three hours that while I became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself but underlying what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug it was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if they're managing the driver CDs of patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find that sexy well and then she wonders why she has never been so lonely in her life\nBecause what feminists like all left to live and to make believe world\nReality it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the if the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every move he makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex she this is they they just said that they want their cake and eat it it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be a feeling of relief not personal appetite implying conquest you're going to move personal appetite from sex all it's good to be is Karen ... sounds like a visit to a social worker or a therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth\nDo you know where your stands on Brett Kavanaugh you should so she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh disrupt the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman their children left his two children that party they do want to grow up I Want\nTo be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional boots that dating and relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else\nI'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that working for a living can bring\nI Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it negatively can bring\n\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart the children they do not want to grow up growing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms and all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even nice snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups does it amazing thing she admits fish like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post how lonely she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\n\nI now I continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of the leaders feel stuck in the same dilemma\nReally that's not true\nLeaders are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have mature understanding of life it involves\nPolitical pain there is a pain in life this is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be a A N o may first oh\nBy the way just a reminder the my my uh it's the rational bibles but there's like five volume commentary on the first five volumes it's been so successful the that was going on the fourth printing of ... the first volume was on the second book\nOr if the prices going up to five dollars 'cause of the price paper it's printed on very beautiful paper so you could still get the old price at um at Amazon them if you want to get it I'm just letting him do that is the rational Bible\nAt any rate uh I I that book makes you aware that Jim is is this is what human beings\nTo grow up you have to leave the garden of

know I Want to have faith that strong\nThat well right right yes I agree with you now right I agree with you know ... have a person right but at no point the she challenged feminism\nBut it may be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with this particular person maybe there was like well I mean I'm a Democrat I so I have to be left for graphic um yes yes\nI think when it comes to this and my relationship and kind of by sense of oh no you know I I Am nervous they're scared to do that again that's like human ...\nEither ... or what ever I don't know that already\nAttached to
