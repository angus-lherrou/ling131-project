A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. and let me know\nOr what you think and I try to respond to all of those emails\nAnd if you check those sites you find out where else I'd pure besides filling in for Dennis or or Larry on the ... radio network\nIn Alaska or we certainly talking about to respect the shootings at the temple\nAnd and then it it kind of fall into a people blaming it was certainly the media and of course the Democrats and left it's all the same thing these days blaming President Trump\nFor the ... bomber blaming President Trump for the shootings at the temple it never ceases to amaze me that everything that goes on that's bad it's his fault\nAnd um even in the most serious charges against and the one I think that most if ended up being the press is that people\nAre that depression is the enemy the people which I think they are because they don't report the news objectively and that was basic to our founding that there'd be a free press a new reporting the facts and not ... the giving into government figures that they agreed with and make\nIt easier like they did on President Obama and by the way speaking President Obama he said some awful things to that could incite people like me normally ... met her people like make sure that we have that clip let's play\nThat shouldn't be democratic\nTo say you don't punish political\nHow\n\nI'm not now but I'm not going to [noise] I don't know what\n[noise] and\nSo why isn't bad inciting people to violence did you see how he said so passionately in in ... the anger in his voice as ... people on my side let alone President Trump that were against people based on how they look or how they pray daily\nWhen did that first happened I didn't I must have missed it or when he was looking for the compassionate Republicans right he really needs to Republicans that don't stand up for themselves but I Love the last one 'cause I was going to talk about illegal immigration in this hour\nRipping immigrant children not no it's not illegal immigrants but we're at the immigrant children\nAnd and talking about from the cold cells running them out of the arms the mothers or fathers and and you know however you put a I'm paraphrasing and they wind up in a in a coal sell how was that incitement on his side for some ... yeah you do that or take children away from their parents we better do something about how come when he does it\nIt's okay how come when he he actually is lying about opposition\nWorst President Trump blind I Want you to point that out in terms of\nLeaving them in a cold sell cars that makes me pretty angry how come it's not on their side\nThat that that's OK when they do but it's only President Trump you be seeing the visceral hatred for this president\nAnd as I mentioned on Larry show friday you know the reason for\nIt because we finally have a Republican\nWho standing up to the other side who doesn't let them get away with anything look like you I'm I'm not thrilled with everything he says is Dennis as you get the total package with everybody but the fact is they hate him to hate him with a passion because finally someone standing up to them that's what I think\nSomeone is really not letting them get away with it remember John McCain didn't do anything about personal bombing he didn't want people to even mention the fact that\nHe may have been you know the way he talked about the America should I Apologize and I've you know the issue about where he was born I get that one but you can't say anything about President Obama that was sacrilegious so to speak\nBut it's okay you can if you want to say about President Trump is okay and the press is complicit with this so yeah on my side you can't say anything but on the other side you could do what you want\nAnd it was very hard I got to tell you it was very hard for me as the last caller last hour said even some Jewish leaders I shouldn't say even what a surprise most of them are on the left to say oh the climate from the top down\nThat's what you're doing that's what's creating madman well let me tell you if I was ...\nThere's all over the edge what President Obama did good maybe if I was a crazy evil person maybe could push me over the edge\nHow can you compare that mark how could you say that a president bomb was just a straight guy right like he never lied he never set up a straw dummies like you said an immigrant children it's not immigrant children and how come it's not mentioned that when people go to jail their kids have taken away from them because people don't want you to know that\nYou don't want to have that that kind of ... let me know what you think when a predator seven seven six I'm hearing is live in a pain free relief factor dot com studios and let me get to your calls and rabbi Diane I'm not sure if it's a different take or not rabbi Dan you're on with mark\nAnd mark how are you real\nGood I'm actually trying to make a comment response to the previous caller and I'm often looked like she said people get up from the community and say that that that they are opposed to the president has on the air is representing the Jewish community and unfortunately\nPeople often will include the name of the entire community ones that don't live\nWithin the more traditional Jewish community that I'm a part of your characters who we are good appreciation cook has done\nFor the country and for the state of Israel and all the moving the embassy um everything with the UN um it's it's just an unbelievable were grateful and you find even more traditional around so much like\nPeople are more conservative and people have more conservative values that we expect it and we also know that we have to ... ... ... we have a security system nothing is perfect\nBut you can't get in and they got the answer box without going through ... and then we go to ... have a ... in Oregon and by the office and it's unfortunate reality of life in the medical ... that really\nWell thank you rabbi down I appreciate very much and I forgot that right we should mention that he's got orthodox or grandchildren but certainly\nThe idea that he's anti Semitic yeah they put that often at the beginning also doesn't matter if you have some on the air everything goes none of it matters let's go to Peggy in Chicago Peggy you're talking with mark ...\nI work I I heard this and I mean I just want oh my God how come the oppressive over this I I heard that public health isn't the apartment and department of public health is actually\nVery very concerned not panic but right on the border line and they said that these people that are coming across and if you know in the [noise]\nThing migrants that are coming over or not checked for disease they are carrying inside the antibiotic resistant TB TV was a scourge in this country\nAnd therefore scourge until you're in an antibiotics to check it this is resistant to it we are opening our borders to people who are very sick they are some of 'em are like typhoid Mary show no symptoms but don't carry the disease here\nAnd public health can handle that it's a huge number of people that go directly into the population you are at risk your kids are at risk\nThis is a public health problem great yeah it threatened to overwhelm the country and like I Know I've heard you know President Obama you know if you want your doctor you can keep your doctor I mean he sounds great but the fact is we got screwed on health insurance because of him\nAnd like if somebody says a good thing that's that's great but where's the beef\nShow me the the project was going to happen in public health\nIt's nothing to mess around with their the people that stand for you in the middle of your community and President Trump is right we have a crisis on our border and people don't even know about it I call the Chicago Tribune which is just purchased by another company they're like the new kid on the block\nAnd when they get a hold of the story I don't know what's gonna happen I mean we're we tend to be a democratic town but we're concerned about our kids were concerned about our families and if we find now that somebody's been holding back\nInformation that we needed and didn't get because the press didn't tell us didn't think it was important um there's going to be hell to pay\nAbsolutely you you were a good you got in the winter snow arby's commercial where's the beef is not our business Wendy's I Can't keep up with new comers that's bad they're doing a bad job if I don't know the sponsors let me know what you're saying one pressure seven seven six Marcus are filling in for Dennis ... and we aren't going to go there and illegal immigration hold on\nThat Kim John on one could go right but here's the background any take that into consideration now what do we have\nWe have the south Korean president who is Catholic [noise] taking a letter to Pope Francis\nTo come over and visit North Korean peninsula we no longer have that boy ... missile that came at Hawaii and our next will finally worked\nAnd shot it back he's not a lot being missiles into their place near Japan are flying over or threatening to attack on Guam and that's the only one thing he's gotten in other countries and and that that he had gotten in our country\nTo point eight per cent raise and Social Security this year for our people on Social Security\nYeah he's done he's done a lot there's no doubt about that and they don't want to acknowledge that in any way let's go to Jerry in uh San jose jury you're on was mark\nI can I can\nOkay great hate my point is when a President Trump has asked for someone to get rough duck whatever it's somebody talking squabble\nAnd it's that particular person but what appalls me is that democratic leaders would say kick everybody be on civil to everybody and I think that's the point that America will point oh because\nIf there's any structure he should be taken care of your life\nAbsolutely absolutely want to go to as many colds I can Judy

R. at AOL dot com\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis Springer for as they did for Larry Elder last friday\nIn this hour you can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I wanted to talk to about illegal immigration especially with the caravan approaching\nI've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact\nThat people across the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as famous place them somewhere or loss then\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if there are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you on hold and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walks into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove that the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase on document\nAs if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left as one of the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit\nOf course and helps having media on your side perpetuating these false it's\nSo so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the obvious\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accused you heard President Obama last hour we had the clip of him of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration\nHe has more I mean but with the right word than anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes but the left and the Democrats and the media off in the same thing do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that want anyone does something illegal and they hold off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd the in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nThat was no doubt in my my name is Thirteen and other people who do us harm or among them so can President Trump the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets into our country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people who come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico\nSome of us think this is so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mention it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know it\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote when he ran in Texas\nWonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics a sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most of the ... illegal immigrants come here for jobs as we'd long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for and the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's the phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats\nThey always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it is clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody [noise]\nWhat do you say to people around the world who've been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and in ... and she bought a national paperwork even have a chance of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those are dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one call a lot of different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told him I bet they work in the short run to stop mass of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now as we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really live safe for murder by their ...\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure for coming into our country and I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed on to better public as like Bush George W. Bush or Paul Ryan\nNo amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior but today to those who say the border wall won't work\nThey use the same or digital logic I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had at the end of last summer when they say the documents coming oh he said the caller a chance for me to have they committed mass murder no it's not like the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt your fat illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that wall preventing one Hamas murderer in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals are given safe harbor\nYou come up with a phony arguments like illegals will not cooperate with the authorities you've heard this if they know the\nIt'd be apprehended are sent home but how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with the Saudis how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers and ice who have the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes some of the rest of us have to live with long waits at hospitals\nDeteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls in their gated communities so what's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free health care and preschools you for strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some she goes to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please enough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes or bilingual government documents\nOur country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nAs I said our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed at Ellis Island as boring sent one of the colors last hour they didn't come here for free benefits they didn't come here for free hospital care free schools\nThey didn't come here for any of that it was so happy to be in the land of freedom so let's build that wall\nAnd do everything to end illegal immigration and take our country back tell me what you're thinking won a primary seven seven six I'm Mark ... filling in for Dennis and\nOf the illegal aliens that are here to work uh have been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions ship it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a myth or my daughter was actually a victim of a I D fell by illegal alien using her Social Security number which were stole when she was a child mhm\nSo uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing oh by by describing what's happening here in internally when\nPeople come here to work [noise]\nYou have just a one one of the many ...\nIt was with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me there's got to be an orderly procedure that how someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to the people you want to give the opportunity to seem so obvious to me and that's\nWhy you have to have when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states are Murphy yeah legal immigrants but you change the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks for taking my call mark pointed out one thing that seems to be glossed over I mean if you're like this caravan of course they want they want they either\nPathway contaminated only and the out a yellow El Salvador Guatemala and decent people what for most countries that pose contract out to be just gangs and dogs and Sarah team at all what you want to tell\nYou well know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America to give me even people with disease right they haven't been ... as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point\nHis argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do it here the rules here the procedures you have to follow them ... President Trump's Republicans are going to lose this one either way right you call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you gotta do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joined in with that right\nAnd if you uh don't stop them you have an invasion you have people coming in these people aren't coming in for something that may be as some of them but a lot of them we know they're kind of I don't blame them by the way to come in for jobs that coming into the benefits were\nThe ones to blame let me know what you think\n... seven seven six more conscious of filling in for Dennis ...\nWithin a Springer show live from the relief factor free studio [noise]\nWhich one thirty ...

Americans are paying the illegal immigrants\nA lot less so they're taking and taking the the way and the hardworking Americans and they just want people to remember that\nThat's why it's such a prize Tracy when many minority members who often are on the bottom of the scale you know the latter I should say\nNo they vote for the Democrats and liberals letting illegals in all the time to compete and
