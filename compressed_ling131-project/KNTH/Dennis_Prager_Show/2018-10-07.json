remember co enzyme Q. ten levels decline with age the omega three super pill helps put it back\nTo your personal financial freedom to be able to retire\nOur government for probably two or three generations now has convinced us that retirement is an age\nAnd they keep bumping that age I write so at one point it was sixty and then it was sixty five now they're recommending you wait tell what sixty seven sixty eight\nAnd they've done a great job of marketing that so when you ask somebody when are you going to retire the answer is typically well I think I can retire and they're going to ask now one of the ages that they have heard that typically is associated when they can begin to\nStarted doing some research because it's been a long time since I've looked into retirement plans and what financial planners are saying and I have to tell you ... that\nThe biggest scam at least one of the biggest scams perpetrated on the American people it's the four oh one K. and the IRA and I'm going to take that on today it might be painful for you but stay with me through the entire show because I Do have a solution for you\nBut before I roll out the solution I'm going to roll out\nK. if you had to write a check every month to fund\nBoth of those you'd be very aware of what your pay every month you would\nBe asking yourself does this make sense should I be doing this where is this money that way and what is happening to it what is my return on it\nFrom attacking his point of view I return on it as the public services that we receive\nYeah how are those potholes in your community that they're getting better and my community and far north Dallas but ah boy I still you wonder where is all this money go he's right and all the other myriad of services that are provided\nFor our taxes but you'd be much more critical about the efficiencies of government if you were writing that check every month instead of being taken out of your pay before you get a hold of flip flops same at the four one K. if you had to write a check\nOr do you want to like try to deposit to your four O. one K. every month you'd be looking at those returns much closer you'd be much more aware that the games and your four one K. or the money you're putting in every month not necessarily what you're earning\n\nSo if you have a four O. one K. if you have an IRA if you know someone who does and you care about them or you're anticipating starting to\nContribute to a four O. one K. or an IRA this show is for you before I really get rolling this is the best time to give me a call and ask that question the number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven\nSo I read one article that just let my fire and are out of all of them that I looked at I think this is the one that\nReally highlights what the problem is\nAnd the lack of critical thinking and folks if we don't bring critical thinking back to her everyday decisions we are all going to have a future that we are not prepared for and it isn't going to be the one we're hoping for\nSo this article was published by the Motley Fool and it's by a writer named Selina Meyer and John\nAnd I'm just going to read you a little bit about what she says that give you my color commentary as we go through this she says that a whopping forty six percent of Americans say they will not have enough money in retirement I'd argue with you\nThat's actually hire these are the people who are aware they won't have enough money uh doesn't really count for the people who\nSee rainbows and unicorns and think somehow they will have enough money and that one in five Americans are older than sixty five are still working because they can't afford to retire\nOne in five again I think that number might be a little higher\nAnd she goes on to give some tips about preparing for retirement and her first tip I actually agree with that is to make a plant we just have very different opinion about what an effective plan for retirement is but Salinas suggest\nThat you start by estimating how much income you'll need each year in retirement I Do agree with that but we talked about lifestyle planning the first thing to do is to figure out what kind of lifestyle you want to live where all the components what do you want to do\nDo you want to live do you want to stay in your current home do you have a mortgage on that home how much is that how much is your property taxes how much is upkeep and maintenance you\nGot a plan to replace HVAC systems and water heaters and all kinds of things over time in your home [noise]\nSo what are those expenses look like over the span of your retirement do you want to vacation do you want us to take the grand kids on fun trip what kind of cars do you want to drive how often you going to replace them right on and on and on you design that lifestyle so she doesn't go into that here but we'll give her credit for\nUh having the insight that if she was actually working with you she would go into that lifestyle design and you come up with a number how much do you need on a monthly yearly basis in order to enjoy your retirement to have the retirement of your dream\nHay and she goes on to encourage you to be conservative in case you encounter some unexpected expenses or your estimates turn out to be a little too rosy hey good advice\nThen she says to tally up your various incomes sources such as Social Security any pension income well how many people have pensions at this point\nNot very many usually public workers government workers they still have pensions but they're chopping away at those and and see how much income you'll need to generate on your own\nArt so again her vision is that most of American she's probably right are dependent upon Social Security\nAnd then a small handful of folks comparatively of some sort of pension coming the rest you got to figure out [noise] so the average annual Social Security she says is Seventeen thousand dollars a year\nThat's fourteen hundred dollars a month and I\nI think everyone is aware at this point that if you're going to try and live off Social Security you're going to have a lifestyle vastly reduced from what you're used to living\nSo she goes on to say that if you think you'll need a total of fifty thousand dollars a year to get by and retirement and you expect to get twenty thousand from Social Security so already\nShe warns us to be conservative and then she's bumped up that average is Seventeen to twenty thousand that's an Eighteen percent increase so she's already\nUsing a number from Social Security that's Eighteen percent higher than the average Social Security benefits but we'll just go with her numbers for the sake of\nOf this analogy then you need to figure out where the other thirty thousand is coming from\nAll right\nAnd remember the fifty thousand dollars will be taxed at regular income income tax rate so in twenty Eighteen the effective tax rate on fifty thousand dollars a federal tax write forget state is just over eleven percent that's five thousand five hundred dollars\nSo now you're actually living on forty four thousand five hundred dollars and we began the exercise by saying you need fifty thousand to live on\nThat should be what you clear after all expenses right all taxes and and insurance and medical right but\nAlready we're down to forty four thousand five hundred because you're going to be taxed on your Social Security\nAnd you're going to be taxed on the money you take out of your ... that's the whole point it's deferred taxation not tax free money\nAll right and then\nTo get an idea of how big of a nest egg you'll need to generate the income you need you can use the imperfect but still how full four percent rule\nExcept for those of you haven't heard this from your financial planner the ideas that your going to live off four percent\nOf your IRA every year so you're going to start drawing down that IRA by four percent a year\nAre there some but I'm saying many financial advisors don't have the accumulated wealth that you do and yet we expect you to go to them for advice on what to do with your wealth when your retirement is at stake\nIt's time for another short break and when we return and we're going to continue our conversation about for one k.'s and IRAs and a better way to secure your

names spring and the ... and it's still the same place\nAnd they say certainly people know the would lunge but it is the closest town to the ... going South Korea south West is that right correct\nIs just south of the wood fence and one of the things that that people are always asked me if I Love the area\nBut I Can't afford ... prices I said well we have a wonderful place for you it's caught spring fall spring Texas spring Texas it out yeah is just south of the woods lens and also east of the women's 'cause like I said it's\nSpring is pretty pretty spread out so if you love the willingness area you still want to be posted amenities in the winter and spring is definitely a great place for you to come\nAnd actually as you describe it that way\nForget about the woodland for a minute it also puts you a little further south to be near Cady and some of the other things going on let's say I'm not I don't know why I guess I'm thinking about my son living in San Antonio if I Want to get down to a tan and go west whether it's San Antonio or even California is pretty easy right you had a nice location yeah\nIt's actually very very well a standard because you have to forty nine that's easy access for spring you have Nineteen sixty to take the east and west if you don't want to catch the main highways and then on the east side of rain there hardy toll roads\nYou jump on the hardy and you get into downtown within Fifteen twenty minutes without any traffic jumping on the hardy till row and then now the greatest edition was\nThan Ninety nine parkway\nNo spring just keeps growing and growing and growing I mean all he said just keeps growing and growing and growing and they had to add that grand parkway which is out or do you have ... and you have that weigh eight which um is just south of rain\nAnd now you have the grand parkway they can jump on from spring me down to Katie you can be down and sugar and then you can go up towards the humble on Ninety nine as well so it's very well centered\nAnd it's interesting when we think about the highways when we talk about the highways and even rush hour mid\nMid rush hour traffic whatever you want to call it it's interesting that it's not highway Ninety nine the grant park way if it's a beauty contest is getting more votes than any other high ... yes people seem to love it and then the few times I've been on it I went to the ... and it's it really has been a breeze and maybe I got lucky each time I've been on\nAnd you know it it it is just amazing every time that I've been on the ground parkway I'd go on and quite a lot because I have a son that place of baseball and their baseball field is right off Ninety nine\nWe start as early as meaning that the baseball field seven AM\nAnd being as late on the baseball field as eleven PM which was this past week we jump on Ninety nine always just straight brief to get from one side of town to the other side of town and it used to take us about thirty minutes to come down from spring to beltway a\nLoop back around ... and then go back of ITN west to try to get to Katie that would take thirty minutes now we're doing in Fifteen minutes for free\nAnd the other thing I'm thinking about Ninety nine is that yeah I've been on a word smooth sailing but the other thing that's attractive is that there's a lot of space so it's not yet congested to wear all you're seeing his ... all the time\nAnyway so certainly we've established well established ... one of the great things about spring is the location what are some of the other things\nThat draw people to the springs area and you've been a resident there about a decade or so yes people some of the things that they had lived there\nThere's definitely a a a lot of amenities in that area um I live in a gated community um named legends French and there we actually have one of the new schools\nAnd that's a ... the school is ran oaks high school it's a huge campus walk the campus several times now and it just looks like a college they made this campus so big it's gotten a lot of the most up to date\nAnd like trying to fix for the kids that the concept that they came up with is just\nMind blowing ... the concept that they use for the school\nAt very nice so if you want to get it come to an area that's going to have great schools\nIs definitely there and spring there's a ton of amenities as well Larry that I live in it's um they just ranch and we're seeing a ton of growth now with Graham parkway opening up\nA to a lot of areas that were not acceptable round parkway has opened up those areas now and the area's still booming there's still a lot of empty land that needs to be developed and the developers are seen that the values there because uh the the number of people that keep coming to the area is just keeps growing and growing and growing and growing\nThey can't keep up with the demand so the ... are still behind in their bailed out with\nHarvey still being a part of that catalyst there where I'm contractors are still\nOn some of the Harvey products that they need to get back up\nToday and you mentioned gated communities you're talking about the one you live and are there are a lot of gated communities people can select from\nYou know they're ... yes yes there's definitely a lot of a gated community in the spring area there's a ton owners led in France or harmony there up in the ... are still water as well so there's a ton of properties that are gate it up there and they're very attractive because\nIt it gives people a sense of a safety you know they're behind their their uh gates where where it's acceptable to them only the one that I live in it's twenty four hour man gated community means even better if it is it's very nice\n[noise] so any time that you have a guest come in they have to check in with the guard they provide them with their id and then they buzz you at your house or whatever phone service that you have\nAssigned to your um through your address it but you and one want to make sure that you're expecting get somebody to just given about his address they won't let them in\nSo that sounds so if someone wanted gated community they can select from a few different levels and some of them have the gates I Lived in one where we didn't have the guard but still it was nice having the gate there so that's a great thing let's talk a little bit of pay all about the new construction out there\nAnd someone comes to you I'm going to I guess I'll throw figure out there let's just take a number and let's say it's four hundred thousand\nAnd say look I Want a nice house in the spring area what can I get for that price\nAbsolutely yeah and the four hundred thousand dollar range you can easily find something that's probably going to be about a thirty five hundred square feet to about forty five hundred square feet easily\nThere they're going to be a ton of products out there is just depending on what you want to be on a larger backyard smaller backyard I'm just depending on all your needs there's\nDefinitely a tone some products out there or be their homes that's currently out at a villages or harmony may have a lot of different products they start as low as two hundred thousand\nAnd they and they go as high and that's a new home produce hundred thousand yes that's a new home construction in New construction home\nOver a ... homes over villages harmony as two hundred and Nineteen thousand dollar while and they go as high as three hundred thousand dollar they can go up higher as well just depending upon your um upgrades\nThat you like to add to those packages they are always having a a ton of a discount that as well that they provide lies but don't go directly to them\nCall me when you want to go see those new homes\nIndeed and one of the things that you're providing as the real estate professional in addition to being the real estate professional that's up to

real estate probably buying it to how many homes have you lived in since you've you've been up there\n... avenue in the ten year span of ... I ... yeah I I Love\nThis spring area so much that the only home than our own there so I had lived there ten years but I have six properties that I own in the spring area that are investment properties\nAnd you know what you're the spring king [laughter] we're going to go with that nexus between guardian a business card you have it's going to be the spring ... came look at that so you're\nReally super knowledgeable I bet there's people that might be listening while they might be out of Houston they might be listening in on the Internet after the broadcast however there might be people living in Houston right now maybe they are an uptown or in the center of the city somewhere\nAnd they may say look I Want lower taxes I Want a nice house I want a new home I Want a gated community or I Want a second home where I'm a little bit outside and they may want to call the spring\nGang activity what if they do pay oh actually I Do find that well if they do call me and they let me know that\nThey heard our show here today when I'm going to do for the month of October is donate a thousand dollars bag to breast cancer awareness month so\nReach out to me at pale Rubio that's P. E. Y. oh are you ...\nThat up their second now what are the signs of moisture intrusion certainly some are obvious [laughter] you know you see water there by the by the edge or something but what are some of the signs that you look for that the average person may not be hip to\nSure the most common is going to be a disdain that's that's the most obvious but there are others where you're getting more sure intrusion behind something we're pain is going to\nGoing to kind of bubble up or or ... kinda flake off that's an indication as well areas that that may have a little bit of a deformity obviously or water damage even if they're freshly painted and sometimes even the fresh paint in an area will\nKind of draw your attention to it so that's a problem one of the problems that you see inside the home as you're walking around and we're going to get\nTo the addict as they want to go up there as a whole there [laughter]\nSo in in the house they were checking all the operating system to have a home so basically sink faucet as all your dream systems all your\nSchool system for Jack and polarity of the blood we want to make sure that that a ground fault and and our fall circa protection or are in the places you're looking for who want to make sure that you have smoke detection and the rules have have changed over the years and so we we we always recommend that they bring them up to the most current standards\nWhat are the rules for smoke to you have to have X amount per square foot of the home or a welder and placement or what\nYeah currently the and he says that um we have to have one in each individual sleeping room and then in the immediate joining hall and they must be interconnected so one one goes all the all actually together\nAnd I have some things to do with the home to do list as I said oh my goodness yeah my ... just got a little bit longer I think so let's go to the addict what are the things you go into the addict yeah okay if it's December maybe it's okay but if it's summertime it's super hot but what do you look for when you're up in the attic\nOkay so because the way we're built here we don't have basements so pretty much all of our mechanical systems are going to be an editor HVAC our water heater a and then of course we're going to address the structure and in most homes where you see some signs of structural movement I typically find that there is an issue with the addict framing and not necessarily the foundation\nThe framing what could be wrong to when we look up up on where the roof is the framing 'cause they're all the those are two by fours or whatever they are are up there what what would a problem look like\nRight so the simplest way to describe that is basically if you're looking at home you think of the roof is being a triangle and if there's if there's a missing part of that triangle then you're going to have pressured it's going to push on the outside of the walls it's gonna gonna look like foundation failure but it's just improper framing and it's very common\nFascinating what about what the AC and heating systems what are the things that you look for whether it's inside or outside of the home\nNow so we're looking for you know this one of the areas where we're kind of limited and the state of text you have to have a a sea license to go much further but a very you're not opening up the machines are and we we are through the through the act access spouse if there is an access to the oil we can look at the ... look at the condition of it we're looking for corrosion in the pan\nThat's going to indicate that there's been a freon league mixed with water which causes the Russ 'cause\nThe or the ... when I was I shouldn't be resting we're going to look at a flame color on their car was so if there is a\nFree on leak that Russ correct\nAnd why is that because of the free on does is boring and ... an hour twenty two guests bashing look how much we're all learning as people are listening driving whatever they're doing so as far as the inspection business you've been doing this quite a while what is it that keeps you excited about that next inspection\nEvery house is getting paid for it [laughter] that's that's one of the things I like about my job but yes so it has to be fascinating because you're seeing homes of all kinds of what about a new home let's talk about that if someone's buying a new home should they not get it inspected because it's quote brand new\nOr no that red alert red alert and yeah so this is the type spec should we do the least of which is new construction but it's actually the most important um it's not uncommon for me to do up five or seven year old home and find thirty to thirty five deficiencies just a builder would have taken care of had they had just had their inspection done when they were buying a house but it was being constructed\nSo that's a good point and so we're buying a brand new home we still want to have an educated person than educated I look at this call out hey here's a problem or this is okay rex\nRex especially if those deficiencies are in conflict with the current building standards of the builders are by law required to bring it up to the courage to an Alan what's the area that you serve here in the Houston area do you have a geographic ... this this spring woodland area magnolia ...
