dot org on Instagram at team feeling champions on Twitter at ... say Facebook\nDot com Jill lane fan is that right yeah\nWow okay thanks for the ... yeah yeah yeah so let's talk about eating clean you hear clean all the time and it seems like every big nutrition experts talks about eating clean and what does it really mean\nIt's like the discussion we have the top of the show like natural and synthetic everybody has their own definition\nFor me it means that you recognize the words of everything on the ingredient panel and the food you're about to eat yeah what's chicken apple\nO. salt pepper Faisal anything outside of that start to get a little fuzzy but the problem is that there's a over three thousand food additives are allowed to be either to our food in the U.S [noise] wow it's getting more than that only ... yes some most of which are grass generally recognized as safe but of those\nOnly a small fraction of been tested like do they harm or reproductive system if we consume them overtime so the bottom line is there's not a lot of control over those foods and long\nThose additives in long term studies so important to educate yourself so the bottom line is we talked about this so much you just get really good at reading the labels of the food you consume you cannot just go off of what the front panel looks like and I brought something in because\nI we talk about how we get due to all the time that we think that it was like a pretty sun on it it said all natural we've been talking about it might even say organic it might say non GMO but I had some family members in town and\nMy dad color green on us it's my call her grail\nFor sure because that looks so healthy agree on is really just want to eat it\nSo I brought it and people can go look on my Instagram at ... feeling champions and my story I took a picture of what looks to be a syrup bottle it's a popular brand log cabin they pretty much salad everywhere has non GMO on the label it says all natural but there's something really interesting about it when\nYou look at the on there does it say anywhere on that front panel Bernadette but that is maple syrup\nMaple syrup no now buying syrup\nWhat are you thinking you live in that mine are buying Sarah what do you think you're buying maple syrup look at the ingredients their maple syrup at all in that product ... okay let me go anywhere on the other ingredients does it say it contains one drop of maple syrup wow oh my\nGosh oh mayor oh maple syrup and that contain around rice which is sugar a surf around race or a water sugar brown sugar natural\nFlavors anthem gum citric acid this is John it's pure sugar isn't that amazing no minerals which is which is one thing what did you get from maple syrup right\nRight um well you know the ... that I made I put black strap molasses in the morning it was the title ironing ironing the maple syrup has all the minerals I actually have a an uncle\nWho was in the maple syrup business in Vermont for years and years and my mom's brother my uncle Frank um but and and and it made me think okay so on the front says log cabin okay all natural non GMO absolutely my uncle Frank used to send these little miniature log cabins that you put these little smoke things in it would come to the chimney they were so cute\nBut when you think of the word log cabin you\nAutomatically think of maple syrup road which is crazy isn't that amazing so in that area yeah so it's called table syrup and how much did you pay how much it didn't\nHave a family member went and bought that for me and my dad so I asked my and I wasn't trying to be like this is amazing I wanted to show them because even I was like oh my gosh\nHe's like yeah I bought it because I had that non GMO thing on there and they got it on that so I'm like I Would have to I'd yeah but this has zero maple syrup in it and people say well maple syrup as their sugar just trading one for one sugar for sugar but the point is\nYou have to read the label and they have to read the makes me mad is these companies are laughing all the way to the bank would this I think that we didn't even catch it and you bought it yesterday to the grocery store just ...\nAnd Walmart one was from a Tom dumb yeah so it's amazing I so I go to natural grocer it just goes back to and I don't know if one of the Marta Elise than quote unquote on natural synthetic ingredients actually in there when you read it but my point is you\nAnd get what you thought you were buying why it took me literally not even ten seconds to turn the bottle around read the other ingredients like we talk about and make sure that you can identify everything that's in it\nThat's better than like aunt to mind that so I don't know maybe\nWho knows I mean I'd say they're about to say this and try to probably ... you know I don't know I don't have it in front of me\nBut in the end it's better but it might be better because high fructose corn syrup over time you know raises inflammatory markers and all sorts of other things however the point is you weren't you didn't buy what you thought you were by absolutely so as soon as the label that let me look so I'm gonna I'm gonna take a test that so let's say\nNatural flavor OK I'm an I'm an air force them on my finger and see if it tastes like maple syrup sticky when it looks um so I had some pure maple syrup at my house when my dad was in ... these making pancakes where my kids so we just wanted to buy some to make sure and we tasted them and it does taste it tastes like maybe it's ... it's like it but I'll tell you when you have\nIt next to a hundred percent pure maple syrup it doesn't it's not the real deal it wow tell that it's\nNot everybody has diabetes and the fat and everybody I'm exaggerating make a point but it's so many people who\nWith the non GMO labels they read for sure it's safe it is yeah with natural yeah\nIt just goes back to listen I I think we talked about this so much and you mentioned in your segment to dwell on it and and Bernadette take responsibility for your own house you are responsible for your health it's not your doctor it's not anybody else so when you go to the store eating clean just means\nSticking in second to look at what you're buying don't just go off with the package says all natural organic there's a sunshine on it that makes it look really healthy the coloring as right they know what's going to appeal to you I'm from a packaging sample they spend millions of dollars to advertising and development\nBut you need to turn it over and look for the things that we talked about the most of the top five things or the artificial flavors artificial coloring artificial sweeteners and MSG those things are like the first to strike down the list but not by anything with those including high fructose corn syrup\nAfter that it takes a longer education process to look for other chemicals but you can just simply don't download\nExcuse me the environmental working group apt to your phone\nIt's an amazing app and if you love like I was just on my way here like okay I'm going to pull up something random I went into the bread category I pulled up like Hawaiian rolls\nAnd it gives you a scale from one to ten if there's something to be flagged in that product all the way down to how it was manufactured ... ten being bad one being goods you want to look for five or under and if the product you love is like between five and ten they give you alternatives that have a a lesser score and start to just overtime improve the food that you're buying and putting into your body\nI bought Hawaiian I never buy these but they had an organic brand when I was a natural gross ... last night made chicken ... for my daughters they were both sick and then I made my Bernie virus this morning just so good to be in the kitchen especially this time of year I just love to cook and the smell of pumpkin and maple and all this real maple not this um but\nYou know you'd ... you'd have to be so careful and and you um or your ... your father in law whoever ... is a family member got totally do I would have to have you know it makes\nMe laugh too because when I was shopping for syrups they put all the organics and the very top\nThe pure maple syrup at the very top so you can hardly reach it and you're tall yeah you can I couldn't reach it it was like a hundred percent maple syrup and then the rest was All right in front of your eye out which is all the crappy well yeah they pay for that product placement too yeah\nAbsolutely I mean yes and you don't want to get so bent out of shape there's actually a term called ... where you are so in the weeds with how you eat that it's like a mental disorder and you're so into being too healthy okay that it ruins your life but you just want to take ownership\nAnd I understand what you're putting in your body and so that's being cleaned means just know what you're eating yeah take ownership ship out if you want to choose to have a cookie\n[noise] it it was\nSafe fees [noise] [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] ...\nBuckle years ... years juvenile\nCharming [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] it's\nAll right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host chip Darby are right here\nGuys we are absolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned\nWho's we these small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who love Ron Paul\nWhat happened to the revolution what happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought\nThat everything should be black versus right you got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence\nEven today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\n\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism but that's\nThat's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth is\nWe have become\nStupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system\nOur judicial system hangs on the voters it does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice\nAnd this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury\nWhen they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now so it's a divisive\nHateful climate what\nHappens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union us\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and what happens\n\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative\nCandidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\nIs frightening how much division there is and really\n[noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that sport big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also\nSupporting big government and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to and that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction\nFrom the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever if anything about the Kavanaugh\nCircus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its the knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come by and false allegations come up\nAnd because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has written and has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them\nExcept for that does all that I mentioned in the beginning I think even less than three percent\n\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of people think of all the bomb was badger Obama was really bad Obama was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush with big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was banned Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any\nBetter with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nAnd Kevin all\nYou really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\n\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist\nI can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could on the points\nThat we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I've made many friends that way but that was then not in this climate\nWe are to the point really we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet of all the other subjects have all the other issues that is the one\nThey will die on that hill they will fight the battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O but chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\nA lot of problems with Brock Obama and the reason I'm starting there is because rock Obama supported abortion\nHe supported theft government death stealing ceilings stealing from people to give to others\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in this story rock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives\nAnd a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama were ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow many of you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to the pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat\nOf all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around this\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama\nSupported\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama\nBut they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years four years\nLeft of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive with terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ... I mean everywhere he supported aggression\nAre not everywhere but he often supported aggression\nHe was very divisive\nAnd so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that and a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\n\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm going to tell you that as we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nHi Shaun mocking here if you follow my work you know that one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion
