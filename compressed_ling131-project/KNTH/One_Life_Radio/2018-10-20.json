I I mean\nLook it's it's it's a lot of things I think there's a the antibiotics and the food supply I think the uh the hormones that we're talking about like the R B or C R B G H causes insulin resistance\nMade by Monsanto by the way it's one of their pets\nThere was a number of things that are that are I Believe are are causing insulin resistance like obviously we're getting we're overeating\nWe're having too much high glycemic carbohydrate or not exercising enough and sure like the exposure to these artificial sweeteners I mean there there's a number of things that certainly could be contributing to this but there's a number of medications that we talked about that I think can predispose you to this as well\nYou know I was doing some research about uh we're going to have an upcoming show on milk\nAnd what's in milk and how gross it is [laughter]\nI was actually eating some cream fresh last night with my potato chips and I I my mind started going into overdrive and I couldn't take another bite I just couldn't do it um but we'll talk about that another day but while I was doing my research I ran across a Purina and I was looking at you know how they feed them and just all these different things about cats\nSo what they do and I came across Purina hearty be supplemented trademark hardy 'em by Purina and it says that are already be is not offer\nI [laughter] right [laughter] but hardly be okay and as a supplement is designed for beekeepers looking to help their colonies fried and between\nPollination and so I have to ask myself is that even cool to do that why can't you just leave Mother Nature alone should we be interrupting a between colonization so what do you think just curious were just talking science hair Simon\nAnd that's when so I have a girlfriend that lives up in Michigan okay her bees from Georgia okay and I said what are you going to do in the middle of winter and she said well when you harvest the honey you have to leave enough honey for them to eat\nAnd so if you don't then they need more food because they don't have any other source okay and so these farms of bees these commercial producers take all of their honey right and in late\n... yes yes [laughter] I like the ... maybe it's a small\nLittle local person that's got maybe I don't know three to ten hives mhm and there's\nAnd your which means three in ten different honey comes that they can harvest from each one of those they need to leave at least a third of that okay with that they can eat it it depends on how cold it is and it depends how long the seasons will be between the pollination yeah but I can understand why they're going to need to provide food if they harvested\nHere's the interesting thing and this is why I brought it up because I thought I thought this was such an interruption if you will of nature number one and number two\nSo this thing that they this this Purina hardy supplement it's formulated with a balanced profile of amino acids vitamins and minerals this protein supplements designed to perform a and Patty or liquid form a to fit the needs of your operations so Purina hardy supplement include flavoring ingredient\nTo optimize intake and it's led a and there's less attractive to be a two beehive beetles\nThan a leading competitive supplement but the whole thing about this and then it having flavorings and it kind of bothered me just bothered me yeah I don't I don't know much about it yeah but anyway so let's get back to the second to the sweet and\nThere's that we're talking about today um issue which John Wells so um ... well you know what so there were six different artificial sweeteners that we're setting and the study what else do we need to know about this\nWell you you brought up some good points that like [noise] not only are these artificial sweeteners out there but now we're getting into sugar alcohol sales\nWere getting into some of these robotic short chain fibers like a it's called I Am I so multiple multiple Hugo sack ride that was in some of the bars mhm uh we're getting into a ... is that natural is that good has fructose only go soccer I'd FOLS\nI'm so there's just a ... it's like you said tall and I don't even\nKnow about that 'cause it's not it's not a it's not um\nIt's only commercially available and so you didn't put in ingredients that I mean they put in products that we don't even know about but you know I Know you and Shelley ... even ... for a long time what do you guys do to sweet and your for your baked goods things like that when you to do it safely and and stay in ...\nYeah so we use like a natural sweeteners um and we try and limit the amount of sweetness we have like it's very easy when you get into Quito or something especially if you're if you're going from like the western diet and you're like OK cool do Quito and all you have is fat bombs in Quito desserts and\nHave all these artificial sweeteners right you're really not going to do while you're still going the sweetness override your society that you can still overeat or Quito and the whole point of Quito\nIs that you eat less right and when you eat a savory or ... answer right if you're eating savory Quito if you're having things like eggs and you know steak and whatever you like you can't over eat those things but fat bombs ... you can easily won those\nBe [noise] the ocean\nCity fees [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nBuckle years ... years ...\n[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nOh right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter your host chip Darby right here guys we\nAre absolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned who's\nWe these small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul\n\nWhat happened to the revolution what happened\nWhat happened guys we have\nFallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\nYou got that rodeo slip by versus right or was it you see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right but\nThat's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\nI don't use a term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism but that's\nThat's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth\nIs we have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would like to say ignorant\nBut we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system our judicial system hangs on the voters it does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote how do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice\nAnd this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled from such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union us\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way\nBut it could and what happens\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta or the jury\nIs frightening how much division there is and really [noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that sport big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also\nSupporting big government and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever if anything about the Kavanaugh\nCircus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans the knee jerk\nReaction of the Republicans false allegations come find false allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support it big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has written and has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\n\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that does all\nThat I mentioned in the beginning I think even less than three percent\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of people think of all bungalows badge of Obama's really bad Obama was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush with big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was banned Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry Kavanaugh do you really think he's better guys were being divided\nWhat is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith\nSomeone whose views would be typically leftist I can sit there and have coffee and find some common ground and we could all the points that we disagree disagree and even in some cases\nHave a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I've made many friends that way\nBut that was then\nNot in this climate we are to the point\nReally we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies\nIt doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects have all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O but chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\nWe have seen\nA lot of problems with Brock Obama and the reason I'm starting there is because rock Obama supported abortion he supported theft government death stealing ceilings stealing from people to give to others\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in this story\n... bomber had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney\nVery similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion he can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat\nOf all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the\nMurder of babies and Republicans rallied around\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney I brought up Obama so that we\nCan see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion so that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years four years\nLeft of Obama and Obama was devised with and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ...\n\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression\nOr not\nWhere but he often supported aggression\n\nHe was very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that in a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\n\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys we need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against a heartbreak guys\nI'm gonna tell you this we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nOn more brandy ...
