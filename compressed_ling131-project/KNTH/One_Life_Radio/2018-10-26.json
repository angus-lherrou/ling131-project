us look I agree with you is reprehensible when he says things like that and I don't think he's said directly the Democrats are evil but when he says the presses the enemy of the people he should drop

welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host ... Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned\nWho's concerned I'm concerned who's we be small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul what happened to the revolution what happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought\nThat everything should be black versus right you got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats who were responsible for so much racist violence\nEven today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism but that's\nThat's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the leftist racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant\nBut we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system our judicial system hangs on the voters\nIt does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is to dump devote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote how do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice\nAnd this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled from such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union\nGuy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union is\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and what happens\n\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative\nCandidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\nIs frightening how much division there is and really [noise] I understand there's a lot of people that support big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also supporting big government and why is that\nThat's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer do and that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to it than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by both allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has written\nAnd has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that does all\nThat I mentioned in the beginning I think even less than three percent\n\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of you think it will Obama's badger Obama's really bad about ... big government and then there are those are you going ... Bush was bad Bush is really bad Bush with big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was bad Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump do you really think drained the swamp Trump is any\nBetter with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nKavanaugh\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided\nWhat is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist I can sit there and have coffee and find some common ground and we could on the points\nThat we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse\nOver the areas in which we disagree I made many friends that\nWay but that was then not in this climate\nWe are to the point really we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects of all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick [noise]\nAnd then we'll get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on\nThey don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\nYeah back before the civil war we had some a handful of abolitionists\nOn the northern side that wanted to free slaves for good moral reasons and the southern states we had certain abolitionists that was a free slaves for good reasons\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in the story\n... bomber had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something\nThat was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different now maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\n\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around this they claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\n\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power\nAnd it failed and so for years\nFour years left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth that if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle ... out there are you ...\n\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression\n\nYou often supported aggression\n\nHe was very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that and a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd went to just do it increased the racial divide both ways\n\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm going to tell you this when we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nI had a confession I'm One of the eighty million people in the U.S suffer from Maine diseased bench data seeing a doctor for years I covered up my legs and live
