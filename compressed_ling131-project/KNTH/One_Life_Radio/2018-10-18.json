allergy friendly ... is like a gluten free Disneyland for all you out there are interested in that and\nI just think that we went to the last couple of years and there's just some great vendors out there with a lot of really healthy products on gluten free ... and and and then some say that but I'm so good to have you in Studio always said you'll pay and Elizabeth uh Albert is with us today as well\nAnd we're talking about this because I think this is so important so many people fall into\nThe trap of doing the same thing over and over and over again and they never really build that inner strength that that that just that that strike that that comes from just changing it up a little\nSo there there's both sides of the coin there it's if you're trying to create a movement pattern it takes over ten thousand reps roughly moving to create a new movement pattern so at that point you're trying to create a new movement pattern you have to do things over and over and over and over ...\nOkay so people out there listening say create a new movement pattern what does that mean\nSo if you want to get your squad purpose or you want to ... you want to better\nIncrease your gait pattern or you're running or something like that you want to prove that you have to do things that create that move pattern or at least ten thousand times to create that new neurological pattern of your brain\nDoes that mean if you're trying to get a perfect squat down or a perfect meal extension or ... you know me flushing whatever it is\nIt takes time decreed that move or pattern so in that aspect it's good to do things over and over again but if you're trying to get there is a difference between neurological and physiological effects right near a logical strength physiological size\nRight so we need to do things over and over again but you have to change it up to create more stress on them also to make it grow to an aspect you need a change of your programs quite frequently if your body builders something like that you're trying to put on more muscle mass but if you're trying to get more neurological and trying to get more strength and you need to do things a\nLittle bit more consistently at first until you kind of get to the extreme level that you want and then if you want a different type of strict any new switch it up but then you get the physiological effects of that as well mhm so there's there's benefits to bowl\nBut I think the main point of this article is just don't get stuck in a rod because then you are just you're wearing down joint you're not getting benefits on the muscle anymore and you're probably not even your goal probably isn't the moving patterns\nYou really want to say it was well I Want to say that you know he he made the reference on a body builder mhm everyday people every average everyday people you know they get stuck in the same routine mhm every single day and they want\nTo change they want a different result but there's a saying if you don't change the equation you're going to get the same results\nEvery single time ... you know so it's always recommended you change your workout at least three weeks\nThat's that for me that's what every three weeks every three weeks because like for example at tried mhm they come in and they take the class all the time same thing same thing you know your treadmill on the floor nothing ever changes and then they're like Elizabeth how come my body that changing now because you're not changing it up you know pushing ... whether that may be adding more weight\nOr that may be doing more intervals hills whatever it may be or even a separate work on something else like ... right or yoga or um spin\nYou in your body gets used to the same exercise that change is not going\nWell and the hit training Israel important I'm thinking of when I first met he never nap a teen ever not isn't one of the top fitness are experts in the country she was my personal trainer for about five years and uh she really did help me to transform my body I you know just results like incredible results I used to look like you\n[laughter] years ago and now the club and I live on that and then again it and getting it back one day at a time I'm not that far\nBut the point is like when I first start training with her I could jump rope for an hour nonstop and you know I could do seven to fourteen aired like seven to ten thousand jobs per hour and that was it was it was magical and I thought my and I'm In such good shape you know I could run I can do to spend bike I could I could run like\nJust as long like run for an hours straight and run pretty fast too\nBut when I got started training with Tina I'm she said that doesn't mean you're fat\nAnd so and then she you know described you made the different parts of the body we were going to work and then she proceeded to kick my you know what and it was still weightlifting and doing hip training and all this stuff and it really made me realize just how um how bad it not bad shape I within but\nHow I really could get in so much better shape and build like incredible uh endurance and muscled through doing something different\nYeah and I think like talking back what what Elizabeth said with the average person the one of the reasons they getting that rotten kind of just they're good for what they're doing but they're not for those other things yeah being well rounded is that after a while too comfortable first and you get really good and it might signing 'cause it's a lot easier right but then you get stuck it right it's easy I'm not going to push the ...\nWell I Do think that there's a benefit from it though in this respect that you do go off into a meditative down especially like when you're running\nAnd you get that runner's high or even jumping rope I mean after an hour I'm like at a I'm like I had a channel into that yes yeah I'm at like such a high level of consciousness uh and and just you know thinking about things that I wouldn't normally think of because my brain is just like so focused and relax and so that's important to\nBet is and that's a meditative thing that's the runner's high I've never experienced that I I have it's either I Do not like I've I've experienced a high doing other things but not not running [laughter]\nWell and I didn't like to run yeah I never liked around but I used to do the circuit of seven miles it with a set amount we did a triathlon like twice a week myself and my friend ah back in upstate New York and then we would wait a week twice a week\nAnd we would we would run seven miles away um then we would bite twenty five and we would swim a little bit then we would bike back then Lee which would then we would sometimes even do another seven miles it was too much but we do it like twice a week and it's actually when I first experience that runner's high because I didn't like to run\nI found it so laborious I just like really hated at a at the end I learn to love it when I got to that point where I where I achieved that uh you know that call if\nThere are a runner's high I learned how to sleep when I was running really [laughter] yeah out from one out of network [laughter]\nVery carefully you take a little cat naps you close your eyes on the street stretch and then wake up about thirty seconds later and then kind of do it again make sure you are wearing when I when I fought fires we did morning PTA every morning we had to run five to ten miles almost every morning and you're constantly tire 'cause that was in one of ... but then you could find buyers two or three o'clock that morning\nAnd you'd be back during the next day and so you were to show he's tired get no sleep so you learn how to sleep during runs\nYeah now that's crazy I never got the runner's high but I did learn how to swim and wondering and getting runner's high which is your busy sleeping side or the ... that's ... that's crazy I never heard anything like that I had\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nBuckle years ... years ...\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nOh right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter your host chip Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned\nWho's concerned I'm concerned because we be small handful of liberty minded people laugh because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul what happened to the revolution what happened\nWhat happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be\nBlack versus right you got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism but that's that's\nNot where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth\nIs we have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would like to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is\nAnd the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system our judicial system hangs on the voters it does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote how do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes\nBoth ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled from such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat and union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union us\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and\nWhat happens if you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta or the jury\nIs frightening how much division there is and really [noise] I understand there's a lot of people that sport big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also\nSupporting big government and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority\nIn the right how ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its the knee jerk reaction of the Republicans the knee jerk\nReaction of the Republicans false allegations\nCome find false allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man who puts the government's needs above those of the individual rights and has written\nAnd has written decisions court decisions saying as much we have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that just feel that I mentioned in the beginning I think even less than three percent\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of years ago Obama ... Obama was really bad about was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush with big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was banned Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump\nIs any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nKavanaugh\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\n\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist I can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could on the points that we disagree disagree and even in some cases\nHave a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I made\nMany friends that way but that was then not in this climate we are to the point\nReally we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet of all the other subjects have all the other issues that is the one\nThey will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nOh oh but ... years where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\nYeah back before the civil war we had some a handful of abolitionists\nOn the northern side that wanted to free slaves for good moral reasons and the southern states we had certain abolitionists that wanted to free slaves for good reasons\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in the story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama were ready\nTo latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can he gave lip service to the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\n\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund\nMurder of babies and Republicans rallied around\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but\nThey rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama\nBut they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had a pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion so that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years\nFour years left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ...\n\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression\nAre not everywhere but he often supported aggression\n\nHe was very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that and a lot of people supported him\nPurely because he was black and what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\n\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm going to tell you that as we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nThis is Dr Sebastian ...
