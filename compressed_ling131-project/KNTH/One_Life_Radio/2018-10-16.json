that one life radio dot com and um and that's it for today so other than we're going to be talking about how to manifest things that you want in your life and\nA autumn told an amazing story a manifestation we don't have time for it I don't think the shoe store I maybe it will tell it next week manifestation a\nStory maybe every week so people under really truly understand that they do have control over their lives they do have power over their minds and the ... they want to achieve and they're like a lot of people you know a lot of people ah\nThey recognize their parents a manifestation like\nI'm I'll be on and was just talking about with like a parking space or you know like we all have these little things that we consider ourselves you know like we we they happen to us you know it's more than just good luck something that we really believe in or whatever and they're the thing is that people don't realize you can do it on much more important matters but there's a little bit of a strategy that's involved in it\nWell your spirit and your thoughts have energy they do have energy and people are attracted to good energy and there and they want to run from bad energy and it's just the simple act of trying to keep yourself constantly in the present moment the president's state with a positive\nOn life and people around you the things around you will automatically that love attraction will attract good people into your last fight\nIt does and by by letting the universe work as it does so when you manifests larger things in your life a lot of times they won't come to fruition necessarily in the way that you think they ought to necessarily be followed\nBut when you allow yourself to be at peace and to be guided by what is truly happening and know that the outcome that you're hoping for is the one that's going to become president in the end then you don't get sucked up and all that back and forth day to day and the worry asked\nHow many times have you had something that you want and you didn't get and it was the best thing in the world that happened to have to have it all the time I could give you countless examples personally in my life where that's happened to me and I just got to follow the path that you were meant to be on he\nDid so it's it's not part of the power of letting go so if you want to manifest something like you know we're using the example of your ah your dream job\nSimply before you go to bed at night think about\nYou know get yourself to relax said and then think about getting the job to think about how you'd feel get your emotions involved think about you know how you feel after you get the phone call thing you got the job or an email saying you got the job what would you physically do would you you know scream thank you would you ... you know what you call your best friend would you\nLike think about all the steps that you go through feel get the emotional process renting really feel what it's like to the party achieved what it is that you want and then and\nActually you know ... like a movie scene playing out in your head\nAnd then once you get to a place where you can feel like it's tangibly happening in that moment\nThen let it go and by letting it go I mean breathing and breathe out and then just don't think about it and start focusing on your breath and start moving onto something else and don't necessarily take any um any further mental steps towards that\nA lot of times a a manifestation action is needed but you generally will be guided by intuition to knowing the action's needed it shouldn't be from a mental process it should be from an intuitive process\nSo rather than sit there and worry well should I send them a follow up email or should I maybe call my friend who has this connection and blah blah blah that is just mental chattering that needs to go by the wayside that's actually detracting from what you want you need to just be at peace and understand\nI have asked the universe for what I Want I have felt how it feels to get it and that will come\n[noise] it is\nSafe fees [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] you\nSure is\nBuckle years ... years Jim\nJarvis [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nOh right pull ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter your host chip Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned\nWho's concerned I'm concerned who's we these small handful of liberty minded people laugh because there's only a tiny\nFist full anymore what happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who love Ron Paul what happened to the revolution what happened\nWhat happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought\nThat everything should be black versus right you got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\n\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism but that's\nThat's not where I'm going like this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant\nBut we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part\nIs that every bit of our justice system our judicial system hangs on the voters it does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\n\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice\nAnd this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury\nWhen they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive hateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union us\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and what happens\n\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals was a vendetta on the jury\nIt is frightening how much division there is and really [noise] I understand there's a lot of people that sport big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also supporting big\nGovernment and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point\nI'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever if anything\nAbout the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its the knee jerk reaction\nOf the Republicans the knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by boss allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man who puts the government needs above those\nOf the individual rights and has written and has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual and the liberty people are behind them except for that does all that I mentioned in the beginning\nI think even less than three percent guys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of people think well bungalows badger Obama was really bad Obama was big government and then there are those are you going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush with big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was bad Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nKevin all\nYou really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\n\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist I can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could all the points that we disagree disagree and even in some cases\nHave a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I've made many friends that way\nBut that was then\nNot in this climate we are to the point really\nWe're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet of all the other subjects have all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nOh oh but ... years where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living we have two parties that oppose liberty\nHe supported theft government death stealing ceilings stealing from people to give to others\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in the story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office\nWe had something that was vastly similar to Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to the pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around this they claimed they did like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years four\nYears left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth that if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ...\n\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression\nAre not everywhere but he often supported aggression\nHe was very divisive and so we had that\nAnd a lot of aggressive people felt empowered\nBy that and a lot of people supported him purely because he was black and what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm gonna tell you this when we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nYou keep getting those annoying invitation to a new mailbox so we'll be we're going to have\nYour A.
