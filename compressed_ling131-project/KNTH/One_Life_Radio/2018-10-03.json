T. and I what I saw within those realm of people that it was really really common they were female clients I got a female perspective is this is this um\nYou know a a kind of like our synonymous with the with the ah the love\nWhat do you call it in the sixties the love right everybody says you know we think\nSo because I think that was very counter culture back then and I think this is normal now this is the okay normal I don't think it's seen as counterculture okay um so one of the things I always say is what fires together wires together so any type of behavior we do repetitive Lee\nCreates an expectation that creates habits it creates thought process as it creates beliefs\nUm and so just like the whole porn industry and you know I talk about sexual addiction all the time is that sex becomes disconnected you don't know the person\nI'm it's an expectation created by a had a a ... a fourteen year old who lost her virginity at Thirteen land because she was at a party with older boys and it was just expect 'em or God well\nYou know when you were speaking just now I I I Want to take back when I sat kind of being the ... I I forgot about what about all this swinging with couples like ... you know that that have been you know they're in their forties and fifties it just go meet up and like exchange partners I Can't even imagine well it's\nNot so it's not just in the college or high school it's all over\nBut when do we start getting program to believe that one this is okay to that this is normal or three it's remotely healthy or beneficial in any way because it's just not we we ... our statistics in America are off the chain for all the negative consequences\nI think it's this type of it's just it's leaving us yeah and that's leading this has to call has to have an overflow in your life and I can just you know randomly sleep with a bunch of people and that it not affect the rest of your life\nRight absolutely and you know part of the problem and I'm just going to speak from a female perspective but I've had ... with the same\nIs that so as a female we grow to be disappointed in men we say they're not commit all they don't know how to connect they just want to have sex they have no integrity and then when you have a male who sees the same about a female they say the same thing so then we the bar is really low\nYou know we just have this expectation that people have no integrity about their sexuality they have no commitment they have no fidelity why would our millennial culture everyone to get married\nYou know I mean it just you can see the destruction of the just the fiber of society with this type of mindset ... that you know where you know\nThis is as good as you get hooked up so I'm an asset to young girls here in Studio um what do you guys think about this as young females about the hook up culture\nI think it's really common I was just telling diamond in there I used to seeing like groups of friends just alternate and rotate between different partners like in the same print circle it was weird\nYeah wow yeah yeah that's where okay yeah I don't know I don't I don't I don't\nKnow was that your I don't care to college now OK Nancy my daughters that wasn't their friend experience ... but that's the friends they chose mhm but I have these clients and they're like this is what all guys do like I'm never going to have a boyfriend 'cause they just wanna hook up and\nThen well why buy the cow in the middle just free and so the girls they were they far have two pieces of the cage [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n\nBuckle your seatbelt ... years from\nThe army [noise]\n\n\nAlright welcome to another edition of the final chapter I've got to ask\nWhat do you guys want from me seriously de ... honesty do you want truth or do you\nWant me to lie to you to just make you feel good about your political choices and about the future of this nation the future of the world I can tell you that Donald Trump is going to rain in the messiah\nI can tell you that Brock Obama and Donald Trump are going to unite come together and be happy I can tell you whatever you want it\nBut that wouldn't be right to you you see I got complaints because I've critique Donald Trump because of critique Obama I've gotten complaints because I'm might\nIsolate the audience and I'm thinking okay maybe some of your stinking panties soup can handle the truth\nBut a lot of you out there 'cause I hate ya critique them where they are wrong and let us know where the right there's nothing wrong with that\nAnd you know what I think there are more of you who are reasonable than there are that are\nSensitive over emotional panties just just saying\nAnd so giving you the benefit of the doubt guys I've got to talk to you about something that is really really concerning to me\nWe watch the Kavanaugh saying it is a circus it has a circus\nKevin I was not a good appointment if you listen to this program you know that Kevin ... is not a good appointment it was Kavanaugh who said hey you know I'm not going to rule on a a case regarding Obamacare until it's resolved through the Supreme Court that was when he was in a lower court\nHe wanted to wait and see if they were going to consider it a\nTax and there was a reason for this\nI Want you guys to understand the significance of him referring to this as a tax of him waiting for the ruling of this as a tax and his suggestion that it would pass constitutional muster if it were attacks\nI Want you to understand the implications this when he said that when he suggested that when he refused to rule on it and kill\nUntil it was decided that it was a tax what he in essence did was said hey if you\nIf you rule that Obamacare is attacks been were OK they were OK with it and the constitution thanks to the sixteenth amendment\nSo what he did in essence is decided the sixteenth amendment\nIs the way to get Obamacare through because it would be illegal and the other way what does it extend the met say well the sixteenth amendment basically opposes the constitution but since it was an amendment and the kind of becomes constitutional\nBut it opposes the very nature in essence of the constitution chip don't keep us in suspense while alive you already know but just in case there is someone out there who doesn't know\nThe sixteenth amendment says Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever\nSource derived with out a portion meant among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration you see taxes were only collected based on\nWell\nBased on portion meant they were only allowed to collect taxes from the states based on the census\nYou see the states pay taxes to the federal government the individual did not until this I still wonder if the wording permits individual income tax but that's what the that's what the whole design the sixteenth ... was the income tax\nWhich\nI Will tell you guys one day how the property tax maybe a little bit later in the program how the property tax\nEnables the income tax but in the meantime Kavanaugh we're going to go back because I I went out a little bit a little ways out Kevin ... was the one who suggested to the Supreme Court if you rule that Obamacare is a tax then it can pass constitutional muster\nSo what we're seeing is Republicans backing\nAnyone the Democrats don't like you guys this is a football game\nYou're playing with your lives your wellbeing and your futures as it is a football game now the Supreme Court should not have the power has but guess what the Supreme Court ruled that it has the power has and that's why this record has the\nPower goes to the constitution toward the weakest branches of government\nBut it ruled otherwise so basically the courts have assumed power they're not qualified to assume and we have allowed that Congress is supposed to be the absolute strongest\nBranch of government the branch of government that creates and makes laws not the Supreme Court and the Congress is restricted to which laws it can address and make\nThe whole gay marriage thing I keep going back to gay marriage thing if you notice from programs program because I don't think the government should be involved in marriage however\nCongress has no right\nTo make laws regarding that that is the state's issue and the Supreme Court has no right to make laws regarding that is the state's issue and the Supreme Court has no right to make laws now that being said\nLet's roll back so we've got a list right thing here rooting for our teams\nRather than rooting for liberty [noise]\nThe left brings a false allegations against Kavanaugh the rice says oh no we're going to support this guy no matter what because of what the less doing\nAnd the few\nIndependence or going this guy's supported Obama Care or at least he helped get Obamacare passed this guy supports the stop and frisk attitude he supports the Patriot act he's porch\nBig government over individual liberty he's not a good choice buddies pro life\nAnd sometimes that's all a Christian needs guys we need to stop this battle less versus right we do we need to stop and say hey look I Am not going to support everyone the left hates I'm not going to do it\nI Will not support everyone hates\n\nI Will support only the protection of individual liberties including those individuals within the womb\n'cause you guys don't know that the constitution losing ground work for protecting those individuals with a new um\n\n[noise] our protect the liberty for those I Will protect the liberty for the Huey P Newton gun club to march spouting racist anti law enforcement propaganda\n\nWith firearms strapped around their shoulders you've got to support that because you don't have to agree with their message you have to support the right to carry the right\nTo the second amendment is as valid as your right to the second amendment the right to the first amendment is as valid as your right to the first minute we have got to get away from this\nI hate you because you're Republican I hate you because you're Democrat I hate you 'cause you're liberal I hate you because you're conservative we've got to get away from that we have to realize that we could unite on many fronts\nMany many friends we can't unite on the abortion issue because constitution is clear and protecting the liberty of those who are yet to be born\nIs absolutely one hundred percent clear in that\nWe can't you're not on that\nWe can't unite on a big government thing but what's comical to me is to watch these cases that the ... black lives matters groups rally around\n\nI tend to get pulled over and harassed by law enforcement a little bit more often\nWhen I'm clean cut yeah but I'm speeding them I get pulled over but I have a have speeding ticket and almost Twenty years when\nI've got long hair ... I've been pulled over for nothing for absolutely nothing\nAnd and I I Would I say nothing I mean really nothing I was driving my daughter and her beat her and yes she had to beat her she loves the car whatever I had my long hair didn't look right and um\n[noise] simply adjusted by self my a seatbelt\nI never comes to poke poke coming after ... ... why 'cause she's driving a car it looks like a ... car and got long hair and he fits the profile so go take him down so we want to do\nWill take that that there may be we're down anyway it's a guy comes up with Johnny law sitting there\nHe has his gun in his holster let me see your ID well I'm concealed carry permit holders now I Do not agree with having to be permitted or licensing but until we fix the law I'm not ready to go to jail\nOr oppose the law or pose licensing sometimes to survive you have to do what you do and work on it from legislative point of view so our present him with my\nConcealed carry permit\nAnd my ID and he's standing back there with his hand at his gun\nOut more chick yeah ball I of course you've got new arch dude I'm getting concealed carry permit I've been through the freaking S.

and I looked like a meth dealer\n\nThey're gonna harassed me and that's what I'm saying we get this idea as conservatives that anything that a liberal person says is wrong and it's not there is some truth\nGuys hold your horses there's some truth to what some of the ... has protested there is some truth to some of it and I'm not saying all of it but there is some truth to some of it and we really
