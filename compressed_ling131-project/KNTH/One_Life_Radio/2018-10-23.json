Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned\nWho's we'd be small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full\nAnymore what happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul what happened to the revolution what happened\nWhat happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\nYou got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right but that's not the\nCase when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest\nWas a leftist Democrats\n\nWho were responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism [noise] but that's that's not\nWhere I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the leftist racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system our judicial system hangs\nOn the voters\nIt does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is to dump devote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right it should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury\nWhen they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive hateful climate what\nHappens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union is\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and what happens\n\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\nIs frightening how much division there is and really [noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that sport big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also supporting big government and why is that\nThat's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to and that is the point I'm going to kind of think they're out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\n\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected emotional knee jerk reaction\nFrom the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever if anything about the Kavanaugh\nCircus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to it than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by both allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man who puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has written\nAnd has written decisions court decisions saying as much we have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that to all that I mentioned in the beginning I think even less than three percent\n\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of you think it will bombers badger Obama's really bad about was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush is really bad Bush with big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was bad Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nKavanaugh\nYou really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\n\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist I can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could all the points that we disagree disagree and even in some cases\nHave a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I made many friends that way\nBut that was then\nNot in this climate we are to the point really\nWe're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects of all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in this story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow many of you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney\nVery similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion he can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to the pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\n\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around is they claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had a pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up a bomb us that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power\nAnd it failed and so for years four years\nLeft of Obama and Obama was devices and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth that's not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your
