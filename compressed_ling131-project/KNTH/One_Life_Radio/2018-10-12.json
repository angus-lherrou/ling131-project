Kevin's at the Mike carols getting ready to perform here and just a minute what is the main thing that you want people to know about ... therapy and a correction that was Nineteen thousand dollars a month now the year they said I said we're not ... that's like you got me feel better that's a lot of rent to pay\nA and still make a profit um but uh so what do you want people to know about flirtation therapy or sensory deprivation as they call it as well\nI think it's one of the most effective tools that people have available right now for not only taking care of the physical body but also for a or psychological hygiene\nYeah oh I like that I Love that I Do too and you know and I think that uh\nI absolutely love that I Can't even I Can't top that because that is that's really what it's all about it is and so you you can't perform you can't do anything well if your mind and your emotions are not right you are ... that was where you start\nThe way I looked at it as you know we we have a lot of experience in the course of the day that we don't have the time and energy to process mhm\nSo we're constantly stuffing that down just write honestly pushing it below the level of consciousness an olive that\nUnprocessed energy and experience from our day becomes like a a residue on the lens through which we see the world are cells that are really in the world by doing something is good for us floating gives you the opportunity to clear that lens away and they're not just changes everything about your life\nYeah how you see the ... you talk about opening your mind and is the ultimate a mind opening experience and not like in a weird way like you hallucinate are all these things that you know people tend to I think exaggerate in order to make it more profound than it really is it's just quite simply profound you don't need to exaggerate about asked right yeah\nSo uh but I Love having you guys in the studio and of course as I said at the beginning of the broadcast you know Carol I first\nHeard you perform at the paleo FX in Austin, Texas\nAnd I walked through the door a it was a Michele Norris is assistant and I can't think of his name he was the sweetest thing on earth and said hey you want to see something cool and I'm sure he's like come here and he just like you know motion his finger and then he ... and they didn't like you know with this with his finger as well and we walked into the auditorium where were you where you are performing and\nI got about twenty feet in in my emotions\nMe and I just tears just started ... just rolling down my face\nMy lips liquid ringing I'm like oh my gosh you know I just I was looking around thinking what is going on and what is happening with me and if anybody staring at me right now he's you know I thought so self conscious for just a moment\nAnd then I just you know went with the rhythm and the music and it was so cleansing so unbelievable we went back behind the stage and to Michele Norris his makeshift little office while we recorded the podcast after the broadcast with her while you played in the background\nI have to say it was one of the most fascinating experiences of my life as I told my daughter this morning\nUm and I would bring her with me tonight to your event but it's her dad's night so I I Can't I don't have\nAccess to her but you will be performing tonight a at a salad hailing event here in Dallas texas at the twelve yoga\nBetween eight and nine PM or the address is six hundred south tower would indeed balance at the liberty bank building on the second floor tickets or twenty dollars and you can buy tickets at the door on line to the Wii twelve website tonight between eight and nine one like radio we will be there I Can't wait to experience that but I Want you to give\nOur listeners a little taste of 'em this medicine if you will right now he ... that would be some\nSort of thing and the and the way that a sound healing works is is very similar to the way the flirtation tank works as well because you\nUm anything that's traumatic it leaves an imprint on your body and um\nThese are ways that you could have a relief you had it in the foot tank your very first time yeah the major emotional and physical releases\nAnd then you could think Larry field clear you weren't affected by uh the things around you the way that you normally would be triggered mhm and uh the sound healing works the same way it goes hand in it ah it balances the left and right hemisphere is of the brain and it just penetrates the body moves the water\nAnd the flu it in the body as well as five right the phones\nWell I'm ... ... ... whatever you whatever it is it's ... sounds almost mystical but it's very real I'm telling you everyone here and I was going through a lot of traumatic I had I had a lot of trauma\nLike really bad trauma during that time and I really didn't know how to release it I didn't know who to talk to and the sound hailing just I like floating just took it out of my body my mind in my spare at so here we go guy [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] it is safe fees [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nBuckle years ... years ...\n[laughter]\nIt's\nAll right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host chip Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned\nWho's we be small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul\nWhat happened to the revolution what happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\nYou got that wrote and slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right but that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism [noise] but that's that's\nNot where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth\nIs we have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system\nOur judicial system hangs on the voters it does\nOur jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote how do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes\nBoth ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled from such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union us\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could\nAnd what happens\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury is frightening how much division there is and really\nI understand there's a lot of people that support big government unfortunately is most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also\nSupporting big government and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its the knee jerk reaction of the Republicans the knee jerk\nReaction of the Republicans false allegations come find false allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man who puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has written\nAnd has written decisions court decisions saying as much we have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that does all that I mentioned in the beginning I think even less than three percent\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of people think of all bombers badge of Obama's really bad\nObama was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush is really bad Bush would make government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was banned Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any better\nWith his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry Kevin Oh\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist\nI can sit there and have coffee and find some common ground\nAnd we could all the points that we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I've made many friends that way but that was then\nNot in this climate we are to the point\nReally we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects have all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O but chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\n\nI'm just gonna say you're fighting against your beliefs your core beliefs or at least your state court believes if you are we have seen\nA lot of problems with Brock Obama and the reason I'm starting there is because rock Obama supported abortion he supported theft government death stealing ceilings stealing from people to give to others\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in the story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something\nThat was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different now maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\n\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\n\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty\nSupported abortion so that they could remain in power\nIt failed and so for years\nFour years left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces\nIt ... out there are you ... I mean everywhere he supported aggression are not everywhere but he often supported aggression\nHe was very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that in a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd what does this do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm going to tell you that as we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nOkay did you wake up this morning you're in charge of their culture and Europe are back was or who may be the problem is that the whole world totally for sleeping on this charge or I changed my fellow citizen I did I could have felt better I better I ...
