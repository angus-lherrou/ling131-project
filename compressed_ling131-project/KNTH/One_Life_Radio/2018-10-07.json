provocative and said we were solely responsible for recent downturn in relations between their militaries\nTheir spokesman also reiterated China's objection to a recent us arms sales to Taiwan and the imposition of us sanctions over China's purchase of Russian defense equipment\nQuote as for the provocative action taken by the U.S military aircraft we are firmly against it and we will take all necessary mean to safeguard our rights and interests and quote so they said\nTo be fifty twos flew over the strategic waterway largely claimed by China in what the Pentagon called a routine mission\nSeparately to be fifty two is also flew over the East China sea where China has declared an air defense identification zone and claims uninhabited island controlled by Japan\nChina hits ought to strengthen it claims to the south China Sea by building islands on reefs and equipping them with military facilities such as airstrips radar domes and the missile systems\nFive other government claim territory and the oil and gas rich area to which an estimated five trillion dollars in global trade passes annually defense secretary Mattis said he wasn't concerned about the bomber flights raising tensions with Beijing\nQuote that just goes on if it was Twenty years ago and had they not militarized those features there it would have been just another bomber on its way to Diego Garcia or wherever Matt said referring to a key us base in the Indian Ocean\nMad dog Mattis went on to stay so there's nothing out of the ordinary about it\nSecretary Mattis is right we're doing what we need to do to ensure a freedom of navigation is China seeks to take control of a major navigation passage we have to refuse to play their little game\nAs we discussed during the service academy football review last week army suffered a heartbreaking twenty eight to Twenty one over time loss to number six ranked Oklahoma and the sooner zone stadium\nAs the game progressed in army hung in against a team that many picked for another national championship playoff plot the fact that it was a pay per view TV only event in the state of Oklahoma enraged college football fans on Twitter who are hungry for what would've been a massive up that\nOklahoma fans should have been rattled to find their team almost defeated in a game where the sinners we're thirty one point favorite but it with the black Knight post game locker room game that really made an impression\nOklahoma city's news nine ran a story about how clean the visitors' locker room was after army left the building and tweeted their

wear beard provided they can do better than peach thighs but don't go full mountain man\nThe move to allow face for which took effect last month\nAccording to the military was made to get Canadian service members more freedom in their appearance is\nThe new rules which came after extensive consultations with the troops are expected to boost morale and attract more recruit they came as neighboring service members to the south are pushing for more relaxing standards on facial hair\nLast year than US Army secretary Eric Fanning allowed seek soldiers to grow beards for religious reasons the directive it since been interpreted to allow other soldiers to do the same including a soldier of the north pagan faith\nFor now the army's rules allow beards only for special operations soldiers and those with waivers officials have reportedly been studying the possibility of a more lenient policy\nLooking at such issues as whether scruffy faces could interfere with gas masks our sailors have also pleaded for permission to grow Crump catchers but so far the navy has resisted\nCiting concerns about the proper fit and performance of respirators and other gear\nThe same safety concerns apply in Canada where under the new rules commanders may restrict beard growing but then only temporarily\nIn circumstances where safety or operations require it for example in chemical biological radiological and nuclear environment makers of gas masks and safety equipment have reportedly been looking into ways to accommodate\nBearded warriors but Canadian defense minister ... saw John an army veteran and seek has already patented a special good for the beard designed to work with gas masks and create a gas impervious seal\nI oppose the idea of beers for military members excluding special ops troops part of the reason is combat ready troops never know when they're gonna have to do on a gas mask or other kinds of protective stuff another reason as personal hygiene and combat areas beards do catch and hold dirt and grime\nAnd finally I personally don't think of US military\nHave veterans affair report finds that carrots New Hampshire medical center\nAccused last

more staff\nEmployees also found that facility a better place to work than a year ago when it ranked one hundred and twenty seven out of one hundred and twenty nine facilities on that measure\nIt
