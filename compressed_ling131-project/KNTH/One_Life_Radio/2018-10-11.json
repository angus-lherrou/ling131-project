I found that fascinating there's an idea that Houston was even considering\nI Can't even believe that that even exist like it to me is the most insane thing ever it's done so far out there and they shot him again [laughter]\nLike really insane like I have to be crazy I'm just going to say that to to to participate in that I don't care what your circumstances are it's weird it's beyond weird but you're here to talk about it if you listen to the podcast\nAfter the broadcast with Jon Benet but today we are talking about uh working out barefoot so many people do this I didn't you'll take as an kinetic specialist trainer at tell us fitness center right next door to I heard a I hurt media studios so\nWhy is it good to work out a barefoot or is it\nWell it it's good for certain people you need to look at different factors like you have a high arts lord to do your toes you have any like ... like things like that can affect the range of motion with your toes and it could be harmful thing then if you ... you might not want to work out like\nToo long or do to to\nLike too much running type stuff with it or if you are doing barefoot running now you're doing it without took like Wrigley you're taught my friend who does barefoot you're not gonna want to hear he'll do if you go barefoot and you don't want to do it on pavement\nAnd I think she she may not feel it now but I I just don't know how that couldn't be so damaging to the to the bottom of your foot especially your he'll like you said you're just you're supposed to run into it it\nWill not millions where there's a big four foot running movement and it's actually it can be very beneficial ... like when I run I Do four foot running myself\nOkay so for people that don't know what four front\nHunting is can you explain it or foot right so you know hitting where are you hearing kind of more of the balls your feet and then you're coming down in the back up without necessarily eating your fuel first you hit the balls your feet first being come down\nThat's a lot of pressure on even a bottle of you're a little bit but\nYou're actually absorbing a lot with the muscles and ankles you have to have very very strong and very um in a lot of endurance and your calf muscles yeah but it does\nHave to have strong ankle muscles or you know like like a race for some reason they are your you could you could really get seriously injured\nYou really can you have to build up to it for sure yeah that's the thing about barefoot in general is like we were born like if you believe in God like I Do like we were created without shoes right we were created to go bare foot on grass in the dirt and rocks all kinds of stuff we were not designed to go on the pavement stuff\nBut when we put our should be in shoes all the time and we haven't come out of them very much that's where you have to be careful going better yeah especially if you're going to running or something and American\nIndians even had mocked sense I mean you have to act yourself from the cold and\nExactly exactly so I Would say it can be very beneficial for a lot of people but you also gotta look at the factors are you working on a facility that doesn't allow you know shoes then it would be bad to work out there with no shoes 'cause you'll get kicked out or you could drop weight and things on an athlete's foot exactly athlete's foot like you're going in the locker room it's like man wear sandals right\nSo there's all kinds of different factors I say in general it's probably a good thing to go barefoot every once in a while and work out like that you need to know he got to be careful not to droppings on the foot but if you work in an outside or something in your front yard I'd say it'd be really beneficial to bury your grounding you're getting all the nutrients from the ground lamb it's just I work\nOut barefoot but not outside that's where I draw the line like I Would never run barefoot but other than that I loved being their fat\nYeah but go down not barefoot is actually a good thing every once in a while again if you do and running neck like that's an extreme running of itself is going to be very taxing on the joints throughout the whole body you go barefoot and you better have some very strong feet you better work up to and you better also go slow as far as like not doing too much mileage it\nFor them because you think of it there's a several I forget the name of the culture that does it they they run barefoot or in the sandals that they make out of um tar not to our um [noise] what\nDoes it do it on the wheels from rubber I feel like I'm playing ... [laughter]\nBut they are ...\n... what's the nationality of people they they're famous for barefoot running they do everything in their in their village and they just run everywhere pretty much barefoot and they build up palaces and everything if you were to go there for all the time you're like you build up to ... to ... yeah the front of the things that make sense if you're in a climate that you don't have to wear ... for the cold and all that kind of yeah but I Would say if you have a flatter\nHarder on the bottom of your feet and then we could evolve backwards\n[laughter] I haven't heard of that but it's like\nIf you if you're going to run barefoot or you're gonna work out barefoot a lot for too long you gotta be careful of flat arches and you're not going to be able to absorb the force of the ground so you could have a lot more impact on the heel of hammer impact on the back\nYou made me think of something 'cause I have really high arching now is it better I mean is it better or to run barefoot if you have high arches\nAgain a high arts is a very general terms there's a lot of different things that could go on there so\nIt's not it's a case by case basis okay had to really do a foot analysis on you\nSo if someone wants to work out their ... and the gym but the gym has no she will like you said what are some options\nSo those are the ... finger shoes right where you have and those can have different variants of some of them can have a little bit of support and some of them have zero support I have several pair they have zero support\nOr cuter because I really like um they are it has to lay low layered as funny I went\nTo a ... a basketball game want them all and the girl I took like really on my I'm okay with whatever\nThe yoga or you or I or I'm OK you ever see her again yes I Do [laughter] I'd like to hear him but anyway so the five fingers shoes or\nSafe fees [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n... buckle years ... years Jim\nDharma [laughter]\n\nAll right Paul ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host ... Darby are right here guys we\nAre absolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned\nIt was we be small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul what happened to the revolution what happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\nYou got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things\nIs black versus right but that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right let's be honest\nIt was a leftist Democrats\nWho were responsible for so much racist violence even today\nWe see a lot of leftist policies that that\n\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism [noise] but that's that's\nNot where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the leftist racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting\nI Would like to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit\nOf our justice system our judicial system hangs on the voters it does our jury\nPools are gathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote how do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice\nAnd this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled from such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat and union\nGuy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union us\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and what happens\n\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative\nCandidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\n\nIt is frightening how much division there is and really [noise] I understand there's a lot of people that support big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also supporting big\nGovernment and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer do and that is the point I'm going to kind of think that out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to it than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by false allegations come up\nAnd because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has written and has written decisions court decisions\nSaying as much we have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nThe liberty people are behind them except\nFor that to all that I mentioned in the beginning I think even less than three percent\n\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of you think it will bomb was badger Obama was really bad about was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush is really bad Bush was big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was bad Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drained the swamp Trump is any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nKavanaugh\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist I could sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could all the points\nThat we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse\nOver the areas in which we disagree I made many friends that way\nBut that was then not in this climate we are to the point\nReally we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet of all the other subjects of all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living we\nHave two parties that oppose liberty\nYeah back before the civil war we had some a handful of abolitionists\nOn the northern side that wanted to free slaves per good moral reasons and the southern states we had certain abolitionists that wanted to free slaves were good reasons\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in this story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office\nWe had something that was vastly similar to Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to the pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs state version of\nObamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years four years\nLeft of Obama and Obama was devices and I don't care what\nYou say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth that's not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive with terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ...\n\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression are not everywhere but he often supported aggression\n\nWas very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that in a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd what does this do you think\nPriest racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\n\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak God I'm going to tell you that as we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\nOh\nWould you like to give some great ideas about restaurants festivals concerts live theater special dams museum
