safety and food and personal care products\nAh she's also a certified public accounting and it's owned and operated numerous businesses and the Dallas area um so we're talking about prepping Fifteen reasons to begin ... so\nGive us some reasons why we should how 'bout that okay yeah\nSo we talked a little bit about like just um if you lose your job I'm saving money with beer budgeting um we talked about the medical emergencies and another thing that can pop up where you know a lot of these are just financially related where you're like OK I Can't you know something has\nThrown me out of whack that I didn't foresee that rise caused problems\nBut I said oh and you should always have some salt yes I'm thinking of my dad right now my dad like always said you know you can clean wounds with it you can do everything it's always go ice you saw in your car right yeah so I grew up in upstate New York yeah you know so it was a big deal out of\nAll those good yeah natural disasters we talked a little bit up as we got her again Michael going right now you know I mean so there you know many people do many things that um natural disasters will get into the winter here and then people will be snowed and that makes a complete you know different sort of thing so natural disasters or something to definitely think about um power\nBut as we talk to briefly about that last week when we did when we did the show but power outages huge huge huge and that can come from anything I mean\nThat do you believe in having a generator in your house I do I do I can afford and you should say for did he die and then they have this this great little um\nI don't know structure I don't know what it's a it's a it's a it's a a portable gas tank mhm you can put it in your pick up and fill it up I don't know how to pick up so I'd have to borrow one button I took an upper house I think twenty to thirty gallons yeah and like put it in your garage in case you needed to get your cars or your generator power outage ... yeah a good investment\nThat those are really great things to have I mean really and truly we do not realize how dependent we are on electricity bill you start taking that out of it I mean\nGood the grocery store is even if you have fresh food everything that's fresh spoils right so I mean you can't you you want to keep your refrigerator close you went to other things that you lose power and you start to really get in trouble um so that's a big\nOne you know I I I just make me think of a tip so you know like when you travel if your hours been out um even just for a couple of hours because you know um you put a penny on the top of a glass of water or something and then if you're if you're\nIf it's if your power is out long enough for the ice amount and the penny dropped to the bottom of ... you know that you're you know when you get back that you had a power outage that's a\nGroup that's a really good idea because interestingly my for my freezer broke this week and that and I've been going back and forth on this stuff thought yeah I Need all the while they're young and I and it's you know we didn't butcher box and so we have a ton of sense of ... in our freezer\nAnd we're like we don't want to throw that the way that I that's a great idea idea right keeping your freezer at all the time I found on NATO or somewhere I don't know you love to love social media yeah but in Folsom time yeah yeah yeah\nYeah so um so those are some good things back to talking about like the bug out bag you know we talked about cooking but one of the things that you can throw in a bug out bad would be um some cookware so hopefully if\nYou're in that situation you're going to have we're going to you know you also wants umpires starter type stuff but there's some really great cook or that you can get your hands on that is tightened that's made out of titanium so it's super light and so that would be the kind of ... that you would want to have\nEither in your home or in your book out bag for cooking yeah expensive well you know I I Know the blackout back for the products that I recommend is about the budget is about twelve hundred dollars but that would be a complete you feel like completely and that's with cookware as much as peace of mind you are right right so\nUm I think it's I think it's definitely worth it one of the other things you want to think about is water water and the really big thing I always helping our one yeah you first thing you do as you go fill all your um you fill all of your bath tub Zannier thinks any reservoir that you can in your house of water as soon as you can\nUm worst comes to worst you can drink water out of your bath tub\nUm warrior type toilet and yeah if you yeah it gets down to ground comes to worst yeah but then also you want to if you're not going to be seen in your home you're going to want some kind of water filtration so you can get you can get 'em\nPurification tablets which you can drop into water so those are pretty easy pretty portable like if you're you know out and you're having a drink they also have like small filters they're called um\nUm Sawyer is one of the brands that does those but there there are many little filtration I've seen them and you can actually like to drink out of a straw right right out of you know out of it at a toilet if you had to filter the water and so that's\nThose are both things that I recommend in your book out bad because you can um certainly water is incredibly incredibly important so are\nWe going to be able to put this blackout bag ingredient list or an ingredient seeing\n[noise] to\nSee [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n... buckle your seatbelt ... years ...\nYears\n[laughter]\nAll right Paul ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your hosts ... Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned\nBecause we these small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul\nWhat happened to the revolution what happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we falling victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\nYou got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\n\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism but that's\nThat's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the leftist racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting\nI Would like to say ignorant but we're Franken stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system our judicial system hangs on the voters\nIt does our\nJury pools are gathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice\nAnd this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat and union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union is\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and what happens\n\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\n\nIs frightening how much division there is and really\n[noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that sport big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also\nSupporting big government and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\n\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction\nFrom the majority of the left in a minority in the right\nHow ever if anything about the Kavanaugh\nCircus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to it than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by false allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support in big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man who puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has\nWritten and has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that does all that I mentioned\nIn the beginning I think even less than three percent\n\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of people think of all the bomb was badger Obama was really bad Obama was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush is really bad Bush would make government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was banned Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any\nBetter with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry Kavanaugh\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist\nI can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could all the points\nThat we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I've made many friends that way but that was then\nNot in this climate we are to the point really\nWe're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the room\n\nThat is it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects of all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\n\nO O but chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living we have two parties that oppose liberty\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period and the story\n... bomber had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that\nWas vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nYou can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to the pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat\nOf all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama\nBut they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans\nCheated changed their rules in Orlando changed their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years four years\nLeft of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem Obama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle ... out there or you ...\nI mean\nEverywhere he supported aggression\nAre not everywhere but he often supported aggression\n\nHe was very divisive and so we had that\nAnd a lot of aggressive people felt empowered\nBy that in a lot of people supported him purely because he was black and what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against a heartbreak guys I'm gonna tell you this we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final
