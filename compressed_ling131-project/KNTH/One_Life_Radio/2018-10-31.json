champions or her website ... champions dot org\nOkay so how to cook for your family and reduce fast food intake Jill continuation of last week let's talk about this\nWell it's a great segue from the I'm finishing up with the author of me hooked in the sense that I think what the real story is around me is the quality and that's really what the study was about it went up to twenty five top fast food chains\nAnd actually surveyed them and said do you have a policy about the quality of the means that you buy like do you basically care good meter maid if we are going to quantify me in that way you know do you buy from places where they monitor the way they use the antibiotics\nIn the animals so that's the only maybe just use them of the animals sick just like we humans are they just practically giving it to them all the time because we have them crowded into a tiny little\nYou know feed law and they just want to do that so that they don't get sick 'cause right lines their bottom line so what what's your policy and so they agreed the twenty five and basically all of them failed but to um surprisingly to you know lesser known but um I think more prevalent across the United states France yeah shock and one poll burger fi\nAnd they just basically talk about the fact that more and more fast food restaurants are starting to take into consideration that we as consumers actually do care where food comes from a little bit helps them up and coming brands one called elevation burger more they're seeing more and more companies are starting to\nUm look for have policies a number one enforce those policies and and let us know and ... where they're getting their food and so I think the biggest takeaway here is\nYou dictate how the quality of the the food you buy by spending your money on the quality food absolutely follow the money trail we talk about this in the beginning where the money goes so does the product production and ...\nWell I Would go as far as to say that any um ... national food chain that publicly traded\nOkay forget about it they're not worried about quality they are only worried about the bottom line a pretty pretty sure I'm a hundred percent right on that um and but I Do have to say so I'd shake shack last week I friday friday show when it went to shake shack had myself a beer\nSurfing they do that\nBeer while I waited for my for veggie burgers and my two veggie hot dogs that didn't actually have the veggie hotdog they called it a garden dog and I thought oh gotten in a brand you know what I got when I got my car with a bunch of pickles and lettuce and onion and uh you know relish in my ... but it tastes just like there was a ...\nI'll get in there but there wasn't but it was absolutely delicious yum yeah I mean I think the reality I think the take home is and people would say well she's got she's nutrition is you've got to be like never eat fast food but the reality is in real life as a mom of three kids from time to time Mahmoud happens yeah I it's not my preference it just happens and\nSo you can be irresponsible consumer and roll into places where they're trying to be more ethical with with the food that they purchase\nOr I prefer like the fast casual modeled like ... ... they're a pay way places where they actually sort of real vegetables like yeah just the pickles and the chopped up iceberg lettuce and it's a condiment but you can get a salary you can get\nYou know broccoli that steamed and so that's as as our family roles that so we try to lean on but you know there's the occasional place and this was really happening for me like okay you know what we're going to put our money as a family if we really want hamburgers or traveling we won't do that\nTowards these brand and now like I Am making an effort to do that\nWell shake shack had a beat veggie burger that's what I got I didn't get any meat but but as I understand like Ted and that report yeah they're one of the top ones they do care about the quality of the food that they're serving a and their employees they pay their employees more you know\nIt's interesting in this article and and and the people work well why doesn't really matter what the article goes on to talk about the fact that the world health Health Organization and the CDC and other government health type 'em and do things like that\nAre concerned about the fact that the animals the antibiotics in the medicines and the hormones and the stuffed animals are taking\nAre transferred over to us and we consume bear flashed basically and that that is increasing our human susceptibility to have antibiotic resistance so when we get sick and we can go to get put on antibiotics because we actually need it they don't work as well\nAnd so to just be mindful of that and back to Marta the author of me hooked in my house as we\nReally do come to the conclusion that\nI think people should be less meat spend more money on better me and if that means you have to eat a little less me fine but I think we should eat meat and just needs to be good me\nWell I agree and you know diamond I'm going to bring you in and that's because ah you had mentioned I don't know maybe a month ago that to you and your husband your your phone bill I was reduced in you have more money now for better quality food or by not\nPurchasing as much me and my is that a good summer yeah that's exactly it which surprised me 'cause they always say it's\nSo expensive to eat healthy but when you don't purchase meet during the on the weekend to eat during the week it cuts down your bills so much we only eat it when we eat out like Joe said mhm\nYeah I mean I think again I I Would rather take that extra few dollars instead of buying three found the three pounds of conventional let's say ground beef about rather by a pound and a half of the grass fed grass finished\nAnd I would rather in the same sentence by less packaged foods does not make me the villain here owned by less packaged foods like and buy more fresh fruit and vegetables you know it's the whole picture\nWell you know and eating well there was it's funny how serendipitous that content can be some times when I ran across something that's so sitting for a a show but I I I found is that says the poor diet this is fresh thinking and this was in ... as I said eating well magazine by ... sat that says a dollar forty eight\nHow much more healthy diet costs on the average per day compared to an unhealthy won adding up to about five hundred and forty dollars per year that the twenty percent food budget increase for the average family and the lowest income bracket that's not that much\nYeah it is I think the diamonds pointing to that article it's it you have to just be strategic so you can buy nut butter and you can buy these and just start to upgrade the stuff you eat most often enough I tell people will do so you go from buying the super sugary cereal to the no sugar added cereal and then you hope to your family into\nOatmeal you might start with the instant oatmeal and then you might go to like the\nThe whole oatmeal that takes a little longer to cook so you can't take an F diet too in a overnight psychology doesn't work that way but you can slide into it by just having frozen vegetables like that's some of the\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\nBuckle your seatbelts\nDriver's\n[noise]\n\nAll right guys welcome to another edition of the final check from your host ... Darby I've got questions but I'm not asking him today why not because I've got answers which take precedence over the questions I Want you got to be in a good mood I Want you to be cited I Want you to enjoy life but let's be honest\nWhen there are people out there who are voting for ... into ... into Mr O'Rourke an Irish man who is pretending to be Hispanic now this is offensive to many guys sorry\nThis is truly offensive to me I Would like to go fisticuffs with veto I really would\nJust to take this\nTurn down I'm sick of him you got an Irish men pretending to be Hispanic supporting open borders anti guns and things that makes it let me tell you about this the Irish were taken prisoners\nSold into slavery in the Americas those who weren't killed or butchered in the sixteen hundreds\nThe Irish have known of oppression\nThe Irish have been defenseless I Do not support Irish people or anybody being defenseless yet that's what ... supports and he's tried to hey I'm going to use this cool hip\nName Plato or beetle or whatever the heck it is and why is he doing that because he wants to hide his Irish heritage and I'm gonna tell you what\nYes the stereotypical Irish man is a little bit impulsive a tends to drink a little bit likes to Raul a tidbit I agree that the stereotypical Irishman but you know what else they work\nThey work they work everything\nBe told does is anti Irish grant you\nSo chip while you got a problem while you get a problem with this liberal retard stepping away from his Irish heritage well guys\nFor those of you have listened to the program for any length of time you're familiar with my Irish heritage but you know I'm kind of a a multi right some of 'em but let's just be honest I'm um but\nWe have Irish background we have a Spanish background as well and this guy is taking Hispanics\nTaking and faking his bank heritage for the purpose\nOf getting votes I mean ... is a whore to the max and maybe I should start a show off like that but he's a whore to the max\nAnd the problem is\nHe's more like a madam if you will see a whore just pimps themselves out they they sell themselves for money for votes for gain whatever the piano is selling out your independence\nHe's selling about out your right to self protection\nTo self defense\nAnd he's pretending to be something he's not\nNow while the stereotypical Irish men tends to roll a lot since to defy lot to be a little bit impulsive and to drink a lot\nThe stereotypical Hispanic works their tail off has family values\nAnd drinks a lot that I have a serious and that's it anyone who's worked in construction you know this anyone who's\nBeen around them this is the stereotypical hey we're going stereotypes backed off people there's a difference and I don't care\nWhat you say uh your your political correctness you know why\n\nBecause I don't that's yet in a nutshell I don't care about political correctness I'm telling ya stereotypical ... typical white man too\nBut right now I'm covering two lines of my heritage so according to all the PC crap if you want to go PC I have a right to speak about the stereotypical Irish myth and the stereo typical Hispanic which beat toll is not stereotypical Hispanic\nIs neither stereotypical Irish men do he actually has Irish roots and so we've got this man out there who supports open borders and it cracks me up\nSometimes it depends on the ... and sometimes it makes me fuming mad it depends on which heritage we're going with I guess I'm ready to go to the costs when it's my Irish heritage\nBut it makes me do you mean mad when I see the toll pay two sides in a fenced yard Gino how\nHypocritical that is what does ... does stand for open borders welcoming criminals no security\nNo self defense windows criminals commit seriously come on guys what can I get an a man let's do a little bit you get I get an a man brother because Beethoven ... says open the borders ... anyone in the borders anyone\nRegardless of their criminal backgrounds lift them and let them come let them rape lift him pill is a man let them flooding gr [noise] [noise] no bitches no borders\nNo criminal checks no background checks\nYet\nFor those of you who wants to defend yourself from the criminals coming in may not work\nPay toe old works his brothers and sisters\nNo firearms for you know a our fifth teams for you know mechanisms of self defense for you weren't going to let them rate and pillage and ponder without background checks [noise]\nYeah\nI just wanted to go a little a southern Pentecostal there for a minute guys this is ridiculous\nSo when I see someone with a fenced yard and it'll be to side with someone who even has locks on their doors and it'd be no sign they are hypocrites or more aunts you can't really get past that they're either hypocrites or more on\n\nOur society so and I don't know if we're going to recover from it\nMan how can we recover from the stupidity I Know of a way to start a show today chip but you know what I saw too many pseudo science and actually one is too many but I've seen too many of them\nHave you heard any guys heard these cheesy commercial that Greg Abbott is putting out about the MS Thirteen gang butchered\nThat butchered and mutilated some girls and he's taking credit for fighting against him is Thirteen let me tell you the truth\nTed Cruz is the hero oh I Know some you Trump veins run out there well I Can't because your God Trump\nWas lying about crews and insulting crews and you just couldn't get over it now listen I Know some of the guys out their support Trump who aren't just worse than Trump let's be honest\nWhatever Trump said about Cruz was about as reliable as Trump's words when he promised to pay all of those contractors\nAll the contractors that didn't work for him prior to him filing bankruptcy\nI'm just saying you can't trust what comes out of Trump's mouth of that being said let's tell you the real story\nAbout Ted Cruz let's say the real story about him is Thirteen and that commercial cheesy commercial that Greg Abbott is putting out there\n\nWhen in Houston yes used\nA group of MS Thirteen members took a fourteen and Fifteen year old girl I shouldn't say a took a fourteen year old girl and a Fifteen year old girl they rate them repeatedly raped them repeatedly\n\nThe reason is because we know that while there are some good people out there there are also some bad people out there it's the truth\nIt is the honest to goodness truth I mean and this is where the liberal libertarian open border ... or ...\nIdeology falls apart they won't leave their doors unlocked they won't leave their cars ... be a lot of people who were open borders have been says why to keep bad guys out of their property\nNow here's here's the bumper chip chip ... your ... you got a point but the problem with your decision to to make that statement to the problem with your argument chip is this\nHere's the problem with your argument your illogical irrational argument chip you're saying that we don't want to criminals coming into our yard in our homes\nBut that's not the same as having them come in to a country where the land is\nBecause we're not talking about individual property we're talking about a country you see land not your land and this sounds great guys okay now let me let me put it to you this way\nThe nation\nOr state is my preference that you live in is the one who grant you a deed to your land\nSo if you don't recognize the sovereignty that nation its borders and it's right to establish borders then you don't recognize that nation or that state's right to establish the borders of your property\n\nOut too that burned you should've let me repeat that for the dumb guys if you're good solid conservatives and you've got someone who is dumb was your liberal hey it's okay to make sure that yours are cleaned out for this\nIf you don't recognize the state's right to establish and defend its own borders then who is it that establishes your borders\nIt is the state\nOr a political subsidy of that state a city\nOr county that\nSame state you don't want to have the right to recognize its borders is the one you want to secure your property if someone Trish passes on your property you turn to the state don't you\n[noise] is somebody trust passes on your property or break into your house you turn to the state you don't want the bank foreclosing on your property without proper procedure why because it's yours\nNow I Know there's ... there's a whole agenda there we're not going into that what we're talking about is property rights as established by the state\nEither you recognize the states' authority to establish boundaries to establish property rights and to protect property rights or you don't [noise] so anyone who supports big toes ideology\nWho owns property Europe flipping\nHypocrite you Ari flipping hypocrite or you're a moron I don't care which side you choose all chip I Choose to be more on that's fine\nRon but you're either a hypocrite or moron and that you can't\nCome at it any other way there is no other logical conclusion because the state that you oppose having borders protect the borders and recognizing borders is the same state that you expect to protect your borders and your property and to recognize your property\nI'll take it one step further most\nOf the libertarians and I really do support libertarians more than I support Republicans\nBut most of the libertarians and a ton of the liberals believe that the police\nShould not go into your car without permission should not enter your house without a warrant and guess what I Believe that too I Believe that the police should not enter your property without a warrant\nI Believe the police should not be able to access any of your property without a warrant and we can go into the Warren did hold oh man there's so much to go over on the weren't but that's another issue again\nSo we believe the law enforcement the state the government nobody has a right to enter your property without a warrant\nBut\nIf you believe that the state has no right to recognize borders or boundaries\nThen you have to allow the law enforcement to enter your property without a warrant because it's not really your property because there are no recognizable boundaries\nDo you see how any audit the open border argument yes [noise]\nGuys production is the way the enemy is it's time for ... you're listening to the final chapter of we'll be back in just a few minutes\n[laughter]\n... so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story used to the doctor and he diagnosed with cancer\nStage four and here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to met a share where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family they group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without\n... it's so worth looking into there's
