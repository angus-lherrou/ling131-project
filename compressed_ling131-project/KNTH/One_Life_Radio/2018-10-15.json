defense league meeting\nThis weekend Sunday ten fourteen you know were taping this to bring all these wonderful people to you that we could never ever ever get in one room except the gun rights policy conference so\nWe're kind of back to back there but we've got a whole different crop and for a whole different reason actually believe it or not so let's get going here on segment for from the cross street holster studios to knock out this hour of armed American radios monster broadcast from Phoenix sitting to my left the only individual\nWho I've named a segment after over all these years you know him as the Allen Corwin experience it as a pleasure and an honor to be here with how are you good to actually see your face market what a pleasure almost no it's a pleasure it's still too that's okay I found a rock out in front of my\nHotel last night I and I know there's a lot of rocks in Arizona and it looked like a lever right you know what you do with a lever yes as a matter of fact I Do but tell me you throw it over your shoulder and you'll leave or right here 'cause it's worthless yeah that's right I'm a rock collect somebody ... years ago and I don't know\nI Know that was but as a geologist here in a very highly miner allies state\nWe go rock collecting with kids and we teach them about nature and they learned about geology and the planet and it's really wonderful and some of the rock to find our labor rights leave or right they're leaving rather others are very valuable for collection teach you a lot about science geology chemistry physics things you don't get in school\nAnd the fun part is you teach kids\nThere's lots of other things you can teach kids about two and we just had a a a veteran a mark Boston was on from Vietnam vets wonderful ...\nWho's out there trying to teach kids in high school about some of the things that you and I have worked together on for many many years that's right now you're going to talk today and I love listening to you speak as you're you're a huge hit ear your band plays here this is a wonderful meeting and I'm proud to say\nThis time when I speak with third time I'm not a life member of a CDO congratulations though is really fun to be here this is family to me and you know how much I Love coming here\nNow I Know and this is the sixth year in a row the guns enamel magazine named Arizona as the number one a little late for gun ownership and gun used where constitutional carry a term that came from Arizona and all sorts of laws to protect your rights like nowhere else just a pleasure ... done here is like a book\nWritten by it and sell it among your friends you can carry it without much concern there is some prohibited places but they make sense to retake well you know\nBut there's crime that comes with that Allen and I'm surprised that Arizona right isn't a crime that\nCome ... no no no more than anywhere else you have criminals they operate in their criminal ... some ... and then there's the rest of us and\nWe found out who she will carry Arizona would still be the quote unquote wild was of course I'm being sarcastic\nNo but criminals operate on the constitutional carry anyway says simply carry guns and it's illegal and sometimes it gets stop sometimes they don't they used to be an honest person carried a gun and got stopped oh my God this is bad and it ruins your life\nBut it's just possession of personal property and you bring up a very important point boy Lewis we're going to start going for a nationwide\nIs discrimination against civil rights based on firearms the banks are trying to close down companies struck a deal with firearms that's discrimination it's discrimination based on a civil right\nYou can't do that and the hotels to any argument is well the hotels of private place so we can do that\nYou can see this as private I don't lend in blacks don't letting gays fat people women Jews that civil rights and civil rights are and in the constitution if you've noticed but firearms is right there it's an explicit express Sprite\nAnd banning it is illegal and this is a civil rights battles that we have to start operating on that way\nAnd something tells me that you personally are going to be at the tip of the spirit that fight here in Arizona\nI'm drafting the bill and with the infringement all infringement is banned if you try and take a firearm from somebody who legally owns it that's infringement by definition the people who do it should be held accountable and your firearm should be\nYou know one from confiscation now how\nAre we going to get something like this is Alan Gottlieb behind the previous segment we're talking about Arizona being ground zero and it is on two fronts All right\nIn the Senate of course wrestling for control the Senate I never would have thought we'd see red Arizona wrestling for control the Senate what is the state Senate or the federal federal ... okay this is a big fight as we know McCain has passed away flake is out of here big fight going on right now the polls are showing this neck and neck give or take one percentage point for a Democrat could win here\nAnd I can't imagine a Democrat from Arizona voting against anything pro gun either doesn't voting for anything grown for anything or anti God I just that doesn't seem to make sense in the from the blood of the state some Atlanta's ...\nArizona is going through some change Californians are abandoning that state because of the California policies and they're coming to Arizona where the property is better and the rights are better taxes are lower almost everything is better here except for the beach front we have a lot of beach no water and so they come here just can't see it\nYeah it's all the way with all the way over there like right after the earthquake will have they ought to be trust\n'em so they come here and they bring their California ways and it is affecting the voting body and it has the potential to change the legislature but Arizona is about as hard core pro America as there is in America\nTold me about the state level and I'm gonna move kind of quick because we've got about three and a half or miniature state legislature here versus federal state legislatures pretty solid is it not\nIt's solid but it's not great some of the Republicans are kind of rhino and they're running as Republicans and they're not strong on our issues we managed to get most of the bill through in fact I saw a list of bills and went through this year pro gun bills it's about Fifteen of them are Eighteen I had no idea\nI just check the legislative website and so the the guys at this conference here this is an open carry banquet\nWith over five hundred people carrying openly safest room and tells the safest hotel and failed or I'll tell you this I'm going to open with this when I Do my little ... up there\nListening guys up a fight breaks out don't shoot there'll be so many guns going just ducking like duck and cover you don't want to shoot in the room like this everybody's getting a\nCan of you know I'm Carrying a ... in a cross breed holster outside the waste and I love it\nAnd you don't shoot yourself there no your mood or what have you got whatever sport coats or I've got to say you're carrying crossroads where I Am it's a little easier on my back and you know what a lot and you can do it actually made we we may not with just a kind of make statements over here as well to write so everybody should say their best posters on everybody's\nWearing their best leather and have a gun and his hogs leg in there and\nWhat's wrong with that nothing of course not absolutely nothing that sort of little hotel discriminate against people based on the property they own that's bad see this to me if you're wearing I'm wearing a sport coat this is an unnatural motion reaching for fire on with your right arm if to carry strong side\nThis cross draws a much more natural motion [noise]\nBut it's up to the individual [noise]\nAnd I don't expect to have to draw in this room I don't\nThink you're going to have you if you have to we had a bigger problem on our hands and we're thinking of right now so tell me with with the remaining time that we have just as an organization that's award winning ... this is the ... of course Allen was reminding us grassroots organization of the year again that the gun rights policy conference\nYou guys are at the tip of the spear your right at the tip of the ... with your involvement in the studio and the legislation that you're talking about writing you've been working with this organization juice for preservation of firearm ownership sit for many many years\nWith the second front we have here is not just the Senate but the second front here is also Bloomberg money the battleground ran with it and I know it's aggravating but I got asked the question\nInforming hand Andrew training responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast series your host farms American radio\nBar Walter\nHalf hour or two we are rolling right along as you know well\nMaybe you don't if you're just joining us I Am I have moved the cross breed\nHolster studios out west to my favorite part of the country that's Phoenix, Arizona the value of the sun\nWhere we are broadcasting from the Arizona citizens defense league annual meeting and I'll tell you what this was an award winning organization grassroots for a reason and I am proud to be this year third time I've spoken here and been just been treated wonderfully it's all family to me but now I speak here as a life member and sitting to my left\nIs the president of the Arizona systems defensively gay cop David it's a pleasure\nTo be here is you know every single year it's always a pleasure to see you at venues around the country we just spoke at ... again at gun rights policy conference here we are in your neck\nOf the woods brother you got a lot going on here ... ... where you've got everything I was speaking with Alan Gottlieb in the previous segment our previous hour about what you've got going on in the Senate\nMcCain of course out flake\nYou've got to fight a battle royale going on over here with about a one point shift actually there's a potential for US Senate seat here to flip blew that blows my mind\nAnd Arizona then you've got the state issue here with Bloomberg you personally have been out front of this I've listened to what you guys have been doing here legislatively I say we because I'm a member also and boy I'll tell you what it it's it's an uphill climb is that a safe way to describe it\nOh yeah well you know where you been doing this long time so it's always ... ... the fight never stops that never ever stop so we go on in yeah\nDid you know no go ahead go ahead and\nWe go on and and this just keeps going and you guys like Bloomberg keep pouring money into everything ... pouring millions and millions and millions of dollars into the legislative elections now a federal and state\nWell he's pledged because I Love being able to sit here with you can have a natural conversation and I don't have to worry about a delay on the phone the millions and millions and millions you're talking about is over one hundred million pledged he just added as you know\nAnother hundred million I'm Talking about every town for gun safety in the rest of those words he added another hundred million to the fight for control of Congress right so this man is a quarter of a billion dollars is not more into this fight is that is that right\nWell and you know\nThe only way we counter that because we don't have that kind of money and none of us\nI have volunteered to be the billionaire that funds that I'm going to suffer if everybody wants to get to go find me page I Want to be the billionaire that funds are fight so have you can help me make that work please let me tell you to do it ... it but we don't have that kind of money we just we never will how do we compete with it you guys have got dumped some magic out here\nAre the only way we do it is to show up and you know you've been a member for a while you know how it works\nWe get our email lists to W. W. W. dot agency deals dot org getting our email last join up\nWe send you alerts anytime there's anything moving the Arizona Legislature that you need to be aware of it whether it's a committee hearings or whether it's legislation on this war as those going to the governor or whatever it is good or bad will tell you about it you send your email\nWhy do why do I care as a Georgia residents about what happened here in Arizona why do I need to be why do I need to be concerned was I live here man it doesn't matter to me I don't get up in Arizona put my boots on in the morning I mean I Do in my heart that every day\nBut in ... but it matters doesn't it of course the dominos all fall or this is ground zero there's this ... this is the center target for the anti gun establishment the professional gone prohibition of and then we'll talk about it but they know you know I Know this was this entire organization those\nAnd the man so you're left Mr got leave knows that if they can get Arizona fall just what happens next with gunshot state Florida falls we've already got difficulty in Florida right now are we a lot happening down there I never thought we'd see in the quote unquote gunshot state where I Am from so when you add all of this up\nThe dominoes do fall and what happens here boy I'll tell you what is going to be a model Nevada to bordering state and other tough battle another tough fight\nIf they can bring and you've won now six years done some ammo it's got this state from the last ... them all ranks out ranks Arizona number one ship what six years running up security in the room so so again\nEffectively tell listeners in Kansas listeners and Minnesota Michigan Ohio I Want you to pay attention\nTo Pennsylvania they're working on anti gun laws in Pennsylvania now day to make it a felony to carry a gun loaded and your vehicle they just never stop but from the big time here they can they can nail Arizona Bloomberg wants to ... oh yeah yeah okay and\nYou know in your and my dog is your PC one of the big things they've got going now is the gun violence restraining order thing and they're pushing that real hard they got Republicans on their side pushing it and it's just another step another another bird in the wall like the song and\nIf they get that then\nWhat else can they get well there for you know you're right and that's a great way to ask if they can because I hear it let me ask you this rhetorical sarcastic nonetheless by still want to ask even though I Know the answer this question of sodium\nIs it ever enough for them no absolutely not so when it was if we give them let's just say that hypothetical we give them\nAll expanded background checks because we're sick and tired of listening to Shannon watch talk about it we're sick and tired of watching all this a mulatto talk about it let's just give it to him and shut them up we already get a background check to buy a gun right so let's just give it to a will they dry up and go away\nWell you know it goes back to ... you know I'm a ... in our personal stricter goes back to the same logic that they use when they say well you know bad guy comes and you want something from you want your wallet he want your money what you do or whatever\nJust give it to him and he'll go way more if you want your life you're going to give that to\nA there are ... believe it or not sadly there are people out there that think well that's not going to happen to me and if it does [noise]\nGuns aren't the answer is well and we see that right but it's our answer our answer is no we are not happy the lowly correct absolutely correct so let's move to another one let's move to assault weapons ban ... because we've got a really bright kid named David hog\nOut there who was apparently a master of everything now he knows everything about everything so at first I was ... he tells us that if you've ever followed his tweets it's quite astonishing\n[laughter] of course I'm being sarcastic but I haven't talked to laugh I David ... the ... of the world's some something else but David hog now doesn't want to take away our God he just wants to take away our fifteenth so let's say we're sick and tired of David hog on the news all day every day and we say you know what fight\nLet shut him up unless we don't need these they don't need to say are Fifteen let's give them to him will he stop all shut up and go away no\nNo one else really wanting us because you know somebody some years ago wrote an article and I don't remember who was about Goldilocks gun control and he says you know wanted never enough you know is it to heart or is it too soft you at some point you get to that realization that they are never going to stop it's always gonna be something\nAnd that's the assault weapons just to put in the door once they get those are they going to stop of course not then they're going to count for something else and this is exactly the logic that we need to remember is always in play they don't stop they'd never stop\nThey've gotten bits and pieces over the years they've gotten machine guns and you know as they managed to outlaw those and so now we can own machine guns new manufacturing there all the only thing you can buy now is the stuff that's already on the registry and it was closed in a ... so they keep going up and up and up and you think they're going to stop an assault weapons of course now\nSo and you know what else is there but that's a that's a great question 'cause that was due process on the line you're talking about the ... extreme risk protection orders for example is a great example to talk about due process we're talking about a fundamental tenet of our judicial system we're talking about innocent until proven guilty but wait a minute\nI just watched the Kavanaugh hearings and I never saw a Democrat concern one bit not one bit on that panel did I see a senator on the left concerned about Kavanaugh's wretch to due process did you or am I missing something okay so if we see them at that level\nThey really don't care about my due process do they\nWell and this is the thing you know you actually had Democratic senators during that hearing saying that you need to prove to us that you're not guilty\nAnd they fight upset at that as a quote yeah you're not you're not ... that's not the shop paraphrasing that was actually set\nYeah and I mean somewhere along the lines somebody's want their constitutional law class\n[laughter] so I don't know that they've taken one of the you know I have a copy of the constitution sitting over here with me okay and I know a lot of people in this room have a copy of the constitution with them [noise]\nYou know I go over and read the constitution and my kids we actually talk about these things that we put them in perspective at home and my my kids are super bright and some of the stuff they don't know anything about it at school yeah we live in a really nice area\nIn a really conservative red area with really good schools but they're public schools\nIn the ... this this is a big concert or what's the next one minute that we have left what direction are you taking daisy CDL forward now\nWell you know we've got a governor that's pushing these extreme or protection orders like you mentioned ah we beat him last year he's four is going to bring it back so we're fighting were frightened to stay in place at this point we're going to try and move anything good that we can but right now we just want to make sure we don't get bombarded with that\nHazy CDL dot org is where people can go to join I'm a life member it's easy to become a member of this was the best group of people and an award winning organization for reason thank you for everything you're doing it for your dedication to the cause of fighting for our freedoms in our rights upstate cop the president of Arizona citizens defense weak and\nUm so now I'm focused on making sure that the Arizona houses as pro rights as it\nCan possibly ... and and how close are we in your estimation to that happening because an outlet to segue ... depending on your answer I'm gonna do it anyway but I Want to segue over to the federal election as well so where are we where are we here locally\nNow here in Arizona we're in very good shape um we've got a few districts that to that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts\nBut uh as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections are going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council race by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking\nTo no question or no those let's use the state now you feel comfortable about the state\nI'm pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe with the governor is going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do see but he's way way better than the alternative\nYou know you would the nobody was a big fan of a lotta people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump loved it and call the election the night of the election on on my radio program I said go to bed tonight knowing Trump plus three hundred electoral votes will see in the morning\nThree hundred and ... I still have people that I'm proud of this asking me to pick their lottery numbers for all right let's go now let me segue to the to the federal election I've I've talked with my previous guests over the last hour an hour and a half\nHere in the Arizona as in a strange place very when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one point race right now today as we sit here at the at the easy CDL meeting ... meeting so one would have ever found that\nIn bright red gun toting gun loving\nHistory of the gun state Arizona [noise]\nHere since ... who is the Democrat running for the Senate\nUm has painted herself as a moderate Democrat and she's done a pretty good job of it although a lot of her history is now finally coming out and people are realizing that she was a a a\nDemocratic socialist green extreme\nRadical leftist before she started moderating in order to be able to be elected to office she's like Mike Bloomberg becoming a Republican he didn't become a Republican because he believed in Republican values he became a Republican because they already had a Democrat candidate right and he wanted to spend enough money to get elected in\n... when it can you say you're with me for one more second sure you've our good because that we run out of time this was a short segment of the program of the hour what I Want to do is keep your carry on this conversation about the elections your neck deep and there's a lot of listeners are very very concerned about we're seeing coming up what we're seeing coming up in the mid term we want to get your perspective\nNot just your own Arizona but around the country as well I'm Talking with Jeff knocks I'm at the Arizona citizens defense league annual meeting\nFor armed American radios monster broadcast today Sunday the fourteenth I'll be right back after this don't go away [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat's alright news ... the Koreas are holding high level talks this week to discuss engagement admitted global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff with the north\nSouth Korea said the talks will be aimed at finding ways to carry a peace agreements announced after last month summit between Moon Jae in in Kim Jong one two leaders of the Koreas\nFederal emergency management agency chief Brock Long is calling the damage led by hurricane Michael some of the worst he's ever seen long toured several towns in the Florida Panhandle\nThey along with Governor Rick Scott hundreds of thousands still without power and will be for probably another two weeks or so they say they're working to get about Ninety five percent of them back on line so far the death toll stands at Fifteen\nAnd the European Union's top Brexit negotiators detergent talks with the point person did not result in their ... agreement an outstanding issues is is that sarin news\nAm defensive and be the answer\nThese days people then their children to college to learn a trade that no one in the family has done before they move away they work for someone who doesn't love them and then they trade they're intimately valuable time for a little bit of someone else's money\nWe'll plan was to get a job but lay aside each month and a later start a family business as the owner you leverage the time of others in her and all the hundreds of man hours per day it's called financial leverage\nAt trade way we teach you to start a family business by trading stock the added benefit is that each generation teachers the next and bills on these skills that and your children have the competitive advantage of experience that's a great plan for potentially creating generational will\nJoin us at the garden ...
