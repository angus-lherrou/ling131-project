I'm telling you sometimes is a long time it's another man cave it well that's true it is but it's\nAlways good to properly eliminate and completely eliminate and that's a good thing so um anyway thank you to Scotty potty and all of our sponsors because they make this rocket go up one more thing I forgot the expo\nThe gluten free actually coming up in Dallas we will be there on October twenty seven twenty eight at Dallas market hall in fact I'll give away some tickets right now so uh\nUh called diamond it to one for seven eight seven eleven Ninety or email us as much in play about radio when life radio look away some tickets All right so let's talk about this autumn\nIs what blew through a lot of time there but you know preservatives or something that are have a huge impact on the human body they're not good for you they're really not tell us why\nWell essentially my the simplest thing that I always tell people any time we talk about food preservatives or the fact that um\nWe need to stop separating ourselves from other creatures in the world you know look around look at the animals look at it as we were talking about the beginning of the birds look at you know the squirrels you know the bunnies any sort of wildlife Casey\nUm everybody else's eating food that looks like it came from there we ought to be eating the Atlantic and really they are says well I never really thought about that now obviously we are um more more civilized in a sense I'm\n... right in that sense and in other ways we're very civilized but I think right you are absolutely terrible horrific\nSo but so we can use our intelligence we can use 'em or adaptability to preserve our foods but let's do it in a way that um commune with nature rather than detracts from it\nSo you know there are natural ways to preserve food um canning them adding salt too I'm dean nature of the bad bacteria while allowing the good bacteria marsh and you can use different oils and different vinegar to um keep things\nFresh but by using chemical\nPreservatives what you're doing is you're changing the complete molecular structure of the food you're stopping its natural state of um\nDecaying and degradation and you are freezing it in a moment in time with these chemicals and thereby you are ruining the nutritional value you're ruining the um the natural value of this food it's not food anymore else said so so well set\nAnd it you know we've become this convenient society a society and the throwaway society and the selfish society where we want everything what we want a whatever we want we want it right now we don't like to wait fight we like to run into a grocery store and pick up things that are really bad for you like blueberries cereal I got a box sitting right over there and\nThen yesterday I was in target um and and uh or the maybe it was yeah it was yesterday yesterday morning very early getting some extra stuff with a baby shower and so uh but I saw on display and I even took pictures of it I've got it on my phone I pull it up here but pop tarts okay\nWhat a junk food I Know they are starts out with um now I think high fructose corn syrup I'm going to pull it up here I took I think it matters how raises\nAmazing for the food I mean the I mean for any when he was eating a pop tart recently they're not that big and it's like two hundred and forty calories you could eat you know a cup of vegan yogurt or something you meet at home even better\nSome you know an apple a handful blueberries granola or whatever like you could eat this you know massive bowl of food for the same caloric content as one dinky pop tart\nHere here's what's in that dinky after okay enriched flower which is wheat flour nicer reduced aren't be won Simon a beach to folic acid sugar or high fructose corn syrup dextrose soybean and palm oil often some more\nCorn syrup in case you were a little short throw some more in there which corn makes you fat by the way and it's all genetically modified and it's horrible for your body and your mind of bleach to wheat flour way ah pertains terror contains two percent or less of molasses cocoa process with\nA elk ally or cornstarch uh just goes on and on\n'em and natural in artificial flavors a modified cornstarch there some more for you um gelatin egg whites color additives anthem ... left us and this is a box of junk this is about ... the box of nothing right and I don't know nine for a box of it\nSitting on a big um that was one of those big baskets they almost like a basket over size you know what I have a great marketing tool but that would be great if they could put some fresh food in there\nYeah yeah and it's just a shame and you know the way that it's marketed as it seems you know in some ways you know they even seem wholesome you know with kids with kids being excited about them or putting them at being able to make them themselves and things like that\nAnd you know it's and it's just a shame because there's absolutely nothing in that less than that level that it's been processing level at them print there there's nothing that your body is going to look at and actually go oh food right everything is going to require an extra process for your body to derive anything out of it whereas you know you could also eat an apple\nAnd he went we wonder why the country so sick the most important thing that we really want to talk about here which is the same thing they were talking about what the ... all these ingredients a sequel us as a sweetener I think they do that though is a preservative don't they say oh I think so yeah ... um but what affect those types of ingredients\nHave on your good gut bacteria I mean they completely destroy it because it's not it's not natural for your body you know a preservative your body does need good bacteria in it so when you take something like a preservative or chemical ... and it's no different than if you you know\nSprayed Lysol over all over your food what you're doing is you are consuming a chemical that is going to be nature of the good bacteria in addition to the bad bacteria\nWhereas the way you need me need humans need lots of bacteria you know there are lots of studies that say we're more bacteria then we are human cells\nUm and by killing the good guys along with the bad guys just to get rid of the bad guys you're doing yourself more of a disservice than anything else ... so and naturally preserving food\nIt allows the good bacteria to remain unscathed and ... and therefore you're able to preserve your food at the same time as give your body of the stuff I'm good bacteria and nutrition from the food that you're saying here's a great\nLittle story it says imagine you have a hostage situation\nThere are five bad guys holding a hunter good guys hostage and you can't just drop a bomb on the whole building just to kill the five bad guys so the same goes for our bodies eating preservative is like dropping a bomb on our intestinal tract because these preservative kill both are good and are bad bacteria\nThere the natural preservatives vinegar it has a way to distinguish between the good and the bad bacteria right or as a chemical preservatives antibiotics on and on they don't know you're doing yourself harm\nAnd what about what they say it's a natural preservative what about that if it's truly actual natural such as filmmaker or lemon or um\nSome sort of a fermentation process then yeah that's great but unfortunately as we all know a lot of times the word natural as he is a little bit flight yeah Ali it's over you [laughter]\nGosh oh it's great having human studio on him calmly you can find er at pro by addicts y'all that's problematic child dot com everyone you know what you get one body you get one mind and you get one life be smart get out there and make them at seven [noise]\n\n[noise] it is\nSafe [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nBuckle years ... years from\nDARPA [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nOh right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter your host ... Darby right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned\nWho's concerned I'm concerned who's we be small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who love Ron Paul what happened to the revolution what happened\nWhat happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\n\nYou got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\nWho were responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\n\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism [noise] but that's that's\nNot where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the leftist racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system\nOur judicial system hangs on the voters\nIt does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right it should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury\nWhen they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union is\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way\nBut it could and what happens\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative\nCandidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\n\nIs frightening how much division there is and really\n[noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that support big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also supporting big government and why is that\nThat's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think they're out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction\nFrom the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh\nCircus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to it than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by both allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has\nWritten and has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that is full damage in the beginning\nI think even less than three percent guys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of you think it will bomb was badger Obama's really bad about ... big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush is really bad Bush would make government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was that Bush was bad\nBut you really think Trump do you really think drained the swamp Trump is any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nKavanaugh\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\n\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist I can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could on the points that we disagree disagree and even in some cases\nHave a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I made many friends that\nWay but that was then not in this climate\nWe are to the point really we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our\nAbility to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects of all the other issues that is the one\nThey will die on the hill they will fight the battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O\n... here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nI'm just gonna say you're fighting against your beliefs your core beliefs or at least your state court believe if you are\nWe have seen a lot of problems with Brock Obama and the reason I'm starting there is because rock Obama supported abortion he supported theft government deft stealing feelings stealing from people to give to others\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in this story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives\nAnd a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama were ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney\nVery similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money\nAnd fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but\nThey rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans\nCheated changed their rules in Orlando changed their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion so that they could remain in power\nAnd it failed and so for years\nFour years left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ...\n\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression\nAnd he often supported aggression he was very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that\nAnd a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm going to tell you that as we get back let's talk about what
