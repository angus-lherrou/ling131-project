journal and also the international society of sports nutrition all of a great sponsors helped bring this programming to you Dr Church a welcome back\nAnd Daniel tag and Elizabeth Albert I guess I'll start with Daniel since I've already introduced you Daniel take isn't or do kinetic specialist trainer at tell a fitness center and he has certified in or they'll kinetics biomechanics resistance training\nAnd muscle activation technique he's also a a massage it's a licensed massage therapist and holds belts and three different martial arts systems and was a wild land firefighter Elizabeth Albert is the owner of ... fitness here in Dallas texas\nAh she received her bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Texas at Arlington or she also play division one college basketball she as ... is also a certified personal fitness trainer a group fitness instructor a certified fitness nutrition coach\nAnd has been a basketball trainer for ten years and of course Dr Tim church as a medical doctor\nAlso a master a public health a PHD and one of the country's leading positions\nAnd exercise and obesity research okay last week Daniel we were talking about squats\nVersus a dead less so let's talk about the difference between the two first and kind of ... well\nThe biggest differences in a lot of the same movement pattern modified bowl the big issues where you're picking it up from weather a straight bar doing dead lifts\nOr ... kind of want that kind of surround you step inside of it and you pick it up or a bar bell which he usually put on your back and do swap that way it's all a squad movement\nNow we've defined it as a squad in a dead lift really the same movement and you can bury both of them differently the load that change\nWell and it is a that's so important because uh your lower body really you know I'm you know uh what do I want to say here it's like the foundation if you will ride of like a tall building a literally and so I'm gonna ask you Elizabeth I'm about to lessen squat squats which do you prefer\nI loved that last year like I Love that looked at her like the dead lifting get to hear it but I think your body but see I'm and\nIsn't that funny women [laughter] now they have their [laughter] I'll never figure it out but uh but I guess a healthy body is what you want right there [laughter] okay doctor Dr Church I'm going to ask you this which powerful move is the king of all exercises that list or squats because you are truly the expert here\nNo I'm not everybody's got every day I I wanted this thirty so [laughter]\nI Would do whatever more personal trainer with told me to do these report point here with aerobics it's pretty easy to figure out anybody can just kind of go to the mall and walk\nI like to tell people when it comes to resistance training you really do need to find a professional to get you hooked up yeah you know you can't just go out and kind of fake this stuff I one of the world's leading experts on exercise and weight loss and I have a personal trainer 'cause I Can't keep up with this stuff\nMhm so what do you does your trainer have you do both dead dead lifts and what\nI mean the mix it up mix it up there I mean that's one of the miners are structured so that I have I've been training so much you through I've been using my trainer enough anyway when I Do they mix it up\nOkay and so a Daniel I you know what the pros and cons of H\nYou the the con against the barbell on your back would be if you're not doing the right to potentially damage your neck because if people are leaning forward a little too much and goes up on their neck that could potentially be harmful\nTo uh doing dead lifts your ... a lot of times if it's if you don't have the hit mobility or the hip motion or an emotional ankle motion to get the bar at the bomb you're going to start in a ... position for lower back and can really hurt the lower back you see films on YouTube all the time of people doing dead lift Max's\nAnd they're lower back is just really curbed under which means you're loading that lower spine ... and it's really not a good thing for the low responding to loaded in that way yeah that'd be\nEssential risk there you could just kind of race it up a little bit we can lean down and get it without bending your lower back or hopefully you have the mobility to get down there and do it but those are some of the bigger pros and cons\n... con okay so it must have been said do you prefer the dad left over this quiet and why is that and how do you do the orders\nWell I I like to do that left more than I like that and Dr Church has said I like to change it up a little bit I mean to work every part of the muscle group um I think that ah with dead last you know ... and the nice um especially if it's a a heavy load\n'em guess their safety and again going back to a dangerous thing last week depending on your body depending on the load on yeah you sometimes don't have to ... you know Sam\nWhat comes down to what Dr Church said it's like it's just like in physiology and the ... that he was doing it to a case by case you know thing in the same thing with body by body who has the range of motion the way that\nThat Elizabeth is doing dead list is more like a straight legged or you just have a ... a ... so you can also bend your knees and that and go more knees\nAnd get more quads in it too so there's different types of motions you can do with it the way that she doing is going to really isolate the glue if you've been down with a little bit more on emotion then it becomes more like a narrow or white squat depending on what your motion at the knees is\nThen you can go heavier on the weight that slight bend yes nice\nOkay let's talk about muscle activation for people that don't know what is it\nSo it's making sure the muscle sends a signal to the brain the brain okay to go back to the to the muscle to get it to fire is called alpha gamma co activation and did the sounds complicated it is [laughter]\nIt goes on a neurological side which is not my forte I deal with more bomb mechanics I Know a little bit about the neurological side just enough to make me dangerous but\nThe big thing is there's three systems in the body to skillful system which is the framework the muscles which movie the framework but then neurological system is the link from the brain to the muscles that tell them all the contract therefore moving the bones so if you don't have a strong connection\nThen that muscles not going to contract so you can have the strongest most in the world but if you can't contract and that means absolutely nothing [laughter] so that's kind of what activating the muscle ages ... to do basically applied can use the allergy testing muscle testing and tried to single out\nA muscle best you can there's always going to be multiple muscles firing but you test you things to see is his muscle really going to sustain under force in a neurologically weak position which would be a shorter position\nAnd then if it's not and you're saying hey we need to target this by some specific exercise or by some treatment and they put it back into the movement pattern like the dead lifted a squad cars if certain muscles like the ... fire and you can be set up in a great ball mechanical way to get those clues to fire with those lists\nAnd they're not going to fire because they're not creating that signal so you know hamstrings going to take over some spinal sensors might have to take over\nSo you need to go back in and be able to test those in a somewhat scientific way to where you can say hey is this muscle really doing what I needed to do because it the right foods firing in the left boots not\nThen that left who's going to take over any work on imbalances a strong things get stronger the weak things get weaker\nAnd that can cause injury more doing more intense exercise like do you do if you're trying to do something like that mhm certain muscles aren't fire and you're going to do the movement you're going to make it work right but you might be in a vulnerable position to pull something or damaged joint or something else if everything's networking optimally\nWell and you can find it so many different ways to exercise I you know we talk about a assess ability um there's some great exercises that never make the top five less because they're either performed on a ... a machine or not everyone can perform them for example like\nHow it's highly unlikely I'll one had to pull up I got to make it to the top five less of a best exercises because it takes a long time to work out to one handed a hell of a word you know\nI Would have to ask you know what we're doing now than they swing from trees when you're out now [laughter] yeah well I Do\nPull sometimes when I'm Out in the wild yeah I don't necessarily swing trees all the damage fun okay [laughter]\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nBuckle years ... years Julian\nGarbage [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nAll right guys welcome to another edition of the final chapter ... Darby I've\nGot questions but I'm not asking them today why not because I've got answers which take precedence over the questions I Want you guys to be in a good mood I Want you to be cited I Want you to enjoy life but let's be honest\nWhen there are people out there who are voting for Pete toe to toe Mr O'Rourke an Irish man who's pretending to be Hispanic and this is offensive to many guys All right\nThis is truly offensive to me I Would like to go fisticuffs would veto I really would\nJust to take this turn down I'm sick of him you got an Irish men pretending to be Hispanic supporting open borders anti guns and things that makes it let me tell you about this the Irish were taken prisoners\nSold into slavery in the Americas those who weren't killed or butchered in the sixteen hundreds the Irish have known oppression\nThe Irish have been defenseless I Do not support Irish people or anybody being defenseless yet that's what ... supports and he's trying to hey I'm going to use this cool hip\nName Bayh though or beat or whatever the heck it is and why is he doing that because he wants to hide his Irish heritage and I'm going to tell you what\nYes the stereotypical Irish man is a little bit impulsive a tends to drink a little bit likes to Raul admitted that I agree that the stereotypical Irish man but you know what else\nThey work they work\nThey work everything be totally does is anti Irish grant you\nSo chip while you got a problem while you got a problem with this liberal retard\nStepping away from his Irish heritage guys\nFor those of you have listened to the program for any length of time you're familiar with my Irish heritage but you know I'm kind of a a multi right some of 'em but let's just be honest I'm um but\nWe have Irish background we have a Spanish background as well and this guy is taking his panics\nTaking and faking his bank heritage for the purpose\nOf getting votes I mean ... ... is a horse to the max and maybe I should start a show off like that but he's a whore to the max\nAnd the problem is he's more like a mat him if you will\nSee a whore just pimps themselves out they they sell themselves for money for votes for gain whatever but you know is selling out your independence\nHe's selling about out your right to self protection to self defense\nAnd he's pretending to be something he's not now\nWhile the stereotypical Irish men tends to draw a lot tends to defy lived to be a little bit impulsive and to drink a lot\nThe stereotypical Hispanic works their tail off as family\nValues and drinks a lot that I hate seriously that's it anyone who's worked construction you know this\nAnyone who's been around them this is the stereotypical hey we're going stereotypes backed off people there's a difference and I don't care\nWhat you say uh your your political correctness you know why\n\nBecause I don't that's yet in a nutshell I don't care about\nPolitical correctness I'm telling ya stereotypical ivy taste stereotypical black man too\nBut right now I'm covering two lines of my heritage so according to all the PC crap if you want to go PC I have a right to speak about the stereotypical Irishman and the stereo typical Hispanic which beat toll is not stereotypical Hispanic\nIs neither so typical Irish men do he actually has Irish roots and so we've got this man out there who supports open borders and it cracks me up\nSometimes it depends on the boat and sometimes it makes me fuming mad it depends on which heritage we're going with I guess I'm ready to go ... costs when it's my Irish heritage\nBut it makes me fuming mad when I see the toll the two sides in a fenced yard Gino how hypocritical that is what does ... does stand for\nOpen borders welcoming criminals no security no self defense windows criminals commit seriously come on guys\nCan again a man let's do a little bit you get I get an a man brother because Beethoven board says open the borders ... anyone in the borders anyone\nRegardless of their criminal backgrounds lift them and let them come let them re elect him pillage a man let them plugged into her\n[noise] no bitches no borders no criminal checks no background checks\nYet\nFor those of you who wants to defend yourself from the criminals coming in ... he told her work\nPay to go over works his\nBrothers and sisters no firearms for you know a our fifth teams for you know mechanisms of self defense for you weren't going on that they're great and pillage and plunder without background checks [noise]\nYeah I\nJust wanted to go a little less southern Pentecostal there for a minute guys this is ridiculous\nSo when I see someone with a fenced yard\nAnd it'd be do side with someone who either has locks on their doors and a veto science they are hypocrites or moron you can't really get past that they're either hypocrites or more on\n\nOur society stopped and I don't know if we're going to recover from it man how can we recovered from the stupidity\nI Know of a way to start a show today chip but you know what I saw too many people who science and actually one is too many but I've seen too many of them\n\nHave you heard any guys heard these cheesy commercial that Greg Abbott is putting out about the MS Thirteen gang\nButchered that butchered emulated some girls and he's taking credit for fighting against him is Thirteen let me tell you the truth\nTed Cruz is the hero oh I Know some you Trump fans going after a while I intended because your God Trump\nWas lying about crews and insulting crews and you just couldn't get over it now listen I Know some of these guys out their support Trump who aren't just worshipping Trump well let's be honest\nWhatever Trump said about Cruz was about as reliable as Trump's words when he promised to\nPay all of those contractors all of the contractors that didn't work for him prior to him filing bankruptcy\nI'm just saying you can't trust what comes out of Trump's mouth\nThat being said let's tell you the real story\nAbout Ted Cruz let's say the real story about him is Thirteen and that commercial cheesy commercial that Greg Abbott is putting out there\nWhen in Houston yes used\nA group of MS Thirteen members took a fourteen and Fifteen year old girl\nI shouldn't say a took a fourteen year old girl and a Fifteen year old girl they rate them repeatedly raped them repeatedly and then\nIdeology falls apart they won't leave their doors unlocked they won't leave their cars ... be a lot of people who were open borders have been says why two key bad guys out of their property\nNow here's here's the bumper chip chip ... your ... you got a point but the problem with your decision to to make that statement the problem with your argument chip is this here's the problem with your argument your illogical irrational argument chip\nYou're saying that we don't want to criminals coming into our yard in our homes\nBut that's not the same as having them come in to a country where the land is because we're not talking about individual property we're talking about country\nShe planned not your land\nAnd this sounds great guys okay now let me let me put it to you this way\nThe nation\nOr state is my preference that you live in is the one who grants you a deed to your land so if you don't recognize the sovereignty that nation its borders and it's right to establish borders then you don't recognize that\nNation or that state's right to establish the borders of your property\n\nOut too that burned you should've let me repeat that for the dumb guys if you're good soldier conservatives and you've got someone who is dumb what's your liberal hey it's okay just make sure that yours are cleaned out for this\nIf you don't recognize the state's right to establish and defend its own borders than who is it that establishes your borders\n\nIt is the state or a political subsidy of that state a city\nOr county\nThat same state you don't want to have the right to recognize its borders is the one you want to secure your property if someone's trust passes on your property you turn to the states don't you\nIs somebody trust passes on your property or break into your house you turn to the state you don't want the bank foreclosing on your property without proper procedure why because it's yours\nNow I Know there's ... there's a whole agenda there we're not going into that what we're talking about is property rights and established by the state\nEither you recognize the states' authority to establish boundaries to establish property rights and to protect property rights or you don't so anyone who supports big toes ideology\nWho owns property Europe flipping\nHypocrite you Ari flipping hypocrite or you're a moron I don't care which side you choose ... odd years would be more on that by being more on what you eat or a hypocrite or moron and that\nYou can't come at it any other way there is no other logical conclusion because the state that you oppose heavy borders protect the borders and recognizing borders is the same state that you expect to protect your borders and your\nProperty and to recognize your property I'll take it one step further most of the libertarians and I really do support libertarians more than I support Republicans\nBut most of the libertarians and a ton of the liberals believe\n\nThat the police should not go into your car without permission should not enter your house without a warrant and guess what I Believe that too I Believe that the police should not enter your property without a warrant\nI Believe the police should not be able to access any of your property without a warrant and we can go into the Warren did hold oh man there's so much to go over on the warmth but that's another issue and yeah\nSo we believe the law enforcement the state the government nobody has a right to enter your property without a warrant\nBut\nIf you believe that the state has no right to recognize borders or boundaries\n\nThen you have to allow the law enforcement to enter your property without a warrant because it's not really your property because there are no recognizable boundaries\nDo you see how any audit the open border argument yes [noise]\nGuys production is way beyond me it is time for a break you're listening to the final chapter we'll be back in to see\n[laughter]\nEvery side fashion
