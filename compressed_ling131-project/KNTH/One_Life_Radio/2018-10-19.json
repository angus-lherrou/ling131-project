I could be a blueberry 'cause I there are so great and I look great in navy\nAnd I love going to pick a good uh what about you dynamic live ever thought about it I haven't thought about it well you will as I Am so we've got we've got well we've only got a couple of days I live ... around it and then you have to clean one has to be on the on the clean Fifteen\nOkay oh got to be on the clean there's China apples onions as high as ... as blueberries on there has to be I don't see it oh well I'm going to be an organic blueberry\nPineapple cool All right [laughter]\nHappy that just me about that and that's what I'm Talking about okay\nSo that's one of my tips there is you gotta generate something to look forward to and it can be a big thing like an event\nOr it can be a vague gay or it can be more smaller like if you don't have the you know a lot of economic means it can't like one of my favorite things that that I plug it into\nI tried to plug into every week is just sitting on my porch with a cup of coffee in a fashion magazine and that is like I look\nWell words ... right it's that whole but what I get to go do that brings me some happiness actually generates happiness in the moment\nYeah I can make sense I think it should grab your cup of coffee and go on your patio every single day well I Try to but sometimes the work day well I I haven't because of the weather little that you know it's been raining a lot here in Dallas yeah crazy ... um but yeah I mean little simple things like that of course I'm\nLooking forward as you said it's something that is vital but what if we don't have a lot of money or means at our disposal 'cause a lot of people try to use that as an excuse which is why I said you should go out on your porch everyday right cost anything\nI'll tell you another one that doesn't cause as much as I look forward to my breakfast every day\nOkay like I cannot wait to have my veggie on land and my fruit like in that I just I Love that\nAnd my copy it's just I look forward to it every morning yeah you make an omelet every morning I Do well no well they have a lovely five out of seven days yes good for you yeah today I just had my college in protein coffee yeah\nWell I you know that surprises me 'cause you've said many many times that you don't like to cook but that's a short\nSimple thing oh I Love to cook because they know what to put my body but it cannot take more than like thirty minutes or I'm Out no way\nOh I've got to get you to a point where you like to create a ... or ... some night that only take I think our eight masterpieces within twenty minutes you can say no you can't yeah basically impossible because it only um the process of making and cooking impossible impossible sorry thank you I like to me\n[laughter] I was All right I'm going to get you make a loaf of bread before and watch\nThe dough rise because that's what we're talking with\nMakes you happy it makes you gives you something\nTo that may not make me happy not having things it let me tell you okay so the things that\nBring you I think you're going to tell me what makes me I'm going to tell you what I think is a great are you ... my my ... no I'm not I don't try to regulate anybody or tell anybody else what to do with their body or by the way that's your own decision\nBut I'm trying to make a recommendation that I'm telling you from having done it multiple times in my life yeah a simple act of of baking a beautiful loaf of bread which takes about an hour okay no additives like happy meeting the Brad\nAnd making it it's so wonderful and then you get to slice them out and put the butter roll over at no okay all enjoy linear and I'm point all enjoy eating it but I won't enjoy making and how do you know you've never done it\nThat's like saying I wouldn't I don't think I'd like sex because you've never had and I'm not saying you've never had sex you've got children I'm just saying how do you know that you're not going to live in this\nCongress [laughter] and make a point though right\nHave a number like we've done two so having purpose\nNumber two is you know having something to look forward to are having hope and then the third one is gratitude and having a ... office of gratitude and it's just it's been research so much it is absolutely something that is vital and key that you had gratitude over the simple and the big things going on in your life\nHave gratitude about the suffering that is going on in your life the anxiety going on in your life and it switches something about the intensity with which that you know is affecting you\nOkay so you said something I find very interesting [laughter] okay so how do you do that if someone is suffering what do you say to yourself what 'cause you know I I say to myself like I'm so I'm so lucky and thankful I have a roof over my head I have running water I have food and my refrigerator simple things like that so if you're suffering what do you say to yourself well\nIt's ... eat so I'll just kind of give examples from my life right away I I I have had my share of suffering from yes rape from\nUm a domestic violence to divorce to you know being homeless to having just a week ago really struggling with I'm a very painful performance injury and if you've ever had one of those I forget how excruciating yeah yeah\nSafe fees [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nBuckle years ... years ...\n[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nOh right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host chip Darby right here guys we\nAre absolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned\nWho's we these small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul what happened to the revolution\nWhat happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought\nThat everything should be black versus right\nYou got that ... black versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats who are responsible for so much racist violence even today\nWe see a lot of leftist policies that that\n\nI don't use a term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism [noise] but that's\nThat's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would like to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system\nOur judicial system hangs on the voters\nIt does our jury pools are gathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right it shouldn't go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury\nWhen they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat and union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union is\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way\nBut it could and what happens\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta or the jury\n\nIs frightening how much division there is and really [noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that sport big government\nUnfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also supporting big government and\nWhy is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\n\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever if anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its the knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by false allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has written\nAnd has written decisions court decisions saying as much we have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that just full damage in the beginning I think even less than three percent\nGuys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of people think of all the bomb was badger Obama was really bad about was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush would make government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was that Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry and Kevin all\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose\nViews would be typically leftist\nI can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could all the points\nThat we disagree disagree and even in some cases\nHave a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I've made many friends that way\nBut that was then not in this climate\nWe are to the point really we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects have all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O but chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they\nWant to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\nYeah back before the civil war we had some handful of\nAbolitionists on the northern side that wanted to free slaves for good moral reasons in the southern states we had certain abolitionists that was pretty slaves for good reasons\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period and the story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used\nState funds to fund abortion he can you give lip service to the anti abortion\nCrowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare\nStole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\n\nAt least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around\nThey claimed they did like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans\nCheated changed their\nRules in Orlando\n\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion so that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years\nFour years left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there or you ...\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression are not everywhere but he often supported aggression\nHe was very divisive and so we had\nThat and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that and a lot of people\nPorter him purely because he was black and what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys but I must tell you that as we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nDrowned van pay pasture and author of the new book marathon face surrendering your life to Jesus is the greatest decision you'll ever make but that's just the
