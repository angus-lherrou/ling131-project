that's what the material feels like which it's very cool make sure to check it out let's get back\nTo Ronda is they'll run to it's kind of interesting I Love your Twitter page because you have pinned to the top\nYour history you is the city of Chicago and the winning continues and you've got you know in the United states court of appeals for the seventh circuit is your case it's just really neat to see and I I Know how proud to tell me just\nYou got to be just proud is the Dickens for this have when you haven't won this case and continuing to defeat Chicago on this\nI Am I Am because what's next is actually building a brick and mortar gun rights let's say in Chicago because the fight that we've put forth here in the city of Chicago\nIs so instrumental and restoring gun rights to the entire state so these two ways that we got under our belt\nIs huge we want to take that we want to move forward that want to make sure we bring that brick and mortar come right to the city of Chicago style wonderful beating city of Chicago\nAre you going to open it I'm working with some people right now that I uh I Try to get it open so I have to be involved I\nThink that's wonderful and you make sure it will do the software but you make sure to let me know how we can help you with that what other publicity we need fundraising whatever you need you let us know that is John Norma and I want to continue to follow up with you on that OK Rhonda let's go ... go ahead\nNo I I I I don't want to get outta here because I have some important things that I Do want to talk about and discuss\nOh yeah you know before we get out of here so I I'll let you continue to interview but I Know like get outta here without um shares the mother knew that I I've done here\nTake it away because I Want you to be able to get what you want in here and not be asking a bunch of questions that didn't hit on what you wanted to discuss go ahead\nOh well you know first we were the last time the confidence it was a great thing we were there um it was back in the city of Chicago I met a lot of great people but uh we just started Chicago guns matter here\nAnd uh our objective is to educate as many people as we possibly can on their fundamental constitutional right to keep and bear arms but as I started to step out and people are the two I Am I started being invited\nTo some other events and at one of those events that I was invited to was a the D.C project mhm\nI was invited by love yeah well and I wanted to thank Diane a mother and love and back welfare fighting it was fifty wait a minute walk from every state went down to Washington DC to speak with their legislators has gone on us\nAnd it's rare that ... get the opportunity to voice their opinion and a positive manner because we see so much negative energy about fighting um ownership or someone is always call it the more gun control\nAnd I'm as that project came to a close a little bit\nLater I Want to say about a month ago we to DC project at the opportunity of being invited to take part in a debate with time magazine and with time magazine\nA big project it was a gun debate about guns in America and I want to thank band Mahler my D.C\nProjects sisters who took part in this time magazine project\nRepresenting themselves as a gun owners they had the opportunity to tell their personal stories\nThey told they found the hearts\nThey had the ... the passion that go there not knowing if they were going to be well receptive to accept it but nevertheless it was a grant to project they did well they did great and for all the people that went there to represent\nScholarship or the the Second Amendment side of things because how often\nDo you get to tell your personal story what happened in your life and how it happened and have someone to portray it in a more rural or land on the front page of time magazine and I think that's huge for us that were invited\nThat we're able to go out and partake in this because nationally\nGun ownership in America don't often get to see the positive side of things you know what I'm saying\nSo you ... you know that was that was a huge I'm Glad you brought that up because I'm going to be talking about that time mural cover in the next hour with their W. R. Hawkins also but let me point out to listeners what what it is run just talked about what you said mural\nThe cover of time it's actually a piece of art done by Jay are the artists\nAnd what they did was they pieced together two hundred and fifty four people from all sides\nOf the gun debate all sides everybody from Shannon watch all the way over to ... to ...\nAnd are good for even the task you on this thing and when you hover over the digital version their silhouette pops up and you can click on it and actually listen to their story it is quite fascinating I'm gonna have to go through as you know probably thought can get up to two hundred and fifty four of 'em and I will\nYou know and if it's going to be it's going to be quite the project but I thank you for bringing that up now we got about ... ...\nNo I just wanted to get that out of air because you know if it was a great thing and it spread that gun owners or to a support is get the positive energy that they got from this because those women and those may have went there and put their heart out you know they told their personal\nStories and and they don't get hurt as often so you know big up to that because we in two thousand and Nineteen D.C project will be back and watched in DC so I'll get to tell you more about that later\nYeah and you know the fun part about the time thing was a lot of people that you've never heard of before it wasn't everybody that you see or hear like me on radio and everything else it was a lot of regular people out there\nThat are telling these stories again from both sides and it's quite well actually I'm looking forward to going through the whole thing rounded with about another we've got about another minute Chicago guns matter the ... the website is great it's Chicago guns matter dot org\n\nLacrosse rain ... studio [laughter] or American radio and that was the right to bear arms because at the last former defense against here and we're making the second amendment for you to buy him a very strong supporter of the second amendment\nInforming and Andrew training responsibly our citizens from coast to coast theories your host of farms American radio\nBar walls or\nTo armed American\nRadio sisters of the shows flied right along I tell you if this hour's anywhere near like the last hour the segments were just flying by us and what you to make sure you buckle in okay going to be an awful lot\nAn awful lot of content being covered we're going to move very quickly to that I Want to read a comic first let me start with this kind of as I opened up the previous our case you missed it I'll start with this I did a\nNational radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not an I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and uh international interviews after something like this happens they kind of reach out to me that I've been very friendly to him over the number of years so and I certainly don't mind doing it I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just their elites mountainous at the top\nThat doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with especially when you know you're going to get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but the the article after my appearance on the show is titled it made I guess precedent on the LDC leaving leaving Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now it's even in light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get his view and good luck on your mark seemed adamant that stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation\nAs quoting me a background check looks up the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could name thirty mass shooters in America who at all past background checks quoting me again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun he can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\nIt's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to band is in reality that's not going to work because they can't be bad they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see those were the ones that want this to stop\nYou claim however at this point Kevin seemed to lose his patients referring to gun supporters who have recently spoken out in defense of gun laws in the U.S Kevin responded that the fifth of Americans with dunes are intimidating the full fifth that do not\nKevin ended the discussion by telling mark oh I don't want your thoughts and prayers any law then he hung up on me\nThey didn't say that and then he hung up on the edge of the interview and apparently unbeknownst to me went off behind my back which is proof positive that you've won the argument because these guys can't stay in the kitchen they like to go to the sandbox they they can't play with the big boys\nSo the videos on there if you want to go see it just Google LDC\nAh Kevin McGuire clashes with us gun rights supporter and take a look at it I put it out on my Twitter page if you want to see it at a A R mark at a A R mark what funnier than anything is to come down below\nFrom Martin Palmer so who says this cabin is in ... at a rude ignorant one is that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he slammed down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this present or\nBy the way what on earth does American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it is it like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year than in New York so\nI I enjoy reading that because I just thought before we went on air and I think it makes for great fodder to open up this discussion right now with a W are Hawkins from Breitbart News who\nI think will agree with me and some of the things I said you can actually listen to a minute and forty two seconds it was much like your interview but uh he was thoroughly crushed eight of you are welcome to the show my friend so did I say anything in there that ah that you felt was\nUntrue about background checks are assault weapons or bans are confiscation or anything like that\nNow that you've ... you're basically stated comics his positions and uh just the truth and that's it they can't handle it that's the bottom line I just can't handle it they're not open not only the one individual you're from there but the whole of all they're not open to the fact that they're wrong\nTo do that and it's not just as individual not talking about Brits were talking about every every left the the things the way he does this guy's got classic American leftist socialism disease you truly does\nA and if it was fascinating I I've I've clashed with the guy before and I hope to do so again I appreciate them having me on the show it's an awful lot of fun and I like when they get so angry that they can't argue anymore you know they just they get so flustered that they have to hang up the phone and and then you know talk about you behind your back because they can't win the argument\nOn the merits now let's go to Pittsburgh for a minute or two or three or four or five or however many you want to cover a W are\nWhat went through your head when you saw this as someone who covers this every single day and winds awards for doing so what went through your head when you first saw the news on Pittsburgh\nImmediately a like a ... as we deal with glaciers gun free and uh so it's prime target you know you get a lot of people\nGated in a place where the school workplace church where there's no armed protection and uh the God I'd have to worry about anything I think they said he was in charge for twenty minutes if I'm correct uh that that you know um [noise] that\nWas the first thing that went through my mind and I'll tell you the next thing we're just goofy horrible for the fame like but\nYou know the last talks all the time about how they get tired of the stores or get tired of this happening in six less gun violence or the or else they say I get tired of it happening too\nI get tired of law abiding Americans living their lives in areas where there's there's no there's no good guy with a gun and uh that's what has changed in my opinion that's what that's what was on my mind at the end of the day at the end of the day I look back on what Trump said which I covered\nIt in I thought he did remarkable you know he did it really did\nIt he said I Wish we had our security there and he said I also want to speed up the death penalty so that will people do these kind of think they know they're going to die and they're going to die quick\nAnd I think I think I think those are the two logical approaches to this from this point you don't ... don't set in a place where there's not a good guy with a gun don't be the good guy without a gonna go to like I\nJust make sure you're in a place for their own protection and due call your Sanders representatives let's get some laws change so that people do it to the liberty of living on death row for years and years once they're found guilty\nAnd they have their appeal that's it kill him there's no reason for taxpayers have to find some art or his life and that's what a life sentence ends up being\nAt California you're listening on a number of studies right now you're listening in Sacramento right there in your state Capitol you're listening in Southern California you listening in the bay area my gosh ... a death sentence in California is nothing but mere show just simply window dressing\nAnd you're paying for it you're paying for that and I I don't know that it even bothers people out there anymore I really truly don't but it's interesting because I can use that there's a Segway now\nTo your first piece that I wanted to talk with you about today perfect just works just amazing how we're able to do that on this program Chris Murphy mocks Trump for wanting armed security in places of worship Chris Murphy Chris Murphy is a gun hating ... lunatic left his socialist from Connecticut\nMarch Trump for wanting armed security in places of worship go ahead and take it away before we have to go to the break\nOnly that's that's it you know and they tried to be ominous he said come on man with he said he won't semi automatic ... a gunman with semi automatic rifles in every school and restaurant and go to Tom doesn't want any such thing\nYeah but he used the phrase semi automatic rifles just to be like ooh and make ... scary but guess what\nIf you had had an awkward officer in the sand that go with a semi automatic rifle\nHow grateful would we be right now because we'd have eleven people here with us that are going and who would be dead one animal that deserve to die but managed to live through it and that's why the little semi automatic trades doesn't bother me at all in my truck for warning warning on protection for innocence\nBut that's not going to be a sign will be a winning apply for Democrats so I Hope they'll keep pushing it\nI Hope they do too and we'll all kind of throw in my little exclamation point on this as we head into this break it W. R. because apparently Senator Chris Murphy\nYou know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh this is where we are society you know people use the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time but you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't get home and do the guy you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so but\nYou know I I catch myself to you know it's impossible not going to sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out of your the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say it but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at the age of you are if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know what let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just to sell it in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very oh he's a very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guys I think this is important for one reason because doesn't that go that headline alone says it all I W are that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand the evil exists evil\nChooses the time and place to become evil not us and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to\nEven identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true but you know there's there's something I'm trying to call the turn as hard as I think what I write\nI I Know what I Do I write news but I also want in my heart to educate people and and there's a corner I'm coming to terms where I can somehow\nGet people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to be closer than uh it's very simple gun control a lot of apple substitute for freedom and if you think it is that he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a cake twenty eight team but he didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth twenty Seventeen that keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute for freedom because gun control pretty suppose is that if we limit everybody's freedoms\nAnd certain crimes will go away it does not work that way what happens is we limit my ability to exercise my God given right you put me in an unnatural position\nOr had I've been a member of that congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that lesson that we can't every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying this record substitute for freedom folks there is no\nGood substitute for freedom there is not one that works and that's why a framer went out of their way to hit you in the second ...\nWell said I'm not even going to a that is the exclamation point about a perfect place to take a break you know I got to say this on another note that when it comes to\nArming oh my God we ... Trump wants to armed guards who we are guards in banks we armed guards in government buildings\nWhat the hell is the problem with defending\nWe gather that our target spy evil\nKnow the odds you is it possible to get into their head and it's hard to wrap your head around it back all their W.
