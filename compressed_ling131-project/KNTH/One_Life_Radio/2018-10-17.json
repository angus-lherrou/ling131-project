{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "Actually can happen and people that are athletes\nAnd you can see from our segment with Cassie earlier that because of all these different kind of diet trends are out there you know Quito paleo low carb this whatever people are so confused about what to eat what I find mostly in my practice and over the last Twenty years it's not that people are eating too much\nThey're nodding off of the right foods and what can happen is something called low energy availability basically the body starts to protect itself when you're not eating enough food is are so shut down systems that it doesn't need on the priority which you know the first really came out in the in the Nineteen nineties it was called the female athlete triad\nAnd old very overt things were happening to female athletes like basically they're losing their period and they were getting osteoporosis below the age of twenty wow very extreme things\nBut it was you know as athletes have gone over time especially female athletes you start to excuse at us oh just something that happens oh I don't have my period for I haven't had my last three months\nI'm an athlete that's just normal that's more of what what happens you know when you're an athlete but this is happening to women and even male athletes these days\nBecause they're not doing enough energy going into her body to run their body every day so the ... starts to shut down certain system wow I'm In order to just get you through the acute stuff you need to breathe even live every day\nYeah I went when I was a obsessed with exercise I think it truly was like an addiction\nIn my early twenties and I are also\nA couple that along with an eating disorder I was a ... I won't say it was hard core anorexic but certainly in the beginning stages of it and I lost my period for several months and and but I man I thought I was and just tremendous and I was a tremendous shape a part of that is because I was so young you know it's like Twenty one twenty two years old\nUm and uh it's just it it can impact your body and your mind to cancel it because my mind was screwed up to that is when I started to have really bad anxiety as well\nYeah listen to this so that this is from an amazing study that was done and twenty fourteen there's been locked published about it by the by the people who are really coined the term red ask but this is straight from their their study the potential effects of reds\nNot just the stuff that we think from athletes like decrease muscle strength and endurance performance about depression irritability um decrease concentration decrease coordination impaired judgment you know increase injury risk and so like I said we think of some of the sports stuff in a bubble\nRegard in regards to athletes but what I Love about the fact that the female athlete triad has been taken to the new to a new level by the international Olympic Committee\nUm is that they've expanded who can suffer from this and it's not just seem all athletes is now male athletes and it's not just athletes it's\nMen and women who are over exercising and not eating enough or because they're trying to follow the latest fad or under fueling themselves and they're starting to have like many of us do irritability Russian Blood sugar swings looting is they're they're working on the gym wondering why they're not adding muscle that keep getting injured\nSo um I spend a lot of time watching about this because it is where I think we can make the biggest impact when it comes to not only are student athletes health health about our health as adults as well\nWe'll let me ask you this why don't more coaches trainers a radio host and physical therapists 'cause I've never heard this term before either know more about reds are EDS well\nIt just really kind of came out in the in two thousand and fourteen so I think it's honestly just the lack of education that's why I really dedicated a lot of my time at feeling champions to educating like training the trainer literally because you can\nTrainers and coaches at work with athletes and our and people first hand will start to see the warning signs of this right away you're you keep coming in sort of workout you're tired you're dragging all the time you're grouchy and so trainers and people that are with people all the time you know a physical therapists working with people and physical therapy\nThere on the front lines and the the data show that less than fifty percent of them even though it red is and they vaguely remember something about the the female the trial but they ... they oftentimes can't even name what the the triad component or so it's education it's lack of continuing education\nIt's the fact that they're not trained and nutrition because this is a fundamental nutrition problem and so they don't have the skill set\nTo question it and the know how to fix it for lack of better term yeah we need a team approach\nTo address people and even in medicine we're still very segmented and very few doctors even have a dietitian in their office let alone a nutritionist well and this is twenty Eighteen people I don't I still don't understand that\nYeah and and you and I think of caffeine he or she walked away from her dietitian ... degree or a with the American dietitian association\nBecause she felt like they were giving bad advice basically and so you do have you know a lot of controversy out there when it comes to what we should be eating in order to uh just perform at our our highest level no matter what you do and what your age so you've been at this for almost Twenty years and you say there are for common behaviors\nThat are leading to energy efficiency especially in student athletes what are they and how can we correct them\nThe premise of low energy availability is you're just not eating enough food period so just generally are not enough calories and I think a lot of us especially women I'm going to call us out are really keen to this because\nSomewhere in our brain we're we're still very self conscious about getting fat or you know not looking a certain way and so we are just minimizing we think we still have that if I eat less I'm going to look a certain way some of the thing is we're not eating enough and athletes\nIs that they need and a bunch of abundance of calories do now because they're growing right or they have metabolic proxies on top of that oh and then they're training for two or three hours every day of the week so they need\nAn abundance of calories there nodding enough\nThat it's then okay what are they eating those of that they're not eating enough protein that's\nThe first place I go to not have protein spread throughout the day we talk a lot about protein and why we need it but it's basically what helps you maintain your metabolism or metabolism is in our muscle the mitochondria and our muscle and proteins job is to help with maintenance in addition of lean body math not to mention the good for hair skin immune system repairing\nMe and making our mood chemicals so we need it consistent and pick a good quality I don't care if it's plant based Randall base aren't going to get into that it's just not enough protein day in and day out ... the third thing is just\nOne and there's protein and things that you don't even realize like it like oh now\nSure yeah I mean you just have to you have to just to get into account I have a I had on my Web site on the coaches page if you want to get it that tells you how to calculate your protein needs how to calculate your caloric need\nThe third especially with student athletes as are nodding enough of the right time specifically at breakfast\nAnd specifically after school before training ... many people don't eat breakfast and okay if you're going to do intermittent fasting and its own editing issues that that's fine but we're talking about kids kids should not be fasting right are growing their training they're competing and they're doing other things like getting ready to have a period and they need to have calories to do all of that yeah they need breakfast and they need a hearty snack after\nSchool before training and many of them just roll into\nTraining with nothing or maybe just a granola bar and that's not enough yeah a lot of these kids out hunting yeah the last one is under hydration we talked a lot about this it's not directly a fuel source but\nJust a couple of weeks ago we talked about the hydration and effects on the brain it's almost immediate ... and so just drinking half your body weight announces everyday goes a long way to just energetically fueling yourself to be at your

years ... years juvenile\nArmy [laughter]\n\nAll right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host ... Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned\nWho's we'd be small handful of liberty minded people laugh because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul\n\nWhat happened to the revolution what happened\nWhat happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\n\nYou got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right\nBut that's not the case when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right let's be honest\nIt was a leftist Democrats\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism but that's\nThat's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the leftist racist because the truth\nIs we have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would like to say ignorant\nBut we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system our judicial system hangs on the voters\nIt does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\n\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right it should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what\nHappens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union is\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way\nBut it could and what happens\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative\nCandidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\n\nIs frightening how much division there is and really\n\nI understand there's a lot of people that sport big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also\nSupporting big government and why is that that's a question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think they're out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to it than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by both allegations come up\nAnd because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government needs above those individual rights and has written and has written decisions court decisions\nSaying as much we have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\n\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that does all that I mentioned in the beginning\nI think even less than three percent guys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of you think of all the bomb was badger Obama was really bad Obama was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush would make government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was that Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drained the swamp Trump is any better\nWith his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry Kavanaugh\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist\nI could sit there and have coffee and find some common ground and we could all the points that we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I made many friends that way\nBut that was then\nNot in this climate we are to the point\nReally we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the room\n\nThat is it that is that is yet of all the other subjects of all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get ... over there right to kill\nO O chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\nYeah back before the civil war we had some a handful of abolitionists\nOn the northern side that wanted to free slaves per good moral reasons and the southern states we had certain abolitionists that was a pretty slaves\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period and the story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives\nAnd a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama were ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney\nVery similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion he can you give lip service\nTo the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat\nOf all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around his\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had a pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent us from getting this candidate in order to prop up\nTheir anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we can see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years four\nYears left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ...\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression are not everywhere but he often supported aggression\nHe was very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that and a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm going to tell you this we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nThis just isn't about my friends is about everybody's Farina when the government can come in and tell you what to do and what to think and what your age and you have to choose
