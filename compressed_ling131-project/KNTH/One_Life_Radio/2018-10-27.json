great to be back with you\nI Love what we're talking about today uh it's always great to have you on the show a sleep hacks\nSimple tips to help you fall and stay asleep so I was talking with a another of one of the people here at high heart media\nIn the hallway today and a chair a war does her name and we were she was asking me what the show is about today and I told her about sleep packs with you and you know she told me something really interesting I don't know if you have you ever read anything about the connection but I Want to bring it up a so I don't forget\nShe said the only thing that's changed in her diet or in her life isn't she is on a gluten free diet now and she had a sleep disorder for over Fifteen Years and now she is sleeping like a baby every single night is there any connection\nOh totally I think it goes back into you know the last conversation we had when I was on the show we are talking about\nThe looting and stealing activities and how you can actually have a sensitivity to gluten than it can affect you in so\nMany different ways a lot of people don't make that connection between what they're eating and how they're sleeping and especially when you have a food sensitivity it can totally keep you up all night without even realizing that that would be the culprit of it that is on me wow he's fair that in the ...\nThat we see that in clients a lot where the you know don't make the connections between foods that their body might be sensitive to do we think about\nWho we think okay well I probably just like what you eat ice cream when you get a stomach ache after like we think that's the reaction has to be huge and frequently if not\nFrequently it's a migraine headaches that happens three days after you have the best sandwich with the ... you can actually take Seventy two hours you have any effect on your body so and and you know we forget we provide so it's hard to make those connections\nYeah well I I never was all the reading that I Do I never had read that and made the connection so I'm so glad that she spoke out and share that with us because I how many people are affected that which is why we're talking about how many people have sleeping disorders in this country\nOh my gosh so many in the back of the matter is that over half of adult\nStruggle with sleep issues and the average American get six hours and fifty minutes of sleep each night and most of us need a lot of us need not we're not sleeping enough and you know it's more than just feeling tired during the day you know sleep is connected to how we eat what we eat how we feel\nI think sometimes it can seem obvious that sleep plays a pretty big role in your energy level\nAnd immunity you know people will notice that the times they're sick or other times they are most rundown and aren't sleeping while but so sleep is connected to your appetite and your metabolism and your weight ... something that a lot of people don't realize that's why the weight loss for I Love talking about sleep because you know who was a free pass to sleep more in order to\nThe more weight right yeah well and and so you know we we I we touch on blue light you read about blue light some time to time but it's very critical too isn't it and how does it affect sleep ...\nInteresting that blue light up a light emitted by your TV or computer your smartphone or tablet screen around that time it disrupts your body melatonin production and that's why it interferes a leap\nSo it's really important that where you know obviously they said yes it's it's very heavy to turn it off but not always realistic so for for science we recommend that there's a lot of different ... have you on your phone and computer your TV around that I can turn on his apple actually trend of blue light on that are committing Dow and that so it doesn't interfere your sleep\nAnd much yeah yeah have you seen that one guy yeah the ...\nI have not been Stephanie the ear ... and I do and I also have a pair of blue light classes that I worry at night and so those can block blue light raises well because I Know that I'm not likely to as much as I tried to regulate and now I'm going to get on my phone I Know my husband and I are not watching the show so I put on blue glass\nOr in their cute cute crisscross are like five years ago when he was on the show at first talked about that the blue light glasses which actually yellow right there I mean but I had\n... I think they're called amber about while they're so dirty lucky\nAnd I know mine are those like half\nOn your [laughter] your\nThat you have an app on your phone or your computer you can set it so it turns out that effort in time but you know we don't really do that and they were looking at a TV screen that doesn't have that the great thing about these amber goggles as\nNot only your life really well wearing them [laughter] but they help to just you know they basically the same thing they filter out that blue light emitted from screens and he doesn't look really cool\nYeah she just showed me a pitcher Seventy I Wish you put that on Instagram that's a really good he or she looks so cute enough glasses I mean\nBut there are a vote [laughter]\nWell you know I I think about I I had a a little a little\nGirl at my house a couple of days ago and she got she was on her eye pad and I was just thinking how does this blue light affect all these children now that fine you know parents I oftentimes will allow their children to play on a smartphone or and I had a how dangerous is that for their sleep patterns\nI think it's pretty ... I think we're going to be seeing a lot of stuff coming out in the coming years because of them Neal is in New territory you know when we're younger we didn't even have that option so right we're not even really sure how it's going to affect not only their sleep at their brands and and the way that that fact dead or if it affects\nSo many parts of our life I mean we do see an increase and decreased and immune function and kids and an increase in sickness and I of course I Wonder I Wonder if that's connected to how they're\nSleeping and you know not even just like ... like like just a bit on the phone laugh like that part of it that then you look at how much sugar kids are reading these days and the you know the higher amounts of processed foods that I think there's so\nMany more um scary variables that play a role and leave and how that we're really they didn't really play a role and a lot of us for younger so it's going to be ... scary to see\nWell you know speaking of use and how many what about all the caffeine not only in the coffee that many people worldwide drink and then these these energy drinks that kids drink with all the caffeine in them teenagers especially how happy impacts sleep\nWell coffee in the afternoon can interfere with sleep and the hassle of caffeine\nIs around five or six hours but with that in the end you're relying on a cup of coffee to help you get into the afternoon the caffeine could very well still be in your system at that time and interfere at your sleep lab kind of a vicious cycle that all too common in the world today coffee interfering with\nPolice and the lack of sleep interfering with energy level right you'd have reached for hockey would interfere with your next night sleep and so on and so forth\nYeah I'm really glad you brought that up I think I think that it's really important to figure out I call it your coffee cut off I Am a time when you ... your drink any amount of coffee after that it's likely to interfere with your sleep and the best way to figure that out and try to get on a consistent sleep schedule and really\nSing [noise] [laughter]\n\nBuckle your seatbelt here's Jeff Jarvis\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nAll right and welcome welcome to another edition of the final chapter I Am your host chip Darby\nAnd is an exciting time to be alive isn't it we are watching\nCaravans march towards the border hurricanes hitting towards caravans everybody has their players in place election season is upon us and what are we going to do\nWhat are we going to do the world is watching but moreover heaven is watching\nWhat are we going to do the Democrats have become more rabid an anti God didn't ever and the Republicans have become more status than ever\nWhat\nAre we going to do we are marching towards the apocalypse and what that means guys what that means is\nWe are sitting stage so that someone will be embraced someone with an answer will be embraced\n\nWe are so divided you look at as you say All right well that's just the United states that's divided we know Matthew chapter twenty four then it talks about\n\nNation versus nation thanking them versus kingdom will king the versus keyed them is country versus country yadda yadda yadda\nBut nation versus nation is F those versus and knows ethnicity against ethnicity or race against race and it is worldwide you may not realize it's worldwide but it is\nWhite folks are being butchered in South Africa\n\nWhite folks are being blamed for everything by the Democrats and as a result we have backlash from the white nationalist movement some of which is just people who've never oppressed\nAnd they can't stand being blamed for it and some of them are just flat out racists nevertheless the tensions are swelling between people and that that is true\nAnd I am not a Donald Trump and lay that out like a good zillion times ... is a real number ... producer okay production is shaking their head they're saying ... you're screwed up a good zillion is not an actual number okay\nSo let's just say a whole lot\nWhere I'm at is this we can see economic benefits from some of Trump's policies and from him purely taking the office when\nRock Obama was elected immediately corporations started cutting full time employees to part time employees simply because Obama promised to destroy businesses in essence he did\nYou guys can suck it up I Know there's an Obama fans out there but I'll get up he promised to destroy businesses he promised that businesses record you have to pay more taxes and then we're going to have to provide\nHigher premium insurance rates to full time employees so what did Mr oh bomber do he brought the economy down simply by his pre election rhetoric and getting elected\nHe did\nAnd Trump by his pre election rhetoric and getting elected brought the economy up it's just that simple people were emotional\nWe are emotional why do you think we have the baby boom generation hey we're stepping aside for a minute I'm making a point I Am making a point I Will get back to the Obama and Trump economies but in order to understand economy\nWe know their supply and demand to you've got that whole area\nWe know that businesses need to make money in order to spend money on employees\nBut there's another side to everything there is the human side the emotional side the side that we tend to ignore why because it's not logical\nIt's not after World War two what was the generation called we sent troops to fight in a World War we sent treat troops to die in Europe\n\nWe saw millions die in World War two\nAnd yet the children of those World War two events are called what the baby boomers why are they called the baby boomers because even know there was a decline in the population worldwide because of the war\nThere's the motion of fact there's the human affect people came home people came home having seen the horrors of war people came home\nSeeing that there are a lot\nThere was something so precious to life\n\nWillie Nelson said it best in his song kids have the baby boom he talked about when their fathers came home from the war they gave their mom is so much love and that the kids were born\nKids of the baby boom and that's a fact the emotional the emotional factor is there when you're dealing with humans and so\nWhile we had a population that was decimated and I realized that decimated means taking down by a champion people use it incorrectly all the time but I think I'm fairly close in using\nThe term decimated worldwide population that was taken down such drastic measures are or such drastic numbers and yet\nWe referred to the children of that as the baby boom why because there were there was a population explosion after this massive war\nAnd that is all based on the human impact and you've got to realize that that exist that effect does exist\nIn under the ... bomber\nElection results there was the human factor people said hey\nBusiness owners said hey corporation said hey and remember corporations are run by group of people so there's the human factor\nThey said hey what if Obama does force us to pay insurance\nFor full time entry level people what if Obama does cause our insurance rates to go up and so they began slashing full timers to part timers\nPeople who saw his number I Can't remember was fifty employees report employees who said hey we're going to get below that were\nFull timers so that we don't have to pay for insurance for every employee\n[noise] Kay don't leave your ringer on guys I was expecting a phone call some interviews earlier [noise] but let's go ahead and take this real quick just in case it's them I'm Sorry to interrupt program discuss happened a little bit later but let's see [noise] hello\n\nHello

totally creepy\nWe didn't know already that our cell phones listen to us we give them all kinds of permission by the way guys that's why\nI Am a firm advocate a very firm advocate of terrestrial broadcast radio because you don't have the cyber stalker with you unless you of course bring your cell phone with you but hey anyway that being said guys were close to the end of the break we're close to the end of the days my point\nWe'll have to get do we get back but I Will let you know this I don't believe we should support a candidate just because he's a part of our party that guys will lead us\nThe humanistic agenda they support and do it you cannot\nPut your babies support the butchering of babies support the theft of your neighbors property I mean these are all things that are anti God you can't do that be a Christian so I understand voting\nFor a Democrat candidate who might be a pro life candidate or might have some Christian values\nBut you can't be a Democrat would be a Christian\nYou can't you can support some Christian ideas and be a Democrat but you can't be a Christian ... it just doesn't work so that being said now that I have talked to some people because the truth always hurt let's hit the Republicans\nAnd yeah I Know that's always rough guys don't vote strict Republican built I'm telling you right now\nGeorge pie Bush is not a conservative George Bush is not your friend\nWe were able to interview his opponent from years ago when he was first running in and of course he wouldn't give us the time of the day because he kind of hide from the media I don't know if you've noticed that he hides from the media he lives in his own shell but that's not what we're saying don't vote for him\nWere saying don't vote for him because he's not good for Texas He absolutely is not good for Texas\nNow I don't know if you know the history of the Alamo but there was a group the daughters of the Texas Republican that was formed somewhere in\nThe late Eighteen hundreds they scrounge up money and funded bunny to preserve the Alamo\nThey also funded libraries and various other institutions trying to preserve the history of Texas\nWas the daughters of the republic of Texas have spent money and time taking care of the Alamo\nThey in fact purchased the property that the Alamo was on eventually selling it back to the state of Texas with a provision and this happened in the early Nineteen hundreds\nThe provision was that they would manage the site that they would manage to site and everyone agreed on it for time\nNow there's been a lot of things that have happened here and there since and I'm not going to go with the legislature and various things but what I Will say is\nGeorge Pete Bush\nHas taken control of the animal from them has ordered the demolition and re placement of the Alamo basically he's taking and potentially moving the Alamo and re imagining if you will the Alamo site he takes his historical\nMonument he's completely tearing it down and having it moved and re imagined by someone who is not necessarily fan of Texas and\nI Would love to go to a little more about George Bush were up against the brakes what we're going to do is we're going to hit that break and we'll come back and talk a little bit more about Mr Bush\n[noise]\nNa na\nWhen I saw this I don't know that you\nKnow it takes a lot to get excited about back but
