have talked about this a march program I talked about this on my program so we'll give you that I give you the latest I got on sixteen thirty nine if ever folks that they're they're just just tuning in first time sixteen thirty nine as the\nGun control agenda that's uh that's gonna make it's gonna make Washington them more miserable place well listen everything east of Seattle you know or or north of the you know and and south of Seattle is is is is pretty nice well Tacoma I guess so the other that Sea Tac area over there has become\nThe new as a new north ... ah California so they've they've they brought up a lot of those California rules rest of Washington state's beautiful place or you know I'm visual wise and and and uh in law was that she would was\nBut as sixteen thirty nine ... if you use to puts an extremely I don't have enough time we only got five minutes left I don't have time to give you a are you know all the sixteen thirty nine would do if ah if you're just tuning in\nA in a couple of easy ones are are the you know that everybody is going to register guns or you have to put 'em all of your firearms or into the registry you have are you in this this was done through the sales there can be no more private sales what sixteen thirty one of the things fixing thirty one nine once as a um\nAnd that's how it's done is every Everytime you a gun is sold you have to go through the background check process uh and and that creates a the database there obviously raises the rates to uh to see me the age of Twenty one years old in the state of Washington to purchase any kind of firearm um\n[noise] it's it's just horrible it's horrible for gun owners in Sacramento supporters and people that believe in you know the constitution in this in this country

left habits so\nUm that's you know you're pretty much my my latest updates and a half or there is that the this is still a a crock um\nThe majority that I I saw somewhere with uh the the law enforcement and so I think it was a chief in sheriff's association or that they came out and said they didn't there against this they're against sixteen thirty nine so so they want to see that they want to see that going as well\nUm let's see what the\nUh Nike wanted to say it will make your story about a moment or two here I'm In the store yesterday with um my daughter she's a soccer player she
