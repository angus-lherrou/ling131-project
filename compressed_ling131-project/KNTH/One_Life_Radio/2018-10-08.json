I'm also going where a political hat for Second Amendment organization where I recently as you know took a position of executor\nVice president over there and it makes it a way\nYou got it on the trading inside first of all what this guy does he takes a loaded gun he's taking selfies is obviously excited to be there you see the firearms enthusiast I don't know if you own everybody thought to be happy to be there as you do you have to walk in probably doesn't realize\nThat someone I think his friend that standing there next door and has a loaded gun and left it on the counter\nOr in the ... the whole there any indoor ranging rape just down that little counter top cable\nPicks the guy that puts it against his chest points it against what's probably a bullet proof while definitely a violation of range etiquette and safety rules as he's probably been briefed on but the ... so it wasn't quite sure what's happening 'cause he's on the other side of the wall but Kelly starts paying attention to this guy takes the selfie if the guy holding the gun in front of his chest\nThen he turns the gun and points it directly into the face of his friend that's also standing in that company whole lane is traditional indoor rape instantly UCD are so come around he reaches up touches him first with his right hand with on the gun in their hand pushes it away from the guy's face painted it to the table\nTakes it all Afghan puts it on the guy's cakes they got out of the guys can pull them back from the gun if any lead a guy protest he says something course we don't have audio\nOr this guy's name is Scott it's at the top gun range and kudos to Scott that he did an amazing job of controlling the gun control the person he didn't checks began finds out exploded immediately leaves the gun on the table takes the two gentlemen and starts to escort them immediately from the range from the area of live fire\nAnd it was great from ... my training at personal events network at this guy did a job\nAnd I every instructor every hour or so every range facility and by the way every certifying agency out there\nTo ask yourself or your people and argue as individuals if you put yourself in that role prepared exactly control someone in an emergent situation like that far too many aren't\nAnd quite frankly far too many of these uh you know entities that certify instructors actually have a really hard rules they spend more time telling instructors not to\nStudents without asking permission and you know very aware of liability or anything awkward are uncomfortable with there's a\nYou know inter gender relationship kind of thing and it's a woman touching the banner of Antarctica woman there are so worried about the political correctness of it that one of my fears is that they're not reminding instructors in our associate you very well may need to go hands on\nTo protect yourself and to protect others and that's what this are so his name I only learned off the Internet his name is Scott get a great job of\nSo that first for the ... were real quick route route for listeners for your benefit ourselves range safety officer Rob go ahead please\nYeah that's absolutely so you've been there and you took this step as a as a customer a year range to intervene but you didn't have to go hands on you felt like a verbal you know hey by the way buddy that's not okay\nProbably at an earlier level or at a lower level of risk of course that's the way to go you know we don't want to touch people and we don't need to we don't want to physically control people we don't need to\nBut this are so solving need now I'll tell you been on you know I'll be on fifty sixty ranges this year probably been on I don't know if I had to guess three hundred four hundred pages around the world in my lifetime he did the right thing\nFrom the political side here's what I saw on the Internet all day long those guys should be banned those guys should be kicked off those guys especially that guy shouldn't have guns that guy should not be allowed back on that range\nI Hope he was banned I Hope that I never see him and another gun video\nAnd I have to ask myself now going to Second Amendment organization putting my political ad on is that the right message let's\nThink for me if the if the day the anti gun or is it the other side see that the vast majority of ... orders of hey guys you're going to have a gun are we undermining\nThe credibility of the argument that we shouldn't have mandatory training 'cause obviously I don't think we should have mandatory training\nDo I think we should encourage trained or I should get her faith practices gun require it in the public space of an indoor or outdoor gun right absolutely\nBut what we need to do for a guy like that he died quite frankly that should be banned overweight if he's a behavioral problem maturity problem if he has a mental ... intellectual property of understanding ... from from guns absolutely but that is strange with right that's an infringement of a Second Amendment rights\nLet me let me stop you there let me stop you there for a second I tell you why because at first I'm thinking\nYou know I can see the emotional response get those guys the hell out of there there should be banned permanently but what you're saying it was what I Want you to understand listeners wait a minute that's not the guy that needs to be bad that's the guy that has a ... he's a he's a lawful gun owner\nHe's got terrible technique and bad safety habits that's the guy that needs to be corrected that's the guy that needs to be on the range taking training that they have to be safe\nGun handling don't take him off the rage put him on the range and fix the guy's broken problems at the same time I guess what if you try to but you can't ban in the band from the race but you can't ban it from owning a gun and if you ban him get been promoted a God and he still has a God he can't go to the rage that we still handling gods like that\nI'll stop go ahead you gotta buy that you're spot\nOn you you you channeled the rest of my uh my rent because I watch the entire day people saying this guy off the rain he shouldn't have a gun I wouldn't let him in my class\nHey educators a second and then it right at the kids we need we need to grab that guy and and maybe he should be banned from gun maybe there was an intellectual or mental issue each\nDay yet to correct but it's not and I don't think honestly what I've seen I don't think so I think the guy that had no idea what he's doing it and understand the risks probably hadn't been formally trained we need to go back I catered we love the fact\nThat you like yes we love the fact that you're taking selfies yourself on the rage you're trying to spread you know response will use the fire\nAnd let us ... that was it it went on the issue Rob pig gives out and credible information real fast working people go to watch that unbelievable video\nMars walls or\nInside the ... studios with\nYeah our one in the books Mr Alan Gottlieb is amazing in his just more information than a human being should have boy boy I'll tell you what if having the opportunity

R. Hawkins for dinner on Sunday he might not know that but he just found out now because he's listening and then going to do Monday and Tuesday in tombstone and broadcast from all over the beautiful desert southwest\nLet's go to Mr AWOL Hawkins right now and I'm going to put the notes away for a second because I Love having conversations like this listen I Want you to walk with me here me you and a W. R. Hawkins are sitting down\nAt a restaurant table\nGetting ready to watch the Atlanta Braves and the Dodgers game and talk about guns and stuff with a cold beer and some chicken wing that's what you're going to hear what you come inside this conversation with a W are welcome in how you doing\nA great great they would\nPull up a chair you got to you got that theater the mind visual right\nYup\nLet's talk Kevin off for just a second I got my notes put down I got your your work put away for just a second I Want to get your overall assessment now that this man is confirmed and sworn in\nI Want to know what a W. R. Hawkins thanks from the word go from the moment\nKavanaugh was nominated to right now today hey W are tell us what give us your thoughts on this process\nProcess will surrenders and or the Democrats are shameless what Chuck Schumer spoke yesterday and he said daddy you know he said Republicans were the ones who came in with an agenda that they short cut this they vilified that they did it he was on\nThe Democrats did all those things that Democrats\nDid everything short of a salt that man and a ... fine is unbelievable what I think with those things said and I I Can't say anything good about the Democrats except\nA credit to Joe metric for voting for him I Will say that but\nUh\nWhat you've got now you have a Supreme Court justice will show that he will not waver under foresee were not whether under pressure we have a tremendous just this may be the most conservative justice on the court says Thomas and Thomas is still there or Scalia or so it's just like they have set that up for vote\nAnd check into that we now Republican Party that's fired up I mean Lindsey Graham has been better the TV for me and Lindsey Graham\nWhat he did Trump showed even away but he missed it and then suddenly it dawned on him he had missed any corrected his era and the way is ... ... people\nCats all the politically correct chains and the moment you do that but left has no power over here they have not when you cast them off you suddenly realize that these people can do to me they've just been\nForcing me to cower in my corner and as soon as he cast them all\nHe turned it made a mockery of the very people who use the crazy\nAnd so I think we as we have a justice was going to be unconditional or in his love for the second amendment and we have Republican Party it may have finally learned how to fight and if that's true and if we have those things under President Trump then Katy bar the door of here would come\nBoy I tell you a whole lot of meat in that let me let me take let me take two things that you that you mentioned that were great and all of it was and you're a student of the stuff that's why I wanted to ask you this I Know you study this you read this you watch this you\nIngest it you inhale it you breathe that I mean I Know this is who you are so that's one sort or another round of beers here in some more chicken wings make mine hot please and I'll have another cold glass hey W are you just mentioned mansion and you said God Bless them for a vote in this way let me throw something else that you and I'm going to get your comments on this\nThe hell with mansion mentioned needs to go mansions not a man mentioned couldn't stand up man she had to wait to see how Susan Collins voted before he could vote now the reason I say this is because West Virginia you're listening right now\n[noise] why couldn't man should have said that before Collins voted because magic is playing politics with this vote\nHe had to wait to get political cover so he could show it was okay with Schumer said he could get away with it because once Collins said I'm gonna go nothing could hurt mansion at that point in other words I'm telling you mansions playing you for a damn\nFool tell me if I'm wrong W. R.\nOh no you're right on that I ... and I was they suggest the other was all that but I'm just saying I Am glad he crossed over the call right\nNow in Kathy Griffin road map on Twitter which she can't quit doing uh she's just angry I think she's angry at how she looks at it wouldn't be I think she's angry at how she sounds like she's angry at our careers down and uh\nWhen chained up that you can tweet or say you was the great that that he was confirmed with bipartisan support the they'll never be able to take that away from\nThat right about you're you're right you're absolutely correct about that I had to throw some devil's advocate out there I I got to be honest with you mentioned I think West Virginia it's time for you to wash your clothes you need a conservative in there you don't need somebody that\nYou need somebody that's going to stand up and say you know what I don't vote lockstep with\nChuck Schumer you know what you need you need somebody like Murkowski on your side of the fence right\nOn our part right go Esther J yet at West Virginia have the votes for Morsi there's no doubt about it yeah\nI'm not even suggested otherwise I'm not even suggested people should think otherwise I'm just saying what ... did\nAnd I agree with your hearts that political you or did you take a position of jelly knew that that position wouldn't hurt him\nPolitically uh but but what he ended up doing is giving us the opportunity to look at you described it and he's free and say hey isn't it great that he was confirmed bachelor party\nOr you're absolutely correct you're you're correct and I wasn't insinuating that you were suggesting otherwise I just wanted to throw that out man she 'cause he's so easy to Iraq I'm going to go into him in the next hour when I'm On my own and have some fun with them\nGraham oh boy you know we talked\nLast week about gram off there and I think that Lindsey Graham is woke to use the Urban Dictionary term right I think he's woke what I Want to know from you\nIs what took so long why could you I and others in gun owners who don't own a real conservative see this ten years ago and he couldn't or others couldn't or McConnell couldn't or other Republicans why and you've got about a minute\nI don't know I have thought on this as part of me thinks that I'm just this is only my opinion\nPart of me thinks that the influence of McCain work that great on him because he and McCain were that close that really are that's really all I can come up with me number I but I'm going to tell you what it don't matter what it was I loved that Lindsey Graham I'm seeing right now and I made it uh the guy is awesome\nAnd he you know I Love when he ran for ... when he ran for president under like Darwin but I Love when he said we need the bomb these bleeps I Can't use the word I don't think our regular radio here we're talking about how bad we needed the bomb uh I just send the other people and what he was going to do to them there's always been a fireball\nHe's just been too moderate in true true held back and now that he's let go everything woke as you say I Love the guy just love it\nI I agree with the last twenty seconds for the breakout of up I guess I'll just kind of put a period on that and say that I Believe that Lindsey Graham\nAlways believed or wanted to see the best in the other side and I think it took this and McCain death I I think you're right about that to wake him up to say you know what these people over there and not my friends they're not my friends if they would do that to justice Kavanaugh they would do that to me and I think\nThat just 'cause I I literally it it's so comfortable back there I don't think about\nMy gun being on them and that's the only way I could tell you because when you [noise] for me I just don't like it inside the way Spain Carey hosts or a a unless it's extremely small or whatever Italy but then when you realized is what the cross free\nTo sue protect does everything has a purpose it's not it's not wider than a normal host or because they're sloppy it's lot taller than another host or because they're sloppy or didn't plan it out\nIt dissipates the presidents and later that gun and when you put that super attack on you will forget you're carrying a gun and uh you know I don't mean that reckless fashion obviously that's the kind of country we're talking about I found that St comfort with the snap slot\nYou know yeah and the outside the waste man it's it's really true I got to take this reminder\nTo tell the story about this about mark I have

manufacturers and the number of great super high quality holster they just were not working for me\nAnd he heard me swear off on that and you heard me say I was lucky I Lived in Georgia and outside
