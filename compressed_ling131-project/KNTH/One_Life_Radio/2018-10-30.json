typical oregano like a tally in Oregon our spicy or I can I was like a thin yeah but this Greek oregano is actually kind of meaty almost like a yeah almost like a secular\nYeah well I was thinking when I was eating it this is what a rabbit feels like it [laughter]\nIt's like you said you really have never done this before\nIt was really was I Wish I could get every give everybody\nA a a leaf of Iraq you know it's amazing I I'm going to be taking your home and using every little piece of it believe me but so good to have you in Studio always you know\nLast week when you were here we were talking about what's really in your milk and Jerry and we just really didn't get to really get out what we wanted to so we're continuing that talk and so let's talk about milk let's start with that what are some of the things that are found in everyday milk products that I wouldn't even say even organic milk if not safe from\nThe snow it's not I mean a lot of milk is going to have um any up a whole range of stuff to\nUs being one of the number one things a lot of cows get infections from being over milked so there's a high amount of ... cells inside of the milk and um it is regulated but only to the extent that it prevents bacterial growth not to actually protect people from consuming\nAnd then of course you're going to have growth hormones are going to have antibiotics you're going to have pesticides from the feed that they're eating I mean the list really just goes on and on\nAnd it's not really something that humans obviously are meant to consume we're humans we're not cows\nAnd with that you know ... even the enzymes\nThat we need to digest the lactose they are primarily only present in the human body until age for so you're not really supposed to be drinking milk past the age of of being a baby rhino you eat regular food well what Dr\nJohn McDougal a writes this there was only one thing dairy products have more than any other food I can think of contamination yeah how about the contamination of cow's milk and now they've even got Campbell milks they're going to be abusing animals it's just it's not it's not the\nAnimal it's it's the method now if you own a small family farm and you have your own cows that you rotate and they have babies and you go out there and you drink a glass or raw milk every now and then I bet there are some benefits to it but that is an incredibly different thing than the industrialization of dairy industry\nYeah we're so far removed from it I'm reading another book that's coming up this week uh meat hooked\nAnd I was talking about the the beginning of it's fascinating science by the way especially for anybody that has an interest in biology\nI just started reading it over the weekend and it was absolutely fascinating and you know are are where we are where our society that is a hook to meat and dairy dairy also has an addiction doesn't it because of the uh hormones that\nIt has an addiction because there are a lot of interest in it that um are actually there are like drugs that cause your body to lump them opiates and stuff like that pain relievers that the cows but get passed on through the milk so they're actually creating a psychological addiction for your body of all as a chemical addiction\nWell and they say that uh you know in this book that I was reading a Joseph can whitewash I'm about calcium a cow's milk and it's the hidden the his an excuse me the the real cause of osteoporosis is the overconsumption\nOther than that I Know isn't what you really which is funny because they tell you to drink milk you know to to be sure you get your calcium about silicon where they don't talk about is the facts\nThe calcium that's in an animal based protein is not very highly absorb a wall\nAnd aside from that the amount that your body can actually absorb at one time is limited so the excess calcium that isn't that isn't dairy your body's not even getting at all 'cause your body can't process that much at one time yeah\nYou'd be better off getting your calcium from things like dark leafy greens that are more where the Cal seems more ... easy for your body to digest\nMhm I'm reading here this is another doctor a PHD AT T colon Campbell who wrote the China study Gary has been considered a health\nFood and that is an unfortunate mess [laughter]\nYeah yeah it's much more than that I mean quite honestly it's a bit of a lie yeah it is it'd\nBe telling people who are trusting you know trusting organization to look out for their health and look out for their needs for them and they're being led astray to believe that something that is incredibly unhealthy for you it's actually healthy for you I mean that's not really that's not really giving people a fair shake\nYeah and when I find interesting is the pediatricians that our milk pusher so my goodness\nYou wouldn't even want to be around me and the pediatrician\nI mean I Would like to hear what what do you say to them and they're so timid dating I can remember going which I don't go I don't take my children for their well one of us too old but you know for their well baby where they could they push them they push everything on you that's not really healthy for your baby and that includes milk\nIt does yes it includes milk and especially you know growing up ... having cats like idea where they're primarily began are plant based children you know there's a lot there's a lot of stuff that are a lot of\nMisinformation out there and when you try to tell a traditional pediatrician that you're raising a child on a began or plant based diet there's a lot of concern for the child's wellbeing and I've just found that it's best\nI Do have a health care practitioners that I go to but they're primarily holistic Chinese medicine right people that don't necessarily specializing kids that rather specialize in the human body overall\n... well it in this book talks about over ... overweight and obese a and the American population is seriously overweight and our children are no exception today one in three children and teens is overweight or obese 'em and they're talking about the connection with milk and you know okay so um\nThe fat free milk skim milk so high in sugar if you're right if you're gonna see the baby now you should at least feed them the whole milk where at least they're getting some good and healthy fats right well I mean yeah the idea of going either direction\nEither one is going to have a big negative to it I Would say the biggest negative and the thing that I like to preach to people when I talk to them about milk or cheese\nIs that it's not you can you can break it down and find all these bad things that ... does that the whole but honestly the worst thing that it does overall is create systemic inflammation in your body and all of those little things that we talk about the different chemical additives that\nCombination of the fat the high sugars\nAnd the difficulty in your body breaking it down none of that is really the point the point is the overall systemic inflammation that your body experiences by constantly being bombarded by the toxins that are milk\nAnd it makes your body susceptible to a whole host of other health elements such as obesity and mental disease and ... and chronic digestive upset and on and on\nIt's like if your body is constantly on red alert from consuming dairy products\nAnd then it doesn't have time to tend to the other necessary um body bodily functions mhm\nSo even something as simple as allergies whenever I talk to people about\nAnd nutrition and they're you know their first complaint is allergies I'm like you need to stop all dairy products right now stay off of them for three weeks you know even the people that are like oh I Can't live without cheese three weeks everyone anyone can do anything for three weeks now\nAnd see how you feel at the end of the three weeks and it's like the majority of allergy sufferers particularly the people that need to allergy injections are regularly taking his ear attack or some sort of other\nThan a drill type thing they find that they're allergy symptoms almost immediately go away whenever they stopped consuming Gary ... is just because you're lowering your body and the red alert you're lowering histamine you're lowering the information and and they ... the human body is amazing I managed to that because I sneeze all day yesterday\n\n[noise] the\nSafe [noise] [laughter]\n\n\nBuckle your seatbelt hears from\nDARPA [noise]\n\n\nAll right and welcome welcome to another edition of the final chapter I Am your host ...\nDarby and it's an exciting time to be alive isn't it we are watching\nCaravans march towards the border hurricanes hitting towards caravans everybody has their players in place election season is upon us\nAnd what are we going to do what are we going to do the world is watching but moreover heaven is watching what are we going to do the\nDemocrats have become more rabid an anti God didn't ever and the Republicans have become more status than ever\nWhat\nAre we going to do we are marching towards the apocalypse and what that means guys what that means is\nWe are sitting stage so that someone will be embraced someone with an answer will be embraced\n\nWe are so divided you look at as you say All right well that's just the United states that divided we know Matthew chapter twenty four then it talks about\nNation versus nation thanking them versus kingdom will Keenan versus keep them is country versus country\nYadda yadda yadda but nation versus nation is F knows versus those ethnicity against ethnicity or race against race ended his worldwide you may not realize it's worldwide but it is\nWhite folks are being butchered in South Africa\n\nWhite folks are being blamed for everything\nBy the Democrats and as a result we have backlash from the white nationalist movement some of which is just people who've never oppressed\nAnd they can't stand being blamed for it and some of them are just flat out racists nevertheless the tensions are swelling between people and that that is true\nAnd I am not a Donald Trump and I've lived that out like a good ... times ... is a real number isn't producer\nOkay production is shaking their head they're saying ... you're screwed up a good billion is not an actual number okay\nSo let's just say a whole lot\nWhere I'm at is this\nWe can see economic benefits from some of Trump's policies and from him purely taking the office\nWhen rock Obama was elected immediately corporations started cutting fulltime employees to part time employees simply because Obama promised to destroy businesses in essence he did\nYou guys can suck it up I Know there's some Obama fans out there but I'll get up he promised to destroy businesses he promised that businesses record you have to pay more taxes and then we're going to have to provide\nHigher premium insurance rates to full time employees so what did Mr oh bomber do he brought the economy down simply by his pre election rhetoric and getting elected\nHe did\nIn Trump by his pre election rhetoric and getting elected brought the economy up it's just that simple people were emotional\nWe are emotional why do you think we have the baby boom generation hey we're stepping aside for a minute I'm making a point I Am making a point I Will get back to the Obama and Trump economies but in order to understand economy\nWe know their supply and demand you got that whole area\nWe know that businesses need to make money in order to spend money on employees\nBut there's another side to everything there is the human side the emotional side the side that we tend to ignore why because it's not logical and it's not\nAfter World War two what was the generation called we sent troops to fight in a World War we sent treat troops to die in Europe\n\nWe saw millions die in World War two\nAnd yet the children of those World War two that are called what the baby boomers why are they called the baby boomers because even though there was a decline in the population worldwide because of the war\nThere's the motion of fact there's the human affect people came home people came home having seen the horrors of war people came home\nSeeing that there are a lot\nThere was something so precious to life\n\nWillie Nelson said it best in his song kids have the baby boom he talked about when their fathers came home from the war they gave their mom and so much love and that the kids were born\nKids of the baby boom and that's a packed the emotional the emotional\nFactor is there when you're dealing with humans\nAnd so while we had a population that was decimated and I realized that decimated means taking down by a tent and people use it incorrectly all the time but I think I'm fairly close in using the term decimated worldwide population that was taken down\nSuch drastic measures are or such drastic numbers and yet\nWe refer to the children of that as the baby boom why because there were there was a population explosion after this massive poor and that's all based on the human impact and you've got to realize that that exist that effect does exist\nIn under the old bomber\n\nElection results there was the human factor people said hey business\nOwners said hey corporation said hey and remember corporations are run by group of people so there's the human factor\nThey said hey what if Obama does force us to pay insurance\nFor full time entry level people what if Obama does cause our insurance rates to go up and so they began slashing full timers to part timers\nPeople who saw his number I Can't remember who was fifty employees report employees isn't hey we're going to get below that with full timers so that we don't have to pay for insurance for every employee\n[noise] Kay don't leave your regular on guys I was expecting a phone interview earlier [noise] but let's go ahead and take this real quick just in case it to them I'm Sorry to interrupt program discuss happened a little bit later but let's see\n[noise] hello\nHello [noise] your college very important to us than the line and you'll be transferred to the next ...\nDon't we love peace robocalls\nHello thank you for taking my call because Renee would insurance or Iraq arguing for that in a free health insurance quote\nI Am absolutely interested and excited about your phone calls her just to let you know you're being recorded go ahead so\nOkay that would be like totally creepy if we didn't know already that our cell phones listen to us we give them all kinds of permission by the way guys that's why\nI Am a firm advocate a very firm advocate of terrestrial broadcast radio because you don't have the cyber stalker with you unless you of course bring your cell phone with you but hey anyway that being said guys were close to the end of the break we're close to the end of days my point\nWe'll have to get do we get back but I Will let you know this\nI don't believe we should support a candidate just because he's a part of our party that guys will lead us\nOh you know vote straight Democrat because of the bombastic nature of Trump the offensive bombastic nature are going to vote straight Democrat\nNow I have the feeling because primarily among either a conservative stations are Christian stations and typically Christians can't be Democrats\nOh oh did I say that your idea that you can't guys you can vote for a Democrat candidate who has Christian values which are far and few between but you can't be a Democrat because you cannot support\nThe humanistic agenda they support and do it you cannot put your babies support the butchering the baby's support the theft of your neighbors property I mean these are all things that are anti God you can't do that and be a Christian so I\nUnderstand voting for a democratic candidate who might be a pro life candidate or might have some Christian values but you can't be a Democrat would be a Christian\nYou can't you can support some Christian ideas it'd be a Democrat but you can't be a Christian ... it just doesn't work so that being said now that I have talked to some people because the truth always hurt let's hit the Republicans\nAnd yeah I Know that's always rough guys don't vote strip Republicans don't\nI'm telling you right now\nGeorge pie Bush is not a conservative George Bush is not your friend\nWe were able to interview his opponent from years ago when he was first running and of course he wouldn't give us a times a day because you can't hide from the media I don't know if you've noticed that he hides from the media he lives in his own shell but that's not what we're saying don't vote for him\nWere saying don't vote for him because he's not good for Texas He absolutely is not good for Texas\nNow I don't know if you know the history of the Alamo but there was a group the daughters of the Texas Republic that was formed somewhere in the late Eighteen hundreds\nThey scrounge up money and funded money to preserve the Alamo\nThey also funded libraries and various other institutions trying to preserve the history of Texas\nWas the daughters of the republic of Texas have spent money and time taking care of the Alamo\nThey in fact purchased the property that the Alamo was on eventually selling it back to the state of Texas with a provision and this happened in the early Nineteen hundreds\nThe provision was that they would manage the site that they would manage to site and everyone agreed on it for ... you know there's been a lot of things that have happened here and there since and I'm not going to go with the legislature and various things but what I Will say is\nGeorge ... Bush\nHas taken control of the animal from them has ordered the demolition and re placement of the Alamo basically he's taking and potentially moving the Alamo and re imagining if you will of the Alamo site he takes his historical monument\nHe's completely tearing it down and having it moved and re imagined by someone who is\nNot necessarily fan of Texas and I would love to go to a little more about George\nBush were up against the brakes what we're going to do is we're going to hit that break\nAnd we'll come back and talk a little bit more about Mr Bush\n[noise]\nNa na\nMan I don't know that you can go\nTo Chris fall morning time for your daily pumpkin ...\nAs you wait for your coffee you could apply now it's not your boss wanting extra with cream but you're eighty video doorbell\nPackage your new ... machine no more five dollar P.
