date you want to go with the students and it's and it's a date it's I think we're going to we're going on now\nWhere we're go we're going to both of them back to back I think we're going to the a gluten free allergen friendly ex well first it's on the October twenty seven twenty eight so Saturday and Sunday at Dallas market hall and then ... park is the\nVeggie fair which is always really fun and you can drink beer there too so\nIt'll knock you out of [laughter] workout\nAfter right there you go well and I was thinking of working out squash and dad less you know what's the real difference between the two I don't think most people now\nIt's basically just where the load is coming from right like Elizabeth and I were talking about this right before we came on it the second you been in the hips and the knees I call that a squat\nDoesn't matter I mean what did I come back into band\nBoth the hips and the need to ... ... if you'd have to do what people call straight legged dead lifts yeah we have knees locked or dislike never ... that's what she said to do\nIt all depends on what the goal is and what the forces and how much the extension your knees have so they are kind of hyper mobile and kind of go behind the line\nThen it's not a good thing if you want to just isolate the gluten you do in light loads then you can completely lock up in these ... I Would say it is a higher risk thing if you are doing heavier load to walk out the news\nBut it's not a must same thing if you're doing lake pressing you lock out at the end your legs just aren't loaded anymore but they can sustain that yeah as long as you're on the ... yeah\nAnd when I Would say there's a problem with a locking out your knees ago I'm an amateur over here so but I have done a lot of dead less an squads in my time uh they're one of my favorite exercises I feel and especially if you do the multiple action with you when you go down to a squat with like a slap with like a kennel balance each arm I was actually um this is what I was doing I'll show you\nKnow the kettle does that she broke her too with [laughter] okay\nSo she's got two she got ... on each side Scott I'm holding in my hands and she's coming up and then she doesn't ruin down so she goes down like\nWhoa I got a new movie the last lynching it up I like that and it's so it works out every part of your body yeah it really does have at least it feels like it does does it for the most part you\nYeah and you can get back straight and your shoulders you know I'm strong and all that but when I was going to say if you're doing a dad laughed okay and you lock out your um like out your knees then you're never fully really engaging your clients and your\nAnd your hamstrings and and your and your eyes glued to the gluttonous maximus on that rations yes because you got to get them strong in order to do good quality squats in debt less rice oh I don't know I don't think\nSo if you walk out the top if you're doing like ... like that okay you when you lock out to force does go through the structure which is lower body limbs\nAnd it's no longer loading the glue squadron hamstrings but you can actually still contract all those and work on the ice and metric contraction at the top\nAnd get better neurological control especially if you're doing just you know twenty pound dumbbells or cattle bells on each side yeah that's perfect fine now if you want to keep a constant load on those muscles then yes don't lock out but it's it's\nI never liked white black and white answers as saying like always do this always you act like what's the goal what are we trying to do\nThen what are the risk factors\nWhen you lock out your knees and do you have a higher risk of hurting your back no no no okay and you're shaking your head no you guys are in agreement that round I agree\nPartly and I'm Still I'm slightly bending the nail on the dead last ... hurt or your knee your knee um even like when you're doing a leg press and you lock your knees out all that weight let's say\n... well when I used to do the lead press like hardcore I'd go to like five five forty five on each side\nLike wow a lot that that's how I Lived for my little ... yeah you know so for me locking out in ... in an exercise like that is just too much yeah body now depending on what you can do in your body everyone's different ... um I think that we're agreeing with you Daniel\nYeah and I tell you like yeah keeping these billions basically the safer way to do it like you're not sure don't walk 'em out front or when you guys worked out together what did you do did you do squats together no we did that machine the power out of them and so we did the training and in boxing and I mean\nWhere I live right I mean sorry each other [laughter]\nThat'll ... that'll be then I Know we did not I doubt and I don't want to spark or I feel like she picked me she could say she's totally take an attitude\n[laughter]\nMaybe you should\nBe [noise] it as the\nSafe fees [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] you\nSure is\nBuckle years ... years Jim\nJarvis [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nOh right point ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host ... Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned who's concerned I'm concerned because we\nBe small handful of liberty minded people laugh because there's only a tiny fist full anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul\nWhat happened to the revolution what happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\n\nYou got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch\nTypically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right but that's not the\nCase when they refer to white nationalist\nThey referred to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats who are responsible for so much racist violence\nEven today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\n\nI don't use the term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism\n[noise] but that's that's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system\nOur judicial system hangs on the voters\nIt does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right\nIt should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury\nWhen they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now such a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat union guy accused of something and you've got nothing but anti union is\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way\nBut it could and what happens\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta on the jury\nIs frightening how much division there is and really [noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that support big government unfortunately it's most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also supporting big government and why is that\nThat's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think this out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction from the majority of the left and a minority\nIn the right how ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans the knee jerk\nReaction of the Republicans false allegations come find false allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\n\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man who puts the government needs above those of the individual rights and has\nWritten and has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty\nHe does not respect the rights of an individual\n\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that is full damage in the beginning\nI think even less than three percent guys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of you think of all bombers badger Obama was really bad Obama was big government and then there are those who you're going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush was big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was bad Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drained the swamp Trump is any\nBetter with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry Kevin all you really think he's better guys were being divided\nWhat is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist\nI can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we could on the points\nThat we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I've made many friends that\nWay but that was then not in this climate\nWe are to the point really we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our ability to butcher a baby in the womb\n\nThat is it that is that is yet of all the other subjects of all the other issues that is the one they will die on that hill they will fight that battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O but chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period in the story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives\nAnd a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different now maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney very similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion\nHe can you give lip service to the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\n\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around this\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but\nThey rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had\nA pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent\nUs from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty\nSupported abortion so that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years\nFour years left of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth that if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive\nWith terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there or you ...\n\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression are not everywhere but he often supported aggression\nHe was very divisive and so we had that\nAnd a lot of aggressive people felt empowered\nBy that and a lot of people supported him purely because he was black and went to just do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm going to tell you this when we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nOn more ... term and green and
