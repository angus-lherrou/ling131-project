faces echo an atoll from his was\nUntil one has loved an animal a positive one so remains on awakened\nThis isn't good and you can talk with Peter reminding us that it's easy to be kind to have by choosing photo fleece\n\n\n\nOn live radio is Bernadette\nGray Lexie Brinkley out anti that in shows and Stephanie tubes Seventy two is that consumer advocate professional particularly focused on safety and food and personal care products she became fascinated with the industry when she was\nDiagnosed with a thyroid auto immune disorder while pregnant with her second child she has always been fascinated with education and holds both an undergraduate and master's degree in accounting and finance from Texas\nAnd I'm university and she is a certified public accounting and is owned and operated numerous businesses and the Dallas area she's also a fantastic photographer as well\nThe best years I've ever gotten in my life had taken of myself and groups of people for a couple of a magazine covers that we did a Stephanie was the photographer she's amazing you can find her where or find what's this website you can follow me on Instagram\nTipsy turvy or I Do have an actual blog it to the trivia dot\nCom okay good what's this urban survival site dot com is that a reference to oh I think those were some that some of the reference materials for our study out today so young you you told me or you told us how you became involved in ... so uh what are some reasons that you might be interested in prepping outside of doomsday scenario\nYes okay so I think one of the things that makes people go ... you know they think well this is doomsday that this far fetched you know this is not something I Need to think about but\nThey're really a lot of reasons and we experienced them a lot and I talked about a few of them but you know things like natural disasters you know we've had some really serious hurricanes here you know in in the U.S locally Houston was hit really hard last year a hearty yeah obviously Katrina you know a while back but\nA ... you know when you're experiencing a natural disaster like that it's the same kind of thing you kind of look kind of look around and you go what ... what do I do that and so\nHaving a plan being prepared ahead of time thinking about ... you know having documents in place or food or whatever whatever whatever part of your plan related to this preparedness but natural disasters is a is a great uh what kind of car do you drive\n'em I drive a mini van but I also have a I go vehicle okay\nYou know that one of the reasons I bought my Subaru because it's got the ... thing and it's a it's all we'll all wheel drive\nIf I needed to get out of us yeah tuition I could get that and couldn't can't do that in a Porsche no no\nNo yep so I haven't you do is just like you have a a go back I have a go vehicle and it is loaded with everything that uh I Would need\nA new job and your driveway that I Love that yup yup\nSo when did you become this crazy person what year was that well so that was probably twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen is when we really started to get serious about it and one of the things that I think is often that you can do and I think sometimes it can be overwhelming but you can start really small so we started with that Christmas we ... we\nMade a list of things that we wanted and that's what we asked for for Christmas\nSo we started asking for like water bladder bags or\nUm there are some pre like there's some pre made kits like forty eight hours survival kits that you can buy online there's a number of survival site online that you know what's in one of those cats so there would be like patches of water water is obviously like a huge thing yeah one of\nThe first things you want to do is turn you know I'm Still your backup if there's ever an issue so you about that though you're saying plug them up and sell them with water because water is you know life is precious effort\nThere to do that without it sure did without it faster than eating 'em\nThere's usually patches of water those usually have kind of like al Marri type of food\nUm so it's you know either you're dehydrated or it's just kind of open and it's definitely not something that you're going to want to eat on a daily basis but when it comes down to survive in for forty eight hours or if you've got a baby or\nThat was one of the things that really I had babies at that time and that was what was scary for me if what if I couldn't feed them what if I didn't have diapers what if I couldn't be out of them are paid them or keep them clean and\nThere are so many things that you're dealing with when you have a baby that are different than what you're dealing with so that's another thing I encourage people to do is think about\nYou know medications as a writer think think of you know think about what you need to get through every day and then back that up hopefully it's not medications right ... right right right I mean some people are some people are diabetic or some people have what are you know whatever it is but some people you know obviously have things\nThat I Would have my nasal my sailing right in there um and a hydrogen peroxide rubbing alcohol yeah of course water we've already talked about that what are some other things that are important to have um I\nI Love having some like some ... we have some solar powered things that are like some uh like a charging kid that could do things\nLike just simply those you know they're real small when they fold all up just a little like there was a little silver with solar blanket oh yeah yeah yeah you put it around your body and and it gets heat from the sun and get to keep you\nVery yes yes we also have an aluminum which I'm can drop the drop the temperature by twenty degrees so if we were in the hot sun and we got stuck and we were ... or whatever\nUm we could use that but you know also another thing is getting stranded in your car you know and it and that's depending upon where you live right if you have up north and you know I grew up up north\nYou get stranded in your car when you already below you got to ... them yeah and so like you have to be thoughtful about your surroundings what's your climate like where you know where do you live what specific to you yeah and so we always had a flashlight we had flares we had\nSocks you know extra things like that we've gotten wind offerings I've lived here and I have to I mean I've turned into a week like I have to be able to tell you know I mean do any dollar speaking a foreign language [laughter]\nI Would have these ... and you can I mean you look off the road so way up north and she's going to have that may be and what two and a half months two months and then after ... yeah you get right on mama bear come on down there comes out and you will turn into somewhat of a weirdo yeah\nAnd then you own it you will probably rather be prepared and looked like a whack when I feel\nNot prepared like yeah I yeah I absolutely so masses are really good one I mean and this is one of those things that it's really funny or like how do people used to get around well they used to have maps and we all know has it matches or good ladder yeah drawing the line I or whatever there yet [laughter]\nThrow out in there but I think if you're trying to go somewhere and you don't have your phone to tell you how to get there you need an atlas\nYou know or you need a task roadmap something like that atlas maps so we had met we have maps and we have our location mapped out we gave 'em to all of our family a couple of years ago so if if anything ever goes bad they know where we're going to be often are you adding to your proper bag\nSo that's a really interesting question especially when it comes to food storage and so one of the rotate proper ways yeah in a shared rationale is you want to use foods that you generally eat and then what my mom always dead and she would have like so we had a ... like a pantry in our basement and she did have probably\nLike a year's worth of food but what she would do if she would take food out of that food storage and that's what we would eat\nAnd then when she would buy groceries she would ... them it's kind of like your own personal um you know pantry or grocery store and that way she knew that it was being replenished have press you'll laugh the last time we covered this like the first time was like a year ago yeah I think like\nThat the first time I went to Costco and I got a bunch of water and put it in my in my safe room and then I got nuts I'm like well it's a good healthy thing that I can eat that's got bad you know it'll just keep me say she ate it and it's small stories but it'll stay fresh\nSo I had like a like I don't know like a hundred bags and nuts and when you have a party when you die or that out yeah\n[laughter] yeah you're nuts yeah you're not um gasoline [noise]\nOh that's a good question I mean you can do propane tanks but yeah fuels difficult because fuel I mean obviously is unstable so you have to have their rights do you have to be set up appropriately in order to store that\nI mean we saw last year I think it was with a Rita people worry that gas shortage last year here in Dallas the more they were like filling up buckets and ... you know what that is a problem like it no there wasn't but I think well everyone panics everybody\nPanic word again Alexi and I were together I remember that I could I I didn't even know it was happening in Lexington and got me and brought me to the show um I was out of gas and I was on land in I was at Lehman in oak lawn in any way the brutality of the people that came out ... hours\nPeople got get violent or well that is what you will learn it I had her you know all all boys yeah make it through the day [laughter]\nAnd that's how I can tell [laughter]\nTotally forgot about that we have fun with that yeah it was [laughter] but um yeah so what about ... keep an eye little whiskey in case you really like\nTo rent a fan of that because ultimately I mean never go back to doomsday scenario but yeah but if there's ever an area where I mean where money and paper money isn't really a currency yeah then I think things like coffee\nUm tobacco cigarettes I mean things that the grass and when people are really going to want to ask you how long haul bigger yes\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] I'm sure is\nBuckle years ... years Jews and\nDarby [laughter] [laughter]\n\nOh right ladies and gentlemen welcome to another edition of the final chapter of your host chip Darby are right here guys we are\nAbsolutely concerned\nWho's concerned I'm concerned who's we be small handful of liberty minded people left because there's only a tiny fissile anymore\nWhat happened to the liberty movement what happened to the people who loved Ron Paul\nWhat happened to the revolution what happened what happened guys\nWe have fallen victim to I don't want to use the term race baiting but we've fallen victim to an idea I thought that everything should be black versus right\nYou got that Freudian slip by versus right or was it\nYou see guys we watch typically from the liberal side of things it is black versus right but that's not the\nCase when they refer to white nationalist they refer to them as the alt right\nLet's be honest it was a leftist Democrats\nWho are responsible for so much racist violence even today we see a lot of leftist policies that that\n\nI don't use a term proliferate but they helped facilitate racism\nBut that's that's not where I'm going with this I'm not I'm not on a journey just saying hey the left as racist because the truth is\nWe have become stupid when it comes to voting I Would love to say ignorant but we're breaking stupid when it comes to voting our public is and the scariest part is that every bit of our justice system\nOur judicial system hangs on the voters\nIt does our jury pools are\nGathered from our voter rolls\nThink about that if you think someone is too dumb to vote which many are if you think some people shouldn't vote\n\nHow do you feel about them on a jury how can we find justice and this goes both ways I don't care if you're black or white left or right it should go both ways how can you trust a person sitting on that jury when they're pulled\nFrom such a climate as we are in right now so it's a divisive\nHateful climate what happens\nIf you're a union guy a good old Democrat and union guy\nAccused of something and you've got nothing but anti union us\nPolitical activist Republicans on that jury that's not going to happen exactly that way but it could and what happens\nIf you are a good solid hardworking conservative candidate and you've got nothing but liberals with a vendetta or the jury\nIs frightening how much division there is and really\n[noise]\nI understand there's a lot of people that sport big government\nUnfortunately is most of the voting bloc yes you Republicans also\nSupporting big government and why is that that's the question I'm trying to figure out the answer to that is the point I'm going to kind of think that out on air right here with you guys try and understand why would we support big government\nBecause ultimately we the people could unite\nIf they didn't divide us if we stopped with our emotional knee jerk reactions and typically I'll be honest typically I expected an emotional knee jerk reaction\nFrom the majority of the left and a minority in the right\nHow ever\nIf anything about the Kavanaugh circus can tell you any I mean if there's anything that the Kevin a circus speaks volumes to its than knee jerk reaction of the Republicans\nThe knee jerk reaction of the Republicans false allegations come up by false allegations come up and because of the false allegations we blindly support a big government man\nWe blindly support a status we blindly support a man\nWho puts the government's needs above those of the individual rights and has written\nAnd has written decisions court decisions saying as much\nWe have documented proof that this man does not respect individual liberty that he does not respect the rights of an individual\n\nAnd the liberty people are behind them except for that does all that I mentioned in the beginning\nI think even less than three percent guys helped me understand this\nNow I Know a lot of people think it will bomb ... Obama was really bad Obama was big government and then there are those are you going ... Bush was bad Bush was really bad Bush with big government and you know what I agree with both of you\nObama was banned Bush was bad\nBut do you really think Trump you really think drain the swamp Trump is any better with his appointments like Jeff Sessions Rick Perry\nAnd Kevin all\nDo you really think he's better guys were being divided what is sick sick and sad is I could have coffee\nWith someone whose views would be typically leftist\nI can sit there have coffee and find some common ground and we good on the points\nThat we disagree disagree and even in some cases have a civil discourse over the areas in which we disagree I made many friends that way but that was then\nNot in this climate we are to the point\nReally we're to the point where all the left cares about is killing babies it doesn't matter anything else we must preserve our\nAbility to butcher a baby in the womb\nThat\nIs it that is that is yet\nOf all the other subjects have all the other issues that is the one\nThey will die on that hill they will fight the battle to the end\nAnd that is pretty sick\nAnd they will get violent over their right to kill think about that they get violent over their right to kill\nO O but chip here's where it gets good\nAll\nRepublicans care about is winning and they don't care who's rights they trample on they don't care they want to retain power they want to get power we are living\n[noise] we're living in Eighteen sixty that's where we're living\nWe have two parties that oppose liberty\nYeah back before the civil war we had some handful of abolitionists\nOn the northern side that wanted to free slaves for good moral reasons in the southern states we had certain abolitionists that was pretty slaves for good reasons\n\nYou supported this and he supported butchering babies period and the story\nRock Obama had no Christian values zero Christian values and so the conservatives and a lot of people so fed up with eight years of Obama\nWere ready to latch on to something that was vastly different or at least something they perceived to be vastly different\nNow maybe if you remember that Ron Paul ran for office and I'm throwing this out there because when Ron Paul ran for office we had something that was vastly similar\nTo Obama running on the Republican side and that was Mitt Romney\nVery similar Mitt Romney used state funds to fund abortion he can he gave lip service to the anti abortion crowd to be pro life crowd but in actuality\nIs\nState version of Obamacare Romneycare stole people's money it use the government to take people's money used law enforcement to steal people's money\nOr at least the threat of all I'm fortunate to steal people's money and fund the murder of babies and Republicans rallied around this\nThey claimed they didn't like Obama but they rallied around what Obama supported\n\nSo they were ready to take a white Republican Obama but they weren't ready to take a black Democrat Obama now I Know there's more to Obama's policies more to his fiscal policies and things like that nevertheless\nWe had a pro life candidate a pro liberty candidate and the Republicans cheated changed their rules in Orlando\nChanged their delegate rules and cheated to prevent us from getting this candidate in order to prop up their anti Christian pro abortion anti liberty pro universal healthcare candidate Mitt Romney\nI brought up Obama so that we could see the comparison Republicans denied liberty supported abortion\nSo that they could remain in power and it failed and so for years four years\nLeft of Obama and Obama was divisive and I don't care what you say I Know this program goes out to a variety of people and I'm just telling you the truth and if you don't like the truth is not my problem that is your problem and it really legitimately is your problem\nObama was incredibly divisive with terms I mean get in their faces get your uncle kooky out there are you ...\nI mean everywhere he supported aggression are not everywhere but he often supported aggression\nHe was very divisive and so we had that and a lot of aggressive people felt empowered by that and a lot of people supported him purely because he was black\nAnd what to do it increased the racial divide both ways\nIt increases it increased the racial divide both ways and this is not profitable for us guys\nWe need to step back and look and say hey what unites us and what devices and I'm up against the heartbreak guys I'm gonna tell you this we get back let's talk about what should be our common ground you're listening to the final chapter\n\n[laughter]\n\nIn luck while your kitchen looks amazing I Love your new cabinets I've learned to replace my kitchen cabinets that I'm remodeling takes so long it's so expensive
