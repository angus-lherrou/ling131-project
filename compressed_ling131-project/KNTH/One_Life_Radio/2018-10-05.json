I Need to you got really good at eliminating ... distractions which is what we're talking about yeah I don't know how did it accept I just probably put a little bit of effort into\nTrying to do well that's a good thing and I didn't write\nA little bit it's taking a little bit of planning a little bit of change and it really does a an incredible thing to eliminate just all the distractions that we have coming are well\nI have to tell you I'm One of the things that has really helped me do that is my ... and I'm not ... I'm giving 'em up law well that's great but it's true it's totally true\nThat I go in there and I it's a it's a place for me to just be with myself quietly you know and just she'll and reflect and invest in me because when you do that\nI think you are better able to focus on other things and you will eliminate distractions\nWell and that now I I I think this is somewhat counterintuitive but it's actually true is when you take the time\nTo do those types of self care things whether it's that working out spend the time planning cooking yeah eating well um take care of yourself yes yeah and you're actually then turn around and you're more productive yeah\nWell I started um being more uh uh [noise] what do I want to say\nJust a little more particular about what I eat because I was going a little bit sideways I myself am a real bad with exercise when I exercise I feel so much better like it is remarkable how different I feel with even just Fifteen minutes on the spin bike\nWell and I can tell you this just from yesterday I had a day trip and then I decided last night to do a cheat meal but like this morning\nWhat was it which I feel so hung over really my body feels them when I have I'm tired I'm fatigued and I'm like this is why I don't either way I had\nA chicken pot pie grand logs and\nYes I had read though good right it it was so good um but and I had one glass of wine but I'm I did one but\nI'm telling you this is why I don't eat that way I get one meal like that and I feel like God had been knocked over by a bulldozer\nWell okay I'm going to defend wine here I don't know about the chicken pot pie I didn't make it for your ... no ... well if you're if you're drinking typical American wine was Seventy five additives and call and die the preservative that they don't allow in French\nAre tallying wine or our him well and it's not that expensive I have\nThat teen and why don't you Argentinean because as I Know Monsanto destroyed them bars you know well they they did a lot of damage to their crops I'll tell you that I I'm Sorry I won't be I won't drink Argentine well don't listen to me I'm not an expert on on wind really\nWelcome to surf but but seriously and it's it's not at all I Want fancy wine thing because actually it's the same price some to in some cases cheaper because France is making wine for so many years uh that you can get like just a a good bottle of wine for ten bucks seriously Italian or French\nSo I did it yesterday but I but let's talk about eliminating distraction yeah which is what I'm doing right now distracting you so ah everything demands attention or so we think so how do we stay focused with so many demands cat\nWell I think it's what we just mentioned it's doing a few simple little things are track to keep yourself focused and on task\nAnd one of the easiest things that we can do is just block time mhm we probably you probably heard of before but you absolutely\nHave to do that whether it's blocking time for the self care stuff mhm or blocking time for instance I Do email once in the morning and what's in the evening you are not going to hear from me in between okay great some teaching people when they interact with me yup you're training them yeah [laughter]\nWell I like that well and um I talked about this yesterday a with Daniel I block off a certain days of the week or half days a certain hours where uh that's when I get my errands done or I guess\nRight or I'll schedule in an appointment right like a doctor's appointment or beauty appointment or whatever but it's my time to do with whatever I Want\nYeah and and I think the hardest thing for a lot of people to do as well AOL chicken or say\nThey ... I think I Do and if you give yourself a break at least once an hour every\nHour takes two to five minutes jump around move around get up get down like change your mind from what you're actually on ...\nAnd then come back to it yeah try to plow through a lot of times it ended up taking you actually longer than if you take that to to five minutes to get refresher sell them\nRun around the office building or you know whatever you got to do and then come right back to what you were doing\nYeah I was going to I thought you were talking about are you are going to talk about stopping digital distraction because\nThat's one big one I found myself like kind of starting to get addicted to just having my phone with me everywhere all the time now and I thought I'm not doing that yeah you know like certain friends owe tax me at certain times and it's like I'm not being trained when I get home I'm plugging it into the kitchen and if I don't and I'm not touching it\nUnless I happen to see it or I you know need to address and die but trying to stay off my phone\nStaff your phone it is hard 'cause we it is our business I work on my right to write and I think that we turn off the smartphone notifications\nJust turn them off again block your time when you're going to check that sort of stuff if you're a poster you're into social media have ... times where you look at it you don't need to be looking at it all\nDay long I'm because those number of legs will be there at two and they're those same people are still be there at five or ten or whenever you do that I mean you don't need to keep checking\nWell yeah and if you let people know you know that uh I'm not available after seven let's say or after six yeah and I write I'll check my email or my phone first thing in the morning\nI just think it gives you I don't know just some some some time to ah just let your mind dressed yelling let your mind rest is so important to do that and I know that you say there are some counterintuitive tactics that can keep has helped keep us focus what are those\nWell it's some of what we just mentioned about the self care ... and taking frequent break\n'em because your mind and your physical health are really so important and they enable you to focus or not mhm right so if you are eating crap right if your diet is mainly fast food\nYou are not going to be able to focus as well as if you're eating really healthy clean diet right well\nYeah and you know to back to your point about the chicken pot pie it's now or the wind [laughter] well yeah that chicken pot pie it was the quality of the ingredients yeah yeah you know so very inflamed in the hallway when I ...\nA bunch of you know there's a bunch of salt and sugar and fat and not healthy fat either you know right right ... yes yes yeah\nYeah though are I'm sure they made the the the the pie crust\nWith cheap oil I don't know how can we get column and ask them\nNow I guess we'll need to find out I think the biggest thing that people can do is really focusing on what it is you do want to accomplish so adept defy whatever those four major goals that you have and I tend to break 'em down into Ninety day period of time and you've got to every single\nDay pick three\nBig rocks or three of the four big goal areas\nAnd create some to dues towards those and if your to do this or not moving the ball forward mhm or if your other things that are beginning to you every time that have nothing to do with those three big rocks you got a lemonade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding why we have the electoral college\n\nNow you also have to understand each separate nation sovereign nation that has agreed to take part in this union in this contract\nIs union is secured by the contract on his constitutions the bill of rights was added to the constitution because\nCertain states certain nations didn't feel like the language in the constitution was strong enough even though it's pretty sad out they\nDidn't feel like it was strong enough so they wanted additional language in there to prevent\nAbuse anyway\nWe're not going to try to follow that the electoral college was set up to give equal representation now what I Want you to think about\nEach state is given a certain number of electoral rules according to the number of senators which is appointed according to the number or the population so the population does affect the electoral votes\nBut it's not the population\nOf the whole nation it has the population of each state\nAnd when I say nation I should say the union to be more accurate so it's not the population that population of each state so to make the math easy\nI've set an example we're going to use for states that receive to electoral votes each\nEach of the state has ten people in the population like I said we're just trying to make this easy Matt so each state has ten\nPopulation that is forty votes right there you got it\nForty pardon me not forty vote that is a total of eight electoral votes with forty people but this is representative of four different nations for different countries for different states\nNow let's take a look at two states something like a California and a New York each of these would get three electoral votes remember this is not accurate this is just for easy Matt each of these will get three that means six electoral votes\nSo we have four states which are more states getting eight electoral votes and we have two states getting six electoral votes these electoral votes are more than any two of the previous states\nBut they're less than the combined states so we were on our dice we have an election and what happens is in state number one we'll call it Idaho\nWith two like total votes we get eight\nEight popular votes eight citizens vote for candidate number one\nAnd to vote for candidates number two so all our both of the electoral votes candidate number one now let's look at Alaska same thing\nEight people vote for candidate number one and two people vote for candidates number two\nAnd so on down the other two states a Montana and Texas just for kicks so we've got a total of four\nStates with eight people voting each\nThat leaves us thirty two on the quote popular vote pretended it number one but candidate number one has eight electoral votes\nNow we go over here to California who is three electoral votes and they vote unanimously\nKennedy number two is that gets ... votes in the electoral votes they vote unanimously in New York presented it number two so now we have forty votes to states if it went by popular vote would rule an entire nation\nThere is no representation for the other states\nThere is no representation for the other countries this popular vote could be influenced by a whole multitude of factors now over in Idaho we need the foreign lands right so so we know we need that state\nBut the New York or the California might push and lobby for laws that would destroy Idaho because they don't know ... Idaho needs\nSo the purpose for the electoral college is to prevent one state or two states or a very small minority of states or countries from dominating other countries from keeping other countries from having a say so again we're not a democracy where Republicans\nAnd we're out of time for this segment we'll be back in just a minute\n\n[noise]\nThis is your your Morgantown all died gum\nVoting is being done in many places around the country I Believe a vote for any Democrat for any office is a passionate endorsement\nRevenue McCarthyism directed a judge Brett Kavanaugh and his ordeal before the Senate Judiciary committee it was classic McCarthyism the use of a terrible crime proven in other circumstances to try and destroying individual innocent of that charge\nWe know there are wind Spain's Cosby's just as there were rows and birds are Alger Hiss what channel got her Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn rampage through the lives of innocent people in the fifties\nNow Dianne Feinstein and Sheldon Whitehouse and Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly forty five other Democrats have taken up the road cone mental than the Joe McCarthy legacy can damage in voting but by refusing to vote for any Democrat for any office I'm here with us [laughter]\nPepperdine graduate school of public policy turned more at public policy duck Pepperdine dot edu this is Michael\n... here with my style from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans\nAre decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate how markets offers that free service would access to thousands of Medicare plans plans that can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with an arrow dollar premiums and eat and plant that pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new option it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower co pay more choice of like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on same as you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance it's free\nThanks Mike this is Michael ... for health markets\nFind out if you can get a Medicare plan to pay you back coal eight hundred seven o nine Ninety nine Thirteen that's eight hundred seven o nine Ninety nine Thirteen eight unrated seven o nine Ninety nine Thirteen\nJohn van pay pasture and author of the new book marathon face\nSurrendering your life to Jesus is the greatest decision you'll ever make but that's just the starting line many of us began our spiritual racism following Jesus with unrealistic expectations that hinder us from crossing the finish line every faith journey encounters obstacles just opened the Bible\nAnd my new book marathon bait motivation from the greatest endurance runners of the Bible\nI write about how men and women of fate overcame obstacles and how you can do the same\nAlong with scriptural references I include my own life experiences about endurance running when things get tough like God help you and do or your race so you too can finish well water\nYour copy of author John ... is compelling new book marathon fades motivation from the greatest endurance runners of the Bible that Amazon ended Barnes and noble dot com [noise]\nAlways voluntary hypertension like ... or Tony when you were here who is a thing or is this is not the risk they are still ... to ... sometimes have asthma or sleep apnea ...\nSometimes\nConsiderable home and every hypertension\nTo learn more visit sometimes as we age Don Oregon to see I Do every\nMore on the cabinet allegations that will play college work how did you vote sacrifice the FBI to investigate before he would vote yes remember he wants the Asheville it'd be more Reagan\nElevator and also the latest on the journal treasury shock your shirt fleece officer shot one being killed you can also family by going to Gallagher's army or my salary\nOr show the Mike Gallagher show ... says right before ...\nAm and seven days a yes or\n[noise]\n\nAll right well come back we our boys over the electoral college why the people are still demanding that we have banned in the electoral college\nLike if something bad and the case you missed the first two segments basically what we established was number one the rules and restrictions on Congress", "year": "2018", "show_name": "One Life Radio", "city": "Houston", "day": "05"}
