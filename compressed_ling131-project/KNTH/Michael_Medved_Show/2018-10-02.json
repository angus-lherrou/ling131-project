A. R. K. Davis always go to the Michael ... on Twitter at ... show and Michael ... dot com and even when the filling the guys are here\nSo I I I've just I've talked to so many people and I've read so many things and I've talked to other people who do this for a living and they're telling me the same thing that that people are sick of this that it it has become\n... and ... it has become ludicrous we've gone from a a a an\nAllegation of sexual assault that was worthy enough to bring a woman in an effort to sit down and share her testimony which she did a that story is falling apart there is no corroboration of it and the subsequent stories in New Yorker and among the arm of ah of\nAttorney Michael ... those those ... those are less credible the doctor for it and that's saying something and and now we're getting into ice wars\nAnd uh and and then it ms sweating it who doesn't remember whether that was Brett or not at or near a punch bowl but he had some red solo cups that I wasn't going to take a red solo cup from Brett Kavanaugh\nIt it's ... ... it's theater of the absurd it has gone from political theater to theater of the absurd I wrote a town hall\nDot com column this morning posted the dawn my time so it's been up there for a few hours out to share a couple of thoughts from it and um and then get some thoughts from you we got some audio Richard Blumenthal [laughter] which is always enjoyable there's just something delicious Lee\nTwisted about Richard Blumenthal democratic Connecticut lecturing anyone about truth telling Mr stolen valor they had these folks they they they have no shame they just have no shame will also try again to diagram sentences for Mazie Hirono is just just always an adventure\nUh and and one bubble attract the moving the goalposts and just sort of see where it's all going so my question for you I have an overall broad question for you\nA ... and that is is is what's happening before our eyes\nWhat is happening before our eyes I strongly feel\nThat the nation is on to this campaign Adam unanimously there are plenty of liberals plenty of Democrats and many of you listening and I'd love to hear from you as well 'cause we take all comers although Michael Bennet vet show as you know Michael does when he's here and I do it every any show I'm hosting Meyer somebody else's I absolutely welcome opposing views\nBut I Will tell you something and and we had a little bit of experimentation with this yesterday here's my belief\nShowed me a twenty people who want to obsess about a Brett Kavanaugh's calendar\nAnd who are just so convinced that his testimony just doesn't jibe with what the realities of early eighties party life we're\nFinding a mate among those twenty people are some folks who are really concerned about judge Kavanaugh's temperament on I mean oh my gosh she\nHe really blew this cool in in some questioning with Amy called the chart and Sheldon Whitehouse and I don't know if we can have temperament like that on the court and blah blah blah blah and everyone's find me twenty people who are all twisted off about the ... side\nShows ... irrelevance ease the ridiculous mess and the you know what's driving every single one of them\nThey don't want him on the court because he's a constitutional list\nThey don't they don't care about how he might have treated women when they were Seventeen years old because the people who are telling you that thing about probably have no problem with Bill Clinton probably have no problem with with Ted Kennedy\nYou know Bill Clinton fine no problem Ted Kennedy find no problem with Brett Kavanaugh whoa no surgery can't go there that that's when you know that something else is driving the train and what's driving the train here in in this really is so simple\nAnd once you understand it becomes easier to grass and you've and know what's going on here\nThis entire episode has nothing to do with women or concerned about who did or did not treat her miss treat women properly and the eighties or any other time every single bit of this\nIs smoke is smoke and what's behind the smoke\nIs the true motivation\nAnd that is that the campaign against Brett Kavanaugh\nIs being launched by and embraced by people who do not want a constitutional list on the Supreme Court\nThat because constitutional is don't make stuff up in their rulings they don't make up right that don't exist like no right to terminate a pregnancy\nWhich was absolutely fabricated from whole cloth in roe v Wade in Nineteen Seventy three and this is extremely important\nI don't want roe versus Wade overturned because I'm pro life\nBrett Kavanaugh will not vote to overturn roe v Wade because he is a conservative or a pro lifer and by the way I've no idea what he'll do but if he's a genuine constitutional is the will absolutely vote to overturn it not to forward his political views or his political agenda\nBecause judges should keep justices especially should keep all those things out of there ... all that matters is is there a right to abortion and the constitution of course there's not\nLet's talk about the over ... versus a Hodges the twenty Fifteen gay marriage ruling thanks Anthony Kennedy for that [noise]\nThat this was a completely unconstitutional ruling that said that they not only that state could offer gay marriage equality because of course they can states can do whatever they want in terms of the definition of marriage but over versus Hodges said they had to\nThey had to\nKnow you've got to to make sure that women can abort their babies I Know you've got to make sure that states a rule that a a marriage of two guys is the same as my marriage to my wife\nNo they don't if a state wants to end by the way that that conversely applies to abortion is what little constitution one on one if you need at the moment roe v Wade is overturned and that they cannot come fast enough\nThe moment roe v Wade is overturn what happens what happens\nIs the first answer is close to nothing ... immediately the answer is nothing but the landscape that then left is every state can have whatever abortion laws they wish when over ... versus Hodges overturned every state can recognize the marriages that they wish\nIf state number one wants to have full marriage equality due due to ladies ... whatever you want to do it's all marriage to us that's great\nBut at the state next door says not so much one man one woman that that they get to do that if state hey wants\nTo have ... permissive abortion laws I Will lamented if I Lived in that state I'd fighting doggedly against it but they can do it\nAnd if a state next door says new we're going to be very restrictive we're going to absolutely protect the unborn\nIn many many ways that we haven't even been able to do before that state gets to do that all of that that I've just described hoping to make your wrecked a car or anything that's called respecting the constitution this is the kind of America that Brett Kavanaugh will help bring about\nIn other words if you ... the left\nAnd removing their ability to legislate through court rulings to get from the judiciary that which they cannot get from legislatures this has been an ongoing game of the left for decades and it is over when constitutional is reached the high court\nBrett Kavanaugh is just such a person God Bless him\nAnd um that's that's what it's all about because that that is garlic too of empire that that is is kryptonite\nTo the left\nSo that's what it's all about him getting nothing to do with everybody's concerned about Dr Ford listen we're all concerned about doc Ford some math but our when Brett Kavanaugh's hands that I Wish her well I have no ill will toward her whatsoever or go lead a good happy and prosperous life oh I bet it'll be prosperous her calendar will soon fill\nWith a with book deals and I'm\nSpeaking engagements a plenty I'm sure that I Wish you well I don't begrudge or any of that so when I get to have it on the court are we going to do that is that going to happen to feel like we're closer today than we were yesterday or could it all just go sideways answer is yes it could and I'll tell you why next Mark Davis in for Michael advantage stick around\nBe somebody that was perfect your entire life as somebody said hey here's you up stuff that doesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say for somebody could accuse you of something\nAs you're automatically guilty but is is Ralph you are certainly guilty until proven innocent that one of the very very bad things is negative

Kavanaugh's because the left fears ... with a with every fiber of it's being a constitution list on the Supreme Court and so what would that look like what kind of ruins would you have in many many things like roe v Wade which established a phony abortion ride\nA overkill versus Hodges which established a phony obligation for all states to have a gay marriage equality and it would be a state by state patchwork vast what honoring the constitution looks like a with a question that we had Judy out of the city or in San Antonio Ron Hi Mark Davis for Michael how are you\nOh great great I I guess Arnie or a little better for patients on this they just starting right state by state basis\nHow's that work because I started back in or when you had in a race for America would be illegal in Texas but illegal in Oklahoma or legal or in Arkansas but illegal in Alabama oh on\nThe ... I write here's here's here's here's here's exactly here's exactly how it would work marriage one oh one if two people get married there three levels of of of marriage marriage is religious which means something as a a a promise they make\nBefore God but a couple of days before God second is social\nUh meaning does your ear people around you your family your friends consider you to be married to him in there so that certainly has of either being married and the third is government recognition of yet that's the only one that's everybody's business the other to the social the religious or none of anybody's business a gay couple can get married today anywhere they wish\nAnytime the only question is will the state recognize that marriage there's no such thing as a marriage ban nobody\nWill ever bang on a church or temple you you guys getting married in there they they absolutely can get married the only question is will the state recognizing that an institution is our way out almost out almost out almost ... almost done when the constitution is offered some states will recognize those gay marriages and some will not go ahead\nOkay uh so I ... in traveling across the country and they're in a state recognizing when they got to ... and I I don't know what kind of regular even if you go on abortion first state to state one\nOh no no no one went back out and I came back up to marriage back back up to marriage but let's say a couple is married in Connecticut or to do to marry in Connecticut and their marriages recognized or you just talking about there vacationing or driving across country or they suddenly not married as they pass through\nKansas no of course they are but the state of Kansas doesn't recognize it but it doesn't matter because they don't live there and the only thing that marriage the government recognition of marriage only extends to\nTax benefits in certain laws in certain ... certain that there are still married in the most important ways religiously and socially now if they move to Kansas well that's another kettle of fish 'cause there are still married absolutely but it's not a marriage that the state recognizes with certain\nPerks that come with marriage recognition so it's just not really that big a deal now what was the abortion point you wanted to make ahead\nOf the same thing or are they young ladies in a state where Washington is legal as he gets to her you know right you just done legally another young lady that they were illegal which she get that done illegally she can be tried for murder for playing back then I did it and another thing that it happened to be around\nGreen Iraq I I like states right now to be\nMore than that that's what it looks like that that's exactly what it looks like if a if a state as as ghoulish sleep permissive abortion laws well there you are if another state protecting the unborn and the young\nLady violates that violates that law and the doctor violates that laws and whatever is on the books for violating that law would happen that that\nThis is what the founding fathers thoroughly intended is and that's why we're not a\nOf a homogenous just America where the United states

San Antonio crash hey Mark Davis in for Michael how are you doing\nMark how're you doing good thank you great great yeah is obviously a liar because\nWhy would\nFind gold is a three man and one woman not it right\nSon to John Mark Davis get to talk to you get I I'm trying to get to all these got started welcomed I Want to get 'em on every show I can so here's a little or another check box on the list is great that you are a lot of\nPleasure and I loved it I Love her relatives in Richardson in Plano\nAnd they they listen to you almost religious were [noise]\nWell I should [laughter] all that good it shows a certain prioritization that I respect well let's let's talk about the concept of respect um let's do a let let's let's meet in the arena of colonizing I\nGrace to good people of town hall this morning with a a treat is that says something I Want to run by you\nKnow this is no longer just a Supreme Court confirmation a cabin or could fail to give me what you could withdraw himself he can be withdrawn and we could just offer up any Coney Barrett are ... and be just fine constitutionally\nBut these people cannot win the fabric of America is is is at risk here are the laws of basic decency basic human conduct basic behavioral norms they're all at at play here I Am am I being too dramatic [noise]\nI think what you're having is the latest chapter in\nThe saga of an ongoing disease which is our government has grown so powerful so all encompassing so able to bend the power of government to favor one group for people to another that this is just the latest example of how our problem in politics is not too much money\nThe more the why for another fried butter word our problems too much power POW we are the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to be this powerful to decide things on a national scope with a single to them off in the five to four vote\nAnd as a result because all the power in my from on some issues especially the hot button social issues\nThe Supreme Court people will do anything to get that power anything and that's what we're seeing in the cabin okay [noise]\nWell that that is where we are because legislatures can legislate a chief executives can do executives things and pilot certain programs through presidents are powerful Congress is powerful but they are all I'm a mutual and they're all by biased by the Supreme Court\nAnd and that means that just when their disagreements they win and that's just all there is to it\nOr is it but are we mistaken about that\nNow the Supreme Court is are unelected branch and as a result um and of course it for the life tenure\nOr we're term limits on the president we have um you know elections every two years ... house of representatives every six years in the Senate but on the Supreme Court especially because the it's only nine justices someone gets on the court for life\nOr that could be in a lifetime of your side losing five to four decisions we'd be a whole lot better off if you remember that you know the first ... no Supreme Court nominee ever heard before the Seventy to share a committee until Nineteen twenty five\nBecause the court wasn't that powerful now and in fact they didn't consistently started appearing until Nineteen fifty five now of course the Supreme Court is so powerful and so invasive in all of these areas of our life we treated like you know World War three whatever there's the frequency\nIt seems like a band horse out of the car and isn't it a ... I don't I don't see any way that we can ratchet things but in fact I'm thirty seconds on a conversation I had with here's a little name drop that I Do on purpose\nMy friend Tom Jovan ... at the Institute for policy in the nation I mean I Know where they're wonderful people\nAnd and he and I were having a conversation about it she said this whole thing about court supremacy Supreme Court supremacy if you will is just a mess their their co equal a that term equal should suffice their co equal it meaning that that if the Supreme Court says something okay fine it and\nIf a president disagrees with it she can ignore it but then rather than chaos breaking out the public can figure out whether we like or don't like the president that ignores the Supreme Court and we can impeach our unlike him\nAnd there's a certain rough balance to that unlike what we had you just described which is this all powerful tribunal that just runs our lives on their whim\nWell I Know that Abraham Lincoln Andrew Jackson location we talk about ... the Supreme Court and you know those were and they have like a case for civil war was around\nI Would much prefer the Congress exercise of power it's almost never used which is Congress can pass a law saying the court does not have jurisdiction over this area of our lives\nIn other words we're going to take back the power we created the we've constitution created the courts the court's powers not in for that we take back some of it we limited jurisdiction\nI'm OK I'm singling now\nWith with ah with with potential uh listening for what might be in a rare\nCase of the Nineteen sixties you know the Supreme right out of nowhere set Madeline Marie O'Hare is right you can't have a Supreme Court you can't have a a prayer to a Supreme Being and uh I guess today we we couldn't go out for Muslims but perhaps not anyone else given how things are going but you can't have a prayer in public schools\nWell there was a big move in Congress and I think that for the times had been different kind of liberalism hadn't been renting renting Supreme back then Congress could have said no this is not the court's jurisdiction we take it back so the decision was not on board\nAnd that's okay that's satisfying up to a point because I saw Madeline Marie O'Hare it should be as repugnant a person a but\nBut you couldn't someone rightfully step forward and say a while of doesn't the pesky First Amendment when kennel legislature come in there and say they're like you can argue all day whether prayer in school is a First Amendment establishment clause violation or whatever but in that doesn't that it's each kind of envy argument before it begins\n[noise] well again um what the\nWhat the court had said in the ... case was this was a ... this was\nA violation of the status of religion claws well if you disagree with that Congress can step in as the people's representatives and say no we have a different view\n[noise] so again that hasn't happened it's not likely to happen but I'm simply saying that we are going to have to appoint a whole bunch more constitutional is people who are judicial\nRestraint people to the court because you know there are five people on the court if Kavanaugh is confirmed who don't have this expansive view of the Supreme Court's power rebel more humble view\nAnd I think that that's the best way to handle this put people on the court who don't want to be played comic rulers of the rest of us\nPrecisely and and that is why a distance he would be the fifth that's why the left is is having a whole you know what's sad about that and that's what's great about talking to Jon son is as we can go very macro and now let's come back and go very micro or I Am feeling a little better about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski a little\nBecause I think they were willing to vote for him before the FBI we should placate them Jeff Flake is a wild card I have no idea what amount of ... going to want to rush the will of course I was wrong\nHe will ultimately vote yes why what makes you so sure\nI Know Jeff and I also know that a lot of this is a well let's just say McCain disease I'm you know I think that Jeffers enjoying some of the media attention you know\nI I Hope that I Hope that the worst that's going on I really do but if you and God Bless Senator McCain but if you coined of the pathology that led him to go thumbs down on Obamacare repeal way why wouldn't ingest slaying have\nWell because there can be there you know diseases don't always take their full course sometimes they stop before you know you go over the cliff um look it's like ... voted for the domination to go out of committee\nAssembling nothing dramatic is reveal the FBI probe he would be very strange for him will know on the floor having voted for uncommitted than almost never happens\nIn ... I don't think it would be strange at all because I don't trust them I'm going to defer to you however I Am seeds of the personal experience and and then you and and be in sleep better a little bit because it is what he said\nIt is what he's made me crazy politically and the posturing and the Trump hatred has made me insane but he he he does he did say that he said give me a week and and I can be willing to vote for it on the floor I'm going to hold into that and it sounds like you don't think I Would be unwise and doing so\n[noise] uh I think I think the ... the ... to truly weakest link is actually looser Murkowski\nIn thirty seconds why [noise]\nUm because if she didn't face the Republican primary in Alaska and twenty twenty I think she'd be the most likely to vote against Kavanaugh the only thing that's preventing you from voting against capital is the fact that she faces a Republican primary electorate you've already lost one Republican primary and I had to come back and win as a write in independence\nHas a right and that's right well this is that what John is on the show just got three times better because of you thank you on Twitter at Johns on the national review every place just go get every book he ever wrote just wonderful guy wonderful writer the great John signed on Twitter at Johns I knew it certainly makes sense thank you appreciate it very much\nOkay thank you you bet All right big exhale\nJohnson says Jeff Flake she's gonna be okay and you won't screw us I'm checking back to the bank [laughter] I'm taking it to the bank don't mess with me man Mark Davis is somebody going to be back\nI thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nAh and on a [noise]\nYou know unconvincing presentation on [noise]\nAnd I I told someone later boy I'll tell you they give us a lot of credit\nThirty six years ago I\nWe started this again I guess [laughter]\nI mean if it is back at Yale ... yeah well even before in high school apparently um [noise]\nSo I I I don't you know look I Want the FBI to conduct as a thorough investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are imposed upon them um but I think for anyone who believe there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want\nJudges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs and defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about right\n[noise] do tell I think that a judge Kavanaugh displayed exactly the right kind of radar for fairness because fairness ... is a huge from his every judicial pour\nIt it radiates from every ruling he has a very strong sense of fairness basic fairness basic decency\nSo that when those concepts are dashed against the rocks or those concepts are ex bloated\nRiding a vehicle of character assassination from the left\nIt is exactly his sense of fairness that infused his personality they're under questioning from those Democrats his Democrat torment

would he cares about that\nOne couldn't find anything about it and if you Google you anything about it I think that and\nI Know and no and no one no one is going to care what they are going to care about is what the idea is that a Jeff Flake or John Case it would bring to a presidential race I think they would have strong appeal for Trump haters\nThey have strong appeal for people for whom the president's conservative governance is a little too spicy to sort of a center right the moderate issue voter that that is a voting bloc I think they're they're they're they're both Jeff Flake and John

Supreme Court justice be removed yes yes but\nBut I mean so I mean the president has a four year term but it can be shorter if there's misbehavior in somebody's a beach Supreme Court absolutely is a lifetime of in the designation unless something happens to have the person yanked\nAnd if it occurs to you have a has this guy written a book holy cow I guess I have a couple of them in fact there was one another technique me about it now [noise] ah there was one in twenty fourteen the good people that rag Noreen\nA which we now own which is funny I I I wrote a book for regular human Salem Media group ... so that's a good book to be able to have a\nLittle thing called Lone Star America Texas can save our country the idea we're all in the uh the purgatory it'd be Obama years and the I I Am I thought was hey if if the entire country was run more like taxes we'd be a lot better off\nAnd you know what lately looks like we're kind of doing that so that proved I won't say prophetic could as hopefully with sensible that's Lone Star America from twenty fourteenth then in twenty six team in the election year\nIt occurred to me to do about a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty some talk show topics of of subjects that the left has been getting away with like guns are bad\nHuman productivity has definitely warming the planet the constitution as a shape bubble malleable living breathing document and other nonsense and and just a way chapter by chapter to gently McKay maybe not so gently but at least civil Lee and constructively push back against that\nAnd I put it together in a little thing called upside down how the left turn right into wrong truth and lies and good and bad\nThat's a lot of subtitle justice Mark Davis upside down on a Google or Amazon or Barnes and noble or whatever and ah there's a book and the hope you enjoy it All right\nSo the last gentleman and they took a little altogether was talking about how about about Supreme Court justices and boy you could say we've been talking about Supreme Court justice is a lot lately I'm ... and how it's so important and powerful because it's a lifetime appointment and the gentleman said\nIt's not a lifetime appointment as of yesterday\nBut I I kinda got his point article three sexual on judicial branch beautiful pop judicial powers it's easy for you to say\nI'm the judges of the Supreme and inferior records show hold their offices during good behavior\nSo I don't really know what he was getting at is if it seems like there were things that there were offenses that a lot like maybe for deciding wrongly in roe v Wade should have gotten a few justice is just tossed out onto the curb\nOkay um [noise] it's a lifetime to more than a barring impeachment and and that gets ... eat so about ... what led to do here is if there are there are two things that people have talked about\nTerm limits and age limits to get the more\nUnfair age when it's seen as I'm sixty ... like to be around for a couple of days reborn decades and uh and I I Know a ton of people\nWho are sharpest attacks smart as a whip strong as it ox they're eighty five I also do some people who are forty ... total idiots so I'm just seeing the wildly arbitrary no term limits\nTerm limits boil down to one thing turn over for the sake of turnover I think the founding fathers envisioned a I'm a citizen legislature but you know uh\nThey didn't put term limits on there I guess they left that up to us when we finally did it uh for the presidency you know after FDR was president for thirty seven years or [laughter] I Do I Do a\nAnd a twelve or Thirteen but we didn't we did that and I guess I did that [laughter] but I think we're probably all on board for presidential term limits turned over for the sake of turnover especially these days seems like a good idea uh\nEverybody talks about term limits in Congress oh we we get well I can fill up the lines right now everybody goes banging the table for term limits here's the dirty little secret you're already\nNot enough people wore them oh you do I do your friends do\nThe people you hang out with do I can fill you know forty seven hours of talk shows that people who do you know what if everybody was so good\nData about term limits we'd had him a long time ago so here ultimately has the bottom line of the journey to the dirty little secret\nWe liked the idea of term limits it sounds great but then when you realize that that means you got to get rid of your congressman just to be under twelve years and it's usually the deal is six terms in the house two terms in the Senate\nBoth equally twelve years ago but that means you ... you know what that means I mean I got to get rid of Ted Cruz after one more term I don't want to get rid of Ted Cruz ever\nOne more term oh I Want to I wouldn't want to prove to be a center Jillian Ninety three\nSo that's why I term limits never goes anywhere is a bit every image shows in the bowling approval ratings of Congress are terrible approval ratings of people talking about their congressmen tend to be pretty good\nSo everybody else should have to get rid of their cars but if you don't want to get
