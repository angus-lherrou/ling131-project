Prager Hi David\nHi Daryl pleasure to be on with you thank you\nI agree so a lot more interesting one I differ with you and I differ with you on a fire metal policy I think and I suspect that's what great minutes talking about when he uses the word science\nCorrect entirely actually yeah well and so\nI Do on that there are like three words than it is sort of a phrase well one of them I happen to agree on which is I think my side Republican side is often in the science denying category when it comes to global warming\nWorking to apprehend criminals somebody who was threatened mass murder and apparently printing out credibly threaten mass murder [noise]\nTo a lot of political officials\nAnd a lot of people involved in media I ah I Know that CNN was all terribly indignant earlier big cause the White House mentioned political and fish all but it didn't mention that CNN was the target of one of the bombs\nAnd they apparently are bombs they're rudimentary they're not highly sophisticated but they apparently are operational\nAnd good for the NYPD and the FBI and the New York bombs was basically an all the people who are trying to deal with this and do it also for some of the reactions\nNot all of them some of the reactions have been appalling\nAnd hypocritical and wrong a but not Steve ... piece of the various reactions that I've seen I think the one from the whip for the Republican Party in the house of representatives\nOf the honorable Steve Sebelius congressman from Louisiana who's been a friend of his show a Steve writes these attempted attacks that have been made or beyond criminal their acts of pure terror\nViolence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society I've experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and I'm committed to using my voice to speak out against it where ever I can\nThose responsible for these evil acts of terror and yes even if no one has killed God willing no one will be killed these are evil acts he writes those responsible for these evil acts of terror must be hunted down and brought to justice and I have great confidence that our law enforcement officers will succeed in that mission\nAs a nation we must agree that this is a dangerous path and cannot become the new normal\nExcellent\nThat is fine and by the way what the president said he spoke after Milan yen millennia was promoting the some of her causes any complimented his wife speaking as she introduced him he got a standing ovation\nAnd uh then the uh the president said this about the bombing attempt\nTo suspicious packages and devices mail to current and former high ranking government officials the safety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expensive this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\n[noise] what the\nPresident said is fine and it's appropriate and he offered a little bit more to be more specific here's President Trump\n[noise]\nIt's a very bipartisan statement I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that disagree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred has Americans my administration will provide additional updates as they become available\nAnd I just wanted to thank everybody for their understanding were extremely angry upset\nUnhappy about what we witnessed this morning and we will get to the bottom of it\nOK given the fact that two of the most prominent targets of these bombs were Hillary Rodham Clinton who President Trump defeated and the election\nAnd the Democratic president that he replaced Brock Obama I think it would be helpful for the president or for Sarah Sanders frankly to reveal I mean enough it revealed is honestly but I think it would be a good thing for President Trump to call President Obama and for President Trump to call Secretary Clinton\nAnd to express his concern and his gratitude that they and their families are okay\nBecause uh ... just saying that doing it would detoxify this entire matter and one of the things that I resent is mainstream media right now and a lot of democratic leaders\nAre injecting toxin into this situation\nThey're basically trying to blame Trump for this now I get it I understand most of the people who have been targeted or very clearly identified with the left their opponents of Trump\nThey include Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and Morocco bomb and yes all three of them are African American I understand that it also includes Hillary Rodham Clinton Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd I'm I'm oh and George Soros she was the first one to receive a a package and apparently they are now saying\nThe package was actually delivered in person by somewhat it was not mailed to George Soros but the package with this rudimentary bomb and it was delivered to Soros his home outside of New York city and um\n[noise] look at the idea that Trump is to blame for this of course that is irresistible to the left\nAnd it seems to me it is entirely wrong I sent out a tweet about this immediately when that tendency started\nAnd I understand that there are people in the media who are trying to link together for phenomena what are the four phenomena these bombs the bomb scare number to the show veep murder number three the fact that Trump ... says that it's fake news as the enemy of the people\nAnd um and and a number for the\nUh the idea of the Trump praised at a rally in Montana the body slamming a reporter by congressman Greg Gianforte by the way to apologize lavishly who paid the guy damages who apologized again and actually was pleaded guilty in court\nFor assault and battery so ah here's here's the point these four separate things Greg John forte the Trump assaults on news media as fake news an enemy of the people the murder of ... and these bomb scares which are attempted murder\nWhat's the connection between all for nothing there is no connection the first two are evil threatening to murder people sending out bombs to people's homes that is evil murdering Jamal ... which no American had any role in at all\nWas evil and it's been announced that way by the president the United states the other two things Trump's praise of Congressman John forte for the most embarrassing moment of his life and Trump's general ... on\nThe news media is enemy that people are stupid and it's embarrassing it's not evil and it's not a crime and basically trying to associate these things is wrong it is irresponsible I Know one series is double\nFor people on the left especially Thirteen Days before an election but it's deeply irresponsible you want to hear about irresponsible Jack Reed the senator from Rhode Island was on CNN and of course CNN let him directly to saying what CNN wanted to hear listen\nI think is quite obvious us some of this is a reflection of the the base tone a debate and the president of the United states is that a rally and smiles as people chant lock her up or make their own\nDirect attacks on the news media\nThat doesn't raise the level of debate that lowers it and it creates this environment where these acts could take place and not only being an attack I think the other thing that's going to have this or act to find out if someone is sending has exploded a device anonymously to people who could be hurt\nAnd and this is something that is just just just to record that\nIt's not just disreputable it's not just caught cowardice is evil but the point is we don't know anything about the perpetrator yet I Hope we will soon\nAt one of these guys are wrong let me give you an example of something else it was just a couple of days ago that in Washington DC in northwest Washington Fox five Fox News in other words was attacked\nBy a guy who have now identified his name was George ... and he came and he broke two big pains of glass and he came in and the security guard thank God shot him didn't kill him he's alive\nNow if all of a sudden you're attacking Fox News of course some idiot could jump to conclusions oh this is because of all the hospital things that Democrats are upset about Fox News nobody said that because we didn't know anything about this guy now we do\nWhat do we know about him was he indeed a left wing activist actually know what was he we will get to that in just a moment we'll also get to some of the outrageous stuff that was set on NBC\nOr did that get the same kind of attention here\nThere seems to be just as much damage that was done by that attack as this one namely none\nOr is there media\nManipulation going on with the coverage of this event\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six it seems to me that there is a ... the New York times and their initial coverage of the attack on this Fox News station that was an attack would damage property at least in one guy with a bullet in his chest or\nThey ah said the shooting of a station comes almost four months this was in the New York times the day after the shooting at the station comes almost four months after a man's formed a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland and opened fire with a shotgun the chilling attack killed five people left the world of journalism really\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he has often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ shows burgers at in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was nachos device of but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nOr this we don't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a down\nThat wins Steve school lease was severely wounded and there was an attempt in and so we're Washington officers severely wounded assigned to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated the guy was clear about it\nBut listen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after Steve ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nThey have her comments from Republicans including Congress about face reality rhetoric from the last thing in some ways [laughter]\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by maverick public ... are outrageous than eat the dignity of the job that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nHad their they say such a thing how dare they so this sick individual that's something that the ball\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful but then all of a sudden they sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't want to go into president of the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you heal again I I like to go there another day but since you asked\nHow could they possibly say such as\nOf the way they can have such a thing the way they could say such a thing is big cause that shooter had told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans he had been just active in the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president\nHe was deeply politically active and apparently mumbled to his wife all the time when he saw stuff on TV we know the guy was politically motivated\nSo the only kind of political motivation that can be condemned is if it is from the right well there are other people who say no this couldn't have been from the right this is probably a leftist set up can I say we don't know\nWhen will we find out we'll get to that with your calls coming up\nPathetic the Michael mad vigil\n[noise]\nThirty Wednesday afternoon and thank you for

get a majority of Senate voters not even a majority\nTo vote to actually remove the president from office appreciate your call 'em and I think part of what you're saying\nIs at least it makes a little

had been apparently though this has not been confirmed planted in the same building\nThat houses the San Diego union Tribune the main papers in San Diego but apparently that same building had the office of senator or one of the officers field offices in our come hire us\nSo that potentially could go along\nWith very prominent left wing targets and that would be the first person really who was identify more with the Bernie wing of the party then with the very left mainstream of the party the Bernie weighing being left of left\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six she was the president of the United states speaking earlier today\nAnd if you have something that you find objectionable in what the president had to say give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nSuspicious packages and devices mail to current and former high ranking government officials to safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America [noise] people\nAre applauding and then I Know I Know I Know the monitor on the left if there was somebody a sitting here who is a congressional candidate and there isn't a from the Democratic party what\nThat shows you know we can never political violence but a at his rallies he ah encourage people to beat up some of the protesters\nI think someone with President Trump said at his rallies during the campaign was stupid\nAnd it was a responsible and he shouldn't have said those things but is it necessary for him now to go back there and say gee I'm Sorry I said these comments\nMore than two years ago in the middle of a campaign it's not necessary for him to do that what has happened\nIs he a stomped encouraging violence and then somebody's going to say well the other night he was speaking in Montana\nAnd he congratulated a congressman Greg John forte for having body slammed a reporter uh who um got on his nerves it wasn't even a reporter would have been particularly hostile to Congressman John forte\nLook I think it was a mistake I don't think he should have done that and handed the other side that kind of support but the idea that that is somehow associated\nWith somebody trying to kill people\nAnd whether or not these bombs were very well made up it was an attempt to kill people or at least make people think that they were being threatened with death\nAnd it was outrageous\nAnd look there should be no problem at all\nWith people acknowledge ing President Trump said something very good there\nHe said we should condemn political violence of every time we should condemn scuffles we shouldn't condemn people and by the way it is part of what he very I'm perfectly and very poorly try to do in some of his garbled and messed up response to Charlottesville\nOr when he said there are bad people on both sides what he said it was terrible as he said they're good people on both sides there weren't\nBut there were bad people on both sides and that was accurate and if he can go ahead and consistently now\nCondemn people from groups from the Proud Boys to antifa from the neo Nazis to uh some of the other people on the extreme left\nWho won't allow speech to proceed you know something I was just I just found out about ... and it's it's appalling to me because\nLook I I have\nA certain affection\nFor the physical a Yale University campus I spent close to seven years of my life there and\nRight now the camp has been totally defaced by graffiti and all the graffiti is excerpts from the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford right\nOkay what is the point of that for goodness sake I guess the point is because Brett Kavanaugh went to college and the al ... law school he was also there for seven years so now they have graffiti to remind people I mean\nReally that's pathetic and yes\nPolitical violence and intolerance is pathetic whichever direction that comes from\nAnd I hear you have two members of Congress actually former members of Congress or David Jolly of Florida who by the way is very anti Trump and Steve Israel of above Florida who well surprise is very anti Trump here's how they sounded on MSNBC\nWe're in an era now where violence seems to have a license for the president of United States\nAnd it's not just going to Montana and endorsing bodies slamming and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know are good people there are good people on both sides of a more including neo Nazis remember that the president ... states in the campaign offered to pay the legal bills\nOf his supporters are if they attacked his opponents\nAnd I'll just say one other thing on this it's not even just the president we have a bomb squad and CNN or the CNN building in New York City today yesterday I was walking in New York City and I pass the the building where Fox News is headquartered and the ticker the digital ticker that displays news and the building\nWas reporting on the George Soros a bomb threat and it began with these words for the man who has everything ... that's not funny\nIt is dangerous but and so it's not just a president who gives a license to violence\nBut those who are enabled by that violence they have a responsibility to make sure that we are a racing values of a piece of safety and not pouring gas on the planes were happening too often\nI Can't I'm Sorry how does how does I I don't know what the Fox take her actually said but if it said for the man who has everything 'cause he sure that that was in the context of George Soros I I don't know\nBut equating that with the ... murder that really you you want to show me that ... I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin ...\nYeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard him attacking\nThe lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something and no of course he didn't think lives he\nDoesn't didn't at first of all we don't even know Solomon a mom and men saw him on was actually directly responsible he probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of the election day whatever happens and I hope urgently in earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they applied to George W. Bush Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um\nOr go to I'm John Berman who is an American news anchor and currently the co anchor\nCNN Uday with Alice and come right on CNN he's a regular a relief presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had to say\n\nThat couldn't have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B. R. E. N. A. and I see okay so nobody knows who that package was sent it but if it was sent to John Brennan which is more likely than he's another politician not primarily\nA media figure um meanwhile uh the down is down sharply\nSays technology stocks led the market deeper into the red on week earnings reports from ...

President Trump's response now\nTo a new joint statement from the two leaders and the Democratic party in Congress both of them want to be majority leaders\nI and Thirteen Days from now or when they we have a great big election uh also thirty six governors' on the ballot in that election is so important to be sure you vote\nHere's what Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had to say we listened with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and to protect the American people and that is our first responsibility however they say\nPresident Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condoned acts of violence\n\nTime and again the president is condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words in his actions expressing support for the congressman who body slammed a reporter the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never expressed support for killing a young woman in Charlottesville it's outrageous and it's wrong\nLook he was a ... that's an outrageous charge and they haven't right in their\nExpressed his support for the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never did that expressing his supporters are his supporters at rallies get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy that people\nLook at the the instincts here to\nPlay politics with a direct in serious threat\nWhat would they still be doing that if if one of these bombs going off and people were killed\n\nIt would be it would be even more outrageous\nAnd it is\nA no we we had a caller who um who\nCalled in and Palin she wanted his age should Trump tone down his rhetoric\nYou should certainly avoid anything that can be construed as an endorsement of violence of any kind at the very least between now with the election and probably forever\nAnd yes he can be more careful\nThere is nothing wrong with a ... a president being careful about what he says it's Theodore Roosevelt called the presidency a bully pulpit\nThe asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration\nAnd it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low the only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last years of the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen uh people come here\nIn terms of uh applying for\nAsylum between the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum or turned back\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable and says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence\nA move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband\nYou probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable enough\nUh let us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael ...\nMike I'm yeah I I just find that you know this hardening and an unbelievable ... out the bottom paid for the left side media is lying they don't give you that the whole story they cut things out anything they can do\nTo the ... it's really perpetrating the flawed resigned concerned but I'm ... and the the that the political will have on the left side\nThere that are lower than bottom feeder tactic of marrying President Trump has made a lot of a ... he's he's pretty much kept this war he stayed on target these try but like you said nobody is perfect guy created nobody's perfect\nRight but the point is it don't you I I don't you think would be helpful if folks on our side didn't for instance chant lock her up lock her up um I mean again it's I I think the American people are kind of tired of that and that's OK maybe in the height of a campaign\nBut I don't think it helps our side and it's not a question that there's some kind of great huge moral outrage or this crosses some line that's inscribed in the heavens\nIt's just dumb politics because actually particularly the key deciding\nVoters in a in this coming election are going to be white suburban women and I'm not sure the chance of a lock her up for anybody are going to help gym in Portland, Oregon you're older Michael Mann that show\nI like I was wondering um\nOr how can our\nPolitical community a deep polarized and get back at some of 'em respect for a loyal opposition I I Hope it's not forever lost it doesn't look good goal right now\nI agree with you and a look I\nI think if I'm a ... one of the things that that will be important is particularly if you look at some of the ads that the Democrats are running I mean some of them I've seen in down in Oregon where you have a good chance of electing a Republican governor and um and and here in in my state\nThe ads are so hateful\nThe most important thing is not to reward hateful this\nDon't rewarded for you'll get more of it\nAnd when people say well you have to vote democratic to put some kind of check on President Trump selection isn't about President Trump it's about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Trump status is not going to change is going to continue as president the question is do those guys\nDeserve a promotion to be put in charge of the U.S Congress and the answer is overwhelmingly and obviously no no no we'll be right back\n[noise] they have to work for three years

you're on the Michael ... show\nThey chose a a prude caricature of President Trump\nWith an open now and in the middle of his mouth is a pipe bomb like the photographs of the pipe bomb that\nThey you know and I don't even want to posted its its ugly and it's disgusting and are\nThey are reporting the Jim Carrey is pending at least part of the blame for multiple explosive devices targeting Democrats and CNN on President Trump's he's not being\nPart of the blame blame of putting all of the blame it shows Obama emerging from Trump's mouth Trump spoken the bomb came into existence God's spoken light in\nThe world came into existence so why not Trump ... create a pipe bomb in his mouth in any event uh he um ... the pipe bombs of course this this morning\nWe're targeting and by the way there is not it is not true it is fake news that there was a pipe bomb targeting CNN\nThere was a pipe bomb targeting John Brennan now yesterday misspelled his name they spell the B. R. E. N. A. and or just one and a two and but they addressed it to them care of CNN he also does by the way commentary on MSNBC he um\nHe he actually plays both sides of the aisle on that one both so balanced CNN and MSNBC in other words but MSNBC did not get a John Brennan package CNN did\nBut all of these packages seemed to be very directly and personally addressed two\nProminent figures on the American left ... Hillary Clinton\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder congresswoman Maxine Waters and yes I'm also Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz now\nYou may have heard on this show and it's I Know it can be a little bit confusing that the return address on these packages on all of them apparently was Debbie Wasserman Schultz no one believes that she's the one who sent these bombs [laughter]\nUsually if you send a bomb you don't put your real address on it I mean and I know Debbie Wasserman Schultz has an idiot she is but uh no she didn't do this I don't I don't think anyone is suspecting that congresswoman Wasserman Schultz did this\nWhat obviously was going on here is that this was the warped sense of humor of the evil and warped individual whoever it is who did this who figured oh great if they don't deliver this package and they return it then I'll get bad Debbie Wasserman Schultz and in trouble if even if I don't blow her I was a bomb that I sent her way\nUm look all of this is is serious enough and I'm OK Debbie Wasserman Schultz today condemned the packages sent this week with her return and trash\nChef saying she is deeply disturbed that her name was attached to I I can imagine that I can sympathize with that package that apparently can turning\nCan tainting explosives were sent on Wednesday the high level democratic leaders including former President Obama former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with Wasserman Schultz has office name as the return address\n\nOne of those packages addressed former attorney general Eric Holder was returned\nTo Wasserman Schultz has office because it was sent the wrong address\nTwo of her Florida offices were evacuated in response she confirmed understatement\nThe one time Democratic National committee chair she's been replaced by the indescribable fulltime Paris\nOr she says in her statement we will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence the polling attack on our democracy must be vigorously prosecuted and I am\nDeeply disturbed by the way my name was used okay I think it it makes it fairly clear that um there are a lot of suspects on this and\nI Hope that by the time we're on the air tomorrow they will have identified a suspect they certainly should they should move as quickly and decisively as I possibly can but to me and while there's all sorts of craziness Stacey Abrams is running for governor\nOf Georgia and\nThey're a series of issues that have arrested\nOf them not that serious one of them it seems to me very serious and one of them as it seems to me is very very serious someone that wasn't that serious\nIs that on the former flag of the state of Georgia she engage while she was in college in a protest or in which the state flag non the American flag the state flag was burned by cause it had the old ...\nThere were a battle flag in the flag they changed the state flag she has never been involved with burning of their flags since then okay let that one go for a moment much more serious\nShe has called for doing a Taliban on Stone Mountain which is a huge and and beautiful mountain in city park where it would cost literally hundreds of millions of dollars and it would be unsightly and destructive\nTo erase the work of art that was put up there in Nineteen thirty one is when they finished it they started putting it up and Nineteen fourteen and say three acres three acres of carved stone\nAnd she wants to blow it up\nI think it's perfectly appropriate if they put signage they're all around and saying that this image of Jefferson Davis and Robert de Leon Stonewall Jackson commemorates the cause that we do not on our support and I think it's been very clear that the government in Georgia the government of the whole United States\nHas rejected the whole idea of the confederacy and the white\nSupremacy that the confederacy was based upon very proudly very directly that's fine\nBut this idea there and they're even black leaders who have spoken out against Stacey Abrams radical position about basically blowing up and Dinah mining Stone Mountain it's a Taliban position and it stinks\nAnd even worse was what she said last night now look\nI understand the Democrats are trying to capitalize on this health care issue but you think the way to capitalize on the health care issue is to trash the entire free market\nSystem here is what Stacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia had to say last\nNight [laughter] higher here you are [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise] you know free market\n[laughter] your heart [laughter]\n[noise] free market [noise] and they were to go [laughter] [noise]\nOkay the whole idea there is no profit and doing the right thing is entirely wrong\nBecause the very essence of the free market system the very essence of capitalism\nIs that you give people what they want and how do you know what they want is what they pay for and the notion that no one can make a profit doing the right thing that has only government that can provide for people\nIs utterly ludicrous and what she is saying\nHere I Hope loses her the election I really really do because what she is a gesture thing is that the free market system that we have to the extent that we even have a free market system any more than we do to a large extent you've done a lot of choice in your medical care\nAnd the idea that that is inappropriate when she says I've never seen the free market um write a prescription and rural Georgia I'll bet there are people in rural Georgia who were ... listening to us right now who have gone in and gotten\nPrescriptions through the free market either because you have health insurance that covers it or because you pay for the prescription yourself\nAnd because it's made available at a local pharmacy now does that local pharmacy make profit by selling your prescription of course they do but you see that's the whole idea of a free market you pay them rather than in slave in them and government forces a matter of slave\nMeant this is the point that I'm Rand makes brilliantly is that basically to get people what you want to do you can either use money\nAnd pay them to do what you want them to do or you can use force that\nThat's basically it I Know of course you can persuade people to do what you want them to do and then you do something for them in return but that's a free market transaction as well\nGovernment transactions are always by their very nature a balanced force and the idea that someone is the Democratic party nominee in the state of Georgia who believes that uh the free market has to be rejected because you can't make a profit doing the right thing for\nGoodness sake look at the hospitals that we have right now most of which was fantastic job the development of drugs that we have there's actually something about the development of the drugs that we have through the free market\nThat is worth considering it involves a a a brand new movie as well we will get to that and your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six so Michael ...\nIt and you know the amount of time you you also think that that two thousand and one was it was not committed by foreign terrorists um\nOh yeah definitely think it was ...\nOkay good orator so so what does our government has to do with that and other with my problem with us with with what you're saying Li is I think\nIt's bigger than what everybody's looking at it as much burgers and in this small character apart bombs is much bigger and more confined the there's more people involved and and what you think\nWell I again if that's the case then I think they definitely uh we'll figure it out I uh I I appreciate your call but I I Hope that people will not begin seeing your neighbors and your associates who may be completely wrong politically and disagree with you\nAs definition really bad people because they disagree with you\nOn this I think\nPresident remember president from gotten all kinds of trouble for saying there would be good people on both sides in Charlottesville well they weren't the people on the Nazi side who's wrong about that but on the side between Democrats and Republicans yes there are good people on both sides\nCan we knowledge that\nLet's go to Greg in Seattle Greg you're on the Michael met that show\nHow's it going go out about that\nYou're from a rhetorical candidate talking about all the free market healthcare right and she said that's a typical regrets on their side I mean really you\nKnow when you talk about the freeway traveling around really what it is if it's the lack of free market be opaque pricing you can't just you know go probably something out one town or another for a better price I'm ...\nAnd ... and ... because their first of all there's so many lawsuits and there's so many regulations in so much government interference\nAnd more than half of every dollar that we spend on health care right now passes through the government\nAnd the government takes it from people and then the government spends it so you're right we are very far from a free market system in any pure sense in a health care I'll let you go go to Heather in Louisville Heather you're on the Michael Mann that show\nA micro get attacked yeah thank you um I didn't see the last caller that came I mentioned that he got it made me an inside job and you ask why would he play you know people's lives on the line I get really know yet that these bonds actually contained that made a bold material or were\nThey vent to at is what what all the media sources are reporting that they were a rudimentary but they were\n... they were awful explosive devices they could have exploded it wasn't ...\nAnd uh again they probably would have done some attention with talcum powder to show somebody just wanted to impact the politics enough to damage people they probably would have said something very different we'll be right back on the ...\nNews\nWeather traffic update\nAll yours the information you need here at a um ten Seventy and if in one oh three three the\nIs with us our news on the theaters in\nWashington President Trump is
