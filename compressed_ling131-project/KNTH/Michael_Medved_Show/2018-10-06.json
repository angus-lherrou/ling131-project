{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "What it really isn't and what it really is that I'd love to get you know really some more insight from you on is is that pro active investing proactive investing being like a pro being proactive rather than reactive the three our trade or you were talking about being able to set these things up ahead of time right\nYou're not sitting in front of your computer waiting it it's all about identifying opportunities before they get their ... but what are some of the things where were you really able to help people's minds shift from that reactive trader that sitting there watching CNBC and waiting for news alert\nInto that proactive trader that can just identify what the institutions are doing and by when they buy and so and they sell\nIt comes out to what I like to say it's not about the news it's about the clues and your professionally trading you're not going to sit there and chase price we teach our students is really important to understand how professional ... I think it comes back to be at a motion versus strategy again and a lot of her students who come in the door\nThey realize that they're there because they want to change something in their life something isn't working through the working too hard they're not spending time with family and so as a result imagined that now we're hearing the twenty first century\nIf you have a laptop and an Internet connection you can trade anywhere you want in the world in fact I had a student her name was June and she kept saying all she wanted it was played golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started talking about how she could pull that off and so\nReally it's really nice about it she can make money training to get herself to Costa Rica\nAnd then what a lot of our students do they actually trade while they're on vacation as long as you're doing it and the timeframe that won't piss somebody else off and do you do that all the time Ryan is the idea that you can be making money anywhere you go and we have a student her name was Hayley\nShe's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce\nAnd when she started to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough and had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you could pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nYeah and I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom nuts that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winners in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] chuckle Everytime I think about it he killed me and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that's one of the things that that does the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection and we've joked about it a few times where he where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I was down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked from ... am to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are from a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve\nYears ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this and it's kind of a fun it's been a fund evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like\nMy grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk up till both ways and the smell you know we had dial up Internet to him now\nJust in the palm of your hand but we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the palm of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you it it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic you\nSay you know and my grandfather taught me that's when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional those confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is a ... class we've got a few tickets left before the show's over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay alright right now I've got to have to add class coming up in your area that have take classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over included with your passes it's gonna be the professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with us from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe

three that data and eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that by hit us up in Houston ... and see if you can scores and passes there\nWere some of the other kind of examples you could share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom splits\nConsistency Ryan most people come in they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit the coach herbal beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now that you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact I'm Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expect to a different outcome this is how most people live their lives they'd rather just\nContinue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and as you said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nYeah I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being the the way you learned it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be well they do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nAnd he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know that's the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the financial markets in one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got now one of the ways that where we start this off one of the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time pass and let's get some people educated haven't changed their lives All right well right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a

Morgan held their freshmen have started Taylor\nBarnes at a quarterback alright first play pass near side and it caught by ... down to the ground at the thirty two yard line as he makes the catch ... seven yard pick up on the first day on\nPlay and that makes like that looked like Raleigh to heart as well John right already there that the other point of this\nYeah All right thanks for a corrective at stake starters at the moment it is kind of Thompson quarterback sixty two hundred and five pounds sophomore second plane lawsuit left side it is in complete the over\nShot his man on the far side of the field dolphin shown shown one of their top receivers I say a super is their top receiver Raleigh tae hotter J. J. mentioned getting started on the coverage\nFor the bears and has a pool and that's a little slot that's the thing I mean that's a hard because while they saw the cover almost\nWhy so that we can't say took a shot because they're right where they want to be ...\nEl Valle thirty second if they took a shot frequently hear [noise] third\nDown three for the Wildcats from authority to hand the ball off\nAnd it's got to be really close tripped up I think they may spot in short of the thirty five yeah he ended up lying on the thirty five yard line but a look at that spot is short of the thirty five\nI wouldn't be surprised they review this John looked like he may have laws that really close\nOf has to be temperament he's a very fundamental way to go see that they go by the way up there are short I'd be surprised this is for [noise]\nLittle more and more this is a runner were show on the line the guy that plays on the further review\nYou call the ... forest down in inches boys just shy of the uh thirty five yard line that still I needed again\nFor a first down a in on this possession first review the game it is brought to you by Barbara Saul shave club grab your premium starter kits for just six Ninety nine today with code football at farmers all dot com game on\nWell they're sort of view that showed it right now I was born he launches and I think he's a call so I think he's a false that lives so it didn't look like his knees were down and it didn't look like from that angle that available here so\nHere are my eyes John and they're getting a little bit older by the day it looks like you feel more than just beyond maybe right on her just beyond that from our bureau alone which would give him that for that I think\nOn review you can see that launch those knees had nearly as elbow haven't hit right oh I think he landed right on the thirty five is what may be overturned so it may very well be a first down for Kansas state's brick thing as well for the defense is you know you can't say no one wants to stop the run all first down Kansas to just\nGo out route they got seven yards so they're right on pace right then they normally one and a half ... yards them to get a first down so\nYou have to guess right on first then you've got a gift for horse down\nYou're going to have to go on you and apply the runner may the wind again it's a purse down to thirty five yard line [noise]\nSo so the big thing is he or she got a got a guess right of course that if they're gonna they're gonna do play action you have to play a lot tighter contest do passes especially if you're going to kick commit bodies to the ruined what you have to do so Barnes on the\nLine and she gets the first down for Kansas State first hand at their own [noise] thirty five yard line new set a downstate are leading three napping snapback passed down the line sewers got it super\nBlasted out of bounds that the thirty eight yard line\nFirst career starts\nFor Baylor today and the Baylor

thirty four orange yard touchdown run earlier now at thirty four yard touchdown run that puts Kansas State back on TALK\nI have to believe that was a that was a busted busted busted a gap interpreted by one of the defense environment to Baylor had a one technique on that side of the five I mean they had some of the center of someone outside the tackle\nIt really normally would you have there is you have a linebacker feeling but it was really no one bears the those those type of\nWhat is right to different demand went outside with the huge gap\nHere's McClellan for the extra point kick is up and good\nAnd with five fifty to play and the second quarter our new score Kansas State fourteen Baylor twelve take a break and be right back you're listening to Baylor big twelve foot ball from

four yard touchdown Ronnie said too long touchdown runs today Barnes eight carries for a hundred fourteen yards here in the first half\nThe gap it's averaging Seventy one per game for its best in the big twelve but he's having a big first nap so far against this Baylor deep and\nYou have you had a you know two runs the rover forty or forty five yards so it really we've seen that a couple of times and then sometimes it would have happened the guys who are fun out of there are out of their gap and when the defense is always good everybody's responsible for gas\nAnd if you don't win your battle or when you're gap or you go somewhere besides with your dad is a big place can happen in you know we've seen it twice a day or so hopefully here now trailing by two\nOh here with five fifty to go and a half as well as they play they gained Kansas State two hundred dollars to one fifty by both teams have turned up all over once a week has been in it in the red zone and miss if you go you just don't want to go and have down there that's something that could be the waiting for young people are\nStill plenty of time here five fifty on the clock as case that gets set to kick it off\nYou mean the numbers on that Charlie brewer a streak you throw in a hundred sixty five passes without an interception for that one just picked off by\nThird longest is Josh ... ah tai Kwan Thornton back the [noise]\nLeagues is going to take it if the goal line that are\nThe far side he is a ... yard line [noise]\nOf those in hindsight would have been better than the fair catch so here are the numbers a hundred and\nIts force against they offer it to the third law they brought pressure that right here you gotta figure we moved the ball really well it's a minute thirty four we ought to get a chance at some points and the big thing was that sect John that's a minus celebrity all\nBeen allowed to Eighteen in five games coming in now three years the first half by\nAnd the interesting part of that is they've got their entire starting off into line back from last year yeah sixty five star hotel that often so blind all sixty five are backing from last season\nThere and that's and that's and that's\nI mean that that goes without saying I Would expect that we've seen it I think a couple of times on the road they predict greatest increases\nThe overall you know I mean Baylor\nHad the chance here now they're going to have up if they can get a decent return [noise]\nHere's the pond away nice high pie Trevor white\nFeels it on a bounce cities down\nI think he ever called or fear catch there while he did call it but it didn't catch it\nOkay so we called her cat and mouse upon you did recover it and the bears will have it at their own twenty six yard line with a minute twenty four to play in the hands\nThere and that's and that and that's plenty of time when you have to time out\nI Believe I was to tell you they have to time out so so when you have a minute twenty four to time out even though your baggage or twenty six you you've moved the ball well you're going to spread about here's a two by two said now which always going to do is you know is it I Want to throw the ball on time\nI Want to get it out of my hands and I want to keep the boy he's moving\nTo yard by Kansas State\nIt's down inside the twenty five yard line you're pretty good oh Charlie ended up with the recovery Ricky\nWas withdrawn about Charlie that more bounce back who grabbed it was one on water\nAll that he was looked in the wrong before he won't eat them all out\nOf hand of all their lives on the left side bounces out\nThe right side he's out of bounds\nShorten the re our game\nThree are gained twenty seven\nYears now a third down and nine with fifty four seconds to play and a half the kids that can be a\nTough team to play again specially if they started dropping coverage because they are safe team they force you to throw the ball in a little bit of noise I'm going to call it where they have body you have body so so Charlie has to be comfortable just sitting back there for a minute and feeling and moving in the pocket versus looking the ruins here this is the third day [noise]\nHere's the play third down and ate Abner up to me I don't have some room thirty five out to the thirty eight yard line and he's got a first down\nThere now you want to move now it's forty tries to be smarter now you got the first day on your three time out it's forty seven and county\nVersus down to the thirty seven yard line is where they spawn equipped snap\nRaindrops began to fall brewer passes field taught across the forty five and downright they're sort of the line of scrimmage Marcus Jones on the receiving end and\nRules going to use one of his two remaining Don outs right here\n\nOn out bears they've got one left there's twenty nine\nSales on the ... second time out of the house who is set to go out to thirty three seconds thirty three\nYear you don't want to you don't want to go and a half with time outs unless there's just one of those things where\nWhen you're just happy to be where you are\nOh that was you know they call it New York show\nTo the states got to go you have to in the pocket so\nWhere do you want to be more probably for him move this ball to the third\nAbout twenty four your shorter the thirty year old and that's the key is you thirty [noise]\nThat would give you about a forty seven yard field goal was to\nBuild probably comfortable with so\nDo it but you have to preserve these thirty three seconds and you have to use the smart and try to save at\nThat time out until you're ready to kick\nPonchos are coming out fans and the Sundance rain\nBeginning here again right here we go sit down and one\nLike pushing them out of bounds on the far side of the field that is a great show a balance\nThere taking is but the biggest voting\nBut one of the good things here that just half that I'm not saying it as good but it goes Kansas eight players down now\nSo maybe it was going to have to get them out of balance I mean actually stopped\nFor progress so well the Kansas State player being down there you can go ahead and call the play and be ready to run another one without burning your final time\nOut and that that's a good thing so\nThat's just a strong run by after Evers Ricky I'm not sure what you're saying but he just\nDoing a good job making either the first got miss or not but that got tackled him and he's still a great balance\nOr ... years and I tell you what it was more important than anything he was probably ten yards from their out of bounds line ran hard and got out of bounds and stop the clock and save the time out that's a huge run not only the game but stopping the clock\nJonathan Durham the a defensive back for Kansas State as a player slowed the twelve bears that\nDo have one time out remaining they are driving looking for a points to take the lead going in and half\nThey have driven to the Kansas State thirty seven yard line where it is first down at ten for their rain getting ever closer to McLean stay trying to\nGet the half time and yeah the right now Bayh was probably John I Would say about seven yards from a\nA reasonable bill go to\n... year they're going to they're going to want the clock I think they did stop and momentum but they should be ready to snap it as soon as this whistle blows\nRight here we go from the thirty seven now back\nDown it's incomplete\nRunning toward the end zone was Chris plant the intended receiver and he let him just a little bit too much so it's second Dan and Dan now fourteen seconds to play in the house\nYou know this realistically you have probably Mm I Would say\nYou have to play that would be too quick hitters ever time out but that was the
