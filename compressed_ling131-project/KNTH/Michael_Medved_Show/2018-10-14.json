I got a book like that and certainly a test so that I use because I saw my father doing everyone I Know\nThere's something about drawing I also I went to art school by the way and I love the draw I did not go so much towards the buildings but I used to like torture and I think that that's absolutely fascinated about life in the Mr McCain by the way speaking a creative outlet you do some of these things are you a musician by the way\nYou know I'm an actor I spent many years I said is and you know and that's also why am I on break during that bring the tourist ally treat every single tore I get like a performance you know I take it seriously and we make sure that we're offering a quality performance to the audience that they're entertain educated the same time that's exactly what we've been doing\nSo I I enjoy connecting with different groups and they encourage everyone to learn more at a youth ministry bus stop or or Mr Lincoln you dot com\nAnd the impact the other when we were on the tour yesterday there are big places in Houston that our historic and have a tremendous history but there's also little nooks and crannies again what listeners Mr McKinney knows where they are\nA lot of fun stuff too I mean we're on a new thing coming out too by the way which is a really cool program I and there is a few involved with that as one of the opposite only charge people but that does go to help keep the buck maintain you know I never knew about\nHow much work into being and the buses and never wanted to be on the buses and still not by the false others things always break down and that sort of people want to support the boss or support classroom they can go to Houston history bought stock or does it go up on me making a tribute to the the work that we deal with kids\nAnd speaking of keeping the bus in order keeping our resources in our bodies in mind industry now that even markets you're not playing professional football right now but you're in shape let's stop people from your perspective the importance of staying physically and mentally fit in at some of the things that you do\nI'm outside I play hand in hand like they're like if you take care of your body to take care of your mind is clarity you know stuff like\nThat if you don't work out a lot at least have a good guy you know so ah just stand on top of your body and it helps it goes a long way\nFrom a physical work out what kinds of things are you doing you're doing pushups\nTo push ups the pull ups every day man I'm like oh can you do I can do one time I think the most I it was around thirty so\nOK I'm Still working on line I don't know why not [laughter] that shape but I I'm trying to do that wanted somehow if you don't keep up with the poll up and you let that slide you know later in life it's not that easy to do one or two I'm just saying oh\n...

in eating as many whole foods as possible like you run out of you know just to check in right so\nHow 'bout you mark is when you're this far as to what things do you stay away from it than anything\n[noise] a lot of those sort of a man I really I Would love to say I stay away from but brownies I'm a week or\nAs an old\nMan recession you or do you have done is wrong well hello hello hello everybody well designed to money matters can re but of course I Am your host can ... this is the show we talked about everything and anything in the world of retirement planning we talk about a state\nTaxes we talk about Social Security the stock market investments you name it we talk about it and we try to have more fun than a human being should be allowed to have one talking about all of this boring financial stuff and this week is going to be no exception because we have an absolutely fantastic show lined up for you\nBut before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am ... write the host of money matters with Ken Monterey\n[noise] Becky\nJak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAnd all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the berries same ideas we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we uh specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon\nAnd so we not work with over a thousand four hundred wonderful beautiful families\nAnd I recently barons named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors\nAnd actually now for the seven year in a row my goodness but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I get that one to them we have a great show lined up for you we're going to talk about uh of course the\nEight hundred pound gorilla in the room right be a big drop in the market that we saw on Wednesday and Thursday\nAnd boy did that illustrate how quickly the market can change its mind how quickly it can turn and how far it can fall in very short order\nAnd there are lessons to be learned about that and in fact\nYou know I was talking to a relatively new client\nAnd they were asking me how does how does this feel right now versus two thousand seven you know before the big drop that came in two thousand and eight and as you guys know we we told everyone listening to the show and our clients everybody in November of oh seven\nOr to sell to get out of the stock market and so he was asking me is this different now than it was back then and that and I thought you know what that's actually a great question to talk about on the radio show so I'm going to answer his question too with you is this two thousand and they all over again there's little marine colonel scare [noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or at least for me that he said he said man who's not afraid\nHe's a fool [laughter] okay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also um as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired retiring soon\nUh most of our clients are over fifty and so we talked about a risk that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement to look like\nAt the same time do to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the risk that could take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about where we were on a series of the Eighteen risks faced in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan to head for that and unfortunately it is something you need to plan for now speaking of planning for stuff\nOne of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're going to talk about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd uh we may not be able to get through all the questions that have lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that uh you know we work as I said with people who are retired retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life building your investments your your net worth\nIs job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stuff and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... and just say out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\n[noise] so this week I Want to talk given the drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself overtime time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of them and say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is a part of the show is ... where we talked about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten ... so we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly\nGive a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening talking about you I'm\nI mentioned last week that we have a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive being thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me you know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a ... right there she just squats in peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email we have the best\nI Can't tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura [noise] uh she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows the ... right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone number as you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time to sweet but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK anyway let's talk about in this house and it ate all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to um you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October issue and all that and at that\nTime you know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but there were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly\nWhat happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally a sell off a cliff\nSo is this like that I'm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength\nUnemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWell basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raise interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up\nIf interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars companies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week at the beginning of the new bear market recession all that kind of stuff but you know what it does do\nIn my view it should be a wakeup call to you\nBecause did you did you see how fast it fell\nI mean it was like what eleven hundred points in two days I mean that's fast the market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly\nI mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did in Y. two K. or ... and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold it is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and you are contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you that there's no doubt so here's what I recommend\nAnyway now that's a risk number six and I hope that helps you know again we have all the risks are the first five us a risk to end this one uh posted on our website so you can go find them if you'd like to read them or listen to the podcast\nBut ... one thing I'd like to do is to invite you to come and visit with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be a knowledgeable friendly um and and competent and they uh they want to help you with your retirement planning All right so we want to talk with you about the important decisions that you need to make\nIf you come in and visit we also want to develop for your cash flow of analysis and that I think is the most important thing that you do when it comes to retirement is is a cash flow analysis\nAnd what I mean by that is you want to look at the sources of income you're going to have the expense is you're going to have\nAnd do you have the money to support the difference and uh that analysis unfortunately I think a lot of people don't do but it's a starting point for us okay we want to know that you have the cash flow to cover your cost of living if you don't then we want to talk about well how do we get there what are the things we need to do to do that\nSo that takes into account Social Security or foreign one K.

planner professional now for the last\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we not work with over eight thousand\nFour hundred families are in in forty three states and you know what it never ceases to our and me and in and and actually it it gives me enthusiasm it makes me want to go to work everyday\nAnd do my best because that you know it's such a wonderful thing and Financial Times named ... our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and that's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning is our primary focus\nAnd us a statue we'd love to help you if we could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are\nProbably the most important a decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed anytime between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you do leg claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll tell you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same\nTotal amount okay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take your sixty two [noise] the problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy so you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so\nSo in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be so the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity and by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefits because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nAnd

will deal with during your retirement which is a inflation and taxes or income taxes and of course bear markets we also talked about uh do you have what we call your magic number will help you to calculate do you have enough money to retire on\nOkay that's a big question we'll also talk about five strategies that you can use to reduce drinking taxes when you retire we'll talk about how to maximize your cash flow okay so when you are retired is in my opinion it's all about cash flow you gotta make sure you have the cash coming in to cover the lifestyle that you want\nAnd you know we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nOkay that means you got to go play and have fun and you got to have the money to pay for all that stuff so we want to help you to figure that out we also talked about your four oh one K. and when should you take Social Security sixty two sixty six Seventy\nAnd and how do you plan for the next market crash what about that you

Penn seven easy answer I\nWant to be a million\n[noise] I've flashy flunk use every\nLast one who runs the father\nCountry is they are ...\nThan we are wallowing in champagne this is money matters with Kendall right but of course I Am your host ...\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states do infinity on beyond yes indeed\nAnd I you know we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so our focus is on retirement planning and we would love to work with you if you are so if you're in that demo as they say\nAnd uh so recently barons named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors actually now for the seven year in a row\nAnd I'm very proud of that designation but without our clients that would be no where at all so all your clients listening right now thank you so much\nA if you're not a client I encourage you to go to our website that has money matters dot net money matters dot net you can learn more about us we have podcasts of this show you can go back to listen to a we have articles on retirement planning topics we have videos on the same so we have all kinds of stuff on there that I think you can benefit from\nUm this is the part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your\nLabor and we do this because money isn't everything but it sure keep the kids in touch does it not right on the roof sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts ladies and gentleman\nYou don't want to see unhappy squirts that's not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirts anyway this is the time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it ... can you play it\nI Know I\n\n\nMy dog and may be and\n\nAnd of course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it actually designed to do the exact opposite we don't want that to happen to you so therefore\nEvery week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy on washed undeserving airs breath to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes during that entire time so [laughter] wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty dress basically\nIsn't it its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create it during your lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will upon your dad they read the will and it says create the trust that can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it will be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and estate taxes why well because for example let's say that the you know your your daughter gets divorced\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trust and heritage that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child or not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the in the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generation skipping tax stress because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money has trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education\nMaintenance and support hams H. E. N. S. and you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind do they're greedy and watch the undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest if they are real estate or something like that\nSo talk to you or a financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if\nAnyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to one of our financial

tessie okay and we're talking savings and investment in your retirement is always hear on the max out saving show our show is about savings investments in your retirement tied to just take my Astros hat off so I could the headphones to\nBetter a ... if we are out on our show it was all about a building up ...\nUnderstanding the markets understanding of the world today and understand where we're going our model in our philosophy\nIs to save aggressively invest conservatively that's the key to building up wealth over the long term to save aggressively at a desk conservatively and\n... it's we ... you know we talk about the markets we talked about savings in the importance of of of building up of wealth and in one of the ways to do that is not losing money which was\nA a task\nEasier said than done this week uh for a lot of people in the markets in it you know there's certainly realizing that there's risk in the markets and and it it it's been a big shock\nTo everybody involved or ... what happened\nIf you've been listening to the max out saving she'll we've been warning you we've had a very expensive market we have a a very overvalued market and on the show last week we actually said we sure did you know or that she had John for our clients last week this first time we done that and about a year\nAh it it really we we just said we we were talking we've been talking about about the NASDAQ Lee we said look at our of our two reports or do we said the NASDAQ say accounting for Ninety eight percent of the S. and P. five hundred not the NASDAQ but five stocks the fang stocks plus uh Microsoft\nUh it was Ninety eight percent of the total S. and P. five hundred that's that was a warning sign we said you\nStay away from the NASDAQ sector in ... you want to be careful with the market overall and uh you\nKnow we we we pointed out the interest rates were going up and and sure enough it was a time precaution and sure enough uh we've had just a lot of problems with this is a live show you can call us up at seven one three three three nine ten Seventy or you call pillow\nOut for yes\nThe bank you start paying interest on [noise]\n[noise] you know that's a great question now for [noise] okay [noise] two years ago we had the lowest interest rates in the history of the United states and so rates were we're not paying very much now\n... the fed funds rate at that time was about point point one three percent and and now it's up to about two to two and a quarter percent which means they're starting to pay more\nIf you're banks not paying interest I Would look at some people uh we use TV America trade holder assets you can purchase a of a money market fund\nTheir uh their money market fund that you have to make sure a lot of the money markets some of the money market funds aren't paying anything she got a check your money find define what it is\nUsually getting at least one point six percent on money fund or more right now are close to it\nAh overall how you can do a little better out for the other thing you can do what you can go down to your bank and ask ask how much a one in two years C D pays\nIt in in that that that could give you a little bit more funds that way or the problem with the banks is a lot of the banks are paying you virtually zero on your checking in savings accounts or they're just sitting there\n... and so uh the the difference\nBetween zero and two percent is a pretty big big amount of money in so I Would first of all I Would talk to the bank I Would say you're concerned about it what can you do I would look at CDs on that a check with a couple of other banks to see if they have better CD rates is well you can take money from one bank to another\nAlso you can talk to a a you could go to like a a a TD mirror trade a Charles Schwab it in and just say you would like to ask them what their different money market funds are paying and look at those those are short term a ... that says that help\nThan just go up [noise]\nYeah it's going up almost everything in ... which which either your CDs to your loans your to your car loan is off priced off of the treasury rate in the treasury rates have gone up the benchmark for the short term rates is either the\nThe three month treasury bills or the or the fed funds rate it and so those are really been going up I mean a ... they probably up close to a a one whole point in the last year so uh yeah so rates are starting to go up\nTo like live or what you get there\nGet should yes it should your rate should be going up\n\nYou know what other quick thing out for the government did some work on money market funds over all\nEnd up so you want to make some of the money funds are much more conservative but they're very short term and they're not paying to check with them you want to basically have a short term or medium term money market fund or a CD is what you're looking for price with a couple of banks see what your bank is going to offer and then make a decision\n\nYet but I think you just have to ask them questions out for in ... you should be able to get a better rate\nIs don't\nYa ya I ask what the CD Rachel ... emphasize this is your concerns of money you don't want to take a lot of risk\n\nThanks for great question a really great ... that's one of the things that's going on out there is is a you know I I was talking to one of our\nClients the other day and it and he had some money elsewhere and I said look check here's checking to make sure you're getting paid a decent amount on those money markets a because there's different types of money markets in somewhat particularly at the banks they're paying you the zero on your money and so you can just go to a\nAh we're in the I think the federal treasury money market right and I think we're getting about one point six something\nIt's going up here recently so I don't have the exact number\nThat's a lot more than if you took the bank getting zero in so interest rates are moving up we had the highest interest rate in in in seven years in the ... and the ten year or\nLast week a early this week and last week when a rates where it a\nThree point two five so doing a little work you can pick up some extra money if your money is at the bank and they're not paying anything check with another bank and ask them what the CD rates are and ask them what you can do to get it up you know you don't want to get caught where they convinced you to try to buy a new a tea or something but\nJust there there's ways that they can boost boost up your returns but you got to ask questions at the bank\nSo ask questions that's one of the key things what can I Do to get a better rate if you got any questions or comments\nSeven one three three three nine ten Seventy here on the max out saving show\nOr what ... what a week in the markets are ... you're looking at some of these returns it ... it's pretty remarkable a number of the the the indexes were down over five percent ... down ... percent on the average ... if you look at him in a\n... he was down four point one percent or the nest at a at the Dow was down for point or two percent or the NASDAQ was down ... only three point seven eight percent you say a hothead well you said that was going to go down more well it went down the week before in in the NASDAQ in the in the ass and be\nHeld up in it and so looking at the bottom ... uh you know really so far the uh uh uh this decline that the the the Dow was near the bottom I ... I think it was about seven point two percent that\nThe that that was down seven point atheists and he was down seven point to the uh uh\nThe Canasta composites fallen ten percent in the last about ten days so ... and this is this is really what uh what we've been talking about what these markets is is is just a tremendous amount of risk\nA you know you're pretty much back to where the market at one time a Thursday and yesterday was trading back where it was in July in in May of this year so you know you you gave up\nOne two three four four or five months of returns in basically two\nDays ... and this is this is a danger in these markets you get really expensive markets\nYou know we talked a lot on the on the on the ... saving show about the the price of the uh the PE ratio the price to to sales record high levels we looked at the price of the uh we we looked at the price a\nPrice to cash flow numbers the Schiller PE ratio is it that you know in their last report we said it's a Ninety five percent a price to sales you know there's a number of indicators that the the market's really is that it hasn't been this expensive since Nineteen twenty nine in Nineteen Ninety or last ... saved his report which\nWe ... we sent out here we are going to rewriting the other one that new one now we talked about the uh the the Goldman Sachs ... beer risk indicators flashing uh sell signal a and and we sat there and broke it down and we pointed out that\nThe biggest indicator on that thing was actually ... the the the devaluation was extremely high on that indicator and inflation was growing up in the number was going to go even higher\nIt should just point out the tremendous risk been warning about this market\nI Am Sam alone you know me as the host of the morning show right here on AM ten Seventy the answer but I'm also the owner of Houston cutting edge\nMedia is called ... new media by twelve new media we agree amazing videos to companies use on their website selling their serene fold sellers with exciting animation ground set fire to a new ...

Brecht city in Europe you've got the Italians threatening to leave and they get ... in a big problem there you you've got a ... if you look at South America there's ... birds\nThen is a whale is collapsing Argentina's in his financial problems Brazil's got a new president coming up\nNext debt that they have ... their markets and sold off and then if you look at it and it just a huge problems with Iran and Saudi Arabia in Syria and Israel in the middle east in it's a real concern in the turkeys markets have collapsed all over the world in ... really the biggest one is really China I\nYou know we've been talking about China a ... Jamie diamond made to which he was impressed with\nWith by the way I went to look the point backup I heard him on a Bloomberg Radio in the mornings or driving in and and uh\nThey vanish they ... they just gave but what Jamie diamond said he was very impressed with ... they're negotiating tactic of of getting getting a deal with the ... with the Canadians and the Mexicans in and going over\nTo to the Europeans dean going over to China he thought that was very good strategy was very impressed that a lot of positive things this goes back to what we've been saying for a month or two that look\nUnderneath it you've been hearing about a trade skirmish ... per year we've been seeing it's much worse than the last couple of months would say look\nThe establishment now realizes the threat with to China and they're coming on board this is a tough policy it is a hot trade war and it's going to be problems and that's what we're seeing so a lot of things are happening a lot of negatives are starting to hit the market and this is one that we ... we get some calls stacking up let's take a call from Oscar who Oscar\nYour thoughts that you know or what Charles fair but you know this is it for free hike or another that from people yet the burden and people don't realize how much of it that it really is\n... I mean I think I don't even think uh the the inflation numbers take into account interest rates or ... and I I I I for one belief rising interest rates has actually inflationary and there's\nNot a lot of or the property taxes are inflationary too and so I I that's the way I Believe it or something like that but\nAnd then you're talking about what's happening all over the world with with countries you know that we're we're there you know there are no there isn't a drain on the [noise] the thing is that there is no there's no there's no control over the world ... dollars\nThat's why the fed is starting to drain so now we did he put to mention the world and people borrowed too much money there's massive debt in the United states but honestly if we don't look back on the ... look at the emerging markets there complete mess isn't so\nGood at it like Brazil or any of these countries they don't have no dollars to pay back what they already oh and nobody's going to invest any more than a broken country that'd\nBe soup yeah I mean right now we're kind of the best house in which they're trying to be a a bad neighborhood let me ask\nMy real question and all of this the Italy is on TV I watch and they say\nWell this gets another typical you know four or five percent blip you know this this downturn and I'm thinking what are they talking about they they think this is a very you know it's just the four or five percent drop or for the most\nAnd I'm thinking whoa wait a minute a different world than than than a year two three years ago in\n... they say they don't think this is nothing what's going on right now and and that to me it it ... I don't think it's I think there's more to it than what they're saying\nNo I I think so I look I mean the question is how does this play out or is it look good and I think\nAll of this turmoil is a ... I think it won't sell until after the election because ... is the Democrats take the house okay you dating you know Trump with his agenda\nAnd they're going to cut into Trump's power and I think that I ... I think that marks another like if the them steak or take the house\nNow we've got we've got three weeks for people to get worried and you know I'm hearing you know had one of the top a pawn shops in the in the uh country combined talked to me and they were like hey we think\nSome of the people they had thought sixty five percent chance of Democrats when she got three weeks of complete turmoil year I you know I think you got to really have a risk management plan in place for your ass you ended up here in Burma at least for next\nMonth until the elections are over so\nOkay thanks I mean that's a good point to it let's take another call from Randy hello Randy\nHave pretty good here the\nYou know you were talking about ... goes down\nYou know ... you know and and I was kind of looking at liquidity and and the spread of stocks and things like that and I remember\nI think we're talking about it's about ten years ago when that when there was no ... we had damn chance Fifteen twenty twenty five ... brat yes down and nobody wanted start I'm not saying that now so much\nSo I got to bury about there's a sense to me that the the the big boys the big bang convention people you know or\nOr start selling and I try to scare the little girl like me you know and the panic selling and then like American food things up so I'm not counting the way I feel about this like you said the economy seems to be fairly stable\nAnd uh uh and they do have growth in the economy the way I think we've gone over extended over a little bit but I don't know if there's any reason not to necessarily butter there\nWell I tell you a couple of thought first of all this French you don't see I tell you where you see it where I see it okay you're not going to see this spreads where I see the spreads as we call in\nTo our traders TD America trade\nIn in ... and they've got computer programs like head we can get this thing done uh go in at the market I think you're probably looking at a seven percent or seven center of five seeing her three sent knew that they are ... up or down to painting were buying or selling\nIt no spreads that the computer programs are telling them to get around that are are starting to really wide enough in here uh so so you don't see the spreads when you pull up your little account or not your little account but when you look on the the regular system you're not really see with the you're seeing you\nKnow a thousand to buy or whatever when we're ... we're getting is computer programs behind the scenes telling us what those real spreads are to get size out which you know we're buying or selling something we tend to be substantial and so we're not\nThat substantial ... compared to a a you know American Funds or something but you know uh so we we have to deal with that to your question look ready this is really the first big decline I went back and look at this markets had a pretty good run since about February of two thousand\n... ...\n... that I did notice and and the last big fall off or we just heard was back in February [noise]\nOkay if the average the two year if you look at the line average close to zero do a good chunk of that time frame and now it's up while over two percent\nSo uh it's that's competition for stock so you can ... their unlike any time in the last ten years you cannot put money in cash and get paid a decent amount of return while you wait around and continue to make money\nOr appreciated by you know I get all our star search\nOkay thanks Jerry you're ... you don't want limited everything but you know I think it would look at we looked at a lotta thanks for the call Jerry or to get any questions or comments seven when three three three Nineteen Seventy we ... we looked at I've been looking at this market uh we got defensive\nA real defensive about a week ago and we're already pretty defensive but we put the Hedges on in\nIn ah the\nI what I'm looking at the church you know I'm looking at the Dow and tell you what I'm seeing what look in the S. and P. here and I'm looking at this in worse right here when I see is we've talked some about the\nThe moving average if we don't do huge we're not we don't really invest based on technical we're best on fundamentals in value but when we are trying to understand the market we like tons of like we look we kind of kick over the I'm looking at a market that literally\nWent from the fifty day moving out above the fifty day moving average to be under the two hundred a moving average in\nTwo days that's extraordinary that's a huge drop in and then at rallies above it and one of the interesting things uh one of the things we're kind of struggling to understand is\nIs is that the indexes\nAre ... under the hundred to two hundred a moving amateurs who's not real if you're underneath the two hundred a moving average with the NASDAQ is that's not good and it's really bad in but\nIt should have rallied above it\nThe the index\nFunds a cute cute cute ESP wire above the two hundred a moving average it I I don't know I don't know if if if that means that the buying came in on the SP why into cute cute cues from retail\nOr\nIf it's sort of being kind of held up a little bit to not triggered the ... more self signals coming off of these these different programs and I don't know the answer to that but but what what I Am seeing is is I is what I appears to be breakdowns for the bull market that this going from two thousand sixteen\nUh up to this level it and to me that I don't think this is over with a I I think you've got to be cautious and really understand the risk and you have to have a risk management program in place for your for your retirement ... it just\n... everything is sort of going against the market to tide is kind of coming out right now and ah\nAnd ah the ... and it it's not just interest rates but it's it's the\nThe China said there was a story this week actually it was a story but a vice president Pence had a very important speech a vice president Pence said that Clinton George W. Bush and Obama fundamentally misunderstood the Chinese Chinese challenge the China challenge\n... and he said he said they basically\nAssumed that they would become a strategic partner\nOver the last twenty five years or so instead what what is what instead what they are is a strategic competitor uh\nIn in ... and that's or strategic adversary I mean this is a I think the quote was actually strategic competitor I've got both there but uh that's a big difference between a strategic partner strategic competitor ... and he said well we kind of hope was we'd have China would be more toward a free market\nDemocracy rule of law and human rights and they all become part of the big global trading world ... and if you look what's happened since president Xi is come in\nIt it it you know the free market but the government's clamping down more and more on it they're installing communist officials on the boards of these companies if you look at the democracy or you know there's ... there's only the Communist Party if you're not telling the line you're out\nOr if you look at the rule of law there there there are there and they're arresting people for corruption and people are disappearing and\nAnd uh they're stealing technology or they're not I mean it it just it ... they don't seem to be paying any type of rule of law and they're ... they're closing down churches and in putting in camps and different things like that and\nIn ... it's really kind of go into a hard line Chinese or the hard line communist\nPlace it's going to compete against us and that's so we fundamentally misinterpreted what was happening in China and this is a big deal for the vice president of the United states who say they were there not that different paths west\nPast three president said we thought they basically he said they thought they were basically be strategic a\nPartner instead they've turned into a strategic competitor into this makes it very tough to solve China's problems and so all of this stuff is adding up and piling in about a good thing is we can bring those factories back it's good for the United states but\nBack to your four one K. playing you know\nHe now is it time to sort of be cautious in his we've talked about we've actually had some are phenomenal caused by the way this is the last segment so if you want to get in here uh seven one three three three nine ten Seventy seven when three three three nine ten Seventy or\nWe'll get your questions answered the if you if you look at this\nEverything is sort of what the quantitative easing is ending that pushed up asset prices are interest rates are going up all keep in mind which one of the biggest drivers for stock prices has been corporate stock buyback programs but their debt levels have gone up over the last five years\nQuite a bit in ... and so now the cost of the borrowing money to buy to buy back stock\nIs is is is starting to eat into profits in so they're gonna have to slow down the stock buying so so that's another thing that's so that's another kind of thing hitting the market and if you look at higher interest rates were someone goes well look I can go get\nTwo two and a half percent or something like that on on a short term treasury or you know why that why do I need this again more pressure on the markets in all of the stuff is building up but what's happening with corporate America right now right now we have a China trade were all these\nThe bedrock of corporate policy in the last decade was look I can go close my factories down in the United states I can shift them overseas to Mexico or particularly to China\nThey'll go build the products over there I'll save money I can lead to all my workers in my profit margins go up it's a great deal and then the stock price goes up and I get my bonus\nIn in into what's happened is all of a sudden we don't know what's gonna happen in China if you're sitting there with your supply chains are coming out of China if ...\nIf this thing really blows up or something really bad happens those supply chains could be flat out shut down and you're out of business which means you're having to look and maybe maybe not pull everything out of China but you've got to have a second alternative\nApple the vast majority of their products are made in China\nOr you know what happens if a bore breaks out or something happens everything gets shut down you know instead of the the the two destroyers going within\nThree hundred feet or a hundred feet of each other the destroyers crash into each other in a skirmish breaks out in in in the end it boom we shut the tray down from China apples out of business so they're going to have to start spending more money to reallocate factories are putting one in in in in Wisconsin now so\nThey're gonna have to search spending money to put these factories in to build these things up or when\nYou spend money at church eating into corporate profits or maybe you only have so much cash flow\nAnd and and so maybe instead of buying back stock you put into companies in the other thing with rising interest rates is a Frank minority of Guggenheim Partners said this week in right after ... a a bit he made some comments that look we see if rates go to three and a half percent\nOr ... most corporations can lose a tremendous amount of their ... their instead it's going to be used to eat now to pay\nCorporate debt interests\nAnd as soon as that happened within ten minutes after he said on CNBC the market started falling apart again this week in it and it just shows you
