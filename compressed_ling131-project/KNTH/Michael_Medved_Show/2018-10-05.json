as she is now she's going to vote no on Brett Kavanaugh that's why he um he's going to win confirmation a boat with fifty one votes instead of the fifty two we are to get\nHe um he has all the Republicans in the U.S Senate except for Murkowski and he does have one Democrat on the um moved democratic being Joe mansion so there is he has fifty one votes\nOr what Sarah Palin is talking about

exception of Lisa Murkowski voting yes that means fifty one vote yes on confirming Kavanaugh\nAll the Democrats with the exception of Joe mansion voting no and uh the Democrats are joined by the one Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski so pretty much a straight party line vote with one switch on each side\nUh fifty one forty nine vote it's one of the reasons that it's so important to get a better majority in the Senate\nOr today Brett Kavanaugh wrote\nSupreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus in separate rooms as I've said repeatedly if confirmed the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and the laws of the United states I Would always try to be a team player\nDuring the confirmation process I met with ... senators\nThe only reason he didn't meet with all one hundred as most of the Democrats would meet with him\nThey refused and I explained my approach to the law\nHe writes I've participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly one thousand three hundred\nAdditional questions I was grateful\nFor the opportunity after all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious
