chin policy expert at Stanford has the answer and the newest video for for a university see it at ... dot com where we teach what is involved [noise]\nAll right so I remember\nThe story and I just saw it was in USA Today yesterday [noise]\nJoy villa I'm a Republican for the first time in my life the extreme left his out of control\nJoy villa in it it writes this column in USA Today she is a well known that too many of course in the ah the singer and songwriter fact she was at my talk at valley best show all\nShe's a so she's a black woman she's beautiful she's talented she's alive she's great she's bright she's everything\nAnd I didn't even know she's a Republican or not a Republican here she is the less the left is out of control I'm a public figure a new Republican I'm going to take my energy where it counts the polls you should to whether your share my views are not\nKnow that that's fascinating\nElizabeth Warren\nReally uh we are going to now have the great one drop of Native American blood debate\nOf this entire thing is incredible and Elizabeth Warren is trying to collect at least some of the people operating her name want her to collect the million dollars President Trump has promised if she can prove she's an Indian and how does she proves she's Indian\nOr we will get to that it's deeply embarrassing and it really does show that there are some not many but some points of commonality between contemporary liberals and Nazis really yes really will get to that on the Michael ... show will also get\nTo the a great debate about the\nCivil war and and again a President Trump ... did not show in ... when he was telling about general grant and generally to be a particularly sophisticated historian he wasn't hired for that but\nHe absolutely did not inappropriately praise a Confederate general and they shouldn't be condemned for it and the press have helped him they've shown and in fact they were forced to retreat\nExactly why it is so many Americans and it's left right and center this trust mainstream media\nAnd rightly distrust mainstream media and most of all President Trump has been blessed this week at the beginning of the week\nWith the\nElderly inexplicable desire\nOf Hillary Clinton to inject herself into this democratic campaign\nWhy\nIs this is a mystery is she some kind of secret agent for the Republican Party\nIs that possible I mean she blew the campaign kind of everybody knows that she blew the campaign against Donald Trump President Trump acknowledges it\nAnd and now she is doing her very level best to ah to to basically\nUm help President Trump and help Republicans in the forthcoming campaign this November OK Hillary Clinton was on CBS on Sunday Morning\nAnd it it's one of those things will posted up at our website at Michael ... dot com you really have to see it to get a a full force of how uncomfortable she looks wives submit yourself to this I I don't understand I don't understand what is\nPossibly to be gained here except to strengthen Republicans and why is that she's not a political newcomer she's been around the block a thousand times she was a problem for the first campaign that Bill Clinton lost and and people forget this this is part of ancient history\nBut Hillary and bill gotten married bill got elected to be the governor of Arkansas very young man and then when he ran\nFor reelection the first time he lost and he lost because Hillary was the issue because she hadn't changed her name yet she was still Hillary Rodham she's still have those coke bottled glasses that I remember her wearing from law school\nAnd uh she she was a much more of an quote outspoken feminist well then she changed and she\nCampaigned alongside bill but given the fact that she has this long long experience in the political world\nHow could you be so utterly unprepared for questions that are very obvious and this this comes especially after we spoke to Ken Starr\nWho's now sending American and has just written a terrific book and again I recommend the book hardly to everybody the um the book by Ken Starr which is posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com tells the story of the impeachment of Bill Clinton\nAnd it tells much more tells the whole story of Ken stars life\nBut it does not portray Hillary in a very positive way and when you read that book you can understand why she would be so utterly unprepared for questions like those she received on CBS listen\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no well I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern some today have said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against whom numerous allegations have been made and which have\nDismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and it as I Believe came out in the right place\nOkay uh it came out in the right place for Monica did it uh it came out in the right place for those people by the way including very much Lindsey Graham\nWho was one of the leading Republicans in the house of representatives at that time a working on impeachment\nThis is so astonishing dishes eight eight utterly shameful display of what about is um let let me play it for you again because you'll notice immediately\nThat rather than talking about what was obviously an abusive power involving a president of the United states and an intern an intern in his office\nIs she a doesn't come from that and she says oh well but what about Trump\nBut you know what here's the key point and and listen to how how ... Hillary Clinton just you lied said she just moved away from it and doesn't even touch it\nPresident Clinton was accused of miss behavior the kind of behavior that would have gotten any CEO\nFired and so quickly so quickly you can't work for any corporation I mean anywhere today you can't even work in Hollywood and be involved and doing stuff like this and and come out the other side the accusations about Trump\nHas to do a with a period in his life long before he was directly involved in politics and certainly before he was in the White House by the way a ... just listen to one more time and I want to come back to this because it's very very important\nAnd it's it's so crucial to make distinctions okay here's Hillary Clinton again being questioned about her record defending bill\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no no I take responsibility right where my writing and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern some today has said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this she wasn't aware twenty or nation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made\nOkay stop stop stop right there I think anyone including the most devoted supporters of President Trump\nA would acknowledge that if it came out that he was having an affair with a White House intern if you were doing the things that Bill Clinton we now know did\nThat yes President Trump should step down a bit of there is no evidence of that and I am virtually certain that especially given the amount of media scrutiny of President Trump\nAnd Secret Service scrutiny and and FBI screwing everything else there's nothing irregular about his sexual behavior since he has been president\nAnd see the point over here is the failure to make distinctions in other words Hillary Clinton and liberals want us to believe that what Brett Kavanaugh did as a Seventeen year old allegedly at a party\nA is a is incredibly serious in ruins him forever and what Bill did as president of the United states and when you talk about abuse of power there's also such a thing about abuse of power involving\nThe Congress and the government and federal investigators or we will get to that and much more coming up on the ...\nBob Michel message across America is Alvin antics than have it well I mean it\nThis is Michael ... regime [noise]\nA fanatic\nBelieves that it is significant if you're able to find that if people have taken these DNA test it always turns out our own\nYou know two percent African American and I'm One percent are from from uh Australia aboriginal I I don't think that turns up very often\nBut the the entire thing is not\nThe only Democrats do this it's completely ridiculous ... why are we so obsessed with DNA that's the question here would be was was there any sense in which you grew up with a meaningful identity as an Indian\nAnd she didn't so she was a fraud about\nIt's your to apologize and just move on I I Do find it embarrassing when the president using the term Pocahontas 'cause Pocahontas by the way was somebody of real Native American heritage who became a Christian she changed her name to Rebecca and she converted Christianity\nUm looked at President Trump was asked about\nThese latest revelations about a Senator Elizabeth Warren who is getting ready to run for president that's why she released this video the timing is horrible for her because it will only heard Democrats and the forthcoming elections here's what President Trump had to say\n[laughter]\nYou better read it again\nI say I also want to\nMake that\n\nIt is going to be a long process for the Democrats um are there are people who are saying uh well President Trump said he would pay a million dollars\nIf a she could prove or that she was an Indian now and there are people saying well he has to pay or a million dollars now 'cause she proved a that she may have had and\nOne the Indian ancestor six to ten generations ago sorry here's exactly what President Trump said he said at a\nRally if I'm debating Warren I'd make or take a DNA test and pay or a million dollars if she can prove she's an Indian no she can't prove that but I'll tell you one thing you can prove is Elizabeth Warren is one of those Democrats who is threatening to bankrupt and destroy\nOr Medicare system how we'll get to that I'm going to write up on them at that show\nBy Michael ... ditch all across America this is Michael ...

much in the right direction or the Republicans who are\nFighting to maintain control of the house of representatives the Senate should be fine that that also could be close but it should be fine and things for the house side are turning around\nAnd one of the reasons is stupid mistakes by people like Senator Elizabeth Warren and a former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and then mainstream media in general\nBut one of the other reasons has to do with the fact that a little bit more as one of those people out there beating the drums for Medicare for all so for those of us who actually support Medicare and I do I I Know how important it is too many many many Americans uh who\nHappened to be over the age of sixty five\nOr why is it that the Democrats are always claimed credit for Medicare or now posing such a grave threat to it and nobody better to talk to about that than Daniel see Weber\nThe founder of the association of mature American citizens a Mac he founded bank in the summer of two thousand seven and then first of all we're over a million members now right for a Mac\nGod Mike ... thanks to you and your show we're one point four billion active members right now\nIsn't that terrific I I I Love that so talk about why it is that this very appealing slogan a Medicare for all really means Medicare for nobody\nWell exactly and it really is expanding a from Medicare which is a kind of an insurance when they're going to converted to his socialism planned\nHere's what I'm Talking about is twenty two million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans\nThose plans this year actually decrease in premium because they're operated through independent insurance companies having a decrease in premiums\nHowever the Bernie Sanders Medicare for all what lemonade Medicare Advantage plans and replace it with the socialism plan is similar to what happened in Canada\nAnd the problem with that is they have rationing for example it takes twenty two week schedule a surgery\nAnd I don't think most Americans like to have that kind of medical treatment\nI was blessed become the fire chief in Atlanta on the thin layer Shirley Franklin and I'm In ah twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are stretching\nUnder the administration of president Morocco I'm On and I was there for just\nUnder a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about the honorable America St Marie in two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success\nHow how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I published a book that I had written on my own time and self published book Chris Jimmy and the book is called who told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam\nIn the garden of eating and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question would benefit jak the great birth eleven so uh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it over calming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended\nAh but the reason why I was terminated because I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purposes for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband in a life and how they match 'em on it and that any sex opt out of that a is a fan and ultimately that's where it costs me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions which are opinions that literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all\nSo in ... it was it the fact is you self published the book you had any public funds\nWhat business is it of the city of Atlanta or the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument we're using a passage\nIn your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city views\nAre and that I can have those you as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city or I had an obligation to check those belief that the door is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that is\nOkay at this point or this I think most people are listening to us or slapping their forehead and think this is just clearly on jobs and when people suffering injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties and freedom of conscience who you're going to call not Ghostbusters you'd call the alliance defending freedom\nOr David Portman attorney for the IDF oh what did the ATF do what did you do a about a chief conference case\nIt was it was quite remarkable when she first contacted us because we thought well you were saying this can't be true of this can happen in America someone writes a religious book for for Christian man a Bible study\nAnd

can agree on is that discrimination based on race is evil\nAnd it's also illegal and discrimination based upon private expression of our religious convictions that's also legal and it's also illegal\nAnd that's why the alliance defending freedom exists um please go to our website Michael midday dot com click on the banner for alliance defending freedom and a\nAnd you can hear about the great work that's being done on behalf of great Americans like she's a Calvin Cochran um let me go back to David cord men tell us a quickly what's happening with this long case\nAnd you've taken up on behalf of the cheap\nSo the the city argued they were trying to be inclusive believe it or not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with his youth I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is\nA is that we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the chief afterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the city and the city allows you to do so\nWe challenge that as being unconstitutional his only private permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled in favor of the cheap and now we're going to trial or to figure out where the case goes for there and and how much damage is for the chief\nFor Republicans to keep control of the house of representatives of the Senate or the United states we should be able to do that\nAnd uh of the White House in the hands of conservative leadership one eight hundred nine five times Seventeen Seventy six what's amazing about this\nIs they ask people to uh to determine\nDo you have a great deal of trust and politicians trust and confidence politicians do you have a fair amount of trust and confidence in men and women in political lights life\nOr or do you have a low amount of trust in politicians trust has been soaring here's the amazing part\nThe increase it's not only a ten year high it's seven points from a year ago\nAnd Thirteen points from the record low of forty two percent in September two thousand sixteen okay now what happened right after September two thousand sixteen\nThe election of Donald Trump is president the United states is it appropriate to feel more trust in politicians right now actually I think it is I Do\nWith all of the problems that we have an American politics and all the conflicts we have if you're one of those people who trust politicians not at all or less than ever or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy\nSix um meanwhile I Want to get back to that question but there was a fairly remarkable interview with President Trump on sixty minutes I Know it's not Fox News is\nFox and friends it's not the friendly confines a president from those at when he was going to be interviewed by Lesley Stahl who's interviewed him before\nAnd then when he was going on sixty minutes he's running CBS network he's not going to get easy questions fast balls or pardon me slow hanging curve balls right over the plate\nHe's going to get some fairly tough questioning and he did so how did the president do\nOr you can uh help judge for yourself of for those who did not see the sixty minutes interview which was big news last\nNight here was a when I think was a fairly\nInteresting inappropriate question from Leslie stall with the presidents answer right at the beginning\nYou are the first president to the United states who never had a political post or for for never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president\nOkay so I always used to say the toughest paypal or Manhattan real estate guys and Bob are now I say their babies [laughter] who tend to have the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is and vicious is full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody and just like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at\nIn the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do remember that when you look at ... as you look at regulations you look at um making deals with other countries nobody's been able to do anything like this actually\nMost people didn't even try because they knew that didn't have the ability to do it but it's a very deceptive world okay a\nVery deceptive world um but how does that\nCorrelate with the idea that trust and politicians is it a ten year high I I think it has to do with the fact that most people regardless of which side you're on can feel that it at least some\nOf your concerns\nAre being addressed because there's so many voices in this political debate\nSome mano grammatical and even though we don't\nOfficially have divided government ... the Democrats haven't been shy\nIn letting their points of view be known and by the way the poll from Gallup\nThat show the trust in politicians hit a\nTen year high that was taken before the accusations by Christine Blasey Ford and before the second round of the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd there's no question that those accusations took a toll particularly on confidence people having in Brett Kavanaugh though I still believe that uh that entire confrontation is going to work very strongly Republicans\nAs does this general sense that believe it or not with all of the deal making in the viciousness\nThat President Trump is talking about there's a sense that the political system is working a President Trump was ah then asked about uh the\nAspect of the political world that he is most routinely condemned and that of course would be as good friends and mainstream media\nThe other thing I really learned is I never knew how just shot as the media was I I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a soundbite by now I I never knew how to\nJust try to get well no but even the way you ask the question like about separation yeah\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk to them no I don't know I had it was recognized none of them answer but you did it four times I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want to have that tight with the okay All right now the fight with the nighttime I'm president and you're not\nA okay uh\nAnd and then they change continues to a question that I think a lot of people asked about an editor mocking was used regularly the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford well Leslie stall picked up on that and just took it a little bit to the side\nProfessor of philosophy forging mimicked her\nMade that speech we would not have one but I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her\nI didn't really make fun of them on the ocean is the person that we're talking about ...\nDidn't know the here at the time the place professor they forgot before the Senate and and was asked what the worst moment and she said when the two boys who laughed at me at my house and then I watch him and my car and\nThousands of people were laughing at her\nThey can do what they I I Will tell you the way now justice Kevin always treated has become a big factor in the midterms have you seen what's going on with the ... did you have to\nWell I think she was treated with greater respect I Know ... what do you think we shouldn't have been to you thank you treated her with great magic show no idea that just seemed to be saying that she relied on a ... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter well we won\nOkay a look at the one thing that I think he was on the right track with he did not men make her mimic carrying her as if you try to imitate her accent or tone of voice\nHe didn't do that and that would have been horrible what\nHe did was he talked about he ... he didn't changes tone of voice you said he said\nA window to happen I don't remember where did you go I don't remember we can have that to play that soundbite for you but this entire media narrative which I don't think is working for the last if you disagree with me and give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThat President Trump was mocking Christine Blasey Ford that he was mimicking her mimicking is even worse because\nPeople do mimic people I mean I I have been known to mimic people oh Im\nPerfectly sometimes but I Do um but I wanted but this was not that\nAnd then uh\nThen he was asked a question that has a profound concern to Democrats here's Lesley Stahl\nWhy not they shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing to do it that you have to believe that the Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign or election I they metal but I think China metal too and I\nWant to know something I said why don't you tell me ... metal because I think China metals also and I think frankly guy not\nProblem hearing the term that hurting the whole Russian Russia but I'm also saying China\nOkay\nHe hasn't polish many times what is undoubtedly the case which is Russia interfered in the election and I think what President Trump is saying is a there is no evidence that Russia swayed\nThe election and by the way I think that's true\nOr if you can disagree you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] guinea shocking\nThe way that a salt question the press\nAnd you got to understand why he's somewhat reluctant to do these interviews we'll be right back with more what it means for the campaign and why the rise in confidence for politicians one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nThat has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign governments including a foreign government uh in in Chile or under a Salvador Allende\nWhich actually I think we were justified in and taking some role and I know that very controversial but what does that have to do with this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests uh we we oppose\nRussia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong and some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and\nWe want to stop it [noise] so what's what's wrong with it\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to question our own morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just to just to think that there are not governments that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries\nNone of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh and we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia did\nWhich is why do think that what people are talking about about this being some kind of rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill because show gay and chopping\nThem up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did a but to actually just apprehend them and take him back to Saudi I I think that as relevant as well and yes there's a difference appreciate your\nCall I'm President Trump inevitably was asked about the border by Leslie stall there was this interchange\nWhat about the for separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same thing it was on the books but he didn't enforce that new one for them to launch that ... the zero tolerance policy\nRain to deter families with children and then everybody just sided and courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our country are you gonna go back to that well we're looking at a lot of things really what we want to do is change immigration laws because they were they were laughing stock all over the world are you willing though I think you're saying you're it's under consideration all I Want all the laws change\nThe topic was is Leslie for coming into our country illegally okay ah I think\nThat President Trump has very strong agreement on that from a a majority of

Christine Blasey Ford\nI don't think he mocked her but I Know he didn't mimic her and that was the word that Leslie stall use you mimic Christine Blasey Ford here's what President Trump actually sounded like a this is before the final vote obviously on judge Kavanaugh and it was a a a comment that he made during a rally in Mississippi listen\nWell do you think it was always wonder\nHow did

that's true by the way and this is the one thing I I actually agree with Trump and is it is right to challenge the narrative\nAbout what a hero in how selfless and how some noble Christine Blasey Ford is\nI'll tell you when it's appropriate to challenge it\nAnd somebody told me what good it did for the country with Anita Hill on Clarence Thomas even though I don't believe she was telling the truth I don't\nAt least you could say she raised awareness of problems of workplace harassment\nAccomplish but says here let me read you one of the descriptions\nI'm\nIn Portland which has long seeing

right wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car and those videos were horrible\nAnd it it's completely what was so amazing as a police didn't break it up these people were attacking motorists and ... and by the way\nMost of them were white most of the demonstrators are white and they were attacking motors for being white people\nHate crime okay uh\nPortland police apparently had been expecting trouble and managed to prevent it for half an hour or so by lining up and tactical gear along the street I'm\nSure they love

Kelly they're both astronauts but not even bill is close enough on that\nAnd ... and we we called attention to the same thing here and they show it how ridiculous I mean the idea of the Churchill who ah was an old man even at the time that he took over in Great Britain and Nineteen thirty nine um\nWinston Churchill actually took over in Nineteen forty a the idea that that that Churchill can't be voted without probation\nA that Scott Kelly also offended by\nOf the reason I'm movie darkest hour which is one of the finer movies of last year were offended by the movie Dunkirk\nI mean come on it's absurd ... if we really reached the point where Winston Churchill has to have is bussed removed from the White House now it is not\nTrue that Brock Obama ordered the bust of Churchill removed\nIt is not true that President Trump ordered the bust of Martin Luther king remote the bust of Churchill had been loaned to the United states by Tony Blair as a gift to President Bush and then they wanted back after President Bush left the White House\nBut uh I suspect that President Trump has put some kind of image of Churchill back in the White House a meanwhile\nThere was this idiotic response from a Princeton professor named ... junior who's much in the media he's African American he had this to say to this idea that a church all should be of dissolved of his various crimes listen\nWhat if it was the case that that that she realized that the invocation of Winston Churchill wasn't consistent with what he's out\nBut he didn't know everything about Churchill and then he realized that Churchill that night James rarely three sanctioned write the starving of Indians and ... and they will realize in fact the church was inside\nA reunion we are committed races to the imperial projects the ... did not represent is what I mean by this I'm going to say this really quickly for those who have been caught in the foot of history [laughter]\nCan't simply in low the mandate of history as a reason to accept certain ... vote on before [noise]\nLincoln comes to me I can I can embrace Abraham Lincoln's\nRight I can and races new democracy but then I realized that Lincoln held the view\nThat white people no matter what we're acting beer once I understand we can only\nI can then embrace own my own terms but I cannot accept Lincoln just because the west declares and was great I have to accept it like a new but every time I ...
