what what is it that the folks are screaming about and what are they aiming to achieve what's fascinating to me about this\nIs remember that dramatic Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile everyone was watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any there weren't whether Germany nobody nobody know that ... and now somehow they were able for that to control\nThese idiots and I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that are already it's indeed\nHonestly if they can\nControl it in a high profile situation they shooting ... every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and scream and shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is

budding their heads against them screaming shouting and sounding like this [noise]\nWhat is the\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelmingly clear\nIf you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up a month from now you you do because the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know it\nUh and basically some of the

about ... you think he's talking about uh uh he even analogize\nIs the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama with people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some

cold heartless Merrick Garland a basically they\nPostponed I'm considering\nHis appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nMe nothing about the fact of the matter is actually the woman who actually accused of sexual a so\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important that um\nThere was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing\nInvolving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no X Y Z there wasn't enough saying\nA clean

spending the United states government literally into oblivion\nAnd it's come on the dishes craziness right now and this is talk about\nA civil war there were issues ... what is the issue here\nWhat is it that that Charles Blow thinks is the key issue in his column that he writes liberals this is war\nAnd by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals this war that this morning on Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy priceless is by Michael ...\nAnd he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch\nJustice Kavanaugh they're the only two justices in the entire history\nOf the Supreme Court who have been nominated by a president who didn't win the popular vote and confirmed by a majority of center senators\nWho when you take all the votes of the people who voted for Gorsuch and all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kavanaugh\nAnd you put them against all of the voters gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against\nCheap but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators it's true that that Wyoming gets two U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming has a population of about six hundred thousand in California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S Senate that's how you find them more\nVotes on the other side but did it this deliberately is the way they set up the constitution to protect smaller states\nSo that you don't have a situation where everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida\nAnd New York\nEverything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious\nAnd yes people who vote in California you have to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral\nVotes because you've got fifty five electoral votes in but here's here's the basic point his complaint is not against the legitimacy of the court\nHis complaint is against the constitutional system that has worked pretty well\nFor two hundred and forty years really what's wrong with these people you're going to challenge the legitimacy of the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh but based on the fact\nThat the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n... really it's foolishness a deep deep foolish enough it seems to me and speaking of deep foolishness one of the um most outspoken opponents of the confirmation of justice capital which Spartacus\nOr the one and only Cory Booker and he was out campaigning in Iowa why was he campaigning in Iowa is it because he is just enormously popular in Iowa does he have a\nFamily in Iowa I don't think so I don't know maybe it does but why was Cory Booker and I always in Iowa because that's where the Democratic nomination process begins\nAnd his plan to win the presidency is he is going to be the most hysterical\nOr the most over the top the most ridiculous of all of the Democrats speaking out a lot of people said he's trying to follow the path blazed by Brock Obama won the Iowa caucuses that was the beginning of his path to the presidency beat Hillary Clinton the Iowa caucuses\nIs very different bronco Obama went to Iowa trying to show he was more reasonable more unified and I'm Cory Booker well Cory Booker goes to Iowa and sounds like this\nLong until November how [noise]\nTo say that\nThat will get the patient [laughter]\n[noise] so\nHave\nSpartacus\nI'm Sorry\nCan we listen to that again this is this is one of the most embarrassing political beaches\nOf our time I'm an artist and it it's in Iowa the Iowa wasn't close this time Trump carried Iowa by nearly ten points it was it was a white man out and and Cory Booker thinks he's going to appeal to Iowa with is can we look\nAt all until November [noise]\nI Want to say than\nEducation how [laughter]\nHow\nHave okay\nCorey yeah you should you should meet another yeah like a ... named Howard Dean I Know how to\nHurry went to Oxford and stand for two and a\nBut seriously it didn't work out so well for Howard Dean but how long\nIs okay and and again he I Korea I Know has a strong Christian background he does\nHe could've said uh how long oh lord how long I Would prefer you\nEcho the eye is a a passage that says come let us reason to cast her Cory ... you can do better than this and then wait same guy\nSpartacus is on the Senate floor and delivering is final but on the Asian of judge Kavanaugh on the Senate floor and more inspiring rhetoric from the gentleman from New Jersey\nSo a lot of focus our asking me what now\nOh I Want to include by reading some word from another painful period\nWhere people didn't know what this body would do\nIt wasn't just in this land and people didn't know what this body would do\nThousands hundreds of thousands thing for tomorrow and to protest to sit in and they didn't know what this body would do pretty soon anyway and they fought any way sometimes they were beaten\nIn fact in one case on a bridge in Alabama they were beaten and bloody one of my colleagues and the other chamber John Lewis hadn't had split open but they eventually got over that bridge and Dr Montgomery in a man named king gave this speech to those people who are tempted to surrender to cynicism in that time\nTo do this thing for those people who want it to to to do that speech supposed people were hurting this was what he said and I quote he goes I Know you're asking today\nHow long will it take somebody asking how long will prejudice the line the vision of men\nDark in their understanding and Dr bright eyed wisdom from her sick from somebody asking\nWhen will wounded justice wine prostrate on the sweets lifted\nOkay just I I I it I understand Dr King was right wounded justice was\nProstate or on the streets in Alabama and Nineteen sixty three sixty four sixty five he was right but how was the justice lying bleeding and prostrate on the streets today one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and a surprise from the new justice capital summing up [noise]\nAnd

the number of black law clerks working for him why because in or Thirty years on the court or Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd saw quite Thirty years I Know a twenty five years Ruth Bader Ginsburg has appointed exactly one black law clerk out of a hundred I'm Brett Kavanaugh was appointed one out of four\nFirst for better it's a nice thing\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six west in Philadelphia west and you're on the Michael Mann that shell\nOil hey\nGood luck I Want to start with a question okay sure are yes or do you agree that it would be despicable\nTo make a false accusation against the person that would destroy his life of course okay All right to them that were agreed\nThat it's not Cory Booker is not acting crazy he's a despicable person all of these Democrats are despicable people\nChristine Blasey Ford's accusation has been totally proven to be false or or if not in any way demonstrably true she gets\nBeen okay then that's that's a different thing she is ...\n... how has she been shy about how she'd been shown to be a liar\nOkay she said she was afraid to fly obviously that's not the case\nWell wait wait wait that was as statement by one of her lawyer she did not say on and she was questioned and her lawyers gave an isolating or how\nThe second door on her house was built because she she felt confine\nAgain but this this is this is a lot I you're right and and that's not something that\nShe said apparently something she led the put out there and her name I think we make a mistake if we wanted to attack\nA Dr Ford as some kind of despicable person I think she's\nI think I Do I Do question her credibility I don't think she has been tried and credible and any of this\nBut I I think she may in one level believe there was actually an argument about this involving a Republican senator woman and a democratic senator woman what argument about what it didn't forward really believe this stuff will get to that coming up

about\nOne of the a truly great confirmation battles and\nAll of the history of the U.S Senate and in fact I Can't think of anything that has produced a this this level of of negativity and craziness and hatred the board battle was close the Clarence Thomas battle was close\nBut what's interesting about that is there were a bunch of Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas\nThere were\nThere were unfortunately a bunch of Republicans who turned against\nJudge Bork\nAnd er here\nIt was such a strict party line thing but Susan Collins I think spoke so well for people who may be in there are a bunch of Americans who are genuinely undecided anybody who's still undecided and you don't know well how do they handle it why what is really count on about ... who's calling speech\nShe made this clear I'm OK we will get to that in a moment she made clear that she believes that Christine Blasey Ford was assaulted\nBut she believes not by I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd this is what Mazie Hirono the gentle lady of Hawaii I actually the most pathetic of of all of the Democrats and the Judiciary Committee this is what senator Hirono had to say about Susan Collins can you think that\nSenator Collins is insulting to professor for what to say that the things that back and forth I think that to the south and what does that and see than\nHe has health advocates are so many survivors from her say that out for all of us have been very sorry I'm at a ... from survivors going back many many years where they kept all these phone\nCalls ... a a cost to themselves and the says what happens with a ... survivors that they did not come forward I found out that in your interview that she kept saying that there was no cooperation a that was a ... than a ... a bald assertion that\n[laughter] well it's probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar only now overall every year ha Jeff Dole's out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective\nThe U.S military every year at the department of defense their total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow a at said it in terms of what you were talking about was open the books dot com you have a a basic approach which is the transparency is the\nOnly way to solve this is\nLetting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\n[noise] well and that's that's the plan on the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal then at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take the three pronged approach and he should lead by example he should post all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report to the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with the White House and this is something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nuts in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff at the President Roosevelt one world war two\nWith a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today I I don't I don't get that at all what what about\nCan you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the condom industry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars flowed into a Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're obviously a small company we did identify Michael that the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world\nCertainly in this country that over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money\nUh there's another one here which is a cigar taste test in Virginia for a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred and Seventy five dollars how could they hold the spending to just a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars for the cigar taste test\n[laughter] and there's a lot of studies like that one point one million dollars of our taxpayer money went to prepare America's religions for the discovery of extraterrestrial life\nOne million dollars went for a study on where it hurts the most to be stunned by be\nOkay well I guess is the theory is that if the government doesn't prepare you for the arrival of Esther extraterrestrials who will then we also spend money looking for extraterrestrial only government might\nWell I think that was an inside deal that was twenty million dollars that the one that went to one of Harry Reid's friends and they went out looking for extraterrestrial life\nOkay people should should get involved with this and what I Love is the three pronged approach which is number one\nPresident Trump begin by showing how every penny is spent in the White House and a number two he touched the White House staff\nBy ten percent and then orders every other federal departments caught by five percent and then number three he starts giving us updates every month on this war on waste because this was a war we can actually win\nIf you want to find out more about this uh go to our website to Michael midday dot com will link you write to open\nThe books dot com that's open the

uh\nThe country coming together and at least being able to talk to each other\n... couldn't Hollywood help with this process well yes but not if you're going to respond to people like Senator Collins

mount armies in stock supplies and live off the land and drive them out\nWhat's the Democrats are saying right now is vote vote vote vote vote and fine and good luck I don't think they are very effectively appealing to voters\nAnd the reason that this whole idea of a war doesn't hold a Jeff ... look John Adams said something very famous in the American revolution he said\nA third of people living in colonies at the time wanted independence a third want to draw a main loyal to Britain than a third one and simply to be left alone if you have a full third who are willing to fight\nAnd another full third who are willing to fight on the other side yes you could have a very bloody war and they were twenty five thousand\nPeople Americans who died in that war but uh we don't have that the percentage of people on the left who uh want to go ahead and how people out of restaurants or want to make this a war\nI I think it's it's not anywhere near a third frankly I don't think it's near ten percent it's extreme crazies\nAnd they certainly don't deserve to be voted into office let's go to Tom in Glen door or California atomic layer on\nYeah thank you very much you bet\nI'd love to
