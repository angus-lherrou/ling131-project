{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "\nThat's right fire away turn your telephone into an instrument of an event [noise] one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise]\nWe try to privilege disagreeing phone calls every day every hour on the Michael ... that show but today this hour on Thursdays we limit ourselves\nTo calls that disagree I think it's quite natural that today on the eve of a historic vote really the most important vote of the Trump Administration so far\nAs the evil that vote or it's going to be natural than many of our calls are going to be people who disagree with me about Brett Kavanaugh I Believe that he will be a great justice of the Supreme Court I Believe he will and should be confirmed\nIf you disagree you can send us a disagreeing tweet I have been somewhat prolific on Twitter on\nThis issue and uh you can access us on Twitter We're at ... show on Twitter that that ... show or you can call us at one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or the state of play at the moment\nIs of Chris Coons the\nSenator from Delaware who's been he he actually is a good friend of Jeff Flake of Arizona and it was they together who added this extra week to the process so the FBI could complete investigation which they did\nLast night the Republicans are pointing out that there is nothing new in the investigation which is a vindication of Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats are claiming as was entirely predictable that the investigation is incomplete and it's insufficient\nThe whole point of the investigation was not to find new information it was to make Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the three wavering Republicans feel\nComfortable enough\nWith uh having given the process some time and some information and getting reports from witnesses particularly mark judge who was interviewed by the FBI extensively to get enough information from these people so they can feel comfortable voting to sustain\nThe Republican Senate majority which means voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd uh I Believe and and certainly hope an ardent leap pray that all three of the wavering Republicans perhaps joined by Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nWill vote for confirmation giving him a a victory or by probably a vote of fifty two forty eight maybe fifty one to forty nine\nIf you disagree with me that this is a\nA positive development and will help our politics he'll and I think it will I\nHonestly believe that it will help American move in the right direction if you disagree with that you\nCan give us a call it is disagreement day one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nTo ... to give us an example of the kind\nOf thing that I think the American people will be voting to reject the Senate voting to reject first and then the American people in November's election listen to a Chuck Schumer the Democratic minority leader I think he will be returned as minority leader of the U.S Senate\nHe um he said this this morning when he was responding to the FBI investigation\nMany fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts\nHaving received a thorough\nOn the documents those fears have been realized for a second I disagree having received this\nA briefing on all of the documents I disagree with Senator Grassley statements that there was no hint misconduct\nWe are reiterating our call given how limited\nThis these documents were and how limited the scope of this investigation was we are reiterating or call\nThat the documents with proper rejection be made public why shouldn't all of America see\nAnd second we are reiterating our call to make the directive that the White House counsel McGahn sent to the FBI\nBecause we believe it greatly constrained V. investigation\nFrom the get go okay I'm\nA investigate investigating investigate I've I think one of the things that his clarifying about this whole process is\nThat it is giving people a little bit of a taste of what America would be like if the Democrats do take control of the house of representatives if you like this\nIf you like hearing from a various aggrieved Democrats making wild accusations trying to a practice the politics of personal destruction\nTrying for a massive and comprehensive investigations of what the terms booth thing in devil's triangle really meant to high school students and Nineteen eighty two if you believe this is the kind\nOf endeavor in which our representatives in Congress should be engaged in most of the Democrats\nAnd cause you'll be getting lots and lots and lots more of this and they win this thing of the reasons that I think that Republicans have been so unified and so energized by this whole process\nIs because there's an understanding people right now they're not attacking Donald Trump Donald Trump\nI mean he attacks back and he says things sometimes that are stupid says things sometimes that are not\nTrue but that is not Brett Kavanaugh for goodness sake\nBrett Kavanaugh's entire record is one of mainstream conservatism of judicial excellence of winning support from people who don't agree with them building coalitions and that's exactly why they're afraid of him on the Supreme Court\nJudge Kavanaugh has a good relationship with Elena Kagan\nAn Obama appointee associate justice of the Supreme Court how do we know because she says so she was the one when she was dean of Harvard law school who appointed Brett Kavanaugh altered change there and if they are going to go after Brett\nKavanaugh who does build coalitions who works with other people who has a life long record\nOf impressing people positively men and women and black and white and liberal and conservative if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh and make him into some kind of cartoon villain make him into some kind of serial rapist\nStumbling drunk I mean none of this is true\nAnd it's the worst kind of politics it's despicable politics and people talk about a threat to democracy this kind of politics is more of a threat to democracy than all of President Trump's stupid tweets combined and there are plenty of stupid tweets\nAnd the idea that a President Trump is going to permanently alienate female voters it it's not true President Trump in the last election\nWon a majority of white female voters truly didn't win as big majorities Romney did\nBuddy wonder majority and\nThe the idea that that the Democrats are trying polarization to separate eight women out\nAnd say ... women have to vote like well then see how that worked for Hillary Clinton it it is the answer is it didn't and\nI Believe that this democratic strategy is divisive\nAnd awful\nAnd ah that the American people are waking up to its dangers and to um to to try to just stop at the here's a disagreeing email that came in from Brian in Compton, California\nOr his message to me is judge K guilty where there is smoke there's fire you Republicans whitewash everything\nIt's clear as a twenty year investigator for the state which includes sexual assault cases rape that's set dry interviewed over thirty plus pick another candidate Andrew BS comment about his demeanor court versus private that's ridiculous my comment was this\nHe was at the committee as a witness not as a presiding judge there\nIs no evidence at all that as the presiding judge or as it's someone functioning in a courtroom capacity he has never shown any problems with his temperament\nHere's a functioning alcoholic pick somebody else\nHe set himself he is\nBias really and you are going to make him a judge long as the bias is for your side it's fine these are the fax cover up and deceit\nNo hearing from Merrick Garland there we go that shows your bias and lack of fairness nothing can beat that [noise]\nUm [noise] I again I Merrick Garland good man by the way\nSomebody who's been a good judge and will continue to be a good judge on the appellate court we'll be right back disagreement day on that show [noise]\nA you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth uh in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth but I think the absence of any confirming evidence\nAt all is overwhelming\nAnd the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd ... and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context\nAnd the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is he really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know and I've never met him but I Do know people who have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\nUm al ... who is a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with the judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion\nThat he should be blocked from the Supreme Court\nBased on on early unsupported unprecedented\nAccusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and and uh and violence against women\nMost of those people do it as a pattern is on a one off\nAnd the idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a doctor for it are completely non credible and have been clearly denied a that I think is worth taking into consideration of coming up\nVery prominent Republican\nA group of protesters that going to be women [noise]\nAny urges those women to grow up\nIs that an outrage we'll play the shocking audio and more coming up on disagreement day on the men that show one eight
