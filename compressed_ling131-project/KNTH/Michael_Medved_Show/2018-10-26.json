extraordinary things in keeping us all safe and getting a very dangerous and very deeply deranged individual\nInto custody and in solving this mystery of the great bomb scare with fourteen different packages sent to fourteen different people around the country getting that things solved in record time I know I Know I Know it's always tempting\nTo try to jump on the president of the United states or to jump on people in the mainstream media or to jump on one party or another party or this one or that one and say boy did you ever get it wrong boy is this terrible boy are you to blame\nI ah I I Want to try to avoid that because honestly we have\nEvery reason to celebrate as a country and President Trump has been speaking recently about the need to come together and to see things in harmony and to see things\nAs Americans not as Republicans or Democrats or pro Trump or is there an anti Trump worse\nBut basically to look at this thing citizens and when you look at this thing uh this has\nBeen remarkable and one of the things that I literally just moments before I got on the air here I put out a tweet that said look this should remind everybody of how lucky we are\nTo have people in place like yes Jeff Sessions and yes Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and yes all of those extraordinary people who work every single day sometimes putting their lives on the line\nTo keep us safe through the FBI and the rest of law enforcement\nThrough the New York city police to the local Florida police we just had a um a moment with Jeff Sessions are announcing the arrest if you haven't heard it and you probably have ... or say oc who's fifty six years old\nWho um it at least as far as I can gather has known employment\nAppears to have been living in his van and yes his van is festooned with all kinds of a political\nA bumper stickers and posters it's actually kind of artfully designed but the messages on the van are insane and a despicable and dare I say it deplorable\nIn any event he was a arrested today taken into custody he's having multiple charges filed against him\nHe was being interrogated in what they call a national security exemption in other words they can't interrogate him without an attorney president dinner fear I think that what they're trying to do is to determine\nWhether or not he had any accomplices or had any associates and he doesn't appear to a a guy with a very very long criminal history\nA guy who as I mentioned may or may not have been living in his van recently uh before that during another very serious criminal charges in during another bankruptcy that he declared he was living with his mom\nAnd I'm at ... we're not talking about a an ... an upstanding or model citizen and when you look at pictures of the van I you know I think about this because\nMy most important role in the world is that right and that is true for probably many many of the males who are listening to me and\nI was looking at the pictures of this van with all the messages on it and literally you can see out the windows because the windows are totally covered with\nTop youth soccer recruits for Trump drain the swamp dishonest media CNN sucks I'm hard rock weekly\nOr they have a seminal hard rock weekly now this has led to some confusion I think because people are saying well he may or may not be Native American I\nThink the seminal there is not a reference to the tribe it's a reference to the football\nTeam or to the um uh Florida State Seminoles I Believe it is and you know there are also pictures of Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton and I believe in the Van Jones a with a targets on their faces\nAnd that's not good but in any event I ... when I was trying to imagine\nIs think if you have a daughter\nAnd somebody's coming up to pick up your daughter in front of the house and he was driving a van [laughter] I mean I'm I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg age you are\nWho has suggested or any any time that police spot a van or a car or any kind of ethical with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately\nIn any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off to where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general\nA little bit more appropriate here's the attorney general of the United states\nAnd please to participate in this amount that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation or an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges marry a change or expand as the investigation perceive\nThis is the law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political by\nOkay good for him or he's he's exactly right and you don't want the president spoke beautifully this morning no I mean it\nAh the Twitter feed probably best ignored but uh his speaking this morning was solid he uh he was speaking to a great group and they were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with him so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left a Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit\nAnd a here's what the president's sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the uh people who are attending that somebody who is president the United states\nI'd like to begin as you are leaders that's a real leaders I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update\nOn the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching\nFederal state and local investigation finds that person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI was struck the authorities to spare no resource are expensive and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [noise]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nThe extent of the law\nOkay a good for you Mr President and then he went on to say this\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America\nCome up with a half ago and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it [noise] and stuff and\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspect I Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the\nUs attorney's office for the southern district of New York the NYPD at all law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people that work so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate\n[noise] okay that's the president of\nThe United states and this is a fine moment for President Trump and I know he didn't ah the death associate the DNA on the saliva on the stamps from the packages with this guy personally but he's in charge you know things went wrong he would get blamed it\nIsn't this something worth celebrating and and what is it ... on what basis would you attack the Trump Administration on this issue this it seems\nIs I Would just\nTry to get folks on on the left including I ... I heard earlier today a congresswoman Jackie Speier\nWho was just way over the top and this is a little reflective of the hatred of President Trump and it's all President Trump has that can you imagine anyone celebrating if one of these bombs going off\nThink about it and for conservatives and I mean we would feel\nHorrible horrible\nJust as I I Know that when ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer at the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see anybody on the left celebrating I didn't hear anybody saying oh I Wish he'd killed Steve ...\nAnd and maybe we can sink in those terms and let that inform some of our rhetoric one eight hundred\nNine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number I'm let us go to your\nCalls and to a Don in Columbus Don you're on the Michael Mann that show\nIs like ... rock sure I'm I'm beginning on your show you argue with making jokes about white right wing nut job is going to bomb could require if it were the immigrant doing it you would have a totally different spin on it and I heard a caller in your show called in band that\nBefore that man was a a ... that they thought it was a Democrat or Republican\nRight and you learn what I said earlier to act and you heard what I said to that and I've also tweeted about it I think it was always ridiculous to assume this was some kind of false flag operation\nUm I don't I I I\nDo not believe that there is would be some kind of conspiratorial Democrat who'd be willing to sacrifice himself\nA in order to try to kill some members of his own party ... none of that makes the least bit of sense so fine Don you're right I mean ... but\nFor you to assume do you think that saves are saying this guy represents I'm a big segments of the Republican Party\nYou there no\nOkay well we lost him because he clearly does not I I honestly I I was last night was in Minneapolis with a dentist Prager Larry Elder and our friend ed Marcy from hot air and their eight hundred people there are nearly\nAnd I honestly and there's no one no one out there and says oh gosh I Wish some of these bombs and reach Maxine Waters and and Hillary Clinton and not at all in fact the president sent out a good tweet about this we will get to that and more of your calls coming up [noise]\nIt's two thirty in the infant Seventy the answer we'll check traffic and wanted to give you the news right now is or\nNews are involved I knew in Washington what law enforcement official says with demand detained in Florida in connection with a pipe bomb scare will be prosecuted in New York City officials said today so he's on our soil will face charges in federal court in Manhattan\nAfter a niche neutral court appearance in Puerto five of the twelve improvised ... shows you\nBolt in the case were recovered in the southern district of New York\nAnd we're learning today that ... extensive record it passed a rash who'd against it served on probation for making a bomb threat President Trump to the praising law enforcement for detaining the suspect in a very quick manner\nCourt and other public records show because you know like the equivalent record is fifty six years old and has made threats just like this and the ... the principles of Yosemite National park now ... those are two people fell from a popular overlook go wild visitors to walk right through the edge of the quit this is sort of knew\n\n[noise] stuck in traffic we get the answer [noise]\nTwo thirty one now it's for Michael my bed show and I am too and somebody the answer if you don't talk to talk to Michael one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six joined the Michael my bed show no second W believes traffic well\nKen section right lane is closed ... freeway ...

not sure that your narrative D is exactly the way it happened but you're right there was this situation in California\nWhere there are a bunch of Trump supporters outside of the stadium where he was speaking who were assaulted by demonstrators on the other side and yes this is stupid and there was an attempt when Ann Coulter was supposed to be speaking in University of California\nAre they actually did property damage NA rioted and\nAre there is no question that the left has been far more guilty of actual violence trying to shut down free speech then they're right far\nMore guilty of it

has been apprehended he has been interrogated or the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect as he will be going away for some forty eight years but meanwhile the president of the United\nStates charged us earlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to for a few moments or with a friend and somebody who I I view as a very significant ally for constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris is the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom\nAnd uh and and Mike we were just talking off the air for a moment\nUh I think we agree that one of the essential elements of\nTrying to to reduce\nThe levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition ...\nSure the the um historical American position has been I may disagree with everything you say but I'll defend the right to say it\nAnd we're losing that particular although there are some of the right decision but the left with the levers of power like in the jak Philips case where they tried to shut down or should they didn't want to use his creative skills to speak a message in favor of same sex weddings\nAnd and the California case that we did in the spring were last year where California to force her life centers to give it a pro abortion message people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say them freely\nAs at you know can we go to the California case for a moment because I follow that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory it seems to me for the alliance defending freedom\nOr this was I've spoken several times for fundraising backwards for um for crisis pregnancy centers and would crisis pregnancy centers try to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancies where a very often people are on Mary they have no funds\nThat rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion or that the centers will help you ... bear the child raising the child and and deal with all the challenges and mom\nAnd they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter] go go to this address go here go there um and that's about right is that\nYes um I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's real they brag today in their papers passing a law that this is a part of their progressive issues to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the ... they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on abortion if if if you are on our side of the issue of the other side of course\nI wasn't required the from the Planned Parenthood has not affected by this law it was only they claim that they only wanted all women to have all views well that didn't work that way\nRight and then just to get this so people see it so clearly\nIn other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood they said well if you want an alternative to abortion and then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nWould have been equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be forced to give the pro abortion message but the lack of a quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nViewpoint that they don't agree with and I I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in as it were saying that the other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can there's a difference between saying\nI'm you know you're you're entitled to express your view\nAnd saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will silence you if you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now with Blaine Adams and who is a ... does promotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in the Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't print T shirts with a gay pride team to them\nAnd he will print teachers for any person but he will deliver messages there's other messages these turned down over the years\nHe found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt at the exact same price but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that these people want it to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God they wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so they're\nTrying to punish planets and hopefully we won that case in the ... Kentucky court of appeals [noise]\nUm and hopefully that will be affirmed in the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not\nWe'll be taking that case as frequently\nI I just saw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different uh attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nWhat we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that um volunteer their time sometimes it reduced rate sometimes absolutely free um but we have a big team that are willing to come in and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have a real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have three thousand volunteer attorneys and by the way we're we're talking to you because right now today is friday we are going into the weekend you will feel great and you'll have more reason to celebrate and feel great all over the weekend\nIf you can do something to um\nTo help the alliance defending freedom go to our website of Michael midday dot com you can read more about their fascinating work and some of these important cases\nAnd see what this great organization led by Michael ...

Michael ... dot com\nAnd on the Michael ... show will a post this Meghan ... column that I'm Talking about uh the immigration conversation we need to have it's called and it's basically\nA conversation that makes it clear we cannot have an open borders policy ... there is no constituency for it it's something that by the way conservatives use more than ... conservative support it because they characterize\nThe liberal position as being for open borders and you know to some extent it is only because on this caravan issue\nHave you heard anything from anyone on the left anyone in the Democratic party\nAbout what they proposed to do about it all you hear his criticism of from oh Trump said that there were middle Easterners and the caravan and they're not probably not probably right that he's wrong but okay so what ... ... as Meghan McConnell makes the point even if every single person in this caravan\nIs solid and hardworking and decent family oriented you cannot just accepted by parents and the caravan has dwindled down to about three thousand people which is good news\nBecause it means that there's some people were finding some kind of asylum or some kind of ability be taken in Mexico maybe someone will go back to Honduras\nAnd and that it seems to me is an area where Americans can be helpful both the private sector and the public sector they're wonderful charities one of the things that I'm very proud of\nHis we'd been associate on this show and I I mentioned this last night in Minneapolis a we've been associated for years with food for the poor which does a\nA great job feeding people and providing for people in Guatemala and\nBy helping to provide for people by helping the cause of reform in these dysfunctional countries and their horribly dysfunctional\nThen and then you can make it less urgent\nFor people simply the fleet and yes it is true that many of the people are fleeing the scanner fleeing for\nTheir lives I'm not saying we shouldn't helps them what I'm saying is that feeling compassion for people who are desperate\nMeans as you can help them in the right way which is back in the place that they're coming from rather than encouraging him to walk across two thousand miles of Mexico where more and a present themselves here in the United states\nSome kind of a welcoming\nTo people who are desperate who were decided to march up to the United states nowhere else they they want to go there probably places where they could establish themselves more successfully and more immediately\nBut the United states backing and we simply cannot cannot uh\nAllow the fact that the people want to come here to allow people who wanted to come here who are willing to force the issue\n\nLet's go to a Kurt in Minneapolis Curt you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Vick give her kicking recall and I really admired question I ...
