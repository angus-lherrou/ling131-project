I have here than his comments on feminism or wrong\nI thought he was going to differ with me and he didn't mention it folks please for the good of the show\nTalked to me about what you told the screener you're calling about I Know you don't mean wrong but it's it just takes time for the program I I Would like you to read these were going to put these columns up from the Washington Post I've done this all three hours I have protein from these columns\nIs the junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage\nOr one of the most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to\nMichael thank you for their ... and you're right about those words if I said anything like that a my BS meter would go off I wouldn't be able to protect you can save the world by politics but my wife would just walk me upside the head\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them why we\nHate each other and how to heal and it's\nAlready a best seller and it should be because the very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics you didn't get us into this mess and politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by that\n[noise] yeah so I'm sure we're gonna talk something today about politics and why does matter so I don't want to mislead and have your audience and saying that it doesn't it surely does\nBut what we're going through right now ... even in the chaos in our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways we're going to\nProduce more total goods and services that in the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science weather turnout confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia of through philosophy of the allergy which has been rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation do you have some projects with co workers in your community the local were spent community if you have those things you tend to be happy\nThat's about rooted in it and get our technology at letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this rootless age and so\nTraditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera there and collapse and so we're trying to find meaning brand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can as emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with a Americans believing that you're either all on our side or you're on the other side and the other side as pure evil and our side as pure good\nThat kind of political talk flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal uh relationships and support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nAnd did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys\nAnd anti thought and and\nThe two groups of of Todd's who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and they follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [noise]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh\nIf you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and you beat up somebody from antifa how does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs were kind of lovable\nRight exactly and they could sing uh it it turns out that you know if\nYou if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that but the great quick kit\nUh take down it's good to just sort of a pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agreed with you but you don't persuade anybody that by and so when people use all these war metaphors for politics I think it's sort of miss understands what we think of the American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics maintained a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can drive and flourish the things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with yet in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well but\nA lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural or tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about 'em but the loneliness a lion you used there are half as many friends in America\nAre in the last twenty seven years what does that mean social science day that showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three point two friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half as many forty percent of Americans have either to zero or only one Koch to not into all there is a loneliness like out there\nAnd a whole bunch of people go to politics say at least I can figure out how to have a um an enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska is a book a new book is called them why we hate each other and\nHow to heal um let me try to make a case and you can ... down if you choose a that that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing\nIs the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice cabinet they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump\nThat we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness\nThat we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings that's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile\nAnd very destructive folks\n[noise] yes so let me uh overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one week so the the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely want the Republican I'm One of them not just\nA expand extend our majority of the fact that I Want the Republicans to\nTo win and the house um\nBut at the ... after that I felt so say I'm the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred and the U.S Senate so if you look at anybody score card on on who the most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody scorecard so I'm not in different uh on political matters and\nThe this is not an argument hey let's just solving couldn't buy off and how much your mental there's really nobody more conservative than I Am\nBut I think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might do something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if that retake the house\nStopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's going to satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great but it means average duration that uh from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two\nAverage tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter\nOne of the things that means is you don't have relationships with your co workers that last over the course of a lifetime\nAnd nails in particular aren't actually good at forming new relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and their country politics can fix that problem rebuilding their neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood I Do I I Do I joined with\nA local civic organizations that me and I'm more likely to know the person who lives two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd uh that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post on our website at Michael Mann that dot com or a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith\nAnd you do talk about uh the the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues or have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\nYeah ... well fed so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time I'm In the in the same way that deep friendship and stick a nuclear families and shared work\nAre heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well that we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family you have a few friends do you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical feel logical framework to make sense of death or suffering\nThat drives happy that but one of the other things that happens in your local worshipping community is you're with people at an intergenerational context overtime\nAnd it turns out that I've got two teenage daughters and the younger side as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nThey really think the accident of birth year defines almost all the people they should associate with\nOkay so how do how do we fix it I Want to get to that was Senator Ben Sasse his new book is them\nWhy we hate each other and how they feel there's so much in this book about where we can go not just in politics of course but in our personal and economic lives will be right back when Senator Ben Sasse white [noise]\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want what\nThey don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve a long term problems they're trying to make politics the center of a gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future I'm speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group to bleed and had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when it's being to you today a talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there is only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there was less than ... printing constantly for the cameras and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative thick of the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative or rather than the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican or the legislature people do not officially pockets that aren't really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a state legislature\nAnd so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with ... or term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bill that's cost effective uh\nThere's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have slightly different priorities of which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by a dog if the federal politics do what they should in America unconstitutional hooked up with your maintain a framework for ordered liberty appropriate idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights\nGovernment the author of sorts of right then government give you a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back and communities where people actually\nLive next door to their neighbors what ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's\nPart of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska all I can say is keep it up senator we need you there in Washington and across the country\nAnd the book

at yesterday's asked every federal department to do a five percent type which should go a long way\nTo at least slowing the growth and the deficit but one of the things you hear is a line which is\nThat because the tax cuts the government is taking in less money that the tax cuts of a lead to less revenue actually revenue when a\nRevenue when I'm not much but it was already high but revenue went out of the most recent since the tax cuts of of come in by zero point four percent increase\nIt's not a reduction how do I know this it's in the New York times okay it's in the New York times in their official government numbers check it out tax cuts do work go to tax cuts work dot com right now send a message to your members of Congress\nTo preserve and protect the tax cuts and or not to kill prosperity\nWith the heavy hand of government tax cuts were dot com\nIn the United states we are beyond forty percent\nAnd were perhaps approaching a day or the statisticians say\nNot so long from now where the majority of children will be born a into unwed families now there are a couple of reasons why this situation is dire\nAnd they're in a couple of other reasons why it may not be quite as dire as we would suppose\nBut let me at first I give you some of the background or that is put together through a new report from yup you've got at the United nations the United nothing and it also puts America's problems in the context of the rest of the world if you believe it's no problem at all\nThat we have almost half of the children born in the United states born into an ... married couple or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number\nThe story from Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling culture signaling cultural and economic shifts that are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations\nForty percent of all births in the U.S now occur outside of wedlock\nThat is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy was that means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has gone up for\nThe percent why would that be\nThis report was issued by un FDA that as the United nations population on is the largest international provider\nOf sexual and reproductive health services says\nThe number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage\n\nThey eat eat you report says likely sees more births out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare\nSo said the senior advisor in economics for the un FBI his name is Michael heroin and in an interview\nHe said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives given where parents support beyond what a partner\nAnd provide\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock\nThat a good thing you think developmentally the government can do a better job than parents or even the government can do a\nBetter job than some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLook the problems with a single parent families are fairly obvious\nBut one of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nAnd maybe a bit overstated is at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but have decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent\nAt least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage ended up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of any of it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by only one or the benefits of marriage\nWas one of those things if you've spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately\nIt's an extra pair of hands it's an extra pair of eyes it's a extra love that can be provided to the child and if you have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to provide an income\nWell what happens to the child or two children\nAnd this is not to blame the single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes was single mothers but it's very\nVery difficult and single fathers same thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be putting up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal I think it's very destructive\nAnd if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood\nOf being involved in poverty criminality\nSelf destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with the child\nIs increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd somebody can say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the studying things in this from the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... since the decision that basically\nAuthorize gay marriage for every state in the union\nLess than one percent of been same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number\nAnd that's shockingly low because a lot of people it assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one percent the the highest rate for gay marriage in the country was there'll be shot San Francisco Seattle a second but even in San Francisco their dream about one point for nine\nPercent of all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the EU are predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says\nThe data suggests that societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce has changed\nSaid Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed\nI I I don't believe that it is in other words it was it fairly common in American Life to have what we are cold shutdown weddings where a couple\nActually concedes the baby before they're married not recommended but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby as well come into a married home\nOf course that's more desirable and and by getting married you were making a commitment to that child into each other just someone\nDown the idea that in most cases then of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most cases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father\nLet's or go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio Andrea you're on the man that show\nThanks for taking my call you back um so um for me um I have a wonderful husband and um\nI I think that parents have to be mentally president they have to be physically present they have to be mentally president and whether you're a single parent or whether you're fortunate enough to have a spouse\nUm you have to be there for them and and unfortunately when it's just one person that half he'll carry the burden of thing they're physically and emotionally and spiritually um you can't do it all\nAnd you you can't specially if you're earning a living and ... and look at its it's very difficult and this was not to say the preschool is an important and doesn't represent an important alternative\nIt's just that you see if we have in this country such a a an inclination to not make value judgments\nIs that leads us to be blind to the fact that it is more desirable for each child to come into the world in a married a household if we can establish that\nAnd agree on that\nThen we have lost the whole idea of constructive social norms one of the constructive social norms that is worth\nMaintaining it seems to me is not applauding open racism or open anti Semitism or open racial or religious hatred of any kind so why are Democrats still applauding and open a hater we will get to that question to coming up on them and that show\nThat often a parent would die in the trial would or maybe you have to wait what their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this could be done successfully as long as we are open minded in in the capture these tranche\nWhat what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse that would\nThat would uh specifically be alert to kids living in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government daycare centers\nI think that we're getting good care of show would be one way I think manners where you do you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay how do I let me just mentioned something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what they're sometimes families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children and their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially\nWith their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate this book or I or I'm going to say this where she cut defense spending because it's just it's just not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when he salmon I hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on the interest on the national debt\nThan we are on the fence and in my opinion I think the end opinion and most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs are the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and it's been shown by a wealth of books and information ah\nThere is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that that blew the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system has been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society\nActually encouraged out of wedlock birth and there are Democrats who are written about that than you'll Patrick moynahan [noise] who was a moderate Democrat road\nAbout the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are the government's role wars out of wedlock for of course they're going to get more of that we'll be right back uh with

who were attacking cars and motorists in Portland we're broiling in the streets in New York City says\nMom that fits but sometimes\nThere are people who get great respect in fact there's someone who has been a very close and an inspiration to a prominent candidate on the ballot\nAs three weeks from now Nineteen days from now\nI'm not talking about Keith Ellison the nominee for attorney general and Minnesota who's not only been accused very credibly of sexual assault by his former girlfriend\nAnd who has supporting evidence et cetera et cetera ... cameras have been much worse\nBut Keith Ellison has also been affiliated and refused to repudiate Louis Farrakhan\nAnd uh\nAnd tell me if if this sounds like somebody who is very much concerned about building bridges\nAnd are helping\nEncourage understanding across racial and religious lines here as minister Farrakhan\nDon't like fog [noise]\nSome of them respect me\nBut those who have been out to sea\nAgainst than me I'm not married with two\nMembers of the Jewish community that don't like to\nA she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan\nBecause if you look at far town's history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country the idea that he should be on stage as he was that Aretha Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people in as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill that deserves some kind of sanctioned go ahead like yeah I\nI I understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are you know very hatred of their hateful of of whites where it's coming from ... in a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them at the people over time whereas the other direction when\nIt was the Nazis or whomever it was attacking people not because they did anything to them they made off and fear if the area than made up that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I understand\nBut if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also ... director so the Armenian people were cruel to the Turks and they were undermining it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith and there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you ought to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people should John you\nLet's go to Calvin in Columbus ohio Calvin you're on the ...\nAnd Michael thanks for taking my call you that one I just wanted to mention a little bit uh I Do agree with a lot of what you're saying and I absolutely don't condone any type of not use them but I Do think that a calling out real issues um\nIs not a bad thing for instance two percent of the population to the world which

Party protestors in two thousand Thirteen a mom\nIt's a talking point Michael and you can't be above that nonsense if you partake in it okay\nHere's the challenge to you out there and I'll take calls

they think about those code paying more ons who continually\nContinuing continually was literally several times in our disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings who flooded congressional offices one of the

think they have two hundred thousand people there that a ton of people\nAnd they made a very big point of asking people to pick up their litter and you can compare that to the inauguration crown or any inauguration crowd it you cannot compare and the same way that very very\nRegularly or there would be people dispatched to conservative political rallies and yes this includes Trump rallies to try

your calls to Jake in Philadelphia Jake you're on the ... that show it's disagreement day\nThat Michael I disagree with your use of a term anti Semitism it should be anti Judaism and hatred of Jews and their religion\nWell no uh because of Hitler made a a very big point of killing people including people who were Jews would converted to Catholicism or there there is a saint of the Catholic Church who was a former Jewish communist intellectual earlier\nHello what Hitler's friend or the sound like the mafia of Jerusalem\nOkay right I ... I understand but the term anti Semitism was originally coined in Europe in central direct by a hold on hold on and it was coined by people to describe a hatred of Jews and you're right the Jews have been European for a long time\nBut this argument about a ... whether it is it real anti Judaism is it is not a\nReligious argument that goes down to religion\nIt does not go down to religion you heard that I I'm ...
