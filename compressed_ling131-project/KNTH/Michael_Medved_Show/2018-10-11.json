understood as primarily of course it meant don't steal property but first and foremost meant don't steal people don't kidnap\n\nHow many people know that but I'm telling you people knew it I don't know how people defended slavery on the basis of the Bible the notion that the you know one of a no was songs ham it was\nA was cursed because he was black and it's it's it's so stupid it's so

tell them\n\nAnd I here's a here's an interesting one for you I just spent ten days and I just had to take one day off I mean it's I tell you the truth I ever impressed myself I don't I've never said that [laughter] it's not the way I think but\nThat I Do the show and I knew the column and I do but speaking of I'd be ... or you and I'm writing this I look back and I think whoa when did I find time\nBut I did take ten days with three other people are\nJust reading all day long except for the show but yesterday took off because the the two of the three left yesterday left today\nSo here's an interesting one for you right you all know this verse every one of you and even if you're a secular if you don't know what it's really a sign of biblical illiteracy and gods said in the third verse of the Bible let there be like what light as\nInteresting question isn't it it's perplexed me and my whole life I thought until I Would say until this past year finalizing genesis that that was the big bang which\nWould which makes perfect sense and by the way I Can't prove that I'm right but I've spoken to scientists only scientists about that first one or two but both of them are astrophysicist one in Israel one in the United states one of his MIT one is Cal Tech\nI mean these are big guys\nGerald shorter and ... and I uh I asked them well actually uh he would already written this and I so I mean he's been on my shoulder number of time anyway this is the thinking and it makes sense to me it was the son\n'cause a lot of you if you look at a lot of the skeptics say oh how could there be vegetation before the sun the sun wasn't created so before the vegetation was was before that\nAnd this is one of their favorite I deal with all the objections to the Bible's authenticity in the course of my five volumes and they have made it clear this was the son in their understanding of science and scripture\nAnd what happens on the fourth day is the the the sun and the moon become visible remember the earth was covered by thick layer whether it was gas or moisture clouds so nothing was visible\nBut it was created and\nAs the astrophysicist in uh the physicist in in MIT and Israel set to me\nUh he ... he has seen photosynthesis take place\nOn a complete leak cloudy day plants do not need a visible sun in order to to grow and interesting so it's the visibility\nOf the sun takes place on the fourth day of creation or the twenty four hours a day is not adventurous to me that I mean I deal with it in the book but that's not the issue\n[noise] talking about for knowledge

Jackson Thomas John than Jackson\nFrom teaching at a a school for black children slave children in Lexington, Virginia a where he he was a professor of physics at Virginia military Institute anyway the point about all of this\nIs that some of the great intellectuals of the civil war period like Frederick Douglass were emphatically black he was born a slave and he could not only read he could write powerfully and many others could as well\nOr he um talks a little bit about some of his own challenges a here's Kanye West again speaking right in front of the resolute desk there in the oval office to the White House with President Trump\nWas diagnosed with bipolar disorder firewood connected with a neuro psychologist that works with the athletes\nAre the NBA NFL and he\n...\n\nFive percent of all human beings but it was probably a number for talkers obese I'm going to work with the other one Ninety eight percent ... ...\n... you know so he said\nThat actually walk that bipolar I actually got probation which could cause dementia ten to Twenty years from now I wouldn't even remember my son's day so all this power that I guess and I'll take my son to the game and all that I wouldn't be able to remember\nFrom a misdiagnosis some what we need it we can empower the pharmaceuticals\nAnd make more money uh-huh um\nSleep deprivation look at it can be a serious problem and again this is something bragging about his IQ tests and things like that\nOr he's not talking about his great grades you got in school but there are other prominent public figures who have the same kind of confidence in their own cognitive ability uh finally I'm ... spoke about his gift to the president of the United states\nHigh prices\nUh I brought a lot of kids with me right here um\nThis right here\nPlaying one is a high\nPlay and this is president Ryan looked at as or [noise]\nOr get rid of\nStuff like that\nWhat we're going to have ample American Company and work on the ...\nOkay um I I I think that for the secret service should review the hydrogen powered plane before President Trump flies on it or one of the things it's amazing about this\nIs the unbelievable indignation\nExpressed by people in the mainstream media which I think his way over the top if you have a reaction to ah the Kanye West meeting of minds with the president of the United states or if you believe that this is I'm\nJust further evidence that we are approaching some kind of cataclysmic civil war there was a matter of a U.S senator and his wife being threatened with the heading we'll get to that and more coming up on them invention\nAnd we're not we're not a ... where you have it at all I some of that stuff that was said I'm as we warned you at the top uh there was a bit of profanity we there was actually more than you heard we we were able to avoid some of it out [noise] um but there was a ... it didn't make it in there [noise] um that was crazy\nThat ...

vulnerable comment um I don't know maybe\nCould breach stage that scene in field of dreams where are the Kevin Costner characters searching the ability to play catch with is that\nAnd maybe President Trump can play catch with Kanye West um why was Jim Brown there\nThis does anybody know now Jim Brown one of the greatest football players who ever lived he has an extensive criminal record and I I

I think you were going to try to help us a little bit with ah some of what it was that you think Kanye was really trying to communicate the core message\nParents you with us no I guess he has not\nGood now you were going to say what do you think the important message that Tonya was communicating\nVery far to communicate a poor black people to overall exercise their mind your ability to pay and look at their most recent history and question yourself why every black community across the country have Martin Luther king boulevard and run down\nBut it's been um governed by Democrats you know you can't say in one day and that you care for a second man ... living in a situation that you would not advocate for your own home if I Love you advocate for things that I Know that\nSuccessful in my family and I want to promote those things whether it's like not\nYou know the world is paying attention and so I think what kind of thing you know we need to um to expand arriving clinically economic otherwise and make the thumb of the people who claim the love of the history of a blessing\nAnd that that I think you said it beautifully and I wish that ah Kanye West to communicated that message as well as you to Terrence thanks for the call\nA look let let me make this clear here there was so much over done media outraged judges jotted down some of the stuff that they were saying and CNN and they said a man who is clearly not okay\nOh together with a president who's willing to exploited they both are very ego driven bonkers off the rails I it's it's way way out of line\nThat used a very derogatory term in reference to her being quote a member of the algae Beatty community\nAirs a this little more than Anna airs was also on the publishing board she was a former columnist for the

call\nThe threat Centre cowardly weaken worthless okay I Will go with that\nShe said you may find me revolting and worthy of a threat on my life but in reality it as your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you beeping beep beep\nI Am proud to be who I Am and nothing you could say or do will ever change that okay good I'm Glad you're proud or earlier this week airs was arrested by Ohio University of police for sending threats to herself\nShe was charged with making three false reports to police or false report of this nature is considered a first degree misdemeanor she faces a maximum penalty of six months in prison and one thousand dollar fine for each charge\nNow usually\nWhen they have these hate crime hoaxes and there are lots of them up they're treated lenient like she probably won't get the six months ago I think she should\nTo uh take up police time this kind of phony nonsense is is disgusting and it's a way of attacking America because it\nTries to lead people to believe that somehow America's festering with hate hate that you may feel for yourself and you generate a for yourself to make yourself look like a victim\nMost important thing to say every day I Am not a victim and refuse to be a victim Tom and Philadelphia you're on the Michael Mann that show\nSaid the right word hey that's a shame right now the white liberal media is offset that there's two black gentleman well known gentleman sitting in the White House talking to the president\nAbout reaching out and helping in the black community starting in the city of Chicago and and and the liberal media it's all upset that they're on federal discussing\nWell again and it's it's it's inappropriate now look do I think that this was a high level meeting a no but it any\nPresident would do this ... major celebrity he is breaking ranks to show strong support for the presidents of course the price is going to encourage it and the idea that how can the president do this when people are suffering in Florida the president's been very outspoken e spoken many times about the horrible devastation from hurricane Michael\nAnd I actually think the president's also done a fine and preemptive\nJob I'm preparing\nThe relief agencies for dealing with a situation here was that Chris Matthews on MSNBC was attacking Trump for doing something else while this Florida thing was going on we will will play that in in just a moment\nBut the whole idea that somehow because we have this hurricane\nOr the president isn't allowed to do something else or somehow shows disrespect look\nThis entire obsession\nWith President Trump I think isn't working for Democrats and shouldn't because we're coming up to an election it's going to decide the direction we want to go\nAnd honestly I think that when you take a look at situations like this hurricane and a lot of Republicans up there on the Florida Panhandle but there are a lot of Democrats too and there are a lot of people don't really care that much about politics they all need help and support\nAnd I think they're getting that both from their state government under the great governor of Florida Rick Scott\nAnd they're getting it from the federal government doing a decent job so the freak out and the attempt to make this count politically against the president\nSeems to me utterly inappropriate when we come back I'll tell you what I'm with Chris Matthews has to say the no thrill up his leg but he is um he's angry at President Trump for what they're doing something you know other policy has ever done right well we'll get to

NAFTA\n[noise] yeah you know until my son and final form Michael to the Congress\nWe're only getting bits and pieces we liked to have the whole formal a proposed a grammar but it looks like it was twenty to rather than reform in other words a little bit here a small amount of dairy products going over the Canadian border\nThe Mexicans got a little bit the sky ran out of this craziness were Canadian Mexican corporation can sue the federal government saying they go\nLosses because of health and safety regulations in place but it was not to reform its full subordinates to commercial power the labor environment and consumer rights of all free country\nAnd right now we had another terrible day on Wall street the Dow Jones industrial average is down\nMore than five hundred points they were down eight hundred and thirty points yesterday so it's a very very big loss or an over at Wall Street a lot of people are saying that's big cause of this talk of a trade war with China do you buy it\nYeah that's part of it and the other is fear of higher interest rates are screwed for small savers by the way they've been Sean of any income for a decade with one tenth of one percent interest rate and banks and money markers\nAnd the third thing Wall Street is generally about hasn't happened yet is inflation\nAnd so can you imagine after all the stuff on Wall street it's still I think bomber was on January first\nUh-huh and so what does it\nIf you say because what you say white isn't too late to reverse course how would you like to see America reverse course\nWell by taking changes in our country redirect hands supported by liberals and conservatives you know that's my argument and if you do that by\nRestoring inflation guarded minimum wage requirement and workers making less than ... inflation adjusted wages in Nineteen\nSixty eight or ... turn a flu matter for free choice of doctor and hospital much less expensive and starting enforcing the law against drug industry and other health industry\nAnd let me let little pricey let me just wander around for a moment and Medicare for all and by the way I um I there\nThere are millions and millions of Americans who depend on Medicare who needed who'd a live\nOr be closeted and a ... ... how where do you find the money to pay for Medicare or a a literally a hundred million people may be more who have never paid in to Medicare\nWell plenty of places number one it's a much more efficient system so you're cutting your management of expenses that over twenty two percent through about four percent that's experience in Canada\nWorking but wait and wait and hope you're talking about right now there are literally tens of millions of people I think the number is well over a hundred million I think it might be close to two hundred million who are covered by workplace insurance at least in part\nYeah so uh where where do you get this money to put them on Medicare\nWell they wouldn't have to pay their insurance the employers wouldn't have to pay they'd be more competitive with Canadian and foreign company companies that have their insurance paid by a public sources\nSo isn't it isn't that isn't that a big giveaway during the ...\nThe tax system is crazy I mean you know you've got corporations today paying ... percent ... percent tax look at the banks looking at apple and they're they're they're paying virtually nothing or some workers paying twenty three twenty five percent tax going to work every day\nAt the other thing is I Can't run a cough or offer I Know you agree with that that's hundreds of billions of dollars a year\nAnd the other thing is to crack down on criminal fraud there's there was fraud on Medicare from these fend on sixty billion a year just on Medicare so after effect the corrupt inefficient discriminatory system that increase lending saying to the American people paying die\nOkay politically do you think any of these things can possibly happen say if the Democrats take over the house and the Republicans maintain control of the Senate and President Trump continues as he will as our commander in chief\nYeah I think the the wage increases supported by Seventy five percent of the people without even a campaign because all these people\nYou're talking about increasing the minimum wage and\nMen are more and and you see Amazon now is going up to Fifteen although a couple of ... so a lot of these companies and you know Wal Mart is going towards twelve dollars the federal seven dollars and twenty five cents I think the Republicans I get the message on that politically for twenty twenty\nOkay so you raise the minimum wage let's say ... raised first stage even all the way to twelve dollars\nI'm given the fact that in in most big cities in many jurisdictions have already raised the minimum wage or does that have a profound effect on the American economy\nYou're increasing consumer demand people can buy more than ... necessities on the table you don't get many savings from increase minimum wage because they can't afford to pay and so I got to buy goods and services good for the economy I mean the consumer demand is two ferns are economy\nUm what about economic growth or what happens economic growth they have all of a sudden uh you are in increasing or the amount of pay you're offering at a time when even right now there's a labor shortage\nWelcome to the limit because millions of people have not come into the marketplace wherever smaller number of people have been paying jobs now than many years because of all the drop of people just couldn't get jobs in prior years\nNow the thing is you know remember Trump criticized him in the ... the unemployment rate when he's running for president called that fake now he loves it\n[laughter] you're only Twenty one hours a year or a wink Michael you're considering employed can live on that show and former just tyrants who for Twenty one twenty three hours you're considered employed so there's a lot of a lot of reserve labor there they can go into the market\nOkay um we're speaking with Ralph Nader his new book is called to the rampart see also calls for very major changes and reforms in our political system including jumping the electoral college they're actually a lot of Americans according to polling who agree with that but I\nActually it is a complete fantasy because it never ever can happen\nOr I Want to get back to Ralph Nader and we'll talk with your calls one eight hundred nine so I find Seventy Seventy think about how exactly you get rid of the electoral college without basically ... the whole amendment process and the constitution movie rights and\nMichael Mitchell wants to marry\nThe ah the states the various states who sign onto it or would be pledged\nTo actually gave them all the electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote so suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant which\nMakes us better being event naturalized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue stage very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nYeah next time Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college will get the rest of the states in a landslide\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who have ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican and John ... and\nTwo thousand part because of carrying guns sixteen thousand more votes and wouldn't carry Ohio and won the electoral college battle\nOr even know it got more votes popularly\nThat's true that's true it was a danger I I like the idea Ralph and I've talked about on the air before of everybody going to the Nebraska main system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you would have to really make it a nonpartisan not gerrymandered\nA portion of congressional districts what do you think about the idea that ... that's\nA step forward it doesn't go as far as the national popular vote dot com yeah that is a step forward I mean it's not going when you come in second in the popular vote in America and you lose the ... and you're winning the presidency ... what country does\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean and president Hayes wasn't a disaster some of his name President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of the success he's enjoyed so far Ralph Nader has enjoyed great success with his literary legal and even some political endeavors\nHis new book is called to the ram parts how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it's too late\nTo reverse course we're going to not reverse course but change course the Supreme Court in one state just declared that all of the people

a U.S and turkey Wall Street journal is reporting are expected to begin amending very difficult relations because turkey apparently has agreed\nTo release tomorrow a pastor Andrew Brunson\nWas being held for some time\nUh in Turkey on trumped up I mean really completely Trump to terrorism charges at all has to do a with the um Turkish obsession with this so one ... who's here in the United states but in any event or\nIs this would be very very good news\nAnd it probably also relates to what just happened at the consulate in Istanbul\nAnd that is the Turkish consulate\nA pardon me these Saudi consulate in Istanbul where\nThis journalists who is actually contributing columnist to American newspapers was American resident not an American citizen but a cush Yogi just disappeared and they have a video showing him going into the consulate\nBut he didn't come out just disappeared and it may be that in return for turkey releasing pastor Brunson which would be a very good thing and there'll be celebrations in and there should be\nBut in return for that the United states may cooperate using some of our security and policing resources\nTo help find out whether the Saudis really did murder this guy\nBecause even though right now we have very strong relations with Saudi Arabia and we have terrible relations with turkey if something like that in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul happened that was a criminal murder or some kind of rendition where they took him somewhere\nOn that is going to have consequences and this is going to be bipartisan\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six okay not such good news the Supreme Court in my state in the state of Washington\nStruck down the state's death penalty today ruling that it had been used in an arbitrary and racially discriminatory manner now there are not hundreds of people on death row in Washington there are eight\nWas this disapproval of the death penalty well that's not true now\nLet me let me go over some of the people who are on death row in the state of Washington and all these people have been given quite literally a new lease on life by the nine justices of the Washington state Supreme Court\nThey are virtually all ultra liberal and they should not be a decision that is made by the court if the legislature wants to eliminate the death penalty then that's okay but eliminating the death penalty for people who have already gone to trial who have been condemned who have been sentenced\nPeople like around but Robert league aids he's a serial killer is responsible for the deaths of more than a dozen women many in Spokane area he was convicted in two thousand and two for the murders of a twenty four year old named uh Melinda Mercer and the thirty five year old named ...\nThose killings were committed in peers county Washington he's been on death row things two thousand seventies white by the way\nThen there's Connor Michael shear him and I remember this case\nHe was convicted in the ...

concerned about keeping marijuana legal than a\nThan a protecting the victims and doing what's right what will that mean for him\nAnd ... and\nIn fact a kid I Will be relieved that would be completely release and feel like justice and served\nOkay he's entirely correct and that's particularly horrifying case and and that idea that the court intervenes on behalf of someone like that I mentioned that there was another case that shows you exactly why you need this by the way ... also white\nThe and I mentioned that because the Supreme Court is using racial injustice as the basis for\nThrowing out the death penalty on these folks who have all been arrested they've been tried they've been been investigating been convicted again and again and again and again\nAnd they deserve the death penalty\nParticularly Byron sure why he was convicted of killing a correctional officer named Jamie bendel by strangling her with an amplifier chord inside a chapel at the Washington state reform and to her in Monroe, Washington that was in two thousand eleven sure if there's a convicted rapist she was in prison serving a life sentence\nOkay do you get the point is already serving a life sentence

five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number you can also reach us\nBy Twitter and we've had a\nBig upsurge in our a Twitter activity recently I think a lot of its surrounding the Brett Kavanaugh issue but uh you can reach us with a tweet a disagreeing tweet\nBy going to a ... men that show on Twitter that's at Medford show one word on Twitter okay this came in from John in ... Washington\nHe says yesterday a caller proposed that we are in the Cold War and a political sense he rejected it and he had trouble defining you stated that the object of a war is to\nDefeat an enemy actually I didn't say that I said the object of a war is to destroy an enemy is to kill your enemy and wreck\nHis stuff just wipe them out it's not just defeat\nJohn says this is exactly what is going on meaning to defeat an enemy not to destroy him the Democrats have decided to use any means necessary to defeat the Kavanaugh nomination\nThey've abandoned all decency it is a\nCold War because bullets are not being shot\nBut there is no question the Democrats mean too politically professional and socially killed Brett Kavanaugh it is a Cold War\nAnd now Kavanaugh and his family are getting death threats if this is not a Cold War Michael I don't know what would be a Democrats have Declared Political unprofessional war against this man looks the term Cold War is also misunderstood\nWhat people mean by Cold War is limited war\nIt was not bloodless we lost fifty eight thousand\nAmericans in Vietnam we lost almost forty thousand in Korea uh during so cold Cold War we lost countless\nOther Americans and different hot spots around the world are there were very\nCertainly an episode of the Cold War was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the push back against that a lot of people who died and I do think it is wrong to analogize the idea of\nOf trying to smear and discredit somebody and wreck his career I think it's despicable I think what the Democrats did was despicable I think their whole handling of the capital matter was shameful and unconscionable and wrong and his right to\nBe condemned but to call it murder\nIs also obliterated distinctions and I think sanctions need to be restored to our public debate I'll give you one example\nI woke up thinking about this is people are now talking about everybody as a survivor right and anybody who\nWas ever complained about sexual misbehavior some guy no matter how far in the past or how limited that in this behavior is now a survivor of abuse\nAnd I was thinking of Anita Hill and this is not to say that if Clarence Thomas were guilty of the things he's accused of that it would be justifiable indefensible would have been wrong\nBut the idea that any to heal the survivor what did she survived exactly\nShe survived um some rude comments that made her uncomfortable that song\nNo charges any workplace consequences to her work by Clarence Thomas no charges that he ever touched her\nI I mean to say that\nAs a survivor and somebody who's been raped at knife point is also a survivor of there's a difference and yes there's a difference between Bill Cosby and Les Moonves if you want Bill Cosby drugged people\nThat's more serious and\nTo lose all perspective to say that we are now dealing with the civil war because we're dealing with a moral issue the equivalent of slavery\n... it's it's just wrong\nAnd no one expects that there are big parts of America that are going to have their duly constituted governments leave the union form armies and we're all going to be finding one another and they're going to be hundreds of thousands were killed\nSo the analogy with a civil war I think detracts from people's engagement with reality where you can make a real difference in bringing America to a more constructive place by voting in this election I Hope everybody does\nAnd vote for sanity and insanity\nMean stop the talk of impeaching Kavanaugh stopped to talk of impeaching Trump stopped to talk of oh my goodness this is the ... total nightmare as The Handmaid's tale we're losing all our liberties and the women are being ground down as\nThe end of the world get a grip we have some problems in this country but hysteria doesn't help and solutions let's go to North ridge California Eric you're on the ... that show disagreement day\nMike I'm a longtime listener conservative here\nAnd um I Do agree that this commentary about a civil war is a over rot in its comments but I disagree with you you\nAre in that I Do see a future of separation coming [noise] a rich and the student reformed calls and what's actually coming to this coming on the horizon for our country is a divorce\nIt's like you know that there's gonna be a war you are yourself or just building this up with this idea that there'd be hundreds of thousands of people killed we have a great separation and we have a mechanism available to us and I'm Wondering why what what\nIs the ... what's the mechanism\nOh say they're just one moment let me say this we talked about before why would you deprive be one of the great rights provided to me in the constitution and that's the freedom of association\nI Know you and you have you with us completely fine anymore than don't but you you live in the same country with them you live in the same country with them there is no right in the constitution for secession it doesn't exist you know and\nThat's like we discuss before it's lots of session what it is is the solution of the union which has provided through article five mechanism is available through article five and would not be a war\nOkay how what how was that was a mechanism provided for dissolution of the union they never anticipated that and it's not there there's an article five a convention of the states is to propose changes in the constitution that still have to then be approved by three quarters of the states the\nMike I called in about a year ago you had a constitutional scholar on and he agreed you simply don't\nWant no no no no I it's it's it's if you believe a convention of the stage could provide for the dissolution of the union or you just have to then get three quarters of states devote to dissolve the union and they want\nAs a student of history Mike I Want to quote something to winning the course of human events it becomes necessary or want people to dissolve the bands that bind them to another\nVet event that African I could have done it to another it's not buying disconnected them but but go ahead okay so ...\nDark what ration of independence and our great founding fathers realize that these things happen in the\nCourt okay so in a shell me telling me what you believe is the issue that is worth dissolving the union over\nWell you're in you crush me on that before and a half before you and you've never wanted to answer and that is the\nKilling the murder of over forty million American\nBabies that al ... actually written into the Democrat platform\nOkay again that can be a reason you don't want to associate with Democrat but frankly right now we have made tremendous progress in reducing the abortion rate\nBut if you think that somehow it will help to save lives to save the lives of the unborn by breaking up the United states of America which is the greatest force for good in the history of human kind [noise]\nI think your ... how we will be right back\nOn disagreement day siege disagree with one eight hundred nine five five Seventy Seventy six so Michael May\nA long time over the last ten years arguing about that it's more than ten years when Bill Clinton was first elected president and he came in and Nineteen nineties yeah\nMichael who's working for working for the medical industry the insurance industry and the attorneys stylish is\nThis is great for them to have gotten extremely wealthy and powerful ... by doing nothing except tried it off to the courts weren't sure the executive branch out to the laws you talked\nVery OK well wait wait wait wait wait I again when you talk about some kind of establishment conspiracy was the establishment for Obamacare or was it against Obamacare\nSport\nOkay ah then ... you will agree with me that there wasn't a very significant difference of opinion between Republicans and Democrats or wasn't a single Republican not even one in either house and Congress who voted for Obama Care\nAbsolutely okay there's not an issue there but wait\nWait you're saying that they were nowhere this issue the last had their own approach to medical care which I think was the wrong approach which is that what about medical care needs to improve his more government involvement I think we would all benefit from less government involvement\nAnd art and people having more freedom of choice and getting their own insurance arrangements that it it seems to me is going to be one of the challenges for the next two years for President Trump and the Republicans if we maintain our majorities in Congress we we've got to continue moving in that direction\nThe idea that these issues that you bring up\nThat aren't instantly resolved ah it it doesn't mean that there's some kind of establishment conspiracy look\nThere are a lot of people in the United states of America who are doing a lot better in the last two years and it is not just rich people\nThe ah the fact is that if you look at the wages that have been going up I mean even Ralph Nader acknowledge that when we were talking to him on the economic growth that has happened in the last two years\nHas benefited everybody in the country\nAnd look we've got two bad days on Wall street I Hope that won't be the end but you see the the problem with all these ideas about some all knowing establishment is it trying to put some order some fake water into what is by its very nature a very does orderly and sometimes chaotic process\nI it is disagreement day on the Michael ... bed show that means that is your day to take me on on issues\nWhere you think I Am flat out wrong all you have to do is falling through one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nUh when we come back somebody says I've hit the
