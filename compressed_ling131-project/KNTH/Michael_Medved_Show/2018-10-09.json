people short a Donald Trump won a majority of the boats excluding California\nAnd these people want freedom but the government is forcing us in the position that basically making us cry uncle and my health insurance premiums have doubled since Obama Care how would you like to live in the ... and the county where no health insurance\nAnd you know people who say single payer Medicare for oh what what sound very appealing from early\nWait wait wait that's my point ... wait wait forgive me that's what people would like they ... they would like single payer for all I I I Would be very interested to see if we took a national vote only on that question would you like to nationalized healthcare everyone is covered and doesn't have to pay\nDues would just take it out of the ...\nPeople now are forced to want that because the health insurance premium for double double\nRight oh no no no All right so you have no no no no no I hear what you're saying so you have very articulate spokespeople on the other side saying folks don't vote for that your premiums will go down if we have medicine the same way we have food and everything else competitively\nPriced so we will have articulate people argue I Am I hear you perfectly\nThey'll say no no no don't worry you will have premiums obviously because it's going to be a private insurance market\nAnd then the other side will say folks don't you just want to be taken care of and not have this worry every civilized country in the western world after all has nationalized healthcare they're doing fine just ask your Canadian friends\nAnd I I Would be very curious to see what the voters\nWhere I mean that's the direction we're moving into Michael that's the point my not selling the American people short\nThe American people are ... are people and they have been de Americanized in terms of values that's what's happened American people who still from liberty in God we trust e pluribus unum the American trinity aren't going to vote for nationalized healthcare\nBut people for whom liberty secondary to being taken care of they will and by the way and that's part of the reason is that people who believe in ... more government than liberty walk more immigrants because no matter by the way it doesn't matter where the immigrants come from\nHim every immigrant comes from a country on a society that values being taken care of more than liberty\nBecause there's only one country on earth that values liberty more than being taken care of and that's the United states\nSo it doesn't matter where the person comes from\nFrom Asia from Latin America from Europe they\nAll the immigrants the great majority of them not all by any means dropped the word all the great majority come from countries societies mindsets that value being taken care of more than they value liberty\nThat's one of the reasons for the great yearning for more immigrants if it is more people\nVoting on behalf of bigger government the bigger the government the

to replace her at the United nations\nWe'll also talk about a new poll which shows what seems to me to be a contradiction to CNN poll and it shows that support for President Trump\nIs going up and going up fairly dramatically at the same time support for Brett Kavanaugh's going down so\nWhat's the story there we will get to that and also to the arrest of a a teacher for something\nHe tweeted\nAnd it's something that is very very much shows he is whoa I he is clearly on the left and he also is just lost his job what could he possibly have said that would cause him to lose a job we

marijuana is a profoundly addictive drug or we will get to that as well but first the reactions\nTo what is going on in our country right now to the swearing in ceremony last night a judge Kavanaugh was already sworn in as justice Kavanaugh on Saturday Night so he's been an official member of the Supreme Court for a while\nBut President Trump I think very rightly wanted to stage a formal swearing in and it was a wonderful occasion\nHe had a judge Kavanaugh's family there he had all the justice was the Supreme Court with their Ruth Bader Ginsburg was there dancing and celebrating and oh he's seeing if you ... uh no that's not true that part but she was there\nAnd uh that's that's appropriate and that's important and I think the judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke\nVery well and President Trump a President Trump did not speak as outrageously or as badly as a liberal media are trying to suggest and we'll get to that place of of where you can tell you why but first off\nOn this issue of civility which remains a very very big and divisive issue in the country but there was a contribution to civility\nFrom a contributor over at MSNBC and this is very much appreciate because it puts the situation and such good focused and this is a big contribution from Eli missed all\nAbout making a deal with the devil\nBacks up his Vargas alright the devil does not Trump hasn't delivered for these people on the things that they care about most the of the liver racism for these people he delivered massage any for these people\nAnd now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something they've been trying to get for a generation we're going to see if if this way but they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see it this way last for three days for two years\nFor sounds like\nA thousand you're right that's a house in ... vice that's of\nCourse what a Adolph Hitler proclaimed in his house in ... lasted exactly twelve years a look at ... ... ... when he says has delivered for these people are we back to the basket of deplorable is is that we're we're told me who are these people to whom President Trump is delivered racism and massage any\nAnd where is the messiah Janine American Life right now\nIs it a the idea that there is a lack of civility on the right how was it civil to suggest that a President Trump\nIs making a deal with President Trump is a deal with the devil or the the people to whom he has delivered massage any and racism and corruption and horror and misery and and\nJust general awfulness are actually diabolical one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this\nUm Tom ... who was invested I think it's upwards\nOf twenty million so far I think it's way above twenty million might be upwards of fifty million so far he spent on ads pushing the impeachment of Donald Trump\nHe spoke out on who to blame for everything that is going wrong in America here's Tom Sawyer\nA group of very rich very entitled white men wanted to tell the rest of the country we are going to have our way and if you don't like it that is too darn bad\nAs far as I'm concerned the only thing everybody else can do now that the rest of America to go to the polls in November of ... those rich entitled white men that we exist and democracy exist\nOkay just a question um is Tom ... a man and so yeah he is I think he currently identifies a as a male even assist gender male\nIs the white yeah he's white is the rich yeah is he in titled yeah so I\nI don't understand this is this is all the fault of rich entitled white men and was this kind of thing going on on the left\nBasically suggesting that its\nRich and title white men who were controlling things against the public interest\nOr ...\nDoes it seem a little bit bizarre for the defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to say that what we need now is a new civility but there's only one way to achieve civility\nYou know what it is here's what she had to say on CNN\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate\nThat when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect his strength and you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDemean the confirmation process\nWhere were they the ones who brought up by drinking games in high school\nWhere they the ones who are brought up obsessively looking at a high school yearbook and even at general references in the high school yearbook\nHow is it that Republicans demeaned the confirmation process and and what about this notion that the only way that we can restore civility\nIs um is somehow to or\nHave the Democrats back in control heaven forbid one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six she also in the same interview Hillary said what was done last night and the White House was a political rally\nIt further undermine the image integrity the court and that

this\nBriefly and about Hillary saying that the swearing in ceremony was no good it was a political rally it was inappropriate here's the president\nWas yours [laughter]\nI guess that's where she lost she doesn't get it and she never did I knew that long ago\nHillary never got to\nThat's why she lost\nAnd and by the way when you talk about political event [noise]\nWas uh what judge Kavanaugh said political about wanting to be a justice who was fair\nHe said all nine of us just as the Supreme Court review the constitution and yes that includes Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor and Elena

dad addicted to pot and he writes about going to his first marijuana anonymous meeting in West Hollywood\nThat it'd be almost a year ago\nIt was friday night and the room was packed with addicts semi age with most younger struggling to recover a life lost to\nWeed and then he writes this and I think it's extraordinarily powerful I mean seriously powerful he says uh there's a reason that Alcoholics Anonymous started in Nineteen thirty five\nWhat's the reason that was two years after the end of prohibition alcohol abuse became rampant and the country almost rank itself off the rails\nWell the same thing happened with marijuana\nNow by the way this is really important because it's historically true most people think oh you know prohibition was a gigantic failure people drank just as much under a prohibition\nAnd then they ended prohibition and everything was happy this by the way it was a big Republican democratic issue was one of the first things have Franklin Roosevelt did when the Democrats came to power\nOr was and the prohibition amendments to uh go ahead and repeal\nProhibition of men but the truth of the matter is drinking did go up when prohibition went away it did go down when prohibition was imposed now was it worth it I'm not suggesting prohibition of alcohol I'm also not in the midst\nOf fighting a war here to reimpose prohibition on marijuana in Washington state\nBut here's the message from Neal Pollack says marijuana isn't alcohol or an opioid you cannot die from an overdose it doesn't really events physical cravings so is it better to call my problem marijuana dependence doesn't matter\nCandidate should be legal he writes justice alcohol should be legal but marijuana addiction exists and it almost wrecked my life\nConforms to my own recollections and experiences in college\nBecause what I'm Talking about okay if people were were teenagers in late teens\nAnd basically my freshman year in college pretty much everybody did beer that was the drug of choice and then all of a sudden boom\nIt's a Nineteen sixty six sixty seven and marijuana\nAnd there is no question that the cognitive impairment particularly things like short term memory loss and problem solving\nThere were there were many people including one two to three of the people that I room to it where it was it was a visible problem you could see it immediately wasn't subtle\nAuthors examined four thousand students and the Montreal region over four years starting when the average participant was about Thirteen Years old the students took yearly memory tests and self reported their alcohol and marijuana use those reports are kept confidential\nBy the fourth year three quarters of the students and consume alcohol at least occasionally well only about thirty percent use marijuana regularly but this study observe more daily marijuana users and alcohol users the study found some of the marijuana as negative effects were lasting\nA particularly troubling finding young cannabis users may cause long term damage to a brain function associated with substance abuse\nWhen studying response inhibition that's an individuals' ability to change their actions helped me to goal researchers found the teens using marijuana cause long term damage to their brains\nLet's go to John in Ventura, California Don you're on the Michael ...\nMichael things you've been [noise] I have a

this issue on the air and it's an important issue because right now there's a very very big industry that's involved in trying to get people to think oh this is just harmless good fun\nAnd I looked for most people who use marijuana I understand but you're talking about Seventeen percent that's one out of five people who take even a puff\nThat I learned that I Want to share with everybody and it's a lesson about\nWhy some people are so indignant\nAbout fake news and that's not to say that I'm not\nBig news about um indignant about this it's just that we've had\nBias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give you an example\nI um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen a lot\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley\nThat's a judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and are just\nAll the judges justices or the spring court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than Trump ruined dead as he does because what he said was outrageous and he was so off the rails any ruin that never before any spoil that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAs you know what when you watch it that is simply not true and let me tell you one\nArea where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw on NBC and very much on CNN which is deliberately misleading they made it sound as if a\nJustice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduced every they all walked in together and then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honored gas and fellow Americans at my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House\nAnd then after a welcoming everybody\nHe said joining us for tonight's ceremony as every sitting Supreme Court justice chief justice Roberts thank you Justice Thomas thank you\nJustice Ginsburg thank you Justice Breyer thank you Justice Alito thank you Justice Sotomayor thank you Justice Kagan thank you and justice Gorsuch now why in that order that's the order at which they were appointed to the court\nAnd then he said this in setting up how his particular performance of his duty and ... helping to watch the swearing in of the justice either a appointed how this was going to be different\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the cabinet or family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process how our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\n\nOkay and then he goes on to make the most controversial declaration he made in his statement he goes on to say that the justice a capital was proven innocent now okay he's not proven innocent\nBut he was certainly judged innocent by anybody who's reasonable enough to look at this and to look at the ... of evidence the bonds of evidence\nWas that anybody who was there at the time any of the name the witnesses agreed with him\nNot in saying that I Know this didn't happen but in the saying no I I don't remember this at all and I don't remember it at all like the way that\nChristine afford described it here's what President Trump said that use are\nUnder historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\n\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now from the bench of our nation's highest court\nYour father will defend the eternal\nIt's and freedoms of all\nAmericans you know [noise]\nOkay this is just fine and it's touching because you can look at the way the Kavanaugh family his daughters Margaret in life so we're looking\nUp at him and his wife ... when President Trump was saying these words and what he says saying he's a man of decency character kindness and courage\nThere is no one who has stood up to say anything different no one and and you\nKnow that if there were someone who said oh yeah ten years ago he cheated mayor ten years ago I saw him beating up somebody areas drunk or is that\nThey would have come forward they wouldn't be publicized a great deal the best they could do was to get three different women none of whom had any corroborating evidence\nWho were charging them with being a jerk freshman year of college\nOr in high school and [noise] sorry that doesn't\nTake away the idea that he has lived a lifetime showing himself\nTo be a man of decency character kindness encouraged President Trump\nConcluded\nMargaret allies as presidents tonight reminds us one of his historic\nYour father is all about it's about what kind of a nation we're going to be and what kind of a country our children will inherit\nIt is up to each of us and do all Americans watching tonight to answer that question\nIs up to us to reclaim our heritage of equal and impartial justice but his up to us to re dedicate ourselves to be traditions and wisdom of our founders and it is up to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection\nThat leave us falls to gather as one great American family [noise]\nAnything wrong with that it it doesn't seem to me there as it seems to me that President Trump was in the right spirit for the occasion as he was with these last comments introducing the actual swearing and listen\nJustice Kavanaugh fills the place left by Anthony Kennedy soon Justice Kennedy will administer the judicial both to Brett Kavanaugh\nJustice he did last year for justice Gorsuch\nThis will be the first time a Supreme Court justice has ever sworn in a former pork to take his seat\nA beautiful moment which reminds us that freedom is a tradition passed down from generation to generation that's a big state but I Want to thank you for that so much so [noise]\nIt is beautiful uh if if there's someone who really believes that this was a disgrace somehow that that President Trump ruin this occasion you can give us a call and tell us why 'cause I don't see it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd judge Kavanaugh spoke particularly beautifully and yes I I think that\nSome of that or changes with the senators at his hearing more and more testy than they needed to be and yes he didn't answer all the questions about as high school yearbook perhaps perfectly but you know what in the sweep of history I think President Trump is right the\nEntire process here as manipulated by the likes of Dianne Feinstein and and I asked you and uh and\nSpartacus and Mazie Hirono and a Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse and the rest of them that entire process will be remembered\nAs a sham and a disgrace and not a positive thing for the country so this is a good place to\nTurn forward and move ahead when we come back we'll we'll go to your calls\nOne eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six and we'll also play a most\nOf a judge Kavanaugh's justice Kevin O's brief but I think very moving and very well crafted remarks or we will be right back on the dawn of a new day and a new term for the Supreme Court of the United states coming up on that show [noise]\nReally is it is that seared using\nWhen President Trump including his remarks said I'm just up to us to read a A R sales to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the minds of love and loyalty and affection that link us all together as one great American family\nOkay he acknowledged that it was unusual when he was doing\nBut I Do think that the process that seat demise both Dr ... forward and justice camp and all that is a process was unusual and not admirable\nLittle in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\nSure Hi you're on\nA yeah I'm I mean I I don't\nYou know when I look at what what do you study was completely proven to be\nUm ... investigate all the people who were actual witnesses that we're likely\nWitness out more information it was not thorough process so from that go around and do that slap it in our face voted ... thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland slap it in our face and say it's proven innocent didn't even have a really only investigation\nOh wait what you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who are is the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that Ramirez woman [noise]\nI I understand or they they made a decision they made it because that was not their job what they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez is concerned I mean\nCome on come on it's it's\nThe idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think you're right not to do it\nWas going through a whole investigation of I'm Brett Kavanaugh's drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale or when he was a senior in high school why because it was irrelevant\nThe question was if if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that could could do for the fact what even said by the way Deborah married she said I was too drunk to really remember this is what you saw it happen and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd it's just his tank\nWhat relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court ...\nSo my feeling is you were treated ten times better than Obama anything Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer or what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about him no one's smearing him no one came up with things about his high school days or college days\nAnd probably because there is nothing but he did not get a theory\nThat doesn't mean you're treated horribly we'll be right that\nAnd traffic updated all set on a um ten Seventy\nOf Sri news on the seniors in Washington Nikki
