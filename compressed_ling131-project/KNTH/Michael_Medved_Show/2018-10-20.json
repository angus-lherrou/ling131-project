without you know and kind of evidence or\nOr ... or after Bruce you may well be right I mean but you cold in about feminism and you didn't talk about it and you can't do that folks I thought if I have here then is his comments on feminism or wrong\nI thought he was going to differ with me and he didn't mention it folks please for the good of the show\nTalked to me about what you told the screener your calling in about I Know you don't mean wrong but it's it just takes time for the program I I Would like you to read these were going to put these columns up from the Washington Post I've done this all three hours I have read to you from these columns\nPeople people who've used ... homeowners much like ah my listeners out there much like you people and so we'll be talking about that Tom decker welcome to the show how are you\nOh I'm doing great thanks for having me appreciate it\nIt's great to have you here my friend um [noise] I don't know if this is good or bad\nWe're going into cooler months cooler weather I think it's good but in the antique business it's you know pretty much your busiest time in the summertime in some ways people kind of panic they don't do what we said\nFor them to do in the off season in the offseason the cooler months we say get it done now because it'll be easier on Tom's crew 'cause it's not as hot you'll be able to get scheduled and you want even bill save more money in the cooler months uh on the actual install itself and then when it's hot you don't have to worry about it\nExactly know what it is cooling down so\nActually we probably have a little less panicky customers so it it's actually better 'cause then when we come out to do an evaluation on the addict if there's a lot of ... sometimes there's little things that need to be done\nA you know just kind of things that need to be taken care of and addressed and yet it we can do that when it's cooler we can spend more time in the\nIn the summer I hate to say that you get in a hurry but you can only spent so many hours in that kind of heat especially once it gets passed about one or two o'clock in the afternoon there's just too hot so we can do actually less jobs in the summer that we can in the winter so price things better this time of year so we can get you a better deal or we can do a better job and\nYou can save money you're around so this was a home improvement project so it's not necessarily you know you do it today and you're only going to benefit from what we did tomorrow it's this is a lifetime energy savings a lifetime of comfort in the house and that's why you actually\nDo take care of your attic there's things that you do and there's a reason why you do your editing or you get a higher resale value your house can actually be quieter when you insulated more because you have less sound coming from the addicts from outside through the addict\nUh ac system runs less your heating system runs less it means that border motives running less it means that compressor if they addicts is cooler to come there compressor has less pressure and because your system isn't being overloaded with which heat the higher the heat isn't the addict\nThe more heat the air conditioner trying to get rid of the higher the pressures are and the ... compressor failures and things that you have with your air conditioning so this is a lifetime of savings of energy in a lifetime of comfort that's why you do it\nSo not just on your electric bill that month but also in the wear and tear it's very expensive trust me I Know exactly we're to talk about that how it started to get your air conditioning system\nA fixed right if something goes wrong the compressor evaporate are coils and go to an all kinds of motors you go down and down the list of things right um there's a lot of components and it it's expensive to get a fix what you're saying is the ...\nThe easier it is for the ac system to run less wear and tear it's kinda like having the wind behind you when you're driving down the freeway Riley use less energy\nExactly well in this so I always say you don't heat kills motors it's hard on the equipment so\nIf you're if you're an engineer though I Love them engineers and stuff called and they understand that the more the the heat are surrounding a motor or the hotter the ... get\nThat kind of thing the less likely we're going to get out of those components so when you can lower editor temperatures your air conditioning system actually well I see last longer exists for one thing that's running last so if it's running twenty percent less that's like running your car twenty percent less mild is you're going to get more out of it\nBut then you're also going to get the heat blow down so when you have let's see the ... the motors and capacitors and stuff are going to be less likely to actually to set a great or break down overtime so that's why you take care of the addict\nLet alone I mean we're talking about comfort that's the main reason people really do an addict has to keep the house\nComfortable but also help lower the energy bills those two things kind of go together as some people call I Want to lower my energy bills suppose we can do that one and we can add insulation maybe we'll look at the ventilation but we're also going to make the house more comfortable at the same time they go hand in hand we can't we can't do one without the other they go together sure\nComfort is so important here in Houston, Texas um we have a lot of humidity here and one of the comforts that we're looking for is less humidity cooler temperatures in the house does having proper insulation in ventilation in your attic help with humidity\n[noise] yes so the editor temperature is is kind of critical for the humidity because of the hotter the ...\nThe addict is and then you have the cold air going through your duct work there so you have a bigger temperature differential ... the bigger that differential is the more conversation can be had in the in the duct work and things will start sweating and including Carlson a problem so you want the addict temperature to be as close to the inside temperature of the houses you can't\nBut we try to do is get it within ten to Fifteen degrees of the ambient temperature so if it's a hundred degrees outside\nWe don't want the temperature being all say over a hundred and ten hundred and Fifteen degrees if it is hotter than that then we'll look at doing solar ventilation may be some soft investigate air into the addict or we have to get the editor temperature down and there's different ways to do that and that would come out would do an addict analysis will come on look at the addict and you don't see in origin\nFor that do you when you come out no\nSo that kind of our first stage so people you know listen to the show today you can call\n'em will throw out a few we got some deals on some insulation as well but call us will come out and look at the attic and see what it actually needs because it's it's hard to even just say you know old just in general over well installations what you need well not necessarily people will say America there sure is not working I Need more ...\nWell that may be the case could be but maybe not so you do what you can do the best thing is is have somebody come look at it so called ... have been doing this for Thirteen Years\nWe know what we're doing and we don't oversell people would just see what they need it would come out and we would take care of it\nI'm going to give out Tom's numbers to eight one nine three six zero five five nine to eight one nine three six zero five five nine Tom is the owner of addict innovations\nHe has actually come out to my home put insulation in point a solar addict fan in and you also put the draft master and that's what you call it don't you\nYou have to drop mess or the ... for the poll downstairs and it just keeps the heat in cold it really works great in the summer and it works just as well in the winter so if you're eating the house and\nHeat rises so you don't want it that heat to just go right up to that addict door ... votes in insulator that will insulate then it's part of like when we do insulation it's actually insulating the door so it's really part of the insulation package and as he calls today will do will throw one of those in which is what the purchase of insulation absolutely fantastic\nTo eight one nine three six zero five five nine on today's show top medic innovations is going to be talking about\nAttic insulation we're going to be talking about solar addict fans and radium barrier radiant barrier also is actually good for the winter a lot of people think that must be a summer thing because that bounce the the sun's energy back out again right so we'll be talking about that here on the show before the break\nLet's talk about a deal you brought you always come to the show with a deal because you know that I check a pro Joe require it so I hang Tom upside down by his ankles I shake him the problem with that is Tom's a couple inches taller\nYeah you always bagging my head and if you can visualize it so great I'm On my ankle checks bang bang bang\nK. so God you brought a deal ordinarily it's a dollar Ninety per square foot for eight inch ad of blown in certain seat installation the white stuff right and and so that's a that's deep eight inches and that's generally what people need to get up to the our values and our ...\nYear so not most houses are going to have five to six inches in there that hasn't been upgraded so will come in and that's what we find that's all you're on that special on eight inches\nThat normally we'll bring you to Thirteen fourteen inches when that'll be a really nice job uh we used it certainly insulation doesn't itch it's class say fire rated uh that doesn't absorb moisture mold doesn't grow on it it's a great insulator and we can add that to the existing insulation so you don't have to pull the old insulation out\nNow we do removal if it's you know something that you've had squirrels and it's nasty\nBut normally we don't need to do that Ninety five percent of the time we're just going to add insulation to what you have but that is something that we do\nUm but we don't encourage that and push that on people some some places will say ... every house if they got what we were we pull everything out every town now he's like you're spending your own version their customers so much money you might have been a job that was maybe a Fifteen hundred dollar job and they're like oh we got twelve thousand are that John like\nKeep it that customer didn't need that that if you need it you need it but in most cases you know that's crazy we don't operate like that\nWhen you're painting a room you don't scrape the paint off you know ... you don't have any [laughter] exactly you just go over it to eight one nine three six zero five five nine one dollar Ninety cents a square foot ... inch fifty percent off today everybody half price only Ninety five cents is that correct\n... Ninety five cents a square foot for they didn't shed and there were also throwing in the freezer Wayne Slater of the draft ... job one I Love it yeah and those are only two Ninety nine installed and those are she'd made right here in Colorado, Texas so it's a really a nice ... ... people so we kinda use a local\nYou know products and try to support our local community with by doing that and it's a great product\nThat is huge two hundred and nine nine dollar value for the addict stairway until later the draft master I loved that product because I'm ... and we talked about this before time\nHere on the show if you don't have anything on your stairway door and you pull it down for instance and you look up that does just there but when you close it it has\nWhat a quarter inch apply would there that's a little less than an hour one value they're very very low our values you're going to throw that in for free so if you want to free addicts their way insulator in fifty percent off addict insulation\nFrom attic innovations home out or how many callers today can we all we can do six six deals today to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you don't need this now don't clog up the phone lines because we've got people listening who want it [noise]\nCall now six people need to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you didn't get the number who are going to repeat it during the break in time when we come after the break down remind me I Will after the break [noise] okay to wait one nine three six zero five five Ninety\nCallers can get it however three of already gotten it yes\nWith Ellen Yeh so will happen so basically when they call will come out will do the attic analysis and that they like if they need inflation them will honor that price for that so I've had a few people call me or I'll get out there and I says oh I I was one of the first ... cause I thought it was getting the whole house full of free insulation like\nNo it's a free analysis set aside to make sure everybody because we're in a ... it's a free analysis will come out and look at it and see what you need and then we'll give you fifty percent off the whatever inflation if that's what you need it if you needed maybe not needed maybe maybe a solar fan would be a better option so really this is Kevin ... look at it and then we'll go from there that's the best thing to do\nOkay to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nOnly three more callers can get this deal and before we move into radium barrier and solar addict fans I Want to just finish this deal\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine if this is something you think that you want to have done within the next four six eight weeks call now for something you want to have done next year leave the phones open for people who really want this because Tom can only give this deal away to so many people\nYeah well we get that too sometimes some will get\nPeople like oh I get out there like oh we're going to do something we were thinking like maybe two years we're actually going out of the country for six months they will call me in six months 'cause [laughter] you know some of the good even changed over the six by maybe and say what they decide well now we're going to sell the house and\nWell now we just want to bring it up to maybe in our thirties just to pass minimum building code we don't want to do the are thirty eight\nSo kind of you know do it when you're ready if it's to me there's no time like the president so if you're thinking about doing insulation and he's thinking well maybe in two years we're going to sell the house but when you sell it they are going to do a home inspection and they're they're going to look at the inflation\nAnd if it doesn't meet building code is going to come up on the inspection report is insufficient insulation and somebody's gonna want you to pay for it\nSo if you do it now within the two years it could pay for itself just in energy savings and you don't even worry about it we put gauges in there and you're you're good to go so\nReally has no time to present to do insulation\nTo eight one nine three six zero five five nine is Tom's number Tom can answer the phone right now some times he does but he's on the air right now it goes to his trust the staff at the office they're fantastic um you know I have to complement you and your team often when people in an office or answering the phone\nIn a customer service department at at home service business like yours they're just not as sharp as your people I mean people are articulate they're very educated on the process and the product right there courteous and if they don't have an answer they'll get it\nThey've got nerves of steel I've certainly heard the author every patient yes the another great uh so yeah well basically your call a will set up an appointment to become a look at your addict that does like two days before the appointment will send you a reminder email so we kind of keep keep you posted makes so that we don't make sure you know we didn't forget about you so we try to run on a tight ship\nThe day before we come out and do the installed the same thing we're going to call you will if I make sure everything's all go and do we just started really stay on top of things that I found in business after doing this for Thirteen Years it's all about communication and make sure everybody's always on the same page and if we do that we're going to have nothing but happy customers and that's how we do things\nTo eight one nine three six zero five five nine fifty percent authentic insulation we're going to go to a break shortly time when we come back after the break I Want to talk about ... barrier in detail you brought a deal\nOn that as well

dot com\nDavid I'm working farm [noise]\nApproach Joe here it's great to have you all listening to me and my friend Tom decker somatic innovations here on\nThe check a pro radio show I was listening to one of those motivational speakers\nOn YouTube the other day Tom I Know that you do some of that too oh I get a kick out a little guys yeah yeah they they kind of jazz me up every once in a while when I'm film blue that gets you thinking him and someone was talking about having a purpose okay\nAnd my purpose is to serve the homeowner so what I Do every day as I wake up and I say how can I make sure the homeowner finds the best possible contractor so on checker pro dot com we've checked their licenses insurance in references all one hundred plus contractors\nAnd it's also free for the homeowner and you know I have a number of purposes in life I mean you know I'm a husband and I'm a father and I'm a good citizen not in prison I pay my taxes and so forth\nBut as far as work goes that's my purpose your purpose I think is also helping the homeowner\nI'm you're not out there to steal anything from them you're not out there to put in an extra eight inches of insulation when they don't need it you're not going to cut a hole in the roof and put ten fans in because you have to make a number that month I'm right exactly it's actually you're kinda like a doctor according to the doctor before\nYou diagnose the problem and then you say what do we have to do as far as an operation pacemaker\n... none of ours is not as [laughter] then\nAnd and so then you might recommend you know you need to fans and this is why and you have a rationale for it right um you need eight inches of insulation or maybe you only need six or maybe need ten and this is why\nI'm you need a ready and barrier because you're in the primaries Katy, Texas and you're getting beaten on in the month of June July and August and um but you must feel good when you leave the house\nAnd you know that you've made it more efficient and you're saving the money\nYeah the nice thing as soon as we do that it's a lifetime of energy savings income for so everything that we do it's not some you have to do over and over again so if you do the writing a barrier that's the one time deal or if you do solar fans are fans have a lifetime ... so is there anything goes wrong we are going to come to replace the fan\nThe insulation is guaranteed to settle less than two percent over Twenty years so once you put that on what we do it's a one time deal some people will say woman remodel my kitchen for something like one of the ten years that's great but in ten years maybe the kitchen need remodeled again because it's out of date\nIt goes out of style will insulation in what we do and never goes out of style nobody ever says boy you know I Wish my house was less efficient\nBecause they want to see you know what I'm saying it's like you want it to be as efficient as you can you don't ever want to go back once you have an efficient attic\nYou don't want to go back you realize what a difference it to really make 'cause I get calls all the times I Would you really think you know if I had eight inches or ten inches of inflation's gonna make it a big difference and like you ma'am you only have two inches of in oh wow this is going to be huge\nNow if you're already had Fifteen inches inflation is somebody trying to tell you you need eight more and then asking you're asking them as they can make a big difference now is not going to make a big difference because you're already you're already there but if if you're low and insulation you bring it up to where it needs to be yeah it is going to make a big difference in the lower addict temperature it's it does make a big difference in the house\nAs a VIP club or you move to the top of their list and received a VIP treatment deserve plus club members say twenty five dollars on services provided by ... vendors what'd you show 'em you're

E. at check a pro dot com and please your full name and your mailing address\nNow back to addicts I'm a riveting topic we talked about quite a bit Tom spit on the show a number of times and I'm Tom gets a lot of response from the show actually so it's it's a great opportunity for him to fill in those holes\nWhere he may have some holes in his schedule for his crews and he can bring deals um so it works out for everybody works out for Tom an addict innovations in works out for my listeners\nYes and I was gonna say if you're thinking about getting this done in the next three or four weeks now's the time 'cause there's a price increase I'm from the manufacturers starting November first insulation ready and bury those products are going up and cost so and the prices are prices probably have to go up a little bit so\nIf you get an appointment now come on we come out look at it will affect the price in so we don't if you say you maybe you want to do it in the middle of November that's okay but we'll just get it scheduled and will lock that price in because prices are going up so now's the time to kind of\nDo it so you know we've been to I've been doing this you know on the radio for years and this let people know that their prices are going to go up to there's no surprise 'cause somebody like um they'll tell me that oh we've had a price increase before and then they'll say well you know I I've been listening for two years can I get to your prices on like\nYou know everything's gone up in two years just you know I Can't I Can't do it so I'll just let everybody know that for now is the time\nYou know it's gone up over the past two years according to my doctor my blood pressure was totally unrelated but I was thinking\nThings see everything they will go up and never goes down the taxes they only go up and never come back down they always say oh we're gonna have taxes temporary yeah you're right has never temper he'd always when it goes up it doesn't come back down I'm laughing because of the same\nTime my doctor said you're shrinking so I guess some things to go down\nYou know I my ... I'm not shrinking yet but but the point is if you lived to be long enough yeah shrink I went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago and I said you've lost twenty pounds his story Fifteen I'm like oh I wasn't even trying to lose any way but at least addicts are hot tough oh ten more years I only have a less solar\nAddict fans a great deal from the federal government to Uncle Sam is giving you thirty percent\nOff what a deal yeah so you get thirty percent off of the from the installed price so you get thirty percent of the product and the installation so it really helps bring the cost down\nA I go over the numbers were quickly now to talk about the benefits of the fan so we do a thirty want solar addict fan it's made by the people like I said there ought to counter oh Texas I'm a thousand Ninety five dollars is the normal or normal installed prices were taken two hundred dollars offer checker Pearl listeners celebrates it costs down to eight Ninety five out the door installed\nLifetime warranty the whole kitten caboodle so that's a great deal but then the government's also kicking in thirty percent federal energy tax credit to get thirty percent of that back on your twenty Eighteenth taxes so that the two hundred and sixty dollars and fifty cent tax credit so brings the total cost to six twenty six fifty after the tax credit\nSo just to be clear of the day we do the the fan it would be eight Ninety five\nOf the editor innovations and then you'll get to sixty eight fifty back in the tax credit so your your true out of pocket expenses six twenty six fifty so the nice thing about that is these fans can pay for themselves in a year or sometimes even less just an energy savings because I think customers they you know I have\nFour hundred dollar electric bill now my bills like two fifty in such a big difference in the summertime that they get paid for itself to for summer it's incredible\nSo the fans are really nice ours has um humidity sensor and the thermostat comes on eighty five degrees\nSo it doesn't pull heat onto your attic in the winter it's it's smart technology but it will it can't kick in in the winter if you have high humidity and run for Fifteen or twenty minutes pulled the humidity down in ... and you don't want a lot of humidity in the addict is because they can get in Indian inflation and then the installation starts to settle\nAnd then later on you need more inflation the whole reason was because you maybe didn't have enough to start with but if you didn't have enough too much humidity the insulation will basically shrank it's kind of contacting so you want to keep the editor in the air and he had a dry so that's what the fans do\nI've got one you do I put it in that's right you hit it\nMyself I didn't even have my crew to it I came out when we were so busy we did in the summer we were so slam as I could I already know where I knew where you live sauce like I'll come to it as a problem you know where I live right\nAnd uh no yeah you um should meet up the ladder you put your cougar paws on which are special boots that roofers use and you went up and you look you look at you know what you're doing that's for sure\nI have done probably I Would say I was gonna say thousands that I'd say if I put it at least a thousand of myself\nSo I I Am very familiar with solar fans and my cruise they've done thousands of them we put a lot of fans in because they do make such a big difference of lowering the addict temperature so that's the number one reason you put a solar fan in is to lower the addict temperature the lower the temperature an addict\nLittle less the air conditioners going to run and the more comfortable house becomes so if you're at it as a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty degrees\nAnd you're trying to cool the house down to Seventy five degrees inside that is a Seventy five degree differential\nYour ... it just can't over one can't take that much heat out of the house so it gets overwhelmed with heat that is what does your does runs it runs it runs so I tell people you know you drop the temperature down to say a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen that's going to make the biggest difference that you can as far as efficiency on your whole house it's all about out of temperature it's huge\nHow many of these can you give away or I'm Sorry how many deals can you offer to my\nAre saying let's do a we can do six of these soldiers ... fan deal so now some houses may need to fans so this'll be six separate appointments so if you need to find some people say well I think I Need to\nA federal do up to about Fifteen hundred square feet you have a twenty five hundred square foot addict or we're gonna recommend to fans so this kind of let people know about what the pricing it'd be\nYou know you'd normally one or two pens which need okay\nOr nearly a thousand Ninety five correct yes two hundred dollars off from my ... thank you very much time for offering that to my listeners today\nSo that brings it down to eight Ninety five installed yes and but then the federal tax credit from the federal government Uncle Sam thirty percent off which is to sixty eight fifty net sit down to six twenty six fifty after the federal\nTax credit yes that's out of pocket and so that's the nice thing about that and this is the same thing it's a lifetime product lifetime or tea it's a great fan it has a a motor and at that rate it at Ninety thousand hours so\nIt's about a thirty five year run expectancy on that motor\nLarry Jacobson here Larry how are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing this way of doing awesome and for our listeners out there Larry is the top instructor it online trading academy and the director of instructor development so it's easy to see why usually referred to him as the brains of the operation out here\nBut what are the things that I Love about the show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and this shows a ton of fun to do and how could it not be a ton of fun when we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nWe usually start to show off very similar way it it's all about consistency cars at that point never changes right that point never changes all about consistent income it's not about making money once right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consistent stream of income that you can count on\nRight that you can count on not something that well hopefully this works out is that that that step by step process that can generate\nMore income in our lives and whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of things we also have to take into consideration well we walk and just an income we'd have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those\nFour hundred point down on the on the U.S and people that haven't or foreign points down on the Dow and even the other day you know what other foreign points back up and so it's almost like a ... a a a reminder of of springtime back in February we had the big drops in the big rallies or stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market\nAnd it's the traders market because those by and hold situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of rocking back and forth\nIt's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some things you guys are doing right now Larry what's your instructor team really help people kind of harnessed this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at first and foremost I just want to say it's so\nGreat to have some people listening and a lotta times are students are constantly focused on how do they get their financial futures back\nWe just mentioned you know you've had this volatility in the markets and most people who don't know what they're doing a freaking out right now because they see the market goes down then it goes back up that goes down and they're waiting for a sign\nWell the sign has been it's already passed because right now you have so many opportunities in the market to learn how to make trade to the markets go up and go down\nAnd most people have learned their whole lives only make money when the markets go up when it goes down it's a bad thing well we're here to tell you right now it's an excellent thing when the markets go down because\nMarkets have a tendency to fall three times faster than they go up\nAnd if you look at two thousand of the year two thousand and eight Wall Street made the most money during this time when markets we're correcting them they were when the markets or even rallying and this is called shorting the market is completely legal\nAnd a lot of people have come to the academy have realized that if you want to know what it's like and you're wondering how to get your lead to a place where you can quit your job or spend more time with your family then you want to start learning how to trade that's really where it begins Ryan\nYeah absolutely and what if somebody came to you a ... and they said hey you know what the over the last three months you've made this much money at work how would you like to make that much money in one week right because that's really what's happened over the last little bit of the markets have gone down\nWe have erased three months worth of growth in the markets in one week's time well imagine if you could get to the point where you looked at a down market like Larry was saying it as an opportunity to generate income\nLiterally taking that opportunity and being able to make money as the markets are going down now in one week did it for the thing I Would like to point out to everybody is the difference between ten and twenty is the same whether you're counting up to twenty\nOr whether you're counting down to ten right if you're going twenty down to ten it's the same as ten up to twenty right so when you're making money on the way down that's one of the reasons why we talk about how it's like getting a raise as the markets are going down as long as you understand\nHow to generate that income and you have that skill to generate that income it's like getting a raise in this case if you take that kind of apples to apples comparison it's like making as much in a week as it was and making it in three months so imagine you're your employer coming to you and saying hey how would you like to make as much as you made in the last three months in one week\nWhat would your answer be you know I Would imagine that everybody's answer would be yes\nYou know and then it would be well what do I have to do to be able to generate that income well what do I have to do to be able to make as much money in a in a week 'cause I did in the last three months where you just need to have one more skill you just need to have the skill of being able to time it bearish market and it's just like timing abortion market is just the other direction it's very simple process and it's something that\nLike I say is that we're talking about earlier is can be very very very lucrative and a lotta times we can come back on to this because we want to do a little a little give away to help people get started\nBut a lot of people look at it as and there's more risk and the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk\nAnd embarrassed market than an abortion market but one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we get a big stack of tickets here for our show today we say we give away some passes to one of these have take classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believes they hit a point in their lives when they realize they deserve more we gotta we gotta help I'm Ryan absolutely right now we've got to have to a class in your area that have\nTheir classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that income whether the markets are going up down or whether the markets are going sideways and just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like how do we Hansi retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston ... and see if you can scores and passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people can kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in a down market with how margin in different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand we're usually afraid of and isn't it just mainly fear the whole people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know and in\nFact I'll share a story I sure what my students Jim the other day\nIt was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job and the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening\nIs it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people defined it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if you want a frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the fraud tries a couple of times to jump\nBut hits the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there and we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else you start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work because then all of the sunnier this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap that you've been believing your whole life has gone away\nAnd that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there or stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle\nWhen reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets so great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and\nYou know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you actually get there where why would you want to do that people do that everyday Ryan what they're trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it you know teaching a class last night and I have another session with the with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole ... I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh when you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying\nYou know a while ago they uh you know what I'm ... years and years ago they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile\nA this ... about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even an Olympic lipic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we ended up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could have a few more people get started\nWe've got a second tickets here the show is just beginning what do you say we do know that give away let's do it right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area now have take classes where you see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nAnd not only was she able to do this and learn rather quickly she was able to put her two kids through school but bought herself a new car so the thing to keep in mind when you're starting to consider these things one it's not a ... get rich quick schemes you're going to learn how overtime to generate money\nIf you're somebody doesn't want to be stuck where you are right now a lot of people just get stuck in life\nOkay it's not going to be for you if you're not coach of all you got to be open minded that there are people out there every single day making money and doing exactly what you do and the question I Would ask grind of all this did was really earn you some extra money wouldn't it be worth it\nRight right well and then ties back into what can you do with that money as far as giving you that financial freedom and and doing maybe the fun things that you want to do it it's kind of interesting over the last little bit of as we've kinda got ready for our big conference that we do every year you know we we chatted with a a bunch of different students and started talking to them about what they what they want to do and it's amazing to me how many of our students love kayaking\nLike over and over and over again is like what do you do now with all the spare time you have kayaking it was like whoa we'll kayakers\nEar or the other thing when they were oh they do that the ... out of their orders like they're they're all real fit among us pretty cool but yeah it's it it really just boils down to being able to do the things that are the things that you love and I mean how many times have you bumped into somebody or you said\nHey would you rather go to work today or would you rather go paddle boarding and most of the time it's like well I'd rather go proud of hoarding but I have to go to work until it's all about doing the things that you want to do rather than the things that you have to do you know the income is it's kind of that necessary product that we have to have in order to give us the freedom that we want but really\nIt's the freedom that we wanted but at the income that actually allows us to get there and one of the things we can do as far as helping a few more people get started before we get into this uh before we get into this next break is what we do another giveaway\nYeah I just have some people out there thinking what would you do if you had more money and time\nYeah absolutely right now I have a half day class cut up in your area that have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market which is where it was just saying can give you that time back right to give you that more more time to do

Larry\nWhich we talk about next you know with all the volatility in the market right now a lot of our students\nAre asking how can you help us preserved capital afraid to talk about that is a hot topic right now with the retirement accounts kind of inside of the ebb and flow of our financial markets the up and down in the U.S will be five hundred and Ryan and Larry we'll be right back

A. dot com\n[noise] you're listening to powers trading radio now back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs a director of instructor development and half instructor it online trading ketamine really shed some light on different income streams of side of the mark and we're talking a little bit about passive income we're talking about active and can we are\nTalking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we were very and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there and those multiple streams of income or really would create that financial freedom that everybody's after I not just that one source not one source of income when you have that sole source that's why\nJob stance J. O. B. right stance for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we wanted to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big up we've had big down and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes with via social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire\nOr just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it and so it's kind of a consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our audience\nAs the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody here it's going to protect your capital better than you can right now and the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand and fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is\nThis is the first generation right now that has been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four O. one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and have been doing this pretty\nPretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I wonder if I Want to listen to this because it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting in money into this market the last three years at an all time highs not when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction\nThe first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement a lot\nStudents come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term yeah\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics they had in my class last night as as the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on pay and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible forced to make any money\nOne of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account it's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying an identifying a high price and selling now we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her\nOr or or things that we want\nTo be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects and Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about\nAnd he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share it are there but it was just kind of funny you say you can't let their stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially invest the end of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two\nDoesn't care about us they don't care about Saddam and honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end that was kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right\nThere's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent\nGetting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThe the other thing I was like to bring up is every time I see a movie on trading or TV show on trading are investing they always show somebody sweating profusely in front of Eighteen different monitors taking hypertension medication\nWhen in reality the thing that I Love so much about this and I was even telling my class last night a brand new set of students that are just coming out with on online training academy is is when you're doing everything's pro active when you're proactively investing you're able to be strategic you're able to be logical you're able to be rational and you're able to set things up ahead of time proactive\nThe average kind of trader investor out there is more reactive something happens and they react to it which keeps them in an emotional state and the lesson last night with the class was was all about kind of the mental makeup that we need to have for to to really have consistent income in the market and it's all about being proactive rather than reactive and I also think\nThat that is a point to bring up in this conversation because the pro active side of it is what allows your lifestyle to be whatever you want your lifestyle to be right it's something where you can schedule the market around you rather than schedule in your life around the market you know look Albert Einstein had one of the greatest\nQuotes ever about insanity in the you know step initiative insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome most people live in a very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nIs they read a book could go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching well I can tell you what's amazing that what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time and it's the only profession you can do this\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean and the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is they simplify trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam side and they said this many times the architect of our core strategy that really were trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and I think that's an important\nConcept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our county right what happens is there's a buyer and seller\nAnd there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their socks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market but it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account is the same thing in the financial markets and a\nLot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that as you get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your alive and you know why and you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight this year ... out of out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself\nThat you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan and executed all plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online trading ketamine that step by step plan that step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ends up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed all plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow and only the\nOnly attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\nAbsolutely and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but it's the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nThey're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and we have to do\nWas we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little go away we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is that at one of the half the classes and we've got this stack of this

take control their lifestyle help people do the things they want to do\nTo help them get over procrastination right I mean it's amazing how many people spent so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with the reason why they can't do something and what if you only needed to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now either procrastinating of watching TV

I'm playing golf is has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip but of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course so she would get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education and being able to trade in any time with an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives\nAnd actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to working for someone else which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYou know there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talks a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of level are made this playing field\nA very level and it makes ah it makes it difficult on some businesses to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because with the with the Internet connections that we have with the data streams that we have it really is this this this marketplace where it doesn't matter what your background is\nIt doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter even how much money really you're getting started with\nEverybody has access to the same information inside of the markets and so it doesn't matter where we come from it only matters where are we going and we stay focused\nKind of on that go hand in that we do everything necessary\nTo accomplish it and that's kind of that great it's that great relief point where you you get to a point in life or you go you know what\nI can do whatever I whatever I wanted to I don't have to go and do this I can go and do that and that's what that financial freedom is\nThat's where your sleeve and easy at night and there's really nothing
