{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "You can have an investor who has a portfolio of\nA investor homes or our homes that he's investing and um and then you have um the the exposure for a ten is somebody who actually lives in the home but doesn't own it so there again there are a multitude of policies available\nFor protecting a home if you don't have an agent then knows those Fifteen policies and can can speak to you about the intricacies of each then you probably should give us a call\nIndeed and here's another one that that comes under it I think is that when people have their home for sale\nIf it's I think over thirty days is if if I'm not in the home and I have listed let's say I've moved on to my my new home and I have my home listed I'm Out of it for thirty days there was a policy for that because my regular home insurance doesn't cover it after a certain amount of days\nExactly and in different was that one called it's well it's just a vacant home policy essentially\nAnd its structure different ways so I I won't bore you with the details but it's especially a vacant home policy\nUm and just to speak to that specifically every policy is different some have a thirty day vacancy clause built in which stipulates that after the thirty day window if something happens on a property they may either start\nGradually reducing coverage\nOr eliminate coverage altogether so absolutely if\nIf you're not going to be living in the home and it's in some um inner on stage of occupancy call your agent called us uh you can reach us an eight six six eight four or five for six seven six\nAnd eight six six eight four or five for six seven six I just want everybody to know we can help you and give us a call and we'll walk you through that that process that product help you to understand city you can make a confident decision about the coverage\nIn fact we are broadcast certainly people know here in Houston, Texas but people here is all over the United sates sometimes even beyond but we want to remind people let's say you're in Pennsylvania California you can ensure people there as well where I\nCan absolutely we um we hold a license and most states are and we have um relationships with our um insurance partners across the nation that allow us to again find needs and a film and with our product so we're we're more than happy to talk to anybody in\nFact ... someone came into mind right now that lives right here in Houston and they're very\nFortunate their weekend home or their summer homes in Cape Cod so oh that's nice they could have insurance from Stuart insurance and risk management of both locations they could absolutely and another ID I'm thinking about as we are broadcast here in Houston we hear about it more I don't know about other cities but in this city it seems like so there are so many investors\nPeople that are not just buying homes and flipping them that's one thing but there's so many investors and people that have rental property so that is so important to make sure they have the right coverage for the rental properties whether it's one property or several\nExactly so that again we talked about the vacant home there's the standard dwelling fire policy that protects the landlord relationship that person who owns the home and provides liability for the tenet who now occupy the home\nUh for that landlord but additionally you said I'm with a home that people are flipping there's a policy called the builders risk policy and so we can tailor that coverage for a vacant property that is also being worked on um you know gradually being improved\nAnd you know you have to you have to protect a first and foremost liability while the property is vacant and then the structure itself and then any materials that are being used to rebuild their reconstruct the home so that's a huge deal for us here in Houston after Harvey because there's so many homes that are in that interim stage where they're being\nRebuilt or re modeled after that last so standard home policy is not adequate\nThere is an exposure there for anybody who's got that going on so again I I Love the opportunity for you to call us well we can walk you through that process and that product again and make sure that you understand your options\nAre there is no doubt you can make the complex simple simply by a phone call again that number is\nIt's eight six six eight four or five for six seven sex\nOne more time aids I think it was on a it's sort of a think six eight four or five four six eight seven six\nThank you so much

individual not only ... office and what they do but Stewart in general is one of the absolute best companies that I've ever worked with and will continue to work with and you guys have some great individuals'\nLined up for you but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am can rewrite the host of money matters with chemical\nRay [noise] Becky\nJak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is an honor it is a privilege\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist\nSo we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so if you would like to learn more about us you can find us on the Web we are at money matters dot net and one final thought is\nNot to brag at all but uh recently actually for the sixty year in a row I was named one of the top one hundred a financial independent financial advisors or by parents and\nWe love you very\nWell thank you and without our clients we would be nowhere so therefore I put that one I give it to them now let me go over with you what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land of\nPersonal finances so first of all I'm the economy is strong\nOkay by all measures we got a um uh the employment data looked a little softer than people thought but that's okay it's still pretty strong about two hundred thousand jobs a month now which is an economy our size that's pretty darn good\nAnd so the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and we saw that the ah the ten year went which is the most watched interest rate that uh uh traders look at has gone up and now it's looking like it's going to have around three and a quarter if it stays there that's a big thing so I Want to talk\nWith you about have you review your bond portfolio lately\nOkay because if you have and you knew or should I think so we'll talk about that also\nSince we are a retirement planning specialist we talk with our clients about a planning around all of the things that we can think of that have to do with achieving their goals having them we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay we want you to go play and have fun and just relax and enjoy\nAnd so to do that we believe you need to have a a a plan in place that addresses all the things that could harm you\nAnd believe it or not when you are retired there are actually Eighteen risks that you face they're Eighteen of him\nAnd a properly designed plan in my opinion is one that addresses all Eighteen of those so we're going to talk about risk number seven this week which is financial elder abuse okay so if you have an older family member or someone in their seventies eighties\nUh or or older I Want to talk with you about that it's a big big deal uh unfortunately also we're going to talk about Social Security this week so uh we're going to answer the question when should you wait until you're Seventy just started collecting Social Security\nOkay so there are reasons why you may want to do that and so we want to help you understand that uh that strategy\nNow also from a from an investment standpoint you know we want as I said we want you to enjoy your second childhood so whatever that means to you if you if it means playing a lot of golf if it means traveling if it means spending time with your grandchildren whatever that means to you that's great we want to help you achieve that\nBut if you lose a large amount of your money in the next market downturn than I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nSo therefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that is called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by whole myth that is a I heard or I've called because I've heard it and that is that if you sell\nYou know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing and that's like the silliest thing I've ever\nHeard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and that's what I Want to go with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial\nShow going very on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we\nTalk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very uh what's the opposite of greedy\nI'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm a kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and this puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she's like a big dog and you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name as noodle and she's a noodle such noodle dishes noodle\nAnd so the the update because people apparently are interested in this I don't know why is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she swaps and ... a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she pays right on the patio and golly I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but I Hope so [laughter]\nAnyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy or the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now there's some talk\nThat the unemployment rate has rates are low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that the unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely it's going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio um you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds\nBonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bond even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market word falls and crashes it's like there's this general decline to last for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a ... a couple of months ago we\nReduce the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh uh put half of our bond portfolio into government or the cash\nEquivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up and because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we want we want to make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates and our bonds and not lose money okay\nOne thing that you may want to do if you have not review drawn portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd there's a link on there that says meet with an advisor\nAnd if you click on that then you know we'll sit down with you and we'll talk about how to create a you know a plan for your future for your retirement okay and part of that is looking at your cash flow part of that is Social Security decisions are part of that is your four O. one K. and are you a are you

our our basic philosophy is we don't want to take any more risk than is necessary so you've got to figure out what that risk level is and we'll we'll help you with that\nWe'll also talk about your magic number okay so the magic number is how much money do we will help you to calculate what we think is the amount of money you should have to be able to retire on\nAnd so that'll help you to know if you have it number one if you do congratulations if you don't then we've got some work to do but either way you got to know so we want to help you understand that number\nAnd so we have a lot of

professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states and we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who I retired a retiring soon and so that's you we would love\nMeet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family and help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play good to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stop\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors but the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our class who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start and then there's another which is how should I collected\nAnd it's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kind of things there are actually eight thousand combinations of\nThat the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter] so\nHow do you figure that at all well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and it's complicated you know our advisors in our firm we put we we have in fact a starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's\nSomeone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed\nI mean it's it's it's complicated and so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listening to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so\nBe that as it may I Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy and start collect Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually start when you're sixty two assuming you qualify\nYou could take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you were going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy eight increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to wait to your Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nIf you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait to your Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it as sixty six and just give it to me [laughter]\nIf you don't want it I'll take it [laughter] but anyway yeah so if if you feel that the you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon\nIf you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period than we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement\nSo

are a retirement planning specialist and so we work with people that are over the age of fifty primarily and who are retired or retiring soon and we are so so very thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd I recently barons named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors a and actually for the sixth year in a row\n[noise] a flyby thank you but you know what without our clients so we would be absolutely nowhere so all the thanks go to them\nNow one of the topics that we do talk about with our clients are very frequently is estate planning which we call how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and the reason why you\nDo this is because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does it not Baton Rouge sports happy\n[laughter] and you weren't happy squirts okay let me tell you something unhappy square it's not good don't want that you weren't happy squirts anyway so this is the time we normally we talk about that but this week we're going to deviate from our normal appointed task and we're gonna talk instead about you're giving\nThe opposite of greedy I think a very clean not and washed and I'm very deserving spouse\nOkay and so we can talk about how to uh protect your spouse in the event of your dad how to create a trust for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust just like the thing you stick in your ear and a Q tip stance for qualified terminal interest property and so we're going to go over that but jak can play it you know I\n\nWould say you\nMy ... am\n\nAnd\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our estate tip of the week\nSo but this week as I said we're deviating we are going to talk about your blood and most valued spouse okay so we're gonna talk about a Q tip trust so what is a huge trust will\nBasically your if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your state for a state tax purposes and all of that you're half of the state is what would normally go into\nThe Q tip trust or some portion there up okay now the ... trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of this trust are set up for their benefit\nSo what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decide where the money's invested your spouse decides on distributions from the trust so there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse\nThat's number one there is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's called hams H. E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so if they if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle they can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to they have\nLive within what they were living before but you know most houses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money you can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nYou want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you wanted to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the cutest trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but cue tips easier to say\nAnyway if you would like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website is

seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there's a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net after seminar we're going to talk about uh several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions are going to talk about how to protect yourself from the ... market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\n[laughter] Saturday morning and welcome to the max out they don't show I'm catchy okay we're talking saving it definitely think you're retired\nModel when our philosophy is to save aggressively in concert that he built enough well go a long time to save aggressively in advance conservatively\n... what you want to do is start out with ... percent\nA year or in your savings plant called income based state ... percent of the company match that she'd get you up to up typically around Thirteen percent or more most of the research out there shows that that's going to be enough to build up over the long term\nTo put you in a reasonably good place for retirement about\nIf you're over ... you've got to really start ramping up your savings that most people are lacking a little bit and if you are at the time it hit the savings right maybe ... percent or more or come up with a plant articulate if you're a small business owner or not in a four oh one K. playing it it's a little more difficult\nBut it does point to to have a plan in place it in to execute the clan in it because you never know what's gonna happen in the future\nShe want to try to prepare for the future [laughter] particularly in the world today we're like oh my shirt the\nRecord government they they record that's it's a completely out of control a government that you're not sure how long it's Social Security or any of these other things are going to hold up I I think you're going to hold up for a while we actually had a lot of questions about this\nOn on the show last week it during the week we had a lot of questions about you know Social Security it my my thinking is is a Social Security is going to\nBe there if you're ...\nFear I I'm not convinced it it is it reduced or in in ... ... ... ... the ... the big danger also is\nInflation with Social Security ... you're a lotta people what's really not known about Social Security to some extent it's indexed to inflation into it goes up for a percentage of the inflation but remember the inflation numbers\nHave been chain down in dynamically adjusted which is you just a fancy way of saying that they've they've created ways to reduce the true inflation number and\nThat was really good and it's probably kept Social Security and a lot of the programs going because it was a spiral out of control otherwise but the danger is you're not being fully compensated for retirement\nAnd and so this is for inflation or in in in to inflation is a major a danger for your retirement and so there's just something that\nThat we're going to have to continue to look at it continue river I I you know I I Do believe in evolution is going is coming back inflation is is is is really starting to accelerate in China inflation is accelerating in the emerging markets are in\nIt for the first time in the United states in over a decade we're seeing really kind of more of a car push inflation where\nWhere over the last decade we've had what's what I like to call MBA inflation which is simply corporate America jacking up\nUh the prices of everything between hurry typically between five and seven percent a year three and seven percent a year to try to boost profits of the company that sometimes they'll keep the price the fame and the cost of atmosphere you'll you'll get or there will be out in the\nIn the ketchup or whatever uh but but it's the same thing they're trying to grow their profit seven percent a year and so they're they're putting in\nCost any way they can get cost increases there doing it in and I call that MBA inflation is typically speaker under a lot of pressure to boost profits every year to justify these CEOs existence and pay a billion dollars in it and so\nSo that has been an insidious factor in inflation\nOut there but what is changing the last year or so years the economy's really starting to get much stronger under Donald Trump and and what that is happening is we're having with the the unemployment rate under three point nine percent we've had the the most\n... people employed in history and the United states we have a ... we've seen jobs some of the uh wage increases at three percent over three percent\nUh recently a ... basis I think they are actually growing faster than that ah the the the employers can't find workers workers are switching jobs to get a raise or switching jobs because they don't like working there and so\nSo there's a huge demand for workers out there in in the costs going up in the manufacturing capacity in the United states is is is really starting to become a little bit scratch which is a good thing if you look at trucking and the other thing trucking costs are are are are going up\nAnytime you make something you got to move it it's got to move fire truck or a car on an airplane\nIn the cost of freight is going up a real there are shortages of rail cars in the United states there's shortage of trucks to the truckers in the United states these are all good things even some of the first things people watch once you start chain shortages trucking and whale and trans court\nThat means the economy's running pretty close to full capacity and we're starting to hit the costs of things are going up\nIn the in the other thing again the shift putting the NBA inflation to the really cost push inflation you here in in listening to the max savings advisors were value investors in the stock and bond markets which means we know stocked we own bonds we also\n... ts and mutual funds put together a risk based package but we're\nListening to a lot of these earnings calls to see what the company's doing how things have gone company hearing a lot of things about\nOur wage costs are going up for having trouble with logistics logistics inflation the cost of cooking is going up the cost of commodities is going up basically a bee for dealing with price increases were struggling to pass more again these are inflationary things ... ... ... and so\nThis is something we want to continue to watch\nA really there's basically five big risk too weak for big risk to retirement it's it's investment risk which means you invest your hire a roll over in the in the U.S and the five hundred in two thousand seven and eight collapses to two thousand nine down fifty seven percent\nAnd you have four hundred and thirty thousand when you had a million and you're in trouble\nThere's also a health care where there's a logic to the ... you know if you lived to be a hundred and ten\nA very few retirement plans are going to be able to withstand that type of work paying out over that period of time here and then having to deal with uh\nThe need for higher income for the fourth with coaches inflation and I think one of the the bigger ones it's coming up\nIs ... is inflation if you had asked me to kind of rank these things I Would say the number biggest risk is in here now with the market just probably investment rest followed by actually I Would say number one it's inflation can be going forward over the next Twenty years\nOr investment risk\nOf longevity which I think health care is going over time it's going to do that I I think we've seen the peak in health care I think over the next ten\nYears you're going to see a massive movement in the United states to start reducing health care costs ... if you look at the United states of America within a remarkable job in manufacturing\nIn in many parts of the economy and transport in rail and all types of things in becoming more efficient when this was an will mark ... a fishing country where one one of the keys to Donald Trump or going after China is we we have a very efficient very reasonably priced\nManufacturing platform in the United states we have the rule of law we have the ah we have reasonably priced workers we have a very efficient system very efficient ... very efficient manufacturing base we have a low taxes now because he's changed his tax law and now with deregulating\nSo we're a great place to be put in manufacturing hid it in ... and because we've got so busy and we had to deal with China and the rest of the world and we were like hey\nWe've got to sit there and get a a wage cost out so there's been over the last decade pressure on wages that's changing now because our workers are so that we can stop paying\nWage increases who have not found anything in the last ten years is is somehow controlling health care costs and so if you look what we've done in manufacturing if we vote who we've done in transporting ... ... what what was that a hundred years can include structure\nThere's no reason we can't\nBecome remarkably more efficient in health care delivery so help cure going down\nBut you have to understand you're going to have to deal with all of these issues at retirement and understand them and I think one of the things that everybody thinks inflation is gone away and this is a fundamental shift in its really changing back to where it once was well we're going to be having more inflation\nWhen I got an out of a college back in the eighties or the ISI the inflation rate you eat your if you got a loan for seven eight percent remember I got an eight percent on I was thrilled by the house eight and a half eaten recorders pretend I thought it was the best deal in the world\nWe had inflation here or in the early eighties late seventies over a seven eight ten percent a year now everybody's forgotten about that we had government bonds tenure government bonds yielding over ten percent two years ago they went to one point three five percent the lowest in the history of planet earth\nThe uh the the cry or the valuation like kind of ... but ultimately ended up in the mail and blow income credit in Nineteen Ninety eight\n... and so I I think he needs to spread I did the ... and so what was going to have to see how it's obvious play that well if you look at companies market it just does not look it means a lot of risk I\nThink one other thing you know we were talking earlier about the uh [noise] about the inflation and and I think he'll be inflation rate to your work ... football I think it is Leo\n... and it\nWas a big push now to a new and ... and and and and this\nPast year term it makes a lot of sense where you give your turnover your IRA roll over to an insurance company or someone and they'll give you a set payments for the purity of your life\nAnd it it\nIt's a good idea in many cases but ... you saw if you do it that way you're not really going to leave any concrete your heirs if if if you just do it a new witty and that it ... in but I think the bigger danger to me than anything else if you get that inflation if you were in ... in\nIn in Argentina if you're in a new witty and Brazil if you're in a new in Turkey in China in in many areas around the world in Germany and the Nineteen thirties ...\n... it it it it really doesn't help you out with your retirement in ... you know you were wiped out and then you are left are truly nothing it if you get into a big inflation stock will hold up better if you target to the right asset classes you can actually see it ahead of inflation overtime\n\nAnd so this is something I I I I think you know we got a lot of work on there's it it really this is something that we increasingly become concerned about is a\nIs inflation I mean we I think we are making a transition from the MBA inflation at the last decade with corporate America in a multinational just push up the price of of everything from drugs to a serial up in the church and have\nSeven percent a year to a\nA cost in push inflation where wages are going up commodity prices are going up and logistics trucking break in and everything they use is going up and that's a different thing in in that environment\nTend to be more corrosive because the price increases tend to go Bob kind of ... in the pain level for for poor for a individuals and by that I mean\nThe cost that really coming in a ... where they they start hurting the or the other alternative were in the past on it it will do the kind of corporate in place you can kind of manage it target your your your price increases they don't have that ability\nAnd the second thing in that type of world the the NBA inflation is very good for corporate America it's really good for the S. and P. five hundred it's Fox\nIt costs to push inflation is not good for these guys because the cost of going up everything from commodities workers' wages and that affects the carpet and they have difficulty raising the prices and and so that that I think we're going to see more and more of this will it\nWill start earning cycle coming we're I think we're going to see more of this going forward\n[noise] then again if you have any questions or comments you can give us a call at seven one great three three nine ten Seventy seven one three nine ten Seventy [noise]\n... I wanted to expand a little bit I Want a Charles was question on the the the fed funds they raised the fed Federal Reserve raised the fed funds to two two and a quarter range from one and three quarters to to to hear this week in\nInto a two to two and a quarter we did some research and we wrote about in the max up savings record and discovered that since Nineteen fifty five we've never had a recession\nUntil fed funds were over three and a half percent and I think the Federal Reserve those that as well get in there that really wrestling with it and the research is how does the comedy performance Oprah low interest rates\nHit and I think it and so if they're a threat\nTo the two and a quarter right now and we've never had a statue from bringing a half and you have three point nine percent unemployment you have a hot economy have inflation coming in\nThen\nYeah if you're the head you're looking at that point five percent number you're wondering how much more you have to do and so I think they are going to continue to raise\nWages in in I don't think the two and a quarter percent Federal Reserve funds who's going to slow this economy down very much of this is something\nYou can see a lot of people out of the things that they looked at is making a mistake they can't raise rates I think the bigger problem we have is is the record debt levels the the uh the uh quite get trade deficits McCray situation is completely need against the U.S economy is the crime to straighten up\nAnd and I I I think uh you have the United states is\nOnly economy in the world the truly growing right now are you know Donald Trump spoke at the end like most of those\nMost of those countries wish they had the growth but there there are what they're what they're looking at is\nIs this an old thing out there that needs to be the United states to the games and the whole world out of the ... out of the uh the world economy out of a recession or it drives the world's economy and wouldn't even see is that still hold\nBecause we're starting to do better the problem is we're taking the manufacturing back the Senate Turkey's company so I think a lot of uncertainty committed some amount of uncertainty out there and I and I think you really have to have you ... ... ...\n... ... ... what we found is that we really we really have a very defensive right now who most gr caught up\nAnd say hey I wanted to just touch base on where the healing this week uh in one of the things we're looking at is the cardinal healing for the uh but having to be put on the\nSupreme Court ...\nThe main thing is important thing because if the Democrats and the latest filing ... does he get it and making good spirit the ... the Republican base who thinks he can recover who won't do anything in Washington bother voting for these people\nThat make you maybe get into the house and the ... I think if we don't get what Portman all clue I don't think we hope ... ... ... I think we're going to hold the chemicals that he'd be in\n... ... and so this is some ... ... I think we we do have to kind of watch here in uh\nIn in the what's going to happen going forward and another thing is with his ... for the whole country in many many way just because we look like complete fools to the rest of the world by about\n... ... I talked to her for the by that that part she they go on to somebody you know the family's gone through some of these things\nCalled the global cross with it and the pike the situation and the comment to them or if they have to go back to high school they couldn't believe they were having to go back to high school on Brett Kavanaugh I mean they were pretty horrified on the whole deal in\nIn ... if if you if you want to be a a a judge federal judge you somebody now\nAre you willing to put your family who\nWhat Brett Kavanaugh has gone has gone through and it will take a a a a large pool of people out of the equation that just isn't isn't going to want to do this particular he got a federal judge in the appellate judge and you get the Supreme Court justice as well that judges are paid pretty well they're not\nYou know if it if you're up for a federal judge you typically you're really high powered well you're you're probably make and a half a million ... million dollars a year and why\nShould you why should you sit there and take a huge you know I I I think the judges make about a hundred and Seventy five thousand a hundred by five thousand a year which is really good pay but why should you take a massive pay cut\nAnd then the big dangerous drag your family through the mud for six months to sit there and and get on ... and this is huge tree corrosive to our country thought in you know I I think they just need to push you I think\nIt is making a book that you\nThink the head of great can he doesn't get him or it's not good for the stock market because people are going to question what is going to happen in the election if the Democrats get control of the house\nGoing to have a problem if they get in cold blood thinner we're willing to have probably had a huge uproar and the concrete for the next two years that you could kill the economy goodbye he hits the stock market and buy in and said this is something that everybody watching and everybody you found it out I mean I I on so many levels\n... chip is a bad idea the only thing if if the idea is is for the\nFor the uh\nThe Democrats to maybe stop a cap it off but but this is something that we do want to watch it in and take a look at it in the ... what will happen in show going forward\nIt ... the current crisis in these countries when the currency collapses equipped huge pressure on the company's doing that are that are based there because they followed in dollars and they had they struggled to repay their their debts\nYou bet he makes a great group who's been appreciated very much to say thanks a lot and ah and I think we'll see you have any comments and get a caller Kevin one clearly ... pins Seventy here in the max out saving show\n[noise] never sit here and we're ready to go or the\nYou know and that's one of the I mean we really looked at one of the things that kind of jumped out at you when you look at the at the emerging markets is really they corrected you know pretty hardy here and so a\nHope you look at China's down twenty percent if you look at Hong Kong down about twenty percent the emerging market your down about twenty or so and so these markets Ramos crashing in a way down I mean some of these some of these declines of happened pretty quickly it until you got to wonder is it can spread in it\nI don't think we're quite there yet even example of of one thing we've done in some of the emerging market is we've come in and um\n[noise] and uh\nWe we invested in some of the things in in China in what we did in China was\nWe we were able to we we invested in in in China Mobile you like ten why would you invest in China Mobile in\nTrying a mobile had the ... ... they've got one of the best that you are franchises in the world in China in big chunk of the Chinese market\nThat China Mobile what I Would read up on China it and it's like we will not to invest in China Mobile they have forty billion dollars worth of cash and know that in the government might make them do something with the forty billion dollars\nIn in its its approximate number right but and you're kinda like whoa wait a minute all the other cell companies have a hundred billion dollars in debt these guys have forty billion dollars in cash they can grow into a tiny gets in trouble\nThe Chinese aren't going to give up on their cellphone China has forty billion dollars they can make a move to gloat or business in China or elsewhere in the world and so what you want to try to do is find companies who then Whitney well he's finding companies look a lot of cash\nPoised to grow and they have the ability to do it you know one of the reasons why Amazon and some of these other companies have been able to grow\nAnd we've been we've always thought Amazon was overvalued\nKeeps getting overvalued but they have the cash flow which they can invest back into the business get it and if a company has the cash for who picked up ... whom think cash flow not a lot of that that's\nWhat you want to be in this world because we're coming into a world\nWhere interest rates are rising inflation is rising corporate America is loaded up on massive amounts of debt and so you want to be in the companies that don't have a lot of debt that are in pretty good shape where they're going to benefit poor the growth is going to be next and I I think that's one of the big things were going to see going forward [noise] ah\nI I think I we we talk a lot about one of the ... the ... the financial economy in the inflationary world financial economy does that do well the real world as well because wages are going up people spending more\nBut but there's demand in ... the one of the reasons why inflation is happening is because you can't get a whale car you can't get you can't get any\nUh you can't get a try I Try to get a clock you have this ... every time he chipped something the price goes up in the process of making a ton of money workers are making a lot of money ... and so that's the real world\nOr look what Donald Trump has put tariffs then they're lowering the boom ON Technology for whom the Chinese so going forward\nCorporate America getting going hey we're not sure what's going to happen and trying to have an all posed as maybe we should ... be back in the United states and the ... when it comes to workers' wages is is the one in court and thing to remember is\nHe lives in the Alan Greenspan [noise] one of the reasons why they've not over the last decade we've not seen over more and more we've not seen wages go up in the United states was because of China is that's why I'm going to that but I guess he did but\nIt went out and granted we've not seen productivity go up in the future the big threat to to work because it's gonna be robotic well why not put all the robotics in the United states in in the world because you're hired before and the robots in the United states so workers' wages on the\nTable person on the line they're putting together widgets\nAnd they go down the assembly line well I can only pay so much for the person to to to put the which again 'cause I got to sell the the you know the the the symbol thing out of the widget to be in if I have robots in the factory they're producing all but I I maybe ... a few less people but\n[laughter] but I can pay that person a heck of a lot more money 'cause he's meaning the robots are doing two and three and four times to work\nSo I can pay you more but there's a shortage of workers in the United states so now I put more more will by seeing my guys become more ... more productive productivity due to the to the robot I can pay those people more and that's what you're seeing in the United states so exciting things happening in the real economy\nThe financial economy will that you must be shenanigans on Wall street with private equity people all types of\nOf corporate CEOs leveling up their balance sheets of ... stuff that's coming to an end that can affect stock prices and this is something we're gonna have to see going forward so that the interesting that say well this is the last segment a show if you've got a question or comment you want to get in and now it's time to call it seven one three\nThree three nine ten Seventy seven won three three three Nineteen Seventy year than actually saving show\n[noise] who\nWas saying who've been talking more about about the health care [noise] some recent numbers I've seen it's two hundred and eighty thousand dollars is what you're going to have to be saved up that's actually after taxes even more than that five Fifteen an IRA gets to pay for your health care costs in\nOne third of early retirees have declined Social Security at sixty sixty two and a half because of health care and listen to something we really been talking a lot about the on the show\nYou try to keep your health care as good as possible your health as good as possible to eat well the exercise because one of the ... biggest expenses to ... to to retirees who's helped kill it\nWe have some ... to pull don't fall through the row and had health issues is difficult and they struggle all the time what surprises me about some of those people is there some of the ones that work hard it's it's really hard for them to work out\nBut they do it to try to maintain their health and some people really have to struggle it ... it and so but if you\nIf you're in good health you want to continue in good health you want to continue to work out and want to eat well didn't manage your health in by managing your hell\nYou think you can you ... ... you can improve the quality of your of your retirement you extend your retirement assets 'cause you're not having to pay out for help here\nSo it it it truly ... it's one of the thing you hear a lot about maintaining good health you'll live longer and everything but the other ... you're not spending as much money either in health care it's gotten so expensive it's probably the number one\nConcern for retirees in so make sure you're eating well make sure you're exercising in managing your health care it it it it I think this is going to be one of the\nReal keys going forward [laughter] and so it just whomever Medicare starch at age sixty five which means the government comes in subsidize they said the average retiree about on Medicare it's about five thousand a year I'm like oh my God I Wish I had five thousand dollars a year\nI I think our medical costs for health care for my family wasn't close to thirty thousand dollars a year just astonishing into\nThe er at and we're reasonably good health uh for the most part and it's just put I put to understand but once you hit sixty five then you'd go on the Medicaid Medicare and that'll that'll reduce your car or but you also have to continue to work on managing that health care\n[noise] [noise] [noise] no\nA couple of things were going to be seen this week the couple of weeks we're doing a lot of research to the market to me were coming in to it too dangerous time in here in looking at uh in in um October we've got the election coming up the first week of November\nWe're basically a month away from the election right now a year and it looks like we're going to hold the Senate if we talked about earlier in the show the question is going to be the house I think when you hold the house yeah I think it's really important to get Brett Kavanaugh group to keep the\nThe base fired up this is why the Democrats are fighting so hard against Brett Kavanaugh number one they want to keep him off to the Senate\nFault they want to if they can keep them if they can hold off for thirty days\nThere's a possibility that they do get the Senate at that point in time they can put a liberal a liberal\nJustice obviously they're going to do anything you can see here already seeing people lying about what Brent Kavanaugh will there be pretty clearly lying about what what ... what he did it and you know the the one\nThe bar the doctor
