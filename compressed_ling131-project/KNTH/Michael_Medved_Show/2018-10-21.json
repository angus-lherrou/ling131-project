{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "Lisa Adam ... thank you for bringing all of the show by the way I don't know why I'm going to ask this question would have just done what we do have a dog\nAs yes I Do how many one one seventh on your feet was her name or her isn't it neat guy\nHow 'bout that probably listening to the show right now right so they're gonna they're short break and come right back stay with us real estate matter we're still matters we're still on the boat and still cruising boat\n\nShell step in and risk management\nMichele welcome to the show they spelled thanks for having me let's get an idea from the very basics of home insurance some of the things that you think people should think about and and how you engage in that conversation absolutely so\nReally when you're looking at a home insurance policy there's two components there's two sides of it it's the structure and the personal property and how you would cover on this side and then on the other side it's the liability component medical payments et cetera\nSo really you have to break those into two and then dissected have that conversation talked about what the customer's going to be responsible for\nVersus what we're going to have the insurance company pay and personal ... liability and medical payments is it how do you protect yourself from those\nThe situations that come up in life um you know pop it essentially as property damage and bodily injury to others so when those events happen how do you protect yourself from those those are issues\nAnd simply put that's why people really should have a conversation with someone at your company where you can tailor the insurance properly whether it's Homer auto but in this case the home because there are so many things to think about and each policy is different definitely\nDefinitely there's so many variables and insurance and one size doesn't always set off so\nIt's important to have that conversation\nTalked to somebody who is knowledgeable who is um can help give you that confidence when you're making coverage decisions and ask ask questions so that you can\nUh again um grow personally and develop your understanding of the coverage that you're buying 'em you know it's it's a two way street we've got to communicate\nA you've got to tell me what what your risks are and I'm going to investigate with you and help you discover those risks and then we're going to find a solution for you so um as long as the customers engaged and involved in the process with us then we're going to be able to find something that will never won meet their needs and and help protect them after a loss and of\nCourse you are looking at policies all the time and are very familiar where the average person may not be because the ... when we look at a policy there are so many words there there's so many contingencies and and this actually difficult so we really encourage people to reach out and talk with you on the phone number here by the way I'm\nSure it's eight six six eight four or five four six eight seven six again that's eight six six eight four or five for six seven sex\nGive us a word on some of the things that we should think about when thinking about the duck couples\nWho we already kind of touched on on the fact that I'm\nBeing shirt or the customer the homeowner is taking on some responsibility and then the insurance company takes on responsibility as well the ... century their responsibility what they're going to have to pay to recover\nAnd if the insurance policy doesn't provide you know central coverages then it there's a possibility that customers going to pay above and beyond that that duct double our job is to help discover those above and beyond and find solutions for them or at least educate somebody on what they are out of pocket risks will be\nAlso let's do people the website so they can see the full offering of what we have here Stuart insurance to risk management\nIts steward dot com and you are just search for the insurance tab\nIn the policy and we're not going to talk about flood right now but other water situations that occur in the home those are things that should be looked up because other than a flood water can come through walls leaking pipes hole in the roof tell us about that\nAbsolutely so you've got the you know the rising water we've talked to 'em at links\nAnd then you have for additional water damage coverages and most people don't know that those even exist\nSo you've got that never once said in an accidental that's the first type scenario and then after that you've got water backup of sewers and drain so essentially if water backs up into the home through the water entry points that's any water entry point in the home the third is a foundation water damage coverage\nSo if you have covered water loss and they have to dig in and ... into that\nFoundation in order to access the plumbing that would protect the homeowner and that in that event to recover that foundation and remember that the plumbing system itself is not covered it's the damage that's caused from the water loss so that's again that's something they touch where I wouldn't be responsible for the homeowner\nSo many nuances once again the show it's really were making the case that you really should prepare and go over the policy with professional like yourself or you know they can reach out\nAbsolutely at eight six six eight four or five for six seven six one more time eight six six\nEight four or five for six seven takes and bill one last water damage I almost missed it see Bijan leakage coverage yeah and that's the big one the one that most of these don't pay for\nBecause it is something that's typically excluded you don't just need to ask you need to understand what the the limitations on your policy so definitely make sure again those for a secret you only get sudden accidental water back up and then foundation water damage\nBernard Michelle stuff during the journey remember commercial and welcome back real say metal door title and our final segment as we\nPull into the docket you tuning into the YouTube channel

this way it's going to be no exception because we have an absolutely fantastic show lined up for you\nBut before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am ... writes the host money matters with Ken were raped\n[noise] jak I've been\nIn the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting you\nKnow\nAnd I do and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh as at the end of last month we not work with over eight thousand families in forty three states we are honored we are privileged and recently barons named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states\nAnd this is actually the sixth year in a row and without our clients that would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you I Hope you guys listen to the show right now are having an absolutely fantastic weekend I Hope everything is coming up roses for you and we have a great show so let me go over with you\nWhat we're gonna talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land the personal finances show for you and I we absolutely do add\nSo as money matters are from his grown and I'm just mentioned that we have a we were not work with over eight thousand families what I've also come to realize is that we have a great responsibility to those clients\nAnd you know when I first started this business back when I was a a you know I said I've been in his business now for twenty nine years so I was actually four years old when we started and when I was four years old\n[laughter] you know I didn't quite you know I I never didn't think that we would be where we are today but I actually also didn't really think about that we are going to be where we are today I just kind of went with it and you know as things progressed to just kept on going so now as it's as we've come to where we are\n[noise] I've come to the point where I realized that we have a responsibility to all these families that we work with\nAnd so one of the things that I thought about was you know you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do [laughter] that would be a bad thing right so one of the things that we decided to do was that we would have what we call decision one hundred\nAnd vision one hundred is that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong as not stronger as it is today\nSo how do you do that how do you build a company that's going to be here a hundred years from now serving our current clients their families down the line and all those kinds of things and\nSo to do that I studied a variety of companies that have been in business for a hundred years to see how they did it\nBecause if you think about it the last hundred years have been you know fraught with all kinds of things you had world wars we've had a you know bad economic times we've had boom times technology's changed I mean everything it's like all kinds of stuff that happened\nBut yet these companies endured and so what was it that enabled them to endure\nAnd so I Want to take you this uh this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and then you're investing life because we're a financial adviser for him\nSo it'll it it it it sounds kind of the you know philosophical this week but I think we're going to I'll bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as as uh from\nWhat we've decided is that we have to go so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy that helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to accomplish\nSo in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are that we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want them to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that and philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nWhen you retire we specialized work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just lost your money you're you're you're not financially or they have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that endures and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that endures\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that\nAre important if they're going to have a successful life okay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six of core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay\nSo that's the first thing I always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do this\nThe core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more ... you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you\nKnow I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if for example just if you lied on your resume to get a job\nAnd you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise]\nOne of the things that uh I Am not going to apologize for is that we would like to have you if you are\nThe

twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at every single one of them has had a character of its own and they've all been different and they've all been that\nAnd that this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over a thousand families so\n[laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently uh barons named why you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row\nAnd uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am Baron\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of the of of business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business is the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life\nAnd so I think that this week that this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with a thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of a family of grandparents do you have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that uh as this thing grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now and if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taken care of and so well they're down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have\nTo build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years and I think families so to apply this to you personally\nFamilies that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients are obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble if we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do\nBut in the broader context then how would you would apply to in your life you know I I my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over\nAgain every time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song that you know I I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay so now you've got to keep keep doing that making\nA client every day so we visit with a client when they come individually with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters we want anybody that comes to ah talk to us that does not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have that person understand that every single time\nDon't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go away you take your children for granted your children to go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not\nAnd what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net is our website money matters dot net\nAnd you have three things that you can do their alright ... one is you can get my market alert email and it's free goes out at least weekly\nAnd or you can subscribe to that

build your financial plan and uh we'll do all that at no charge obligation and if it helps you fantastic and if it does it you know what that fine to we will part friends\nAnd then finally uh you if you don't want to do any of those things that you can also do a third thing which is you can go to one of our seminars\nAnd over the years we've had thousands of people attend our seminars and uh I

is the part of shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean or Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter]\nThere you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing sticking your ear and a Q tip stand for qualified terminal interest property but that we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trust that is designed to benefit your spouse\nSo if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen to okay but before we do that ... can you play it\n\nYou you\nKnow my ...\n\n\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually\nDesigned to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the field our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago we ... we not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have an actual security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our firm will be called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today [laughter]\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of a ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is a core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\nIf not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love\nThen somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe to more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will continue to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a burn as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all to love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so stay planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in and cannot come out no in fact just the opposite a Q tip trust is there for your spouse\nTo be able to have access to the night for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many and but what it does do is it protected them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point that could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the Q tip trust\nOkay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you to pick something for you to think about so this shell we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that you've got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\n... Saturday morning\nSaturday morning and welcome to the max out saving show I'm catchy okay we're talking stating that meant in your retirement it's always hear on the max out saving show our motto in our philosophy is it safe aggressively in death conservatively that a key to building up all over the longer\nThe saber aggressively invest considerably that's we we have to show we talk about savings we talk about and that's when we talk about\nThe market ... and and I understand well how to how to build all this very rapidly change or you're going into a completely different world than we ever had for the last two or three a century or three decades and a\n... and that's going to fundamentally change change the market it's going to fundamentally change the uh\nThe investment world out there yet and so we're going from a you know last thirty or forty years we were great globalization and and now we're seeing some of the problems they were unable to correct the problems with globalization they did not think to try to\nAll the problems and now we have huge problems we have a ... a Chinese government they get moving in that closely into hard line communism that's now\nBuilding so far most key manufacturing component in well in a ... so that that it's become a threat to the country and if you look at it the trait that debate about three hundred and fifty billion dollars\nYeah well that's about ... percent a year off of our GDP Growth and uh\nAnd and that that is going to throw it down and that and and that's the reason why the decade one of the reasons we've had checked for wrote because China has taken the growth and that has been a huge problem [laughter] so going forward oh things are changing ... let's see more of that [noise] [noise] [noise] so\nHold on just one would I Would have a question of how much you get a caller in on three three three nine ten Seventy right here on the backs up saving show [noise] they [noise] so what we're what we're looking at how do you what\nWhy don't we go to a quick break here and you got any questions or comments you call it that one on three\nPoint nine Seventy seven one Greek or anything\nI can probably get your questions answered and also make sure you go to the website ... dot\nCom plaques up savings dot com or for we got we could not do record here coming out here uh [noise] Monday morning while you're on the last ... the way next savings dot com\nHave you got savings and investment questions ... has the answer\nAll the metro serving show now it's seven three three three nine cents of every [noise] we'll be right\nBack [noise]\n\nThis is hedge yoga hosted in Mexico city show want to Houston most popular financial radio shows celebrating over a decade on the air and he's from Texas stocks at record high valuation citizens rates the record lows you need to have your garden you need to have a plan to manage receive retirement [noise] do you\nRead maxim savings advisors we have a risk based I use destined for the return if you like some help managing retirement\nSort of mix up savings dot com to set up a point sets max out savings dot com\nDown time with your family that's your own time you're hydro as the middle because most of the rings specialize hollers rocket ... drugs when you're not working using grow money\nSo those are drawn to monitor service revere the hydraulic systems that keep you or was it was just so thrilled to designing so hydraulic system from a woman's Austria level official rule or Brussels manufacturing while we're using ... or drop us see her drawings shocked\nBy I'm Sam alone you know me as the host of the morning show right here on AM ten Seventy the answer but I'm also the owner uses cutting edge\nEasier somebody called ... had five twelve reasons we three amazing videos to companies use on their website selling ... for the sighting animation\nGraham said five twelve new ...

[laughter] what are we talked to on the show the other week about the the the Chinese are are putting in chips into into our into the mother boards at the ... which is the base of the of the computers in ah for serve computer servers\nThat we communicate with another server elsewhere and these were going in the Amazon and apple apple servers in in ... at Amazon and apple and ah they're server farms in in some cases used by our intelligence agencies in and they discovered it and there was a fascinating story comes out of Bloomberg that this was going on\nIn a in the ...\nAnd so ... in the story apple had to remove seven thousand servers in from the deal and so\nThe question apple apple says or have the story is not true they\nQuestion Amazon the story is not true another story comes out from Bloomberg so pretty clearly this was a most likely the government leaking this stuff they've known about this and you know the apple and Amazon maybe ... there was a man he was only five thousand servers or something so they could say the story was untrue\nBut clearly this is coming out I commented about this to someone else in the remark was Ted\nWe were told about this like ten years ago in a particularly on the software side in and they were having trouble dealing with this type of stuff\nAnd and we've allowed this to go on and on and nobody stopped the Chinese no one said a word to the Chinese until Donald Trump came along and finally stood up for the American people in the United states I talked to her that I think about this three hundred and fifty billion dollars\nIs what our ah is what our a\nTrade deficit is with China three hundred and fifty million\nSo we have a sixteen trillion dollar economy now I probably should have done this ahead of time but I didn't but here we are defined that by sixteen trillion\nA\n... I mean you see that's about to point two percent a year in economic growth that China was getting over us and you want to know why China is growing at ten percent a year most like because they were taking huge amounts of of our economy away from us and transferring it over to China and and so now we're we're in the\nProcess of seeing the these factories are look all there is something called the supply chain in supply chain is simply with a big corporation when you pick up your product at Wal Mart or\nTarget or whatever it's you know you buy the a toaster oven or the a dress or whatever it it came from somewhere and it had to be produced somewhere and some of the parts for the toaster oven had to be produced somewhere else they came together\nThey produced a toaster oven then they had to ship the toaster oven to the United states will that's called the supply chain now maybe they made the toaster oven in China maybe some of the parts for the toaster the heating element in the courts came from Vietnam and it all comes together and the supply chain in it arrives at a nice box and you pick it up at\nAt target and take it take it home and use it well the problem is\nBut that that if I understand okay we have five thousand years of history reasonably good you go back two thousand years it's much better than the history is much better if you dig down really deep understand it the people understand what the knowledge we have from that time\nFive thousand years back in history the bank of England did a study what did they find we had the lowest interest rates in two years in the last two years ago in the history of planet earth or five thousand years unless there was some civilization that I didn't know about before that you can listen to some people will tell you yes I don't think so but\nUh [noise] so\nThat was unique time in history and and so actually\nThe two ... to ... the lowest interest rates in history that the zero interest rates that the Federal Reserve understand\nStock market crash has happened materially more often than than the interest rates hitting zero like they did materially more often\n... and so what we're seeing is is that that was the ... that was a fundamental outlier that was a literal black swan of all the black swans that happened the black swan the biggest black swan out there was\nThe zero interest rates that's changing so now let's take a look at interest rates you can get\nOn a two year on a two year a one year CD you can get two point six percent so there's opportunities out there on a one year treasury we like treasury scene here two point six percent the latest numbers I've really been going up\nA on a a even a even a ... a three month treasury bills to point two percent\nYou can go we we've looked in a way we own some of the uh the the ... uh I think it's a G. E. B. I. L. which are are basically treasury short term treasury E. T. S. that are paying reasonably good they're a little below this because the rates are going up so quick they're lagging a little bit but when they go down they'll they'll go the other way but\nSo uh\nSo you're getting so we're entering a very dangerous time for the stock market but there's opportunities because for the first time you get over two percent or more an extremely safe investments\nAnd so you want to increase your cash levels before if you if you sat on the sidelines you weren't getting paid anything to do it now you are okay now is when the dangers particularly ramping up uh we we had a client called not a client ... when the client it was just a caller called in\nLast week in the show and he said I'm not getting any money on my CDs on my money market sounds like he just had a bunch of money and a checking account well if you go to the bank and say like a one year CD you get at Wells Fargo and I just pulled the numbers off of TV it's about two point\nWe used to the marriage rate it's about two point six percent of\nFull disclosure I use Wells Fargo but they're paying a lot more now because the the you know the reputation has been a little tarnished so they're trying to work real hard to get back and everybody's good graces\nUp [noise] so so\nThat the good the bad news out there is things are really starting to work about against the in the in the stock market and talk some more about that the good news is there are other opportunities are starting to come up opportunities we haven't seen in years for not huge returns but to protect us so when the time comes we're gonna have a lot of money to invest\nIt really good bargain what let's take a call from Rick hello Rick how're you doing\n[laughter] um I Want to you or your brain I'm sure you know a lot of them from getting close to retirement okay are trying to think of the strategy\nWhere money I have a four O. one K. and her her and how how can I minimize that they're gonna pay on that money coming out\nOkay a\n... a couple of ways or what to say I I how much do you have outside of your four one K. saved up\nBallpark out for the oral one about a ...\nOkay good ah the reason I I asked that question is\nTypically for retirement the numbers about four percent of years which you can take out the ... seats in numbers of the the the study by us revenge and a number of years back was four point to three percent\nOr is it yeah some words for four and a quarter somewhere in there you can take out a year and then in in the ... the thing about that as it then it should grow with inflation overtime so it will keep going up and you can continue taking the four point\nA to five percent out uh so what you want to do is you take your for all and K plan in typical you roll it over into an IRA roll over and then what I Would do is I'd set yourself up on a monthly pay out to get a check once a month\nOr you can do it or\nTwice a week you know every other week if you want but typically most people just once a month in in ... and then\nAnd then you you take it out now ... a year for four and a quarter percent now if you need less than that if you can get by with lesson that that's good uh so if you can kind of get by with three and a half just keep the extra money and they are because remember Rick you'll never run out of money the first five years of retirement or ten years\nThe danger is if you live to be Ninety Ninety five that's when you really gotta be careful and that's why you want to minimize taking out as much as possible early\n... their neck and pointed the reason why I asked about what you had elsewhere so\nYou want to work with your taxes in your Social Security to try to figure out where you are on the taxing to trying to not kick you in two different levels so let's say you're you're you're making do with eighty thousand dollars a year or between your Social Security and and your retirement\nOr in all of a sudden the ... the car the car breaks down and you need to buy a new uh you'd let's say you just need to buy a new car completely gives out and you you find a nice car and it's thirty five thousand dollars and ... and you don't want to you want to put down\nTen thousand to keep your payments as low as possible and then and then finding into that well if you take out another ten thousand give it keeps you up to Ninety thousand dollars\nSo yeah okay that's race your tax bracket if you take it out of your Seventy five thousand you know once every five years or so then uh\nYou know hopefully a buildup backup overtime then you haven't raised your tax bracket up in ... and that's where it's it's important to have that money outside of your plan to allow you to do that maybe of medical expense comes up or something happens some emergency you don't want to have to dip into your ... your up\nInto your IRA roller yes because at that point in time it's always going to be at the highest marginal tax\nBracket no matter where rackets urine\n[noise] uh are you an advocate of the older you know if you don't have\nSocial Security or ... or maybe Seventy\nYeah absolutely yeah yeah ... ... again\nNo one ever runs out a truck runs into trouble five or ten years it's Thirty years in the future or Twenty years twenty five years in the future and and what's so tough to understand is we don't know what's gonna happen\nWe don't know if we're going to have a big inflation I think we'll have more inflation personally we don't know if we have a deflation we don't want to ... a World War we don't know what's gonna happen so the ... put things off\nTo to get to have better clarity the better off we're going to be in and remember up until age Seventy with your Social Security goes up about eight percent a year that's a pretty good return\nYeah one or or what you're what you're going to happen to her friends are they going to go out\n[noise] you know [noise]\nI I don't think so ... if if if the if the Democrats get control the house I don't think you're going to see any more tax cuts and you might see the higher higher earners taxes go up\nA ... with ... the real danger going forward it's going to be all types of of of of of fees and assessments and all types of things like that and what's particularly scary in a world of of big data in a in a\nSensors and everything else you can come up with all types of toes levees and assessments in fees on people and that that's going to be the bigger problem in the future\n[noise] wow [noise] oh very well for him\nUp banks are great questions wreck [noise] they ... some good really good question uh that that's the thing is how do you make your funds last in in in one of the the the things I really like here is yeah\nWith with the interest rates rising is is for your interest rate component which is a little more steady we're finally getting returns that\nI think think justify the risks are the interesting thing we have somewhat of a ... year old curve and so when I mentioned the CDs and the and these these these I mentioned the Treasury's because uh we also invested in individual corporate bonds but but the treasury says it's kind of a good guide post so if you kinda\nGet get the treasury your curve\nIt'll give you some ideas of where the different rates are at different things and you can get a certain percentage over that\nUh by investing in corporate your CD sometimes a interestingly a\nTreasury shield more than CDs and less than a year which is fascinating to me up\nAnd try we liked treasures because they're extremely liquid in extremely safe now will move out to pick up either in in times of crisis will really move more into the bond market to take advantage of of of people's panicking really win in two thousand eight and two thousand nine were extremely successful in the bond market taking advantage of\nOf of liquidity issues\nDebt be careful with the ... the account and it has to be a done a certain way otherwise you can avoid out parts of your will it wreck your state plant uh same thing can be said for a better fishery forms we we see this a lot people will roll over there either re ... they'll retire from\nYou know the proverbial Exxon and uh and then they'll just decided to use their existing IRA account that they opened up with five thousand dollars Twenty years ago when you know it's worth but I don't know\nTwenty five thousand dollars now and they just wrote it in there and well they forgot that that they did that when they only had two children and now they had another child but since it was such a small account at the time they forgot about it in\nTime has passed no one remembers what happened and all of a sudden you have the IRA with one of the children his left off the beneficial reform and to understand your beneficial reform is something there that you off you have to watch as well in the past a lot of the stuff\nOr you didn't have accounts\nThe e typically the stuff all went to ... and now more and more of these accounts are tied in with with with joint type of accounts\n... big amounts of stock or rolled in there are put in there by mistake in in ... ... ... it it just destroys your state plant so something to think about we're going to be where there's a little complicated it's in the ... same support it's a lot simpler than I made it right here\nAre so if you want to copy that just go to the website max out savings dot com Senate for the Freeh report\nA markets you know what can I say um\n[noise] lick it just\nDoesn't look good for the stock market this market his uh his sold off here it's gone down about ten percent of the NASDAQ we are clients where we've hedged or had to have a short on the NASDAQ right now we're out of the group\n[noise] for our clients we did that right at the top ... ... it really it just it just didn't look good and uh the ... the the NASDAQ has fallen ten percent it's come up a little bit the S. and P. and the Dow are down about several of them over seven between seven and eight percent\nOr ... it just doesn't look good at struggling to to stay above those ... or a levels that it went to ... looking at something when the market started going down or doing things unexpectedly people tend to turn to technicals a lot of uh in\n[noise] if you look at the average is the only major average still above or not that it's not broken the two hundred a moving average is is the Dow Jones industrial average which is quite frankly the easiest one to manipulate it uh the rest of them of all broken down or the the the the uh\nThe the S. and P. five hundred is is basically a ... at the that ones at the ... the two hundred day uh the uh\nThe the NASDAQ has completely broken underneath the two hundred a moving average the transports of broken under the two hundred a moving average the Russell two thousand is broken under the two [noise]\nTwo hundred a moving average in in the N. Y. M. C. uh has broken under the two hundred a moving average of the interesting thing is on the U.S some peas under the two are right after two hundred a moving average\nThe choo choo choo and the SP why which is the indexes are above those numbers a little bit\nWhich I find interesting I think the reason those things are hanging above it I think if they break underneath those averages is going to trigger an enormous amount of selling or people in these index funds and so I think they see I ... that's something I've not seen where we're we're like the the NASDAQ Composite\nTypically if the NASDAQ Composite goes down to a level on and moving average the the two key accused at the same place in the same with the U.S and the five hundred all the money is piled up in the SP why in the cute cute cute those were above those numbers if they break underneath the lookout [noise] uh I\nI just see a market this breaking down and and so I think you really have to be cautious I think higher levels of cash treasuries a money market uh\nThose type of things I I think is what you want to look at it here we ... we were very defensive for our clients retirement money right now uh you know it it's\nIt just interest rates are going up quantitative easing is ending inflation's going up the trade war we believe is much more serious than people think is we've been saying uh you're seeing tightness in labor markets companies having to\nPay more for workers more for transport more for just sticks\nThey're having to put new manufacturing in the United states from China that's more expensive uh they're under pressure to do things\nOr the dollar is going up that's pressuring earnings everything the tide is coming out in the investment world it and so now is when you want to basically be heading for the safety of shore and and so\nThis is something we're going to watch this is the last segment if you'd like to get in with the question or comment and give us a call here at seven one three three three nine ten Seventy seven one three three three nine ten Seventy here on the max out saving show the last segment of the show\n[noise] [noise] well\nSo I think you really have to have your defensive plan in place ... it's just I you know a\n... ... if you look around the world at the markets are breaking down or the emerging markets have broken down badly China's down well over between twenty five and thirty percent a\nDebt rallied a little bit on friday a you know it it's just that\n... are emerging market way down an emerging market bonds down everything appears to be selling off in here and you and I to me the smart money is backing away from this market is getting pulling back in and they really are putting their defensive plan in place in and I think for your retirement I think that's going to be really important [noise]\nBy the way she did you see the story about the uh\nThe UN postal treaty the United states is pulling about pulling out of\nThis is a fascinating story it the the poster treaty was it's a hundred and forty four year old treaty and it's sort of if it's bases set up so if you were in South America Africa hundred years ago were Asia and you wanted a male something to the United states\nYou know they ... it back over in those countries maybe people may twenty five dollars a year and so you couldn't charge 'em a couple of bucks for postage\nSo they they gave 'em reduced rates and so it was kind of set up so if you wanted a male something in in ... you know Saddam Iraq or Peru or or a gun or somewhere like that you could sit there and\nThen you get a discount rate to mail it to the United states because of people just weren't making any money well China\nThe so the un set these rates with China they're postage is is is is subsidized over there so the Chinese have it manufactured been mailing small packages like to point two pounds to point a a four point four pounds or less packages the\nUnited States have vastly reduced risk in some cases that we're paying a quarter of the price it cost us manufacturers to shift the product a couple of states over the\nChinese were able to to ship it for a quarter the price into the United states at the same thing it it was a huge advantage\nTo a it was a huge advantage to Chinese manufacturers or this is a big uh this is a big hit on alley barber or you know because a lot of people using Alibaba's to shipping products cheaply into the United states\nIs using this ... this ... this ridiculously subsidize post it just was hurting us manufacturers could not compete against Chinese manufacturers even if they could produce at the same\nPrice for small orders because the Chinese could beat them on postage [noise] so they were maybe it was costing them two dollars\nOr two fifty to shift to the small package and it was called the American manufactured ten dollars amazing stories so President Trump is pulling out of the un postal ... a treaty and that's going to be there I think they're going to do within the next nine months or so receptive things but it's just an amazing story of\nFang stocks Facebook apple Amazon Netflix Google or we wrote about these two reports ago said they were Ninety eight percent of the total returning the S. and P. five hundred structural breaking down a China I mean I'm hearing on\nApple Apple's having trouble selling into China now ah there's some question on their earnings that was probably the strongest one of the group ah Facebook's doing very poorly Amazon\nNot doing well Netflix they had a good quarter but we'll see how long it holds and Google lot of pressure across the board on the sector we'd avoid the fat girl look I I think the tide again is going out a now's the time to have your risk management

restaurant association\nOr there are a number of ... you know what I Want you served as president the Texas chapter I Know I served as the president uh Houston chapter but I did serve on the Texas board of the more you know a number of times as well and so I'm really what what the restaurant association does it represents Houston I'll just talk about the the state is the same way\nIt represents really all every restaurant in the in the in the industry or in this particular region whether it's a member or not a member\nDo they do any lobbying on behalf of Russia and I do from a ...

stakes in other countries\nBecause the thing about moving to Houston and some of those contact me and say I'm thinking about opening up a restaurant in Houston and in fact later I might ask you to give a couple of baby constructed tips but uh if someone does open a restaurant and he used to work a couple of benefits of them actually joining the restaurant association\nWhile the ... the

importantly let me say this jak you know we're a very strong group as it relates to government affairs so if you feel like you need representation\nIt's not just about electing the official that you think as an individual businessmen that you want\nIt's about somebody that has the ability to sit down with them individually and say and proposed to them now we're representing close to ten thousand restaurants in the community congressman or city council member so and so it was ... or ... or so and so we need some time to talk about this whether we win that argument or not we certainly have to listen\nTo one thing is kind of unusual about Houston in contrast to a lot of other cities we don't have the same kind of zoning prohibitions that a lot of city so a lot of times here in Houston you might find a nice little restaurant right in the middle of a residential neighborhood where is this that allowed and ...\nA lot of like meat and potatoes that did you have an upscale twist\nAnd we do

once myself and I'll ask you about that um that I had but I Want to just lightly touch on a few samples of some things just to maybe get the appetite work at a listener so that when it come in and\nLook at the whole menu and try out some things let's start out with your lunch menu I'm here's something interesting here on your starters your hill country spare ribs sells about those\nAgain those are high quality spare ribs a cut and if you will we smoke does in house every single day and they're ... it's an appetizer dish\nAnd it has a slower within a blue cheese law where they which is red cabbage if you will and in ... that we do with blue cheese crumble which is a very unique slow it's not an old south creamy mayonnaise ... grandma's law they it's got a very ... feel to it with some really sharp miss with the blue cheese but those those ribs or fall off the bone\nAnd suddenly they caught my fancy here at all your salads I Love to go to the Caribbean a lot and I also love curry and you have credit Caribbean curry let us wrap that was one of\nThe first issues that we did at lunch to try to bring in more healthy oriented item to the to the menu\nAnd that is basically a curry glaze that we do or if you will a mix sauce that we blend in with with uh basically roasted chicken breasts and dice it up and and it it's it's kind of a take on west wraps if you will\nUh and so you can build his got fresh apples and grapes and lots of grapefruit that you can build your own little bit of lettuce rap if you were with that Cory chickens or proteins are putting in it\nThat way before you go on to some more specific guys do you cook yourself\nI Do I have for years although I'm not a registered chef\nIf you will I I've done a lot of cooking in my life that we've done a lot of things I've got a lot of catering environment that I've done a lot of things of that nature I even own a hundred year old Chuck wagon their buddy and I do\nA comes up with most of the many like you said your son helps you and\nWe did it together the three of us my oldest son Chris myself and my youngest son column is our chef and we did this menu Christian I really early on what the corner Eighteen that was in place at that time\nAnd then calling today really does a lot of it my input to them as what about this let's change that here's some new ideas in my son's on my request just take it and run with it if you will now\nHe has a lot of different sandwiches are here and there was something um I'd never seen a crab cake sandwich tell us about that\nWell the crab cake is so popular we wanted to do something more seafood we do a great shrimp\nPoe boy you won't find anything better than that here you can go to New Orleans and find some great ... boys but this is as good as anybody's but war to kind of a span expand that if you look at the menu at lunch and even then your dinner there is some Creole influence is because of where we're at and the crab cake was so good we just said well let's do it into a ...\nOne day like a burger is like a burger if you will and will use the same burger further than we do for our our our great Lone Star burger and that kind of hickory burger and it's been a great items so it's very healthy so forth\nI enjoyed it very much you're a grilled maple blind pork chop tell us a little bit about that\nA lot that pork chop his his hand cut is blind for twenty four hours at minimum minimum with a special Brian\n... let me say a lot of times I'm hesitant to order pork chops because they can tend to be kind of heart and dry this was very tender was tender because\nOf the brine we don't take it right out of the refrigerator and then put it on the grill it's basically in a brining solution a seasoning salt water running solution for over twenty four hours which breaks down the tissue if you will of the raw pork chop which gives you that that tenderness in Geneva before you ever go to the rule\nThat we serve that at lunch and an eight hour portion at night it's a double bone caught at twelve ounce portion it's really a great pork chop almost two inches thick at night but it's the same product\nThat maple ... baking maple glaze bases you see there is just our take on a ... I found it to be a great compliment to yeah you kind of spread it on the night that you want to take it off on the bike you don't put it back\nThey have something of the interesting name here under your main dishes for lunch past us to go ... and by the time\nWell you know a lot of people do Mira Nair if you will or meat sauce of innocent scenario but I basically did that dish I built a super Rosa one day I'm a classic guy in terms of you asked me to go to an Italian Restaurant I'm going to get a pass to some kind with a meat sauce or meat balls or something like that\nAnd I felt like we needed something there is a classic kind of dish that mom would make when we were kids growing up or we want to go eat or whatever and so we did is we created a super heroes the sauce was kind of a classic name for a red tomato red sauce if you will you put on pasta and that's what that basically is\nYou have some interesting sides here one of them caught my fancy here smoked gouda Mac and cheese\nAgain another very popular item who doesn't like Mac and cheese and we do it a little bit differently is not your Velveeta kind of ... grew up and they're not even your white cheddar Newt has a very sharp\nFlavor of all kinds of cheese and so it's a mixture of blend of cheeses in there that we build and it is a great item and its aside item we don't really serve it as a compliment to any dish on the menu we serve it as a side I mean 'cause rarely to people not order and not want it as everybody shares it comes in almost a fourteen ounce bowl and they just put it on their place everyone can get\nWhat you were mentioning the popularity of your fried chicken that you've maintained and those you get a friday let special buttermilk fried chicken\nWe do we only do it at lunch on friday and I'll be honest with you a Seventy percent of the people don't lunch will eat fried chicken up what they might be or three times this week but the LA salmon or something else but when they're on friday they fried chicken and the fried chicken at lunch\nOr you know we service at lunch or different than we do in the dinner at night at night we serve it with a with a cheddar biscuit with several with honey you know we serve it uh with ... collard greens are and and the good of Mac and cheese and\nNow let's skip over your dinner menu events something's very southern here's one of your stars fried green tomatoes\nWe do again trying to play on the Americana early in the life that's edition was here six years ago when we built built there are opened the restaurant if you will or continued it uh that's another one that's a great item fried green tomatoes very few people do that in America anymore unless\nYou're in the old south uh you know south Mississippi that kind of thing and so you can turn over there if you want a it's been a very very popular dish as well as [noise]\nUh there's your spirits that you had this crab cake we talked about this ... this might be the tender line is also a great item today he said it's just a little cannot pay if he will toast a toast or a bad if you will this slice and toasted I'm\nRight here is where he has got to ... the onions on its gotta horseradish Kramer cramming down on the bottom of that toes and then it's gotten fans slice medium rare a beef to smoke a flaming young if you will on it and it's got a few blue cheese crumbles on the top of it\nAnd I know she has some black more special for different days a week or something I used to live with my mom made I see you have it on Sunday does your meatloaf\nThing we do Sunday Monday and Tuesday we do special blackboard specials we knew chef features every night of the week but on those days we for sure do these things Sunday as meat loaf we serve it with with um\nMashed potatoes and fresh green beans if you will but it has a very interesting item in as a tomato bacon jam over the top of it [noise] pardon me on Monday we do be stroganoff are really outside the box grandma kind of a dish if you will it isn't coming from a package is not a craft", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
