things can go too far it's one thing not to gratuitously insult somebody and it's another to have to walk on eggshells with with members of every other group putting your own\n\n... it's it it makes

no malice and that's the frightening malice then it ends of the issue if you think I mean malice than don't listen\nThan I should be I should be extra pay good from your wife and I don't mean identity anybody\n\nBut if there isn't malice intended but then then what is the ... ... what is the hyper sensitivity it's it just means I Can't talk to you naturally\n\nAnd that's what that's what the left because it's it always means of cause you see it's it's it's they got to be fighting some some new evil\nWhy they're micro aggressions because they acknowledge there's so little real racism in society they have to make it up\nOh you didn't mean it but you really are are you really are racist\n\nSo all it does is make it harder to talk men to women women to man well especially men to women 'cause

you were deemed mobile unforgivable is now been brought and\nAnd on a they're a great day and the greatest nation on God's green earth a great day despite the fact\nOf bombs nailed to new target\nI Joe Biden the former vice president or two bombs nailed for him at different addresses\nSo he doesn't have to feel left out anymore Joe Biden\nHillary Clinton Bill Clinton\nBronco mama Debbie Wasserman Schultz was her name was on the return address for these things\nAnd Maxine Waters also got to\nOr the FBI is pursuing a very vigorous investigation\nWhat's likely to come out of it or we will be speaking just moments from now with the Jim Fitzgerald who is one of the FBI supervisory special agents in a criminal profile or who helped to crack the Unabomber case\nWhich uh it won't take as long I don't think to crack this case will speak to specialize in Fitzgerald retired are coming up on the med vet show about that it's also a big day in the world of media uh I I Know that people often have an exaggerated idea\nOf what people immediate jobs make\nBut there is a figure in American media\nWho has a three year sixty nine million dollar contract that's that's\nAwfully good money making Kelly are gone fired dropped by her talent agencies CIA and by NBC\nUh it it\nIt ... of their NBC is saying well she may be just off not algae may collect all her money any way\nWhat is the conflict all about it's about oh about Fifteen seconds of TV Time what did she say does it deserve this response we will get to that and then a question about the caravan\nUh we we all hear from the left that President Trump is terrible and the caravan\nAnd yes now a Secretary Mattis is sending eight hundred troops to the border and the president's request to make sure that order is maintained and I know people are not just simply going to walk in from the caravan I that is of course the right position to take\nBut what's the Democratic position\nIs the position that literally anyone seeking asylum in the United states should be welcomed with open arms and should be allowed to come in if they are suffering there are a lot of suffering people in the world\nHow many do folks on the left actually wants to take here and then we have disagreement day of course a but first up I Am very very pleased because\nIt'd be it'd be so depressing the other way up President Trump is handling this bombing situation decently\nIs he handling it brilliantly in with unbelievable a plum and so much style and someone's firing no but it's it's it's better than adequate it's good it's fine\nI mentioned on the air yesterday it it might have been a nice thing and who knows maybe he did it just hasn't called attention to it\nTo call some of the people who have gotten these bomb packages send to them and say gee I feel bad we are going to try to track these people down and make sure you don't get any threats again they didn't call Joe Biden you can call Hillary Clinton you can\nCall ... rock Obama why not he's president the United states and uh he did get the tone I think\nPretty close to just right at\nThe beginning of his rally last night Wisconsin a lot of people are saying oh what's he going to say in Wisconsin in federal court fact people in the media are freaking out they say he's blaming the media for this whole thing he is not\nIs not they are distorting what the president said here is what he said the very beginning of his rally in Wisconsin of course all of this for the midterm elections which are coming up twelve days from today here's President Trump\nBegins unites rally by addressing the suspicious devices and packages that were mailed to current and former high ranking government officials my highest duty as you know as president is to keep America safe this movie's off\n[noise]\nThe federal government is conducting an aggressive investigation and we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly\n[noise] and he acts or threats of political violence art attack on our democracy\nIs so [noise] no they shouldn't just succeed that tolerance violence or the threat of violence as a method of political ... should go where's your or control we all know the\nSearch conduct street fiercely oppose and firmly prosecuted\nOkay this is entirely right what is the problem people have with this\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number a because it seems to me that the president got lost each year as they're from conservatives I haven't heard a single conservatives say well you know what\nPeople who got these bombs uh deserved it a ... no one is anyone stood up to try to defend the mad bomber whoever this person is\nI don't think so certainly no one on the right as anyone on the left stood up to defend him or her I think it's probably a guy a ...\nISIS ISIS defended [laughter] the bomber and by the way it's not an ISIS flag it has now been carefully analyzed it was the image was a parody of an ISIS flag that are invoked a Larry the cable guy\nGet her done\nBut that was the image which was a parody from an ISIS flag showing three scantily clad women in high heels okay I mean really\nReally [noise] [noise] okay it's the president went on in opening his rallies speech last night to say this we want\nAll sides\nTo come together in peace and harmony we can do and we can do [noise]\nMore broadly there's much we can do to bring our nation together for example those engaged in the political arena\nMust stop treating political opponents as being morally defective after\nCondemnation and destructive routine these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop no one should perilously compare\nPolitical opponents to historical villains which is done often\nSon all the time got us we should not\nIn public spaces or destroy public\nProperty [noise]\nOkay at by the way it is a he is completely correct I literally in the last twenty four hours there have been about a half dozen instances including very prominent one on CNN [noise] of a lot of\nPeople polling comparing President Trump to Hitler and\nKnow that is not appropriate and yes that is disgusting and it's inappropriate so the president is speaking well I I Know is reading from a teleprompter I Know it's prepared for him but that's what you want for goodness sake this is a time where he has to be careful of his language and he was\nBut then he added this and this was the controversial part of his rally speech last night and I think what he said was\nAbsolutely one hundred percent correct and highly defensible listen\nMedia also has a responsibility to\nA civil yet or stop the endless hostility and constant negative\nAnd oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nOkay why is it not possible for people oh say on\nCNN or MSNBC or on CBS or any ... any of them to acknowledge that the president is right about this but instead of that we heard this from John King on CNN in response to the presidents remarks\nNo one's planning depressing but he won't win and the president\nOf but the president that wants to make this about him I'm a man to the president for what he said yesterday\nLet's take a breath every body tone it down\nLet's just see where the fact that what the investigators do their job we can all be better\nIt's our fault why\nOkay she never said it was your fault the president's words where the media\nAll the responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks\nHe didn't say it was your fault he said that if we're going to be better as a country and that is one good thing that could have come out of it it's going to have to involve all sides and everybody and uh here was I'm Caitlin Collins on CNN ...\nYeah we we will get to that at at actually arguing with Jeffrey tube and a Jeffrey ... says the most in tempered things about president I Know he's a fan of the idea of impeachment and a removing President Trump from office but even Jeffrey too when I was defending him against\nA Republican was behind it because of course by default since all the devices are going to democratic either politicians a media sources or other people related to that I'm an actor with deniro that's the that's the message that being said that you know we don't like your way of thinking we don't like your brand of politics so of course\nWho's going to Senate Republicans but it could be Michael I false flag type situation where it's actually like set up to make it look like it's a bad guy on one side of the political aisle when actually get somebody on that same side who doesn't really want to hurt\nThe people who are getting these devices because quite frankly\nNone of them have detonated but that's a but they're getting their point across as look how bad this other side is so please vote for us in two weeks I Can't tell you Michael which one is that it is but I've worked cases in the past\nNot always bombs or sometimes just letters and and then saying certain things and other political uh um incidents in another elections where one side as there are people write to 'em\nYou know the opponent by pretending they're on his er or get to the opponent pretending they're on his side sort of a mini fall sly type situation and let me just throw in your Michael the last thing\nSince we had ... outside source forces or as in the Russians and some others a mess with the two thousand sixteen election or at least try to I Can't completely rule out any very simplistic and\nAlmost unsophisticated way that there is some parties such as that are involved in this whole thing just to throw a wrench in the works of our upcoming election and just confusing compound the people and Bob and cause a little bit of a man and quite\nFrankly I'm getting it makes America look bad and they I I and that's my aunt my wife was a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see\nBut her her idea is that this kind of thing and not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming it's a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having a very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this way by bombs that aren't even that well made it looks like a banana republic\nOr do you think it's likely that we will have a perfect or before the election I was twelve days from now [noise]\nLike I lost one word on you there but I think if you set a resolution and the next twelve days\nOr so I sent a perp a perpetrator\nOh yeah okay same thing um I think there's a very good possibility and I mean they there's a task force with at least a hundred people on it working this right now in multiple cities I Believe it's headquartered out of a New York my old division I worked there for seven years in the late eighties early nineties there's already a joint terrorism task force\nIn a in that in the New York division of NYPD FBI agents no doubt the secret service are on\nBoard out any of these ... these are people who are professional and they know what they're doing

with that none I consider myself a nationalist because what a nationalist means generally you can look at the experience of cinnamon for patriot\nAnd yes I think my country is the best in the world and I put my country above any other nation in the world I Do and you don't want what's amazing\nHere is you'll hear Caitlin Collins is twenty six years old she's a graduate of University of Alabama\nAnd and this may make the make you dealt with Crimson Tide hold on the national championship frankly because she's arguing with Jeffrey tube and the legal analyst for CNN and he also defends the term nationalist but it sounded like this\nI don't think he can just change the wording national and like that I just don't think that is how this works and I don't think I think we're laying if I didn't do that I think ... if you think you would think you are a nationalized then if that's what the definition of the word that you're using what'd you say your one\nProbably not you know I Would I mean I think you're an adult I you know I as someone who believes in in the United states and the important thing I said I'm not a national now that there was a national left out please come on I mean that term has not become like Hitler I saw\nThat is why it has not use the word national at the kind of a negative connotation it is not the nationalist a Teddy Roosevelt in the nineteenth right\nNow there are all very legitimate grounds to criticize Donald Trump for for his racism for his ignorance for his lying I just think this one is one where he has a legitimate argument\n... heart or public as well as we got about did we got a big another\nVery good I Will say the president said we're not supposed to use that word\nAnd so he was self is acknowledging goes all the controversies that part of the only way that without getting hurt everybody\nA beginning as a dog whistle when when did it become\nA negative word to call you yourself a nationalist by the way this um brilliant a Caitlin Collins I listen to a couple of times to either said it's not the same nationalism as Teddy Roosevelt and the Nineteen forties did she say or did you say Nineteen twenties\nOr Caitlin I hate to break the news to teddy died a Theodore Roosevelt died on January six Nineteen Nineteen and uh there there's another Roosevelt named Franklin he was present in the Nineteen forties at least part of them I

conspiracy theory that these things look like all the devices you'll see in a movie and yet none of them a function\nSo I'm Wondering if maybe a prime minister with deniro studios possibly put\nThese together\nWell ... again what's the purpose and it's ... ... here here's one of the reasons I find it easier to imagine there's some foreign agency putting us together or some simply sick and crazy person\nThan that there is a prompt mastered the studios trying to get a few Jollies or a or a democratic operative who is trying to make Republicans look that\nThe likelihood of this person being

dressed up as Diana Ross\nAnd pose and put out pictures of it and uh and and Diana Ross and of course has very um a light skin and so she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant afro wig and it looked awful and ugly and people were offended by it of course\nAnd a Megan ... took it upon herself in a conversation on air\nTo defend the idea of dressing up in blackface for Halloween a very very stupid point to make but here's what it sounded like\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person what's on or a black person a put-on white they\nLike that that that was okay as long as you were dressing up as a character if somebody feels like something is offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair game and if they're going to want to take it\nYou've got to be able to take it okay Allen broker of course veteran a weatherman on NBC or was one of the many many many people demanding that Megan Kelly apologize and er here here's what al rogue or had to say\nThe factors on for a while she apologized to the shows a bigger apology to folks color around the country because\nThis is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right where I Am old enough to live to Amos and Andy where you had white people and black that he's playing to black characters and it was just magnifying the worst ferrier talks about black people\nAnd that's what the big problems is\nOkay yeah it is a big problem and by the way Megan Kelly saying when I was a kid it was okay to dress in black face she's forty seven years old if she was a hundred and fifty years old maybe maybe\nIt was okay or or even if she was eight years old or Ninety but I've got to tell you I'm older than Megan Kelly I hate to admit it but I Am and uh when I was a little kid it was emphatically not okay if somebody had showed up\nAt our Halloween carnival in my elementary school in San Diego California\nUh wearing black face costume for Halloween\nI think they would have been asked to go home it\nIt has not been okay for a long time a long time\nAnd that's something\nThat Megan Kelly as a graduate of the University of Syracuse and Albany law\nSchool and somebody who's been a TV journalists for a long long time\nHonestly should've known her apology on air\nWas very carefully composed and it was meant to say for career obviously and it sounded like this\nThat want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] we may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it'd ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their faith later or a white person making their darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it and it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume it seemed okay\nWell I was wrong and I and [noise]\nOne of the great thing in his chair and\nGetting to a point of view\nTalk and sometimes I listen [noise]\nAnd yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface and an awful way by raising the country [noise] it is not okay for that should be part of any holiday Halloween otherwise [noise]\nI've never been a kind of person [noise]\nBut I Do understand the value in the sense that has\nTo our history the ticket early on race and ethnicity\nIt passed here has been so painful for many people of color\nBecause they failed so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and the fence I Believe is is it time for more understanding war love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to [noise]\nOr Iraq or well didn't work she suspended or now\nIt looks like uh\nShe uh she's not going to be on air on NBC and she's also dumped by CIA the talent agency major Hollywood talent agency that handles her\nSo she's done by both but she may be able to collect a what's left on her sixty nine million dollar contract so good luck with this I I Do feel there is something that\nFirst of all black faces disgusting and all you have to do is go back and look at some even some quality old movies\nI I'm One of the films that that comes to mind is a wonderful movie called holiday and with Bing Crosby and it it's a lovely film except it has a sequence in it with Bing Crosby in blackface singing the song Abraham\nAbout Lincoln's Birthday and pretending to be kind of an old slave and it's so cringe inducing its horribly embarrassing al ... and enormously popular\nA singer and just enormously popular and he of course was known for doing his shows in blackface do I believe that Bing Crosby and ... and were were horrible races I Believe that they basically shared some of the values of their time where\nIt's almost as if there was something funny something humorous about being black because it was so different and the whole minstrel show blackface history\nIs la mental and it it is an indication of how far we've come or do I think there's any defense for Megan Kelly making making the case that uh uh that wearing black face on Halloween is okay no there's no real defense for it\nBut is it perhaps an overreaction to see her entire career go up in flames because of this one stupid passing comment\nWell it's happened before or with other people I again I I think it is appropriate and good that we are more respectful and more careful\nI mean well there's a piece over at Fox that actually is pretty amusing if you don't get routes wrong with blackface here's why it's so offensive\nAnd today Desmond Harris writes put down the black and brown face paint step away from the bronze or twelve shades darker than your skin that is if you're at all interested in not being a walking symbol of racism is Halloween wait what's wrong with black face a lot of people\nHi Michael nice to talk to you great to talk to you [noise] um\nSo I originally called in to say why and voting for the first time in the midterm\nUh good out here and why\n[noise] well I think it's a way of expressing yourself all the eggs that people are saying feeling right now like these the important bomber\nOr these pipe bombs you know I think part of it is ... and yes he is probably here she is probably a a dysfunctional person I'm Sorry I'm getting off track [laughter] so I'm voting because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with that if you tend to to look and see what they're doing and be paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings are about the situation and my lot in life is to vote and vote in a local level and the state is the best way to do that\nNot good for you yeah it's one way or the other but they're\nNo good good for you are I can I ask are you voting for a Sharon Brown where are you voting for congressman or when I see\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform as listen to all the governor debates are that's far and I'll I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\nAnd that's interesting why um I agree with\nIssue one uh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debate say I feel like the viewpoints wind up\nUm\n... it's just that that that's kind of how I took away what I took away from it\nWell I knew it was fascinating is you know Ohio carry big time big league for President Trump he won Ohio by nine points\nAnd right now uh I Know the the governor's race as close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator who really should be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what this shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic about their voting\nBut I I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get involved\nIt's a good thing and it's the right thing and congratulations on that let's go quickly to David in Duluth or two for a okay we will go to David in Duluth, Georgia in just a moment are coming up I Want to go to this idea\nOf um [noise] this early voting and what it means and why it is that Republicans might be voting early much more than they have in years past and much more than the Democrats are doing this year\nWe'll get to that and more with your calls coming up on them and that ship [noise]\n\nNine five five seven genes jeopardy six Michael

I ... when you say can or can't you\nCan do whatever you want it is a free country but there are consequences and right now there is a very different sense about a white person dressing up as a black person by putting black makeup on then it would be the other\nAround here would be one little point of advice I don't think anybody would mind if you just left off the skin makeup\nRight if you wanted to dress up like a Bob Marley uh we had a caller who apparently dress up as Bob Marley or you want us to dress up as a Freddy Mercury Freddy Mercury was of\nPersian ancestry and yeah it's somewhat darker skin and okay so you want to mess up is from Freddie Mercury dress up as Freddie Mercury of the uh of queen\nBut don't put makeup on your skin because it is that the whole process of darkening your skin usually in a comical way because if you look at some of the classic black pays for farmers they don't look\nConvincingly black it's not like Jimmy Kimmel Robert Downey junior and recent

Illinois Brian you're on the map that shows disagree Monday\nAfternoon ... to ... to you a lot and you get away with a lot of slippery language and one of the while I'm calling about today is ... years spots for a Mac he made the point that seniors are getting what they paid for which is not true they're getting a lot more than they paid for\nThat's ... that's absolutely true and I don't have that average\nFor every dollar a senior puts it put into Medicare they're getting free dollars back\nOkay ... what I said I don't I don't believe that I have said that that seniors are just getting back what they paid for I Am saying that they are are listed in a program and part of a program to which they've contributed for many many years\nAnd they have but what you're saying oh by the way doesn't\nWork for all seniors it's not every senior who gets back more than he pays for but particularly seniors who are lower income so they paid in less than the Medicare system are getting a lot more back that's true so I'm not sure where our disagreement is here\nYou see no applied it only getting what you paid for but in reality I went on a on average on average at every with my right back a lot more than they paid in\nAnd on social wired and on Social Security as well which is one of the reasons and by the way do you know why they get back so much more\n[noise] because medical costs you\nKnow it's actually 'cause our life expectancy keeps going up than in other words Social Security used to pay for itself because the life expectancy was sixty seven sale and to provide Social Security payments for people\nFor an average of two years and uh now our life expectancy is almost Seventy seven\nSo it's very very different and much much more difficult to make the\nUh the numbers workout but your point is faring uh uh we we all do get more back from both Social Security and Medicare than we pay in but at least we pay in something and when people talk about Medicare for all they're talking about people getting payments who put in nothing\nNot anything at all let's go to a Steven boarding ten Pennsylvania you're on the ... that show\nUp or down in New Jersey Michael Oh okay great um I\nI'm a white male drug being average old Dawn Dawn dawn\nCzar ... am I raised the\nUm the boy that's an interesting conundrum I by the way I don't think the dressing up\nIn in the\nClothes are portraying somewhat of a different racial orientation or self orientation or anything is racist necessarily I'd be very careful the racist word\nI think it's stupid and it's also probably not a good idea\nLet's go quickly to Romney in Beverly Hills California Ronnie you're on the map that show\nBlack Americans\nAre laughing at you and corporate America for this type of a thing about the black trade but I mean like people are not upset about this the only people talking about this or individuals like yourself for example\nAh NBC it's simply using this black race thing to get out of a contract same thing like a professional basketball corporations using the N. word and things like that to get out of a contracting using dog a get out of a\nA multi million dollar contract with Michael Vick for example a black people are tired or the the\nWay way way way of a hold on hold on hold on for a moment\nDo you think that uh that that they put Michael Vick in prison only because they wanted to get out of a contract\nAbsolutely they were no evidence that I mean let's go back oh come on things that go back\nTo the point is that he uh he's even acknowledge that he was guilty of what he was charged with and he went to prison for I think almost two years maybe more than they were\nThere were there was no evidence there but I Want to argue with the F ... but it's like
