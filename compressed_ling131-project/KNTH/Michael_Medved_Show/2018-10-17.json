couple of hours we couldn't do it we couldn't do it because when you're in the room I get goofy you get goofy we have a lot of fun\nBut honestly the vice president he really did enjoy the set of the number of times\nHe said we've got to make this an annual thing a because he he actually enjoyed the the goofing is you know I I was worried about ...\n[laughter] I think he was taking care of the time why am I here yeah let's get to your book Donald drain the swamp by Eric ... is the illustrator\nHe not only is he the illustrator but I wrote it with him Tim rank when I or creative partners we've done a number of books together people look it up online some of the most beautiful illustrations you've ever seen or his books but when I\nReally was thinking about who do I vote he's the guy that convinced me to take Trump's seriously he said this guy is a folk hero he's an American folk hero and that's what gave me the idea to write the book\nDonald drained the swamp I said he's a larger than life figure I Need to write a kids' book or a or I mean this is the kids but but it's also humor book for adults in other words adults are going to find humor in this children's book\nThat kids aren't going to find I mean obviously there's a there's a little blue bird that tweets are there is a there's somebody you know the first swamp creature is the lobbyists or us I mean kids are not going to get that and uh and then there's another swamp creature that looks a heck of a lot\nLike a crying Chuck I don't know if\nYou've heard of crying truck but he's a senator for yeah sure yeah are there any of your orange\nAnd then there's the the the biggest bad a swamp creature of them all the Georgia saw us\nAnd you know adults will get that but kids I think I'm part of his book really is that I think we\nWho have supported this president we need to have some fun we need to celebrate\nAnd we need to have something a narrative that's a positive narrative about what's going on we don't need to be in the weeds every day with all the details and everything we need to just say something good is happening in America and by the way most people understand that we're being reconnected to our government were never supposed to have a big bloated\nBureaucracy we're supposed to be a free people who govern ourselves that's what this big his book is all about and I really think it's important that we remind ourselves of that and that we teach our kids what that is and so this is a fable about American style self government\nFeaturing a caveman name Donald and the swamp creatures and all that kind of stuff I mean I have to say it's sweet it's innocent it's not mean spirited so I Hope people will uh will will use it to teach their kids but also just for adults to have fun I think a lot of adults are going to give this to other adults I Hope\nConservative adults will give it to a to they're never Trump or friends you know just as a joke or something because it is not mean spirited meant\nFor us all to to laugh no it's a total for them it's called Donald Jr each drain the swamp it's probably the only book or at least be only one I Know it certainly\nA for a pug positive you president and it's just a in a very far away it's ... it's Donald Donald with caveman Bull Run as it is a series of Donald ... years going on I think\nThe next one is going to be Donald builds the wall or whether Congress gives them funding or not\nA you know that kind of thing but I'm I think there will be other books he lives in Michael Dell of my pillow we're creating pillows based on this book that's not a joke that's actually true we're creating a plush doll it's going to go it's getting crazy Dennis it's getting crazy but people once you buy your make America great hat\nYou know ... that's about it right and so I thought we need to have something just a fun thing or you know so we can celebrate what is happening and it's not it's not a bitter thing it's it's ... it's a bipartisan swamp if you're careful reader of the illustrations I Can't get too specific but it's a bipartisan swamp and you know it's it's meant to be happy and\nFun\nWhile it is absolutely I got a big kick out of the Donald Trump is wrong why what caused you to even come up with this idea well\nHonestly I\nI was mentioning Tim rag when he's he's my friend for Thirty years and he's the one that that really made me see that I that I was missing something with Trump he said this guy's a folk hero and Tim and I've written all these children's books together and after the election I thought you know what I Wonder holy cow I should write a book with him like a kids' book\nFor ... ... with Donald as a folk hero I didn't know what the idea was but it just kind of jumped into my head like ideas sometimes do and I knew immediately it was a good idea and I had to do it but I didn't know what it was going to be and I kept talking to him about it and he wasn't getting it and I saw\nThis doesn't make sense he's the guy that that made me understand\nWhen you when you know so far on the book the book is Donald drain the swamp\nThe dentist Springer show live from the relief factor\nSpringer show one just

it\nNot just in terms of manufacturing we are not just in terms of gross domestic product we are\nBut number one in competitive [noise]\nThe first time in a very very long time we will get to that story\nOr there's also a very good news just grow moments ago\nUh from the White House about fulfilling something that I had been pushing for for a while on this show\nAnd I'm very glad to see it it's a cold and across the board budget cuts spending cuts for every federal departments that President Trump is apparently planning to demand\nAnd as president he can demand it are starting tomorrow and that is appropriate meanwhile continued ramifications about this horrible murder\nIn Turkey and it appears pretty obvious that it was a murder\nIs Trump responsible that's what a lot of people on the left and in the media sometimes means the same thing are saying uh plus uh we we really do need to go to\nSome of the other media stories\nAbout media malfunctions including an attempt to us lime a great American just moments after he died or we will get to all of that on the ... show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nFirst off this very positive story\nOr and and again it's a story not based upon\nA conservative source it's based upon the world Economic Forum\nWhich every year does rating in terms of the most competitive countries in the world\nAnd the U.S had not been doing badly compared to most other countries in the world competitive\nBut we moved up very dramatically and we are now number one\nOf the story is it's covered in uh on line of the wall Street Journal\nOr is US's world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade the last time we were the world's most competitive economy was two thousand and eight\nTwo thousand and eight have in common with a two thousand sixteen Republican presidents\nAnd yes that does make a difference when you have a pro business\nBarge\nThe U.S is back on top of the most competitive economy in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand eight and an index produced by the world Economic Forum which said the country could still do better on social issues okay\nAmerican climbed the one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries with a top five rounded out by Singapore number to Germany number three Switzerland number four and Japan number five oh five countries scores rose from two thousand Seventeen with the U.S not seeing the second biggest gain\nAfter Japan's\nNow all of this is good news is good news for us that Germany is more competitive that Switzerland is more competitive particularly the Japan is more competitive\nThese are American allies and I know Swiss Switzerland supposed to be not aligned neutral it's effectively because of trade and economic matters it's an American ally it's tied into the west\nThe top spot hasn't gone to the U.S since the financial crisis of two thousand and they sold out put and triggered a global economic slowdown economic\nRecovery is well underway with the global economy protected to grow almost four percent and two thousand Eighteen in two thousand uh Nineteen said the report\nThat uh was published a last night\nBy the organization that produces the Davos conference on global politics and economics\nOkay you might say well what does this have to do with my life everything because a more competitive economy means more jobs that means higher wages and means more prosperity it means more freedom because frankly if you have more\nOptions in terms of the jobs you look for in the way that you are in your living and the way that you can\nInvest what ever dollars you can save if if you have more choices that is the equivalent to more freedom and then there's this uh President Trump\nActually just talked about this at a a White House meeting and a ... this is uh what what President Trump made because the media was just tell you now sent advance\nThat he was going to make a demand from his cabinet secretaries and here is what that demand sounded like just moments ago\nI'm going to ask each of you to come back with a five percent budget cuts\nFrom feel very as the bar friends whether it's a secretary of the British rated or whatever I Would ask everybody to come back with a five percent cut for the for the next leader I think it will be able to do it they may be a special\nExemption perhaps I don't know who that exemption would be if you can do more than five some of you will say hey I can be much more of a you know\nI've heard about the penny for Fifteen Years warned petty every year for a dollar one Betty every year after four or five years the countries in good shape I'm saying let's not do that by the way to listen to the five but it but I think you can do it\nSo I'd like to have everyone sitting around the table\nFor your incredible domains that you've presided over so ugly in some cases some cases very well some cases British Italy or I Would like you to come back with a a five percent\nOr get rid of the fact\nThat heard of the ways\nAnd I'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say what can the\nOkay this is terrific and this is one of the best moments for the president's so far in my opinion one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the only thing that I Would add\nYeah and I feel kind of emboldened to do this because this is something that we've talked about on this show was talking about a recently we've talked about a month ago it was necessary it was great the president is right on target\nThere's one thing you could add which is I'm going to set the example and I'm going to cut my White House budget I'm going to cut it right now\nAnd we're going to come back to you at the same time on all of you to come back and share them not cutting just five percent I'm cutting ten percent and by the way it is easy to cut the White House budget by ... percent\nThere too many ... people who work in the White House and they were stumbling over one another by the way one of the good things about Trump is he has an appointed people to fill all of those useless jobs at the White House wants a useless jobs\nYou have a whole offices with a director and then an associate director and then various secretaries for things like the office of White House the liaison to this disabled community now this is not the ... the disabled community\nBut there's no reason there are other government departments that deal with that health and Human Services has a huge commitment of that you don't need a special White House office there is a special White House office was damaged by President Clinton\nTo deal with the algae Beatty community why it's not necessary that doesn't mean that access should be divide the denied the algae Beatty people look there's a special White House office to deal with the Jewish community\nAnd I benefited from it because I'm during the Bush administration they wouldn't have a Hanukkah party and it was a lovely thing\nKeep up the Hanukkah party but you don't need a special White House liaison you don't need a special White House and Ponte you don't need somebody drawing a government salary\nThey can tough this back we have a deficit right now seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it went up Seventeen percent since last year if not because of the Republican tax cuts\nIf you actually look at this and you read some of the hysterical democratic articles\nThey make it clear ... revenues have not gone down sharply if anything they may have gone up very slightly they basically been stable what's gone up as been spending and yes it's true as Mitch McConnell\nMade the point yesterday that much of that spending about half of it is three big federal programs Mitch McConnell made a little bit of misstatement he said that the Seventy percent of the federal budget is Medicare Medicaid and Social Security it's not Seventy percent it's about fifty percent\nIf you add on an interest on the national debt and a bunch of other social programs then it gets up to Seventy percent but still the the point is that there is room for cutting the federal deficit we have highlighted some of the programs some of the stupid spending that has really crippled our country\nNow that does not include however\nSpending to get a new ambassador to Saudi Arabia this is something that President Trump could look into or do I believe that President Trump is to blame for the killing of ... of course not\nAnd this is a ridiculous ... liberal\nBasically incantation and if they say it or not they said enough it might be true and now it's not true do I think President Trump is doing a great job on Saudi Arabia and not so much but it's going to be okay it's going to be OK if he keeps in mind certain facts and priorities about our relationship\nYour entirely correct and and you're right in in terms of the games I play in Washington for instance um at when people talk about quote cutting Social Security they're talking about cutting the rate of increase\nTo know nobody ever and nor should people talk about cutting back what's already pledged in Social Security but it's considered a cut if you cut the rate of increase but you're entirely correct I think what President Trump has in mind here\nIs each of the federal departments is a lot of a set amount of money and let's say you have a a government bureau department is is a has a budget of a hundred billion dollars well that budget cut would mean you find five billion dollars to say\nBut you're you're right to bring this up to and thanks for the call let's go to I'm\nMark in Columbus ohio mark you're on the Michael ...\nThank you sir I really appreciate your ah your\nLight pirates in a region across the aisle you or your ah your regular view of America really appreciate\nThat thank you [noise] um yeah when you say a\nPresident Trump should lead by example he really are [noise] ah I mean once you said yourself [noise] ah he he's already left opposition it was open on field as a as\nA some people would say and and ... alone I think she she yeah I mean the numbers are incredible something like a a the previous administration had a hundred and twenty five\nAnd waiting of twenty five I was going to bring us point up the your ear entirely on the right track uh Michelle Obama had a staff of sixteen twenty four people depending on when and her eight years as first lady\nLonnie has a staff of nine but you don't want ... Milan you could make do with a staff of seven [laughter] what's your bank and ... and and seriously because this whole thing about getting first ladies big staff\nIs is relatively new and a ... and the point is you're right Trump is left a bunch of White House positions unfilled and good for him but I'm ... the\nWhole idea when people talking about turmoil in the White House there would be less turmoil if there were less people working there fewer people working there and I I I think that's very very clear I um\nI wrote a book about this a long time ago it was at the time that it came out which was a very long times forty years ago the time it came out last Saturday Night that time that shadow presidents came out it was the first comprehensive history of the White House staff up to that time\nAnd it's shocking a President Lincoln won the civil war\nWith the White House staff of two that tried to it was him and to assistance because he had a cabinet as well and I'm not saying that presidents should try to deal with the White House staff is too but he could probably make do with the White House staff of two hundred we'll be right back [noise]\nMichael ...

media or for instance I Can't believe it made the front page of the New York times and everything else we have going on and budget deficits and foreign policy crises and\nAnd the parent Lee there are increasing reports from Turkish sources that he died in a very gruesome and grizzly way and they say they have some tapes of him being tortured and mutilated while he was alive or before he got killed and it's quite a ... it's it's disgusting in fact\nBut the idea that this is somehow associated with Trump is ridiculous what President Trump has done since he's been president has been to encourage exactly the kind of change in Saudi Arabia that we have known that we've needed for a long time and you know who acknowledges is\nIt's a Tom Friedman doubled Pulitzer Prize winner in the New York times big liberal but he at least is honest enough\nTo recognize that ... all of a sudden saying oh we have to blow up our relationship with Saudi Arabia and who cares about their oil he's right the biggest thing isn't their oil the biggest thing is Saudi Arabia's role in reforming\nIslam because while harvest Islam which used to emanates from Saudi Arabia was precisely the kind of danger that led to the worst thing that's happened in most of our memories which has nine eleven and right now say what you want about him\nMohammed bin Salman NBS has been working to rein that in and to change it let me read you some of what Friedman rights today in the New York times\nHe says I defined our most important national interest in Saudi Arabia since nine eleven and it's not an oil is not arms sales is not standing up to Iran Islamic religious reform which when come only from Saudi Arabia the home of Islam holy cities make and Medina\nI Believe nine eleven was the worst thing to happen to America in my lifetime writes Tom Friedman\nWe'll spend thousands of lives in some two trillion trying to defuse the threat of Muslim extremist from ... to ISIS dollars that could have gone to many other needs in our society\nAnd I believe the roots of nine eleven came from too terrible bargains one was that bargain between the Saudi ruling family and the kingdom's religious establishment where each bless the other\nThe other was America's cynical bargain with the Saudis\nWhich went like this guy's just keep your oil pumps open your prices low and don't bother the Israelis too much and you can do whatever you want out back preach whatever hate you want in your mosque print whatever conspiracy theories you want in your papers and treat your women however you want\nAnd he says so what caught my eye most about Mohammed then Solomon and made me most hopeful was this tentative willingness to engage in a war of ideas with his religious hardliners declaring publicly do not right that we are re interpreting Islam we're restoring Islam to its origins\nMohammed bin Salman was the guy who saw to it that women can suddenly are allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia that's a a big ... big deal he um\nHe also has argued publicly that Islam and its origins was tolerant of others face and are empowering of women and open to new ideas\nAnd the whole idea that somehow whatever follows Mohammed bin Salman is going to be better\nI think it's foolish and yes there has to be a strong response and this has to be condemned and they're going to have to be people who are punished for this this was a gross crime but the idea that somehow you're going to create instability in Saudi Arabia the cost would be\nTerrible not only in terms of our foreign policy and our confrontation with Iran but in terms of this entire need that Friedman is right to point to which is the need to reform\nIslam's most destructive tendencies and let's go quickly to Jason in Honolulu you're on the Michael made that show hey Jason\nI think for taking the call I'm going to comment about the economics and and everything but I said sure on this topic now I just want to quickly said yesterday on your show\nA when you walk around the recording of the person that sector America no longer in the traditional stance of the leader of the free world you after that you somewhat agreed with that and\nI have to tell you I wholeheartedly agree with that statement I I Know Trump is taken lightly different than than maybe George W. Bush I understand that\nBut I like to share power and control and all of a every capital replicated very humorous and if you dropped the largest bombing ever in the history of mankind so I think he's actually taken a pretty good leadership role\nAnd okay I'm I'm not sure if that bomb achieved what it was meant to do and by the way it was the largest in terms of size not in terms of impact I mean the still the biggest bombs were dropped there's still those little teeny tiny atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that killed more than a hundred thousand people each\nWith more in

was asked about restoring civility in our politics of this is what the president said\nI really think the economy is going to bring people together because people are doing better now African American
