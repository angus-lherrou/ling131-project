neither [noise]\nMy friend's them as Prager here back to David in Mesa, Arizona you feel that the Saudi Arabia's much worse than he ran so I'm\nIn a nutshell 'cause we don't have a lot of time please react to my theory or my belief that Iran is much worse than Saudi Arabia because he ran is a far greater danger\nTo the west\nAnd to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledged the Saudi contribution to a fundamentalist awful madrassas around the world so on what grounds that you think otherwise\nThe group that nine eleven was from Saudi Arabia the um the money they want to I\nWant her to come from Saudi Arabia to\nYeah okay I don't know I don't know what rumors of ... that would have been Saudi Arabia was not prices\nAre now that we're not what they were going to get Iran Syria\nYeah and you are not all of that comes from a are you not know that none of them I'm not a lot of weapons that were given a job to do it that way or that that Saudi Arabia\nAs being heavily covered on CNN\nAnd everywhere and mainstream media President Trump's approval rating is the highest it's ever been okay don't get too excited is forty seven percent but forty seven percent\nTo forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval an approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise] uh and uh then on Thursday\nI'll be home God willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's races and Senate races and more\nBut right now it's all so tight your vote really really matters\nOne of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had to change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle in Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and I'm\nIn the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair and uh they showed in the new numbers about from soaring approval rating\nAnd are asking why\nAnd he had no idea he couldn't answer it\nAnd the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um can most Americans like the economic situation we're in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job a meanwhile\nWith an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there is a new book is being jets that it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening and uh\n[noise] there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana we did um a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a um a guy who said look I'm just a normal I'm middle aged\nA stay at home dad\nWho almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction and this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana is going to be\nJoining us on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions and to take your comments that all coming up on the Michael ... a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise] honestly part of it as the Kavanaugh\nSituation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should simply open the gate and and let in all the people from the caravan ... even those of us\nWho support him immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants and I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that uh you get seven thousand people together and they are marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let them in because they're having a tough time in Honduras but there are a lot of suffering\nPeople right\nThe notion that that uh that that somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea you don't simply a let people into the United states without\nAuthorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nMeanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything but I don't really think he has a position on the caravan because how could he is a battle or work\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy who once called lie in bed and people say oh for Trump such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George ... a age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty\n[noise] attacked him pretty harshly he said the Reagan was practicing rude to economics\nAnd then later we embrace that Bhutto economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president and uh they honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what is going on that the election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song over\nThe great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as bait toe the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nI pass them God\nGuy is totally [noise]\n\nMost men who\nWho may do burn by turning practice and\n\nDown and then now and then\nShe feels [noise] mean\nMen oh you bet\nTo fill that little little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs are in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one get on the Trump train 'em in any event the better our work and the the ... to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about Beto O'Rourke ...\nWhat it is that the jurors the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator and\nHe's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the weight knows so much more about the issues than ... ... what is it the better our work is going to do for the country that inspires\nReactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just to Canada eight he's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that are more than a in a modern Ken very literate show off everywhere with on for every one you can be without an interruption in from the ... factor was I Love your thinking well you know [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay um [noise] or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number of President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about uh the Democrats offering mom's not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a a a very alarming piece of the New York times with at least is meant to be alarming I didn't think it sounded so bad\nIt's by David Leonhardt and it's what if the Republicans when everything the fact that\nThe New York times even thinking about that that shows you which side has momentum at the moment we will be right back on the Michael med show with your calls [noise]\nMichael you rock Michael but\nWhen he delivers employed by ... Michael\n[laughter]\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe\nPerforming and it is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town hall in\nOr near El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise] and uh\nShe she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively that it leads me to believe that you\nKnow he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he ruled out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some and then it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he\nWas asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it he is for impeachment he he believes even before the mall or investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish it needs to fish but better or doesn't think so\nHe agrees with a lot of those people on the far right that definitely just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the time hey I appreciate your call um I I'm a I Will get back\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of\nFlummoxed some of his age or there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that soon and very soon\nA and he says it's people are going to love it it's going to be a big middle tax a flat tax cuts middle class tax cuts\nAnd a and then there's this whole matter of a transgendered support by government [noise] is this a political ploy ... substantive and we'll get to that and more with your calls coming up on the man that show\nMy below was now offer your specialty you buy one get one free go to Mike below doggone usually promo goad Medvedev [noise]\n\nIt's two thirty in the um since Seventy the answer will try to be in one minute and you just move right now for the news I knew we in\nWashington thousands of Central American migrants hoping to reach us or decided whether to rest in far southern Mexico or resume their trek to the United states President Trump made while reading more threats on their governments\nThe president tweeting that he's considering cutting off her substantially reducing aid to three Central American countries for the Caribbean Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nHe says they were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and tried to come in legally end of the U.

with you about the uh the journalist where we are there's more to that and we really it's a lot of our country not anywhere you are called to talk about the uh the planned invasion\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir I\nLoved it you know given the fact that we've had so far this year\nI think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd ah this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system is basically an attempt to raise the border and say that uh we have to let in anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that a lot of them\nSay that so [noise] but when you say ... and a planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUh I think it's just a part of the the war the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen\n... and of course they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing some of these\nPoor people who I think are hungry or scared I'm hopeful\nAh they they do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country and that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent\nOther incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month is not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras is to\nCoordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now\n[noise] and to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to\nBe the only kind of answer that has a long term

killed I I feel that that really not our crime it lots of guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it\nI'm sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country insolvent\nBecause we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we ah we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia\nNow of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world but it's a country that we have a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal\nAnd if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from a China or Russia\nAnd I mean why does that have to do what does have to deal with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince of Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he he obviously president from his never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte and one of the worst moments of his life\nLosing his temper and slam

I'm maybe I'm seeing fake videos but these people seem coordinated they seem 'em purposeful and they seem they seem somewhat happy and I'm not getting that and\nAnd I don't know I think I think what

you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it\nSo a long time how do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm Silber I can look back on some of the uh who might be have years when I was high and and realize that uh that pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having\nA public knelt down even temper tantrums even uh getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also\nWasn't sleeping normally I I was I was ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time\nThinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about the consumers with\nAbout trips I could take that would revolver on marijuana and you know it's just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while right\nNow I've been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I've read I published a capital is ten bucks I had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for\nYeah pretty much every English language publication it except for the New Yorker you know it it's not like I I was a um an on ambitious donor or failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow

I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump did something that provoked a usually negative response on CNN what's striking about this is not the light it

these reporters on air uh are sounding completely don't poet genetically partisan I'm Talking about John Berman\nAnd um and I'll Alison ... and that John Avalon on uh CNN\nListen to how they react\nRemember it was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became illegal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to a trans right concern so I'd love to lock the issue of identity gender identity civilized by Facebook dozens of gender options\nI won't some liberals are bracing bird of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect Republicans want to benefit from this backlash and it's an easy talk just look at the numbers\nTransgender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults work was ... million people\nThat do a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than the millions of gay and lesbian Americans for most people now know was friends family your co workers\nThis just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values\nRooted in freedom and equality not President Trump has also been playing up the caravan of asylum seekers from Central America pushing it as a threat at rallies employees with plenty of application from conservative media this is just more\nPlay the bass panic rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the border\nOkay there let's say they don't rush the border\nWhat are they coming here to do they're they're coming here in Moscow to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum\nAnd basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a basically the core of our sovereignty gets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the country and people are free to leave\nBut this is this is bizarre dishes um we have a can we go to this last uh ... uh we don't have time okay ah I ah I Know we will be speaking about this later frankly\nWhat President Trump is doing is not taking away anyone's rights what he's doing is taking away a federal government position I actually believe that the federal government's position on transgender ism I should be neutral and in other words don't persecuted people were transgendered but don't\nFall of a sudden presumptive leave claims that someone is a woman

couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you got mayor's races you've got sheriff's racist or the sheriff's rate in Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the elections basically been certified or the super the judge has ruled that well we have to

state every election\n[noise] I I Would um because I think it really gets down to the below in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida\nI've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is to let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter\nBut because of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities\nThat I think are actively exploited by bad actors so I mean the the Texas Democrat mailing the the voter registration forms is one example but you know you got groups like acorn and ... and their whole job is to go out and Raul stop as many voters as possible regardless\nOf those voters right you've got voted I I Know one ... one of the same way one of the things you're\nOne of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea of it if you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live\nAnd then you vote twice the national legal but that happens a lot doesn't\nAbsolutely I mean there's nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme
