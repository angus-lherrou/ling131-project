by police thank God for the police and thank God for the police in Pittsburgh and thank God for the work of law enforcement in diffusing those bombs and apprehending the evil bomber and yes he is evil he's not just pathetic\nHe's evil and it's possible to be both of course everybody wonders about what are the political implications of all this I Want to go a little bit deeper than that but we'll get to that too\nAnd I want to talk about what this means about America are weak coming apart\nAre we experiencing a total social breakdown something utterly unprecedented and and this is just the worst thing in the world\nNo we're fine we're fine\nOne of the most beautiful things I ever heard I really mean it was the announcement on all the media\nAnd it was based upon a statement by the Anti Defamation league which monitors anti Semitism an anti Semitic incidents they reported that the horrible attack on Pittsburgh and yes it was horrible and was nightmarish was pure evil\nThat that attack was the deadliest single attack against American Jews in the nearly four hundred years that we've lived in North America\nThink about what that means what an indication of how blessed we are how unbelievably\nFortunate we are with this great country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise]\nUm [noise] let me\nLet me give you a little bit of personal perspective and I don't usually do this but this is very personal I'm not from Pittsburgh I'm from Philadelphia originally\nBut of course we have friends in Pittsburgh I have war shipped at a congregations not at the tree of life synagogue buddy congregations in squirrel hill Pennsylvania we have squirrels of squirrels we we have friends in squirrel hill I'm sure squirrels too and in addition to the humans\nBut um [noise]\n... the the attack is devastating in this horrible and it's nightmarish\nBut uh I think perspective is a hundred percent necessary and what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a White House press briefing I think this could be her best press briefing today as she made a very important point\nIs when news of this attack came out the very first thing President Trump did was to condemn\nAnti Semitism extremism hatred bigotry that kind of sickness that led to this attack and the very first thing that\nMany voices in the news media did she said the media in general but if you can't generalize many voices very first thing they did was to blame Trump and to blame his rhetoric\nAnd I think that stinks\nAnd I think the attempt by some radicals and they are radicals in Pittsburgh to hijack this tragedy saying that the president in the first lady won't be welcome in Pittsburgh\nBecause of their past rhetoric let me make something clear I guarantee you those people who have signed that position they're sixteen thousand of them\nDo not speak for Pittsburgh and they emphatically do not speak for the Jewish people in the United states\nI um I found out about this\nOn Saturday morning after I walked to synagogue and and what I usually do and I mentioned this before\nUh our son and daughter in law and a almost two year old granddaughter live not far from our synagogue um I live further away so I walked to the close to three miles and then I stop in um with Danny in and were shell and\nJulia and maybe for a cup of tea but just to catch up on the week and to actually see this adorable little girl and this week uh Danny walked with me from his home in the two of us walk together\nTo synagogue and which is just literally his his houses clubs and\nWhen we got there uh it was something strange\nBecause there was a guy we know a dear friend actually Christian guy\nWho is a former marine officer a marine aviator I Know you're never a former marine you're always a marine and and Charlie's a marine\nHe's also a world famous honest uh opera singer and an aunt or a instructor and NRA last life member and he was standing at the back of our synagogue again he's Christian he's not Jewish\nAnd I came up and bring them hey Charlie what's going on a great to see you and I said you haven't heard I said no what happened he said there were a lot of people killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh and I just wanted to come out here\nTo help protect my friends and\nIt was so overwhelmingly beautiful and it's such a demonstration of America\nThat this marine from Nebraska\nWould see fit now as it turns out we also have an armed security guard we also have at least five members of our congregation um and it's religiously because we have a ... enclosure in a row of around ... ... ... they're packing\nOn there and they're also guys who are like members of the n._r._a. and they're ready so we\nNow I'm not suggesting that every congregation that countries should do this but this was part of our factor and then part of what happened\nWas that um\nWhen when Danny heard the news he said well maybe I ought to go back home and tell where shall not to bring Julia because you know coming to a two year old and if you're expecting some World War three it said come on we'll we'll be fine we're fine\nAnd he said sure and and the baby came and she had a great time she played was a big girls in sort of\nBehind the services and then we had our um our our kid is like our social after the services and everything was fine now there was there was\nOf course there are special prayers and a mention of what had happened in Pittsburgh we didn't yet know the identity of the killer and this is part of of what is so horrible about this is that um\nThat this occurred on on on the Sabbath and it's ironic those we listen to a lot of this show I ended the show on friday\nBy talking about the importance of the Sabbath and how much I was looking forward to the Sabbath and and the value of actually turning off\nA media for one day a week and\nIt's because of turning off those media that I only found out when I actually arrived in synagogue what had happened\nBut you know ... everybody who's Jewish pays attention to this stuff and you have in the\nBack of your mind what's going to be necessary I I Know that that um\nTo go if you ever go to synagogue in Mexico and I've gone to services in Mexico city and Los ... which is a a neighborhood central Jewish community in Mexico city they're they have really heavily armed security guards and metal detectors and\nWow but that's that's basically the Mexico such an unsafe\nWell it's not nearly as bad as Honduras in Guatemala and Salvador and we'll be talking about the caravan in a moment to but I'm ... it is simply wrong well here's what Howard\nFind men said Howard find men for years of Newsweek he was commenting on MSNBC\nAnd uh this is what he said uh because I think it's it's just\nDead wrong and we need to answer answer it back here is fine\nAs much as the Jews known there and do their own history this is not a Jewish story this was an American story but says in America story about the fraying of our social fabric and the rise of violence as a way of expressing yourself in this country\nThat we haven't seen the likes of in modern times if ever we've had a civil wars we've had strife\nBut we've never had this kind of individual violence against groups based on hate the way we're seeing the bubble up now ah and that's my concern and that should be all of our concerns on this morning\nOkay that's ridiculous it is ridiculous the first\nIn modern times and still in some ways most horrifying\nKilling at a place of religious sanctity was the four little\nGirls who were killed in Birmingham and in the Obama administration of course we have this horrible horrible Charleston episodes and then before countless Ryan stance riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma city killed about three hundred African American people\nLeft ten thousand African Americans homeless destroyed thirty five square of life that was Nineteen Twenty one\nI have no idea what Mr find minutes talking about\nWe're oh hey this is not the edge of destruction or the eve of destruction you disagree can give me a call will listen to Sarah Sanders at her press briefing coming up on them adventure [noise]\nOkay\nIf you see that kind of thing and you should be monitoring this kind of post that was a couple of hours before he went in\nA you notify the authorities because it is clearly a threat and um they're interchange\nAlso included this he says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWinter thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump expressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who may now the court Donald Trump\nOr they allow hate the view that certain groups and certain people\nOkay they allow hate to be viewed as certain groups in certain people that that ... he's he's correct there shouldn't be that kind of hatred toward anyone and by the way one of the names and has to be mentioned in this context as Farrah Khan\nWho recently compared a Jews to termites in infestation of past\nAnd um look at a Farrakhan for years and years and years has been spewing this anti Semitic garbage and yet he is honored by people on the left he was recently seated at a place him on our two seats away from Bill Clinton former president at a reserve Franklin's funeral\nAnd Farrakhan just like this guy Robert Ballard should be stricken from polite comical in conversation\nBecause of course ... to to talk about\nCriticism of one group or another group that is free speech but when you go into Nazi tropes and you talked about genocidal conspiracies\nIt's dangerous\nAnd they're on to be some kind of notification or some kind of concern one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\n[noise] the ah the petition\nBy a group called bending the arc bending the arc I had to look it up I'd never

President Trump\nShould and visit Pittsburgh I Believe he's visiting tomorrow with the first lady and I think that's a good thing\nThe um uh the letter that was signed by these sixteen thousand people

um\nYou know this point this way there's fear about finger you know whether a deplorable or whether it's you know a enemies of the people in the press it's just not helpful and it took ... found down\nOn people and frankly among among the press says well\nOkay I I mean he's entirely right the one thing that I Would be careful of Mr Weiss respectfully don't compare Louis Farrakhan that Donald Trump\nI mean Louis Farrakhan isn't open unapologetic lifelong anti Semite he is I mean he he he clearly if he doesn't even apologize for it anymore\nAnd uh he he is identified I don't know anyone who can plausibly say that Louis Farrakhan is not a hater of Jewish people\nAnd Donald Trump is so free of that charge you can charge Trump with lots and lots of stuff but I I tweeted about this it is unequivocal that Donald Trump cares deeply about the state of Israel\nAnd as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today he adores his Jewish grandchildren\nAnd the idea that the Donald Trump is quote dog whistling or is is some kind of deep anti Semite or that he's responsible for encouraging things like this synagogue attack by as ... said a guy who said he hated from\nAnd that's a ... and it's it's the worst kind of political smear and it's totally unfair\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number here was the opening statement at the White House press briefing uh uh just about an hour ago from Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nOur nation mourns the loss of these extraordinary Americans and we also pray for those who the wind is our hearts are with the four brave police officers who were shot and injured while trying to stop the attack we thank God for these officers and for every member of law enforcement who responded swiftly and bravely\nIn the wake of the attack we've witnessed Americans of every faith in tradition coming together to mourn with their fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America's Jewish community\nThe president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country hit doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family the president is the grandfather of several Jewish grandchildren\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent of Holocaust survivors\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express their support of the American people and grieve Pittsburgh community\nOkay and that is the right thing to do by the way some props to the NFL or the Pittsburgh Steelers went on with their game and that was the right thing to do and yeah there was some religious Jewish people in the crowd USA Today wrote about them\nAnd there was a sign that I think called the uh the attention of many people which is hatred can't break\nA city of steel\nAnd by the way the Steelers one uh but they were playing sorry Hugh Hewitt the Cleveland Browns so that wasn't a shock of John ah Jonathan Karl ah posed a question to Sarah Sanders about the the president's a legit responsibility on this hard\nWas it over the weekend that he could totally off his rubber what we're seeing by that you have any concern that all his words\nFor people to hold\nCertainly ah the president wants in moments where our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days of find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences she'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFound those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\nOK and again I it is hard for me to imagine that Sarah could have handled\nThese these questions more effectively than she did Jonathan Karl kept a going at this and about President Trump's blaming the media which by the way yeah do I believe he should pull back on that of course it's tired it's stupid stop it\nUh but Jonathan Karl put the question of Sarah\nWhy is the author you say you would be why is the author very very first\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack soaked in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous [laughter]\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction to so many people in this country the I'm not finished the only person responsible for carrying out either these heinous acts were the individuals who carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders\nFault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime was\nFor the media the first one was the one place to blame here\nThe president would not placing blame the president's not it's not responsible for these acts\nAgain the very first action that the president did was can down\nAh these heinous acts the very first thing that the media did was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration\nThe major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the crown withhold that responsibility\nOkay and ... and again particularly regarding the synagogue in in Pittsburgh when you talk about trying to divide the country the handful of people from a radical leftist group who are trying to prevent the president's first lady from coming to Pittsburgh\nShould um straighten up and fly right I I mean he's the president of the United states and\nHe's doing the right thing by going there and by the way I'm In his comments are never ideal but it's obvious that is hard\nProbably should have been monitored before but tell one of the things that is striking about ... ah saves are say opt junior\nIs he's a phony Indian he claims to be\nA seminal that's on all of the those posters and signs that are on

throughout the history of this country we've always had\nVigorous debate and then we settle those debates in the ballot box we don't settle them through extra threats of violence like the pipe bombs that we saw sent to the Obamas the Clintons to CNN and others\nAnd and we have no tolerance for the kind of anti Semitic violence that reared its ugly head today are the type of this for the kind of rhetoric\nThat you and the presidents have used do in the president just this morning referred to congresswoman as wacko he's called people low IQ he's called people horse face a from athletes to the prime minister of Canada\nI guess the question here is have you ever asked him to please not news that type of language when referring to other people for the in the case of civil discourse in this country\nEveryone has their own style and frankly people on both sides of the aisle use ...\nOn language about our political differences but I just don't think you can connect it to threats are acts of violence on I don't think the American people connect to the American people believe that those who are responsible or are the people that actually conduct these threats\nOkay that's exactly right and the one reason I'm basically that that I Would hope that the president would not use phrases like horse face or low IQ or\nA ... the basically the Rodney Dangerfield kind of a presidency because I don't think it's politically working anymore if it ever did once when he was running and Seventeen other Republicans and he could just appeal to his base\nRight now between now and election day it's a question of mobilizing the base it's already mobilized it's a question of enlarging the base\nAnd getting some of the people who may be hesitant about that kind of approach and especially at a time of national tragedy and this is raising the tone of discourse a little bit\nI think it would serve the president and the Republican Party and the country very well\nLet's go to to your calls to Frank in Burlington New Jersey Frank you're on the man that show\nI'm I'm an evangelical Christian and I I absolutely believe the Bible tells us that the Jews are God's chosen people and um it just seems like the most evil people in the history of had this proclivity to hate the Jews and I see it today and I really think it\nIt's more than surface hate I really almost think it's like almost I don't want to say Satan inspired but it's um it's it's more than normal hate and I really think it shows\nA real disappear disregard for God I really believe that\nWell again and and I am and I appreciate your uh your your call and your sentiments Frank and of course that relates to genesis twelve three where Abraham is promise of than those who blesses descendants will be blessed and those who curses descendants will be curse\nOr the the point about all this\nIs a is it there the Bible even tells us a with a story of ... which is actually written about by a a ... we just played a clip with him before\nWhere there is something a deeply Neal listing against God and against all logic\nIn the idea from anyone that he is doing a virtuous act to birch burst into a synagogue before the beginnings of Santa prayers\nAnd murder a bunch of ... actually mostly elderly people um who were good and decent and hard working Americans um let us go to a a to fill in Minneapolis Phil you're on the Michael ...\nMichael I think the one of one of the biggest problems is that we are so cheap and racism and anti Semitism anytime you disagree with somebody you're either racist or anti Semitic and when we right up against people who are truly hate till it gets lost in the shop it just gets it just becomes well\nI I think you're entirely correct and it's an extraordinarily important point it's the old story of crying wolf\nAnd it's why comparisons with Hitler or so mistaken and if everything is racist then it becomes nothing is racist you it means that you can't recognize an sanction the real thing when it happens appreciate your calling agree with you Dan in Columbus ohio you're on the Michael ...\nMichael I'm I was on and talk about what you and the Jamie already talked about all this regard that but I've been thinking a lot about it and uh [noise] I think that people like me like you know white guys that\nAre especially from the mid west in fact I was ... for it I don't think we should uh think we should have and you know they were responsible for it but we should come out um\nOkay I I don't think there's there's any question um ... the coming out in condemning it as the president has done as I think everyone in the country has done is appropriate um the ah Britain Hume sent out a a strong tweet\nHe said one of Trump's main failings is that he thinks everything is about him one of his critics main failings as they do to their reaction to the hideous events of last week makes this clearer than ever have to put it in perspective a professor Paul kangaroo our\nLives near Pittsburgh and his Daughter Survive this shooting they'll tell us that amazing story coming right up\nMy fellow was no offers visual you buy one get one free to do my pillow dogs all\nWere able to drive a little bit out of harm's way I Do you know one amazes me about this poll is that is it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target in the United states\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years\nAnd book blessed simply there aren't that many of them and yes but most of the people who died in those attacks\nWere a Christian people who are caught in the crossfire\nOr or even the cross fire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a a a beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen he was killed by an anti Semite was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there\nAnd the grandson was killed two for us singing audition they were doing a program that the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire also to Michael I immediately thought of it because at first we didn't know who is doing the shooting right and so I thought okay what's that date\nOctober twenty seven twenty eight in the day before on friday and my Middle East politics class at grow City College we just finished teaching the Yom Kippur war of Nineteen Seventy three\nWhich it ended I think almost forty five years ago that day on Saturday So I I immediately thought to myself I Wonder if this is a a radical she hottest attack no fortunately it wasn't\nHad not had nothing to do with that but this this was just some loan wacko ... a Nazi apparently a who and I and and the worst thing about something like this is\nI don't know what you could even do to stop it other than better surveillance possibly I don't know who would do the survey and like I Would say this people listening if you know somebody on Facebook or in social media who's posting vile hateful things like this and it was bragging about his weapons collection\nAnd and who's talking about maybe going down to the to the whatever synagogue to to beat up some juice it can get on the phone just call the
