another source of political unity for the United states which is a a complete contempt I mean total content\nThat is shared by Americans are black and white and Latino and Asian and rich and poor and living in the interior live on the coasts everybody shares condemned for political correctness\nThis is something that is stunning and there is a new study that are ... over at Harvard has written about yes Harvard we'll we'll get to that in just a moment\nAnd uh there's something else that ah I I think should unite Americans but maybe doesn't yet which is a fear\nOf another impeachment crisis I mean Democrats are being more and more serious and more and more credible saying if we win the house of representatives let alone the Senate\nWe're going forward with impeaching Brett Kavanaugh we're going forward with impeaching President Trump\nIs that a good idea will talk to one of the people who was central\nTo the last impeachment crisis we had his name as a judge Ken Starr he uh was in charge of the investigation that led to the impeachment\nOf Bill Clinton\nWhat are the lessons for today's political world and one of the lessons for Robert Mueller who's playing the same kind of jobs that are that the Ken Starr function in back in the Nineteen nineties one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOn this issue of political correctness first and and there's this amazing piece in ah the Atlantic of all places in the Atlantic is not a conservative journal headline American strongly dislike\nDislike PC culture and this is stunning\nIn the way that it shows that hatred for contempt for resistance to political correctness brings together everybody\nHe um\n... what what they write about is this is if you look at what Americans have to say on issues such as immigration the extent of white privilege\nAnd the prevalence of sexual harassment there distinct clusters that emerge\nProgressive activists traditional liberals passive liberal politically disengaged moderates et cetera et cetera okay one of the things is fascinating here is people who are traditional conservatives\nFar outnumber those who say they're progressive activists by twenty five percent or conservative eight percent or progressive activists by contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute and exhausted majority\nTheir members share a sense of the tea with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints and a lack of voice in the national conversation\nI think that's exactly right and you can count me uh yeah I I mean I I Would\nProbably be grouped together with a twenty five percent who are devoted conservatives they say traditional conservatives\nBut they're certainly elements sometimes you feel like part of an exhausted majority\nAnd then they go on tour right they say most members of this exhausted majority remember that's eighty percent of the public\nAnd then some dislike political correctness\nAmong the general population full eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it including Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine and of those under twenty four Seventy nine percent that means the people\nWho most resent political correctness who think it's a problem in our country or the people are having a shoved down their throats it's not working\n\nAnd why is this why is this resentments so common and by the way\nWho what racial group resents political correctness most remembers eighty percent of everybody you think why people you are on the\nUh racial group that most resents political correctness as American Indians\nAre second or Hispanics Hispanics have political correctness and Asians\nThey hurried I'm political correctness or even more than white people do black\nPeople Seventy five percent resent political correctness think it's a problem in the country and this piece in the Atlantic quotes a forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who participated in a focus group is part of this project and it's interesting project\nBut uh\nThis American indian again forty years old said it seems like every day you wake up something has changed you said Jew or Jewish is it a black guy or African American you have to be on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense it's scary\nThree quarters of African Americans opposed political correctness this means that they're only four\nPercentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe that political correctness is a problem okay uniting blacks and whites and young and old can we say no to political correctness\nAnd that goes for political correctness even in San Francisco\nOh this is an amazing story about someone named Steve on don't say Steven his name is Steve on S. T. V. O. N.\nE. as the new president\nOf the San Francisco Unified School district and they've had a long standing tradition for the San Francisco Unified School district\nA tradition of I'm beginning each public meeting saying the pledge of allegiance well no more instead\nThe first meeting that Steve on cook presided over as president San Francisco invite school district sounded like this\nThank you tonight we start this meeting in honor of the claim American writer and activist Maya Angelou who once said when you learn teach when you get give [noise]\nSection ... is accessibility to information for public section B. opening items approval of four minutes for September twenty fifth ... motion the second please Selma, Oregon ...\nOkay and then they go forward into the meeting or no pledge of allegiance and instead a a phony quote why do I say it's a funny quote the Washington Post ... actually looked at this\nUm this quote that as allegedly from Maya Angelou the only source for believing that she ever said it\nWas that Oprah Winfrey a set at that Maya Angelou said it\nBut there's no record that she ever wrote that are set it or anything like that and by the way what does it mean\nWhen you learn teach when you get give 'em a I'm\nI'm not sure what that means okay here's the story of Steve on cook he's a young man he grew up in public housing he did very well in school he went to Williams College very exclusive high ranking liberal arts college in Massachusetts\nAnd um then he came back to San Francisco he's involved in a number of social initiatives and gum self elected school board is now the school board\nPresident but he said the um\nThe move dropping the pledge of allegiance and instead of calling Maya Angelou was not a\nDemonstration in the vein of Colin Kaepernick another San Francisco bureau in close or he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nHe told the San Francisco ... chronicles of the current current political climate was disappointing and the Trump Administration has quote been attacking our liberties\nOkay you can\nEven say all kinds of things about the Trump Administration where it's been the Trump Administration been attacking liberties\nI hadn't heard that before what what liberties exactly is the Trump Administration attacked one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then he said I don't spend much time thinking about President Trump yeah I think that's probably true\nHe says although there is a requirement that schools conduct a pledge or similar activity there is no such requirement for school boards that was a statement from the district spokeswoman whose name is Lauren doesn't make\nA no one in the audience of beer to mind cooks\nNew introduction well of course not at San Francisco and now they are planning on having other quotes from other worthy or to begin in a place of the pledge of allegiance those will include Harvey Milk James Baldwin Toni Morrison the Wright brothers Abraham Lincoln and more\nUm so what's wrong with this\nWell he actually dissented from the majority opinion he said nearly a century ago Marilyn citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task of uh renting a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majorities has their effort violates the constitution the soldiers fought to defend I respectfully think otherwise\nIt is outrageous\nAnd one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument in Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd if this decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people from that community who died in World War one\nBy creating a monument in their honor\nAnd putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now is this court decision stands the monument would have to be removed destroyed or defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous\nAnd it's why the judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much Michael we're taking my call I have a couple of points uh you know on this issue that you brought up first of

interviews with her at the White House\nShe stood in such complete contrast in terms of relational skills and the like with her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is immensely\nCharming and charismatic and a empathy at all the rest of it and she said as I say in the book seemed to be just sort of deliberately in your face a A R\nMassive\nA failure of recollection Donnelly strain credulity Michael we just did that by\nThe time we assessed all of her answers we knew that she was she was lying under oath fainting or a failure recollection there was so colossal so profound that it simply could not have been true\nOkay you clearly believe a and I know because he said this house where it would be a mistake to pursue for Democrats\nOr to pursue impeachment proceedings against a either a justice Kavanaugh who used to work with you or against President Trump or why why would that be such a destructive course for the country and and I mean you can relate that to some of the lessons in your book contempt\nYes Michael it goes back to the a structural protections built into the constitution\nTo prevent mob rule at her to the corner of Jerry that Kavanaugh hearings so to speak of mob rule which seem to be the disorder of the day and the dystopia that we all experience doesn't work stoned out but\nThe founding generation wanted a and demanded a supermajority requirement in the Senate a simple majority of the house the people's house should put\nThe issue into play at their discretion so the majority can simply send articles over but then there needs to be a bipartisan consensus\nThat's the practical political message and the two thirds super majority requirement\nIs embodied in our constitution so don't go there there's just no reason there's no justification other that to a further divide the country if that's the goal let's just divide the country even even more let's do what the Russians\nWere paying other owners amount of money and attention to to do and continue to do was just continue to sow discord a and rancor among the American people that would be the eventual a result\nAnd I experience that and obviously we learn from our experiences and\nWhile I was not advocating impeach when I was simply putting the facts of the Clinton investigation\nBefore the house of representatives and while I thought it was a perfectly reasonable action by the house of representatives wants the articles arrived at even before that it was very clear that the American people through the United States Senate was just they were not willing\nTo go so far as to upset an election over these clearly establish crimes\nNow if clearly establish crimes such as perjury and obstruction of justice and the like are not sufficient to remove an individual from office that there is absolutely nothing that we know that President Trump has done and leave injustice capital aside\nFor the for the moment that he has done that rises to the level as I see it in the future will fence so I think it's a the the book and it's on the way is a cautionary tale be careful before you marched down the road peach Ron\nOh lord speaking with Ken Starr he is the author of contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nHe had been is pointed that special prosecutor and it was still special prosecutor in that special counsel and he's one of the most distinguished attorneys and jurists and legal thinkers in our country\nHe um had been appointed to the federal court of appeals by President Reagan he was solicitor general under President George Herbert Walker Bush\nHe also served as president of Baylor University and as a dean of the Pepperdine University law school the book contempt is posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com\nYou were talking before about the need for bipartisan consensus if any I drive for impeachment of anybody is going to be successful\nAnd are there did appear to be some attempt by well two senators I I can name they were both Democrats at the time of the impeachment crisis I Know that a Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein a of um\nUm California I Believe had had both been involved with the idea of promoting censure\nOr a resolution of censure and that could have passed the Congress don't you think\n[noise] yes I think a resolution of censure condemning the crowds of a crime or the violation of basic principles increase up so the rule of law was passed overwhelmingly not unanimously but a overwhelmingly I think it would have exceeded\nUp two thirds majority of cars were given a principled an elegant way out\nYeah and and I'm a white wine was ... who made the determination because it wasn't you\nWho made the determination not to accept a resolution of censure and then to go on with the people's business\nFor a number of arguments were fans to the fact that the constitutional contemplated impeachment and so it was either impeachment\nOr nothing and decide reflected on this constitutional issue I respectfully disagree with that and therefore would say that in the conversation that may uh unfold and twenty ninth team\nThat are those who are crying impeachment of impeachment if their grounds for condemning and I'm saying if their breath grounds for condemning the president but it's it's a foregone conclusion that impeachment will not succeed and that the the ... the United states will\nComplete his term of office where we seek reelection et cetera et cetera\nThen a resolution of century strikes me is completely and the discretion of the Congress there's nothing so let me turn the tables on the argument there is nothing in the constitution structurally or text joy that forbid or prohibit or the\nSenate or the house or boat from expressing its opinion as to south probation and it ... past all the time\nAnd uh that could be something that President Trump faces judge Kavanaugh justice Kevin a most unlikely the book is contends the author is Ken Starr we'll be right back with more lessons for today\nDay and age thing uh in northern Virginia Pentagon City she said using very foul language to her mother who was encouraging her Monica to\nCooperate with the investigation and take yourself out of harm's way\nThat she was not going to bring down this and she is very strong language cries of the\nAnd then she said that course for five months and\nI'm the president for his part insisted of course that he\nHad told the truth and his uh perjury is a deposition and the Paula Jones case so the combination of the ... city of Bill Clinton under oath and the stubborn refusal of Monica for five months to cooperate\nWith the investigation just hurt us and\nThe nation through this very hellish purgatory old process\nSpeaking of a hellish in purgatory process\nI'm ... I I'm I'm sure you've encountered a the currents national counsel Robert Mueller he's quiet right now for a while because it's just a few weeks before the upcoming election and I guess the tradition\nFor somebody in that position as you don't break any news right before an election I Would you have some special advice for special counsel Robert Mueller about how to handle the conclusion of an investigation based on your experience that you describe in contempt\nYes I Would say that the regulations that are what she was appointed\nBy a Rod Rosenstein point the way to very happy resolution once he comes to a close friend and I think he has on may be wrong and I don't know but I think he has concluded that there was no collusion\nBetween the Trump campaign and Russian interests uh that's why he was appointed obviously there's the Paul Manafort monitor the Rick Gates matter the indictments of the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on reason that he was appointed\nBring this to an orderly conclusion and a professional way as quickly as possible and then happily this is a huge improvement Mike all over the independent counsel statute of under which I was appointed and that is the regulations in which a model was appointed to not speak of impeachment that\nWas a powerful dynamic in the independent counsel law that Congress passed in Nineteen Seventy eight\nTo nudge the process toward impeachment\nThat's now where we're going God willing uh and you'll understand why that's so important when you read content a memoir of if Clinton investigation Ken Starr\nHas been a public servant all his life and I admire him greatly the book is also admirable we'll be right back\nYou're on AM ten Seventy one oh three three the answer real up

because it's absolutely harmless there Ted Cruz is going to win that race\nAnd it's much better to send money to pay into than to send it to some some of those swing state Democrats where it actually might make a difference a and then I appreciate your\nCall and and by the way the best example of money not determining the election\nIs uh\nIn in the campaign Hillary Clinton outspend Donald Trump more than two to one and this is if you take all of the sources and all the money and all of a special funding a trombone was not by any means the leading span during the primaries\nHe defeated all

somebody in the very the California money has got him thinking that he's got a chance at some time in the future and you've got to get his campaign or chops and uh\nBut you know here's here's here's the thing what they're trying to do is they're trying to compare him to Lincoln and I'll tell you why Lincoln was a congressman just for one single term\nAnd then he ran for Senate and he lost any

he has come back and he has been a constructive player in the Senate and you can talk to even people use to make fun of Ted Cruz is the most hated man in the Senate\nHe's actually somebody who's won
