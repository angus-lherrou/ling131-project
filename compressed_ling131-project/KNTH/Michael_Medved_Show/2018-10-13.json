{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "The older we get you know it it's called a surprise because it's something we didn't plan on and there's all all sorts of things that happen\nA as we start going down that talked track in fact it's always interesting to me how when we talk to people who have not retired you put them in the same room you put in the people who have not retired and the people who have retired and he asked the people who have not retired\nDo you think you can live off left and they all say yes and then you talk to the people who have retired and he said can you live off less and they go no because there's so many unexpected ... come up as we get a little more miles on our body I mean we could just go down the healthcare path but this\nBut there's just so many things that come up with multiple streams of income ended up being very very critical now ends up being very very important to create that nice stability now whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nGet excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time to really even add investing into their life you know after all\nThere's only twenty four hours of the day and right now we're using all of them and and the thing I Would like to bring up is Hollywood right there's all sorts of movies that have trading and then there's also the TV show them investing in it\nAnd they show it let's all encompassing kind of lifestyle when in reality it's not that the average trader doesn't have Eighteen computer monitors the average trader didn't just take their hypertension medication errors traders not sweating profusely right now in fact when you're doing is appropriately your proactively investing\nYour lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in and that's that's one of the things I I I'd like you to expand on 'cause you you talked with more students than probably anybody I Know your water some of the life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom\nWell the first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason\nPour stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThat people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again\nWhat I find with our students Ryan is they're not\nFrom a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier\nThe number one mistake than most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to do the education because they've blown up the money they had\nSo what is good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is being done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business so the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning new skills that can give me the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the stuff that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine\nAnd he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just easy travels around and I as a great time he just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if\nI go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from it rather than a hall in mind around but it it's just there's just\nSo much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or\nActions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThey were trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his\nFive fingers I Would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get\nStarted with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to cross the sea exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really take it's really a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really lived that life that you're after he just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kitten now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved\nThose seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at Houston ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags and bags below the ... of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another\nWell the first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming after the holiday season again we're going to start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis was the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if your coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right in the raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you are you a trading before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another give away\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nOh right right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class don't just to say you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you're

will\nKeep it here but it looks like a you know because of course is trying to get them to look at it and it the visuals are not going over to the side of the road rules like almost out that they feel\nThat they're going to look at that but it is the case now it's a first down so you know the deep it did a great job got up to thirty six and just didn't make the play they rush three and they said we'll show a lot of time to survey the defense and he just found this ball back\nIn a little boy that that wasn't playing but Andrew back back back in office zone because right now the leading up that time of possession then you just don't want your deepest film appeal to all allows you to you all but it's just a methodical drive down\nThe American juniors gives us a chance to check in with Dave choking debater I Am gee network studios say hey thanks GMO will just a quick uh official update\nFrom the University of Texas on quarterbacks damn Ellen ... that he is currently out with a shoulder injury but will be re evaluated at halftime\nInteresting I shoulder injury\nRemember when he first went out to Reggie Smith said there was you had blood on his right or did you went through the sidelines right right and went but went straight into that you can\nWhich are maybe maybe you might do but not necessarily to ah you know to drops of blood\nYeah so he went into the tent went into the locker rooms come back out there and are they recording too acidic or maybe a shoulder injury per se a mail order any as absolute shame boost shale is on the field a quarterback a junior\nAt Arlington Lamar high school\nAll right here's the blame Bush damaged in the long horn for their own thirty four yard line\nBaylor Seventy six roof shell baked\nTo come play\nNearly ticked off in that secondary by Baylor's Caitlin boogie Barnes was a little bit high and\nFailing complete let's check in with Ricky\n... we had the brick passwords that time outside ... he was tackled\nBy the right track or go through it was about five your gentleman and\nNo penalty Gabby\nSo executive pan on me in complete you know takes the snap at a shotgun fix the hand\nThe air and complain\nThe on charging Jamieson Houston batted that ball down\nAnd a with a little bit of Velcro that might have stuck and he might have run it in for a touchdown ... goes to show\nThat he showed that quarter to the boundary that's into the ground he sneaks inside the receiver to make the quarterback big he's coming on that gene was used and they brought him all the blood\nAnd he wasn't going to intercept the huge because it has to do recover his receiver that's out on a force you to be the third down at the end the three of sick from afternoon\nDirt and sand from their own thirty four\nThree receivers left one or the right side one back in the backfield off the right side of the quarterback who's\nNap to boost shall pressured Comey to shelter throw their side is no income\nPlay skip then no cash and completion will bring up bores\nWars that can further on orange from their own thirty four because this is a little bit of pressure not even want\nTo ask your man or but then he may eighty four seem to get the ball out saying\nHe's a pretty accurate passive but this is a challenge when you haven't played that much or just been practicing drill or what happened over time you're now they solve it takes you about a half to get ready so they're not oppose this ball away and that's basically the Baylor\nOffice would give it another shot at a riot boost chefs skiing is the\nCatch taken by Trevor why\nPenalty or so in any case\nBut if that was hit how about that at all yeah even if it was partially tips Baylor near like got that one new chef ski a ninth and the league in planning thirty seven point three art average\nBy comparison Baylor street Gaillard says first in the league with a forty four yard punt average that may work in Baylor's favor over the course of the afternoon\nWhen all this and hear what the hell this is the ground did go\nThat was a fifty yard five fifty\nFirst wife the bears asked to or heard at the near side short game pushing\nMan that's got to be on her and they just got too much to act that you don't have to tackle\nAnd he ended up just laughing at somebody and that's just what do you can't do it when you do and that's going to be released it would've been second down to the ... six but with that penalty now I've got to push\nBack that's going to be the un sportsmen like probably a better because it after the after the play I mean that's a Fifteen year old or half the distance to the goal is\nWell that's just in a hostile environment on the road you just want your single player to keep cool yeah\nWell you know there was a player earlier he made a catch on the near side lined the Texas sideline and he was drawn a little bit uh with the Texas players they were obviously John get him also so now the U.S and here's the call\nThrough the poor little war both\nOf your dream and gives you the always find they always see the second part right right but he was talking to juggle he was saying something to him and I picked up his so called both of them and that's\nA that's a that's another benefit for Baylor but it's got to be second in about six years so\nI got to use this uh this opportunity you\nIt is second at six from the twenty yard line fleets in motion fleet six to swing fast left side ... brought\nTo run no way to get to the\nUse that great speed so he's brought down for a loss of one back to the Nineteen yard line whatever trying to really get today is they're trying to throw the ball to the it's\nYou see the parents and\nWell we can get the outside so [noise]\nNow six surfers out at about seven\nThe game as the over the question Seventy six you don't have the funding is not a bad thing [noise]\nMonterey Davis made that tackle for the last one by taxes leaks Baylor down at seven from the Nineteen yard line [noise] AC and most of the backfield brewer\nYard line for yards on that fly by Charlie brewer Anthony ...\nThey got to him for the loss and\nThat brings forth down for the man that was the perfect off as we were was fine Charlie the whole entire time they had a free down lime and look and they brought a fourth grader just had we were watching Charlie because they knew that he will go down and probably about seven eight or last week and run it so\nThat's just good defense ethics at UCD visited the justice failure has to find the side\nOut of bounds on its own Baylor side of the field as the forty two\nShort ... we'll give you the distance in a moment out of bounds\nSorority seven yards punch by gay lets out of bounds of forty two so Texas text possession on Baylor side of the field trailing

were looking for room up the metal not much there a couple of charge to the forty four and grew up\nWith the other day with the parents really been playing pretty solid you move the ball ball\nBut they not been able to convert to touch down so when you started your parents or yes it's one of those you know standup\nBlow up in play hard trying to get them off the field with tempo who shell to throw the ball left side it is in complete\nWell defended by Baylor's Derek Thomas\nCheck in with Ricky\nTheir comments due to a great job and he was behind the receiver\nBut what he did also slowdown it\nDown through the receiver courting run through which caused the ball to be overthrown\nThat's your technique Derek I thought well maybe ... prior past when he got parents parents and their parents but he turned the ball is playing the ball so an Alabama has UT the third down in the age uh UT on the afternoon is\nSecond five from the twenty two and a half for the bears brewer takes the snap at a

Johnson\nChasing him the rover from behind Johnson who is\nFan of\nGoing to be inside the yard line somewhere\nYeah that is built for why he was kind of short right on the books on his wife I took them a little under around ... under out the that everything's clear suddenly got the ball to the Baylor's is going through this\nThe right side of the Baylor line so on third down and five looks like that will cost the bears five\nThat's a big five yards to for all kinds of who's now [noise]\nWell that makes you think the salmon snap the ball all the time when everybody moved to a lot of people

six five oh three on the clock second quarter about this in to the when Ricky a you call that one good and I wasn't sure if it's going to make it\nWhen you're really not that went down there you can tell when he was going to get serious but it was about five yards short this one I thought it was that when kind of like where you draw an octave straight down but what a pick up\nDown here you could really feel when not only is in his face British across when so that's a tough year\nHuge one to the bears with five oh three to go in\n... points for the bears since they're opening possession today remember that first quarter in which the ah the teams really just that one possession each Texas is a field goal or a touchdown and bears have added a field goal their own to go up ten to six on\nTexas and that's a huge job with Dr we just talked about it maybe it started a job but they're twenty two yard line they face the third down it's in a two thirds down his tens on that drive that actually had a second and Fifteen and they're so so I'll tell you that's a huge number one just changed the momentum a little bit even though they didn't get that touchdown\nNow the deepest gives you come out they've had some time to rest a little bit that was the big thing is some time to rest a little bit uh and now you get to come back out on view fresh\nGet go by drew gay let's from left or right\nThat'll sale nine yards and to the end zone and out the back good distance by drew gave us\nIn the morning before we go you know the big bang all bets are up big debate of what has happened besides the line we talked about it\nIs their kids only is it it just wanted to make the quandary for you to get\nThe right now is a really steady office but they don't have those kind of kids on the outside so Baylor was taking a few more chances even though you can make some place they don't feel with every day and a couple of\nYears taxes from their own twenty five yard line handoff\nCasting things up for middle he's out to the twenty\nEight three yard gain on first down\nAnd it seemed like coach no one has a good feel for what coach back into term or trying to do or even though they're moving the ball\nWatch this time he gets a lot more yard age out to the forty before he's chase down the forty one and a flag is down as soon as they play holding\nRick thinks there may be holding this what may be coming back\nWell that wouldn't be bad but we've got a couple of everything\nA colleges Baylor is a ... year it's either or maybe not\nGot to play ball\nWe've had a couple of big would but any case there on that one you know I mean on that one that actually was pretty good deep if you have the right defense called\nDoes that was missed tackle white is a line of scrimmage you had a good call the attacker was missing when I was going to be doing that resulted in a big boy\nWeld yard run Fifteen penalty yards back down to the end of it Texas as first to Dana debate or forty four\nRailing a bears fan the sick\nSit down [noise] All right there and watch it it's all exhausted put their Thomas right in the back right with the ball is coming and they turned around and said hey man you don't call they call the parents and the parents don't\nCome as early when he just had a hand on the guy they let them go with that will direct the life definitely a push to\nNope penalties coming touchdown longhorns forty four yard touchdown pass\nHere's the kicker by there and it is good that snap was a little\nIt was picked up man set up by the Potter\nRyan but chefs cues also beholder vicar put her on the board so with for Twenty one to go long horn strike quickly they now leave for the first time today it's sex is Thirteen Baylor fan\nYeah so I Do that I think this is one where you know that that that happens sometimes they make those calls the coaches probably telling Derek\nHey you got to just keep playing a loud rather take a pass interference it gives you bigger than a touchdown but but you know really what I Know coach we walked\nIn these receivers over as you go look at that set of building and they had some huge one's a key opportune time that allow Texas drives to keep going and that was a Fifteen your face mask middle course that was a nice tall but\nBut now the ... office has to come back down Texas ease the momentum\nBut four minutes and Twenty one seconds to go and a half\nIf you're the bail offered you don't want to give the ball back to school\nThe replay Seventy five yards scoring drive by taxes we've seen some long drives today that one very short three Seventy five yards only forty two seconds the touchdown of forty four yard touchdown pass\nFrom Shane Bush in the end of that flight\nAnd you like to see that a little bit out of you know one guy get penalty would that mean that hey this is true rivalry both he'd realize how important it is that\nRight now to poach those missions or do you look at the clock you guys this woman's twenty seconds we get the ball after half so don't don't panic we just want to make sure we get that first first down but you assign to get that first presented in will flow from there so the most important player in the series is\nI first began first goal from the five hand off the\nFor him off left tackle you fall down about the two and a half yard line\nPlenty of time for Texas emitted forty to\n... go term and going to you're going to use as much of this clock is possible\nOr before trying to score points\nAre going to go from the story for the long horn relaxes leads

I mean it's needed a an incomplete so\nTo doubt really if your coach you thinking of minutes ago I got to try to get a position for points I 'cause I got I get the ball as a half but I Want to my best to get in a position\nWhere for points to see some way shape or form or fashion we can we can put together at least a couple of stores back to back to you know one thing I'll say those words he was\nReally cold so you know the guys are just have to settle down and just play football\nThe Texas set to kick off they don't get the ball Newtown ounce remaining for the bears minute twelve o'clock\nIt gives away deep kick\nCarry out of the back of the end zone couple of ah you kick return is back there for Baylor Josh leaks\nAnd taekwondo ... and and now some more\nExtra curricular activity on the near side line flags or dropped so we'll see\nWhat comes out of this one\nReally nothing ever goes good were you close to the other team's sideline\nTo to get out of there so you had numbered minutes we're known as long as it is nothing over there that can help you out like you've been in that position and yeah yours or you get out as fast as you can ...\nYour novels are huddling talking about it\nAnd it twelve on the clock Baylor's ball\n\nQuestion is where will they take possession yeah that that is and the way the first half of going out with a ... that is going against us pretty consistently that they have to do\n\nStill talking about it the officials are probably the question is if is it all setting or just\nOne get one team that's normally one of the discussions when you have a couple of guys going at it\nWe've seen offsetting already here in the first staff at one point\nAlright heres Reggie Smith\nSoftball unnecessary roughness\nNo that's Ross mad as the uh the linebacker slash the snap or for the bears their own special teams\nGoing to cost the bears with that penalty yeah I Would have been up to twenty five then you're going to be back soon and that added ... twelve\nTwelve and a half or they'll call it\nBut that's that's a huge building because if you had any chance of trying to trying to get a few ago range without any time out right probably taken away now\nIsrael's now trying to figure out where they're going to spot the ball in their\n[laughter] at all [noise]\nThought was going number one team they\nPenalize happiness and still the goal\nThe apologies to ah Ross Madison middle name is not on here on April ... Smith backup running back\nThey marketed off from the thirty two yard line for some reason\nMan oh man because there are some reason they were marking that starting at the thirty flu versus\nDaughter who's twenty minute backed up to the twenty five [noise] All right so for the bears I got a twelve and a half yard line first down and paying for their taxes twenty to ten minutes well to play the second quarter Charlie really gives the ball to trust it after\nAnd down no gain the play\nYeah\nOh yeah so they are they're going to do they're going to force the play off here and that's what I'm Talking about the penalty being ruined the challenge because if you get up to twenty five year old line and even if you don't get your least they know if you want it\nWe're pushing back when you do see your backed up ... one of the way the way the Druze and struggle will but this afternoon we may get the ball at the fifty what a chance to sports so ... got to have you got to be disciplined near
