Beto O'Rourke I mean the the media love affair with this guy is something to behold does he deserve all the hype and then we're going to be speaking to Stephen Moore the\nAuthor or a new book called Trump's ... about some of the lives about the economy\nAnd what happens next after the November elections to help Trump fulfill his America First vision of economic reform one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech and he was an extraordinarily good spirits he seemed extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in that CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it and let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that basically Congressman John forte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in ... in Missoula\nAnd Congressman John forte in at the time I thought that Gianforte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed the reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter he it assaulted and I spoke with the congressman Gianforte this was one of the most embarrassing moments with his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a a good idea for President Trump to make light of it I don't think ours when John forte would think that however what struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually with Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way\nWas laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican trying to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate race has become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants lost a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was to show the we're not talking that he because he was lost a finger in a farming accident he's really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale another Montana Republican and he had this to say and defining what this election should be about\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise]\nOf cabinet all\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nIt's gotta be election of those things\nOkay he's talking about the cabin on the caravan and common sense\nAnd I think he threw in off off script the idea of law and order but that that do fine I'll look in terms of Kavanaugh obviously because of the treatment\nOf a justice Kavanaugh that has mobilized lots of Republicans and there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling and the betting and things like that say there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six so right now Republican prospects are surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes\nWith their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers on line\nBut the choice to not be more clear Democrats ... Republicans reduced job [noise]\n\nMan see for\nDemocrats they want to raise your taxes\nThey want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they get Venezuela because that's what's going to have [noise] they want to take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it\nDestroy your Second Amendment and throw open your book deadly drugs and vicious gangs because plenty of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump because guess what he's president United States Republicans control the Senate and the house they rolled apartment homeland security they control lights\nAnd he is right that there are a lot of people coming across the border I just looked at the numbers and they're sad\nOr the number of people entering the country illegally is not going down and went down the first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency\nIt sound like tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September were staggering\nAnd that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago that there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops to try to block\nThe advance of of what looks to be over four thousand people waving Honduran flags by the way\nWe're marching their way through Guatemala and then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what do Democrats say we know where Trump's stance\nFrom stands\nOn a common sense principle which I honestly who who could disagree you cannot let this caravan in you can feel sorry for these people but if we go ahead and say oh well you march told his way well coming up we'll process your your applications for asylum\nThis there will be no end to it\nWill encourage more and more and more and more\nAnd look it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate but right now the question was this caravan is whether we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction\nAnd ah I think frankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory and turn the caravan back\nWhere there's going to be some kind of awful disaster and I think the incoming president Mexico Andres Lopez Manuel Obrador\nUm has a ... actually shown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration\nOn stopping this caravan which is crucial I've been a Trump ... said this about\nThe economy and related it of course of the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nSuch an incredible autonomy I Am so money [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay [noise] uh probably the rhetoric I've created so much I have done this and\nYou know and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the factors the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about was even more coming up and and just a moment\nThe point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about this has anyone heard a any kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\nBecause I've heard nothing all they do is they attacked Trump and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night\nThey don't work the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand twenty and\nBeyond beta or who's a talented politician but he blew up his\nHis own campaign and frankly I think his own future with a one answer that was just a ploy we'll get to that and to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore\nThe author of the new book Trump ... of course one

men didn't show last one eight hundred nine four five Seventy six [noise]\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and helped to design the those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat outline isn't\nYeah revenues are actually up that this year so we passed the biggest tax cut and three years and we actually have a slight increase rather is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy uh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues headed\nFor people to work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which has happening uh but yeah what the problem is spending and you know people I say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans and Democrats this is a bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for that\nYou like a President Trump's a idea a vast along every department to five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do you know that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and that's what businesses did during the recession they they act in their stomach they tighten their belts they got\nRid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that in government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show call in to your show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and that that is a pre structure and what we need pipelines we need ... terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports\nA lotta that Michael I think can be good to be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nAnd I think that's a great ... points for President Trump to borrow from the book from ... from my friend

by his rhetoric\nLast night he had a tough night\nVery good at answering some questions but there was one question he was asked where the answer's gonna come back and bite him here's the question\nMy question would be a what would you say to Republicans and independents who are watching tonight and are contemplating about voting for you but are worried that\nI should you when your main objective as senator would be to try to impeach President Trump\nOK tough question right because well let's listen to the\nWay that uh the young Mr O'Rourke a Dodgers and waves and refuses to face it here's

[laughter]\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach heavy changed your mind\nOur habits um let let me let me put it this way I'm there may be an open question as to whether the president then the candidates sought to ... with the Russian government in two thousand and fixing lots of quote George Will very conservative columnist when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki\nDefending ... the head of the country that attacked our democracy in twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and the amazing democracy was collusion inaction\nThere may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator in what happened in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation always say that obstruction inaction\nOkay goes on and basically what he's saying is yes he would go back to the house of representatives if he if he does go back to the house of representatives a I'd be not planning on it he's planning to be elected Senate that won't happen\nUp and he's saying he favors impeachment and I think that's political poison I I think it it means that any\nModerate who was thinking of voting for better or work because Ted Cruz is very conservative\nOr forget it I ... honestly it and people out there things that the veteran workers answering this question of actively look people who love the idea of impeachment they're going to vote for him anyway\nBut why what is wrong congressman O'Rourke from getting an honest answer and saying look\nWe just want to find out\nThe facts let the investigation work right now there is no evidence and there is not that should

toxic political environment at her some people in both parties describe their opponents as enemies or evil and America\nAre not even\nIn South Sudan or rape is routinely used as a weapon of war that\nIs evil\nSyria where the dictator uses chemical weapons too\nOr innocent children that as evil\nIn North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier\nWas tortured evil in the last two years I've seen truly we have some serious political differences here at home but our opponent or not there yet are\nWe are blessed with a political system that allows them to resolve our differences peacefully\nIn the end we recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that\nAnd particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb\nShe's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that the they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what does or crime well here is the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal um it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this is eight years ago\nWith a squabble over a couple of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother a mother of five and in fact they accused her of polluting the top that they were all drinking from on this hot day because she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms baby told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani law\nTo talk about blasphemy is blasphemy\nSo all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examine the witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten she lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIt's it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case a shortly after the span villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had or imprison the following\nYear record censored to death she lives in a windowless cells where she cooks for herself for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmate against is bankrupt a standing up for his baby requires courage in Pakistan and two thousand eleven as a year after she was condemned\nThe governor of Punjab governor Solomon to fear\nOf visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her and right after that visit and his expression of support for obviously a bb his bodyguard killed him two months later\nA gunman killed Shabaab boss he that's another\nA Christian politician who also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law\nIt's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power now why am I talking about this right now not only because there was attention to her case and there's a new president of Pakistan Imran Khan who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is that President con\nSupports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um this is your mom to show the incident I ah I have been troubled by some voices on the right who want to say that to show the\nAt one time and his wife had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington Post\nHe was no Islamist he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom ironically\nThe the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he is sad I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well oh we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and as a very important ally the United states over this one episode\nAnd it's it's a remarkably important that we move forward and we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one\nOf the things that the Democrats do wrong as they want to make every last thing about from\nAnd or do I think that Trump made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty it's like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit and I believe imagined a solved by a Seventeen year old high school guy who had an end to end it was halted the culminating in groping\nI've to compare that to a brutal murderer in December meant and torturing a guy in cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country [noise]\nThis is not comparable and it's also\nNot comparable because this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show the story\nIs that stupidity if sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil\nAnd how stupid do have to be if you're planning to murder some journalists to try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power\nWhat do you think is going to happen how can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get caught they wanted to send a message but that's evil to send a message through murder and torture is hideous in it's evil and that's wrong\nThese stories the one from ... which is hideous the one from Saudi Arabia and or the murder if it occurred and I think it did is actually from turkey they're very alarming but they have one\nLesson that's profoundly important the lesson is\nProtecting religious liberty is absolutely crucial or we

the lock around UCLA has a a a gender policy that is very open to everyone\nThere is a transgender boy and on the dive teams that uses the girls walk around and it was very startling when she came out of the stall one day when they were changing it's bathing suits\nAnd and what she's twelve and I assume he's looked Nineteen\nYou know so my daughters actually fix him about the age range is that the kids are about twelve to about Seventeen or Eighteen I think the boy is all I think the boys all sixteen but\nThe girl that phone before getting into the pool and sour after\nSo so your and your daughter was uncomfortable with is what happened next\nI when they finish diving and and that got out of the water is our he was in their showering girls and so instead of them calling debating sits down everyone kept their dating is that's an uncomfortable situation spoke with UCLA title nine department and\nI assume he did not camp he did not keep his bathing suit on\nI think he did I did not I think he ... his\nThey okay I just do the stupidity here it's just so unnecessary so she spoke\nTo the uh people at the diving program and what they say back to her\nWell we did actually at herring because those free online ours and they were very very shocked they have never experienced that\nBefore that this year before and um anyway when they wound up addressing it with the rules for UCLA UCLA than than their guidelines that title nine guidelines which says that they\nUm they allow transgender to go where they identify which is the girls walk around and if one of the girls as uncomfortable they will find out about holidays and all the girls had any that very backwards and I don't know if\nYou have said that that's exactly what when you say it's backwards is this is not to say that we should have no compassion are no support\nFor people who have gender identity issues people who are transgender got it and there should be a place for them but that should be a special place for them for people who have gender confusion or gender identity issues or our transgendered or however you want to say it\nBut the idea that that's a small number of people should be made completely comfortable at the expense of everybody else is backwards\nAnd and again there is a possibility if if this is going to be a serious issue then you have a separate time just shower\nOr a separate time to dress up if if you if your gender identity does not conform\nTo um you're at the moment physiological identity and the entire thing is madness I'm Sorry you've had to go through this

larger tissue size which is both soft and strong the company said in their statement Kimberly\nClark and no way suggested being both soft and strong isn't exclusively masculine trade nor do we believe

been taken over by genes Philips who was the daughter of the original dear Abby but she was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name\nThat someone was considering giving a child and dear Abby said this\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but\nThey can also call a child calls a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be a problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful and a foreign language can be grading English by the way when I read that I immediately thought of a a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew now\nThe Israeli name is ... and a are more on I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter\nOr your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture that probably better named to choose now the point about this dear Abby thing is all hell has broken lose for dear Abby people who claimed that she is affirming white\nPrivilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial and what she said\nBut of course the New York times is ready to make that racial\nThey have a column that says I'm the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American households for decades\nAnd was started by miss Philips mother used the pen name Abigail Van Buren this heated reaction has inspired of fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also revel a Tory said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nAbby is clean to an old America were white\nIs considered the norm and everything else deviant and inferior risk our added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and to connect them to vent heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay that's fine and he was not suggesting that anyone is just giving advice do I think it's reasonable advice sure\nDo we have very very dear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely\nAnd you get used to it uh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children okay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny a river and Jonas but none\nOf those names or that hard to spell or though I don't know made the ... probably people there are probably people spelled penny wrong\nBut not many uh okay that's the point about the point about this it just seems to me is why is everything about race well because people make it about race they a quote someone named a non\nZero right is he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality that a lot of this has to do\nWith names but more with white and is\nThere a lot of complicated names from polish and Russian and Italian and German backgrounds that have become second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in a dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity you said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't white\nThat is nonsense I I mean I I think it's very difficult if ah if somebody and they are all kinds of\nNames which could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle ... on his his name was Moshe method and he changed his name to ... more stuff and that\nWas the way he did business 'cause it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for bear is dogs and the

evil but guns now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look at him the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state's Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life in prison and that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen\nYou can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think it's profoundly wrong but see we\nWe lose the battle to him if we lose the language and evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were\nLiterally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that ah Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nUm okay you get to argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that that people had an and there were people\nOf this nature or stolen was evil Hitler was evil\nSo why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of
