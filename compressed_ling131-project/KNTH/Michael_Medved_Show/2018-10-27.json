greatest compliment I could get from a Christian is it's a great Christian commentary\n\nBut she the pastor's being was being very sensitive and to his great credit but there's also a function of our time\nAnd they're making Kelly situation while obviously very very different is related in my opinion we have become walkers on egg shells in our society\n\nIt is it is a wonderful thing I I have always try to walk around with my wife say anything that that offends this person and uh it's a monitor built in to be\n\nWhat every good things can go too far it's one thing not to gratuitously insult somebody and it's another to have to walk on eggshells with ... with members of every other group in your own\n\n... it's it it makes for ... natural relationships\n\nIf you can joke around and if you if you can't say what's on your mind\nIt's that's not that's not an achievement against racism or anti Semitism or other forms of bigotry telling the cheap but\nIt's it's a form of\nHyper sensitivity ordering um nonsense and an unnatural miss if I Can't talk to you a member of a different group than me\nNaturally when I mean no ... and that's key if I mean ... the issue if you think I mean malice then don't listen\nThan I should be I should be extra painted from your wife and I don't mean identity anybody\n\nBut if there isn't malice intended but then then what is the what they want us to hyper sensitivity it's it just means I Can't talk to you naturally\n\nAnd that's what that's what the left because it's it always mean to cause you see it's it's it's they got to be fighting some some new evil why they're micro aggressions because they acknowledge there's so little real racism in society they have to make it up\nOh you didn't mean it but you really are are you

seconds of TV Time\nWhat did she say does it deserve this response we will get to that and then a question about the caravan\nUh we we all hear from the left\nThat President Trump is terrible and the caravan\nAnd yes now a Secretary Mattis is sending eight hundred troops to the border of the president's request to make sure that order is maintained and that know people are not just simply going to walk in from the caravan I that is of course the right position to take but what's the Democratic position\nIs the position that literally anyone seeking asylum in the United states should be welcomed with open arms and should be\nAllowed to come in if they are suffering there are a lot of suffering people in the world\nHow many do folks on the left actually wants to take care and then we have disagreement day of course a but first up I Am very very pleased because\nIt'd be it'd be so depressing the other way up President Trump is handling this bombing situation decently\nIs he handling it brilliantly in with unbelievable a plum and so much style and someone's firing no but it's it's it's better than adequate it's good it's fine\nI mentioned on the air yesterday it it might have been a nice thing and who knows maybe he did it it just hasn't called attention to it\nTo call some of the people who have gotten these bomb packages send to them and say gee I feel bad we're going to try to track these people down and make sure you don't get any threats again they didn't call Joe Biden in coal Hillary Clinton you can call ... rock Obama\nWhy not he's president the United states\nAnd uh he did get the tone I think pretty close to just right\nThe beginning of this rally last night Wisconsin a lot of people are saying oh what you're going to say in Wisconsin in fact core affect people in the media are freaking out they say he's blaming the media for this whole thing he is not\nIs not their distorting what the president said here is what he said the very beginning of his rally in Wisconsin of course all of this for the midterm elections which are coming up twelve days from today here's President Trump\nRiggins nights rally by addressing the suspicious devices and packages that were males to current and former high ranking government officials my highest duty as you know as president is to keep America safe this will resolve\n[noise]\nThe federal government to conduct an aggressive investigation and we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly [noise]\nAnd he acts or\nOf political violence art attacks on our democracy\nIs so [noise] no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political a gym and they should go where's your or control we all know the\nSuch conduct mostly fiercely oppose and firmly prosecutor\nOkay this is entirely right ... what is the problem people have with this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number a because it seems to me that\nThe president got lost each year as they're from conservative I haven't heard a single conservatives say\nWell you know what people who got these bombs or deserved it a\n... no one is anyone stood up to try to defend the mad bomber whoever this person is\nI don't think so certainly no one on the right if anyone on the left stood up to defend him or her I think it's probably a guy a ... ISIS as ISIS defended [laughter] the bomber and by the way it's not an ISIS flag it has now been carefully analyzed\nIt was the image was a parody of an ISIS flag that are invoked a Larry the cable guy\nGet her done\nBut that was the image which was a parody from an ISIS flag showing three scantily clad women in high heels okay I mean really\nReally [noise] okay\nIt's the president went on in opening his rallies speech last night to say this\nWe walk\nAll sides\nTo come together in peace and harmony we can do it we can do it [noise] we can do\nMore broadly there's much we can do to bring our nation together for example those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective have\nCondemnation and destructive routine these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop no one should carelessly compare\nPolitical opponents to historical villains which is often\nSon all the time you got to stop we should not\nIn public spaces for destroy public\nOkay I by the way it is a he has cooked politically correct I literally in the last twenty four hours there have been about a half dozen instances including very prominent one on CNN\nOr ... of people\nCalling comparing President Trump to Hitler\nAnd know that is not appropriate and yes that is disgusting and it's inappropriate so the president is speaking well I I Know is reading from a teleprompter I Know it's prepared for him but that's what you want for goodness sake this is a time where he has to be careful of his language and he was\nBut then he added this and this was the controversial part of Israeli speech last night and I think what he said was absolutely one hundred percent correct and highly defensible listen\nMan he also has a responsibility to get a civil yet or stop\nThe endless hostility and constant negative\nAnd oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nOkay why is it not possible for people\nOh say on CNN or MSNBC or and CBS or any ... any of them to acknowledge that the president is right about this but instead of that we heard this from John King on CNN in response to the president's remarks\nNo one's blaming the president and the president\nOf but the president that wants to make this about him um amen to the president for what he first said yesterday\nEverybody tone it down\nLet's just see where the fact that what the investigators do their job we can all be better\nIt's our fault why okay\nShe never said it was your fault the president's words where the media\nAll the responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks\nHe didn't say it was your fault he said that if we're going to be better as a country and that is one good thing that could have come out of it it's going to have to involve all sides and everybody\nAnd uh here was I'm Caitlin Collins on CNN uh yeah we we will get to that at at actually arguing with Jeffrey tube and a Jeffrey\nA that are Republican was behind it because of course by default since all the devices are going to democratic either politicians\nA media sources or other people related to them an actor with De Niro that's the that's the message that being said\nThat you know we don't like your way of thinking we don't like your brand of politics so of course\nWho's one of the Senate Republicans but it could be Michael I false flag type situation where it's actually like set up to make it look like it's a bad guy on one side of the political aisle when actually get somebody on that same side who doesn't really want to hurt\nThe people who are getting these devices because quite frankly none of them have detonated but that's a but they're getting their point across as look how bad this other side is so please vote for us in two weeks I Can't tell you Michael which one is that it is but I work cases in the past\nNot always bombs or sometimes just letters and and then saying certain things and other political ah um incidence in another elections where one side as there are people write to 'em\nYou know the opponent by pretending they're on his er or get to the opponent pretending they're on his side sort of a mini fall sly type situation and let me just throw in your Michael the last thing\nSince we had ... outside source forces or as in the Russians and some others a mess with the two thousands sixteen election or at least try to I Can't completely rule out any very simplistic and\nAlmost unsophisticated way that there is some parties such as that are involved in this whole thing just to throw a wrench in the works of our upcoming election and just confusing compound the people involved and cause a little bit of man and quite\nFrankly I'm getting it makes America look bad and they I I and that's my uh my wife is a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see but her\nIdea is that this kind of thing on not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming it's a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this way by bombs that aren't even that well made it looks like a banana republic\nUm do you think it's likely that we will have a PRP or before the election I was twelve days from now [noise]\nI I I lost one word on

things that CNN was doing yesterday\nWas continuing to debate the outrage of President Trump calling himself a nationalist\nI mentioned do I have no problem with that none I consider myself a

nation in the world I Do and\nYou don't want what's amazing here is you'll hear Caitlin Collins is twenty six years old she's a graduate of University of Alabama\nAnd and this may make the make you doubt that Crimson Tide holes on the national championship frankly because she's arguing with Jeffrey to bend the legal analyst for CNN and he also defends the term nationalist but it sounded like this\nI don't think he can just change the war national I like that I just don't think that is how this works and I don't think I think we're letting if I didn't do that I think every if you think you would think you are a nationalized then if that's what the definition of the word that you're using what did you say your one\nProbably not you know I Would I mean I don't know what I you know I as someone who believes in in the United states and the important\nThing in the United states I'm not a national now that there was a nationalist\nPlease come on I mean that term has not become like Hitler I\nMean that is why not use the word national at the kind of a negative connotation it is not the nationalist and Teddy Roosevelt in the Nineteen right\nNow there are all very legitimate grounds to criticize Donald Trump for for his racism for his ignorance for his lying I just think this one is one where he has a legitimate argument\nNow ... or Republicans would we got I got a big another\nArticle I Will say the president himself said we're not supposed to use that word or and so he was self as acknowledging goes all the controversies that's part of the lessons about getting hurt everybody's\nA beginning of a dog whistle\nWhen when did it become a negative word to call you a yourself a nationalist by the way this um brilliant a Caitlin Collins I've listen to a couple of

friend director restructure development and top instructor down like pretty heavy is everyone wants to be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure but I\nGot Larry out here and Larry first question for\nYou is how the heck you're doing doing great Ryan how you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing this show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time on I Would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get\nYou in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets in one of the things we always stress and I and I know we'll spend a lot of time on a tear today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down and whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKind of bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that and we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow one of the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direct\nElite dependent and what I mean by that is we can't only profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach at half day classier it on a training academy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well so bad 'cause people are losing money and well that is true if we're just in that bullish biased\nAs markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major crashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name\nThe end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it it it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now or to help people become more consistent than less directional independent and send the markets\nWill this last week has been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling the market\nAs opposed to most people who buy the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do I'm gonna lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing what the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money when the markets go up down sideways and with a lot of our students see and we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade them more than just one direction\nYeah and when you look at even the difference between let's even just say a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and the mutual fund\nIs generally just investing into a long position and it was called a mutual funds 'cause it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money as the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful now that product has never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those phones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved there to be invested into that fund you look at the a hedge fund type strategy and and that word Hedges pretty critical because hedge is meaning that there is a position that process on the way up and there's also protection or\nEven a position that could profit on the way down and so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down and the sideways it's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of liked that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways\nAnd you're one of the things I talked about one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't imagine if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you know you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a you know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the markets are going down a retirement account or income account is is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down but what are the things that we can do is always okay with you every one of the things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away\nAnd we can help a few people out there get started\nBecoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that our to our half day classes where do you say let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got to have to class coming

lessons from some of our top constructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause center twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that said it eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track ... consistency conversation as you say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the markets are going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bombs but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you could always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people playing out of the market's going somewhere either go into gold and go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here is it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond short gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that I imagine that we did a little piece of I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you could start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster\nSo a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirect ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogy that we can pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go on to reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check but\nI just dated myself but it is it true that I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professional ... guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions they say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe professional insider kept makes it so you can get started right now\nCarson through twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the\nNumber is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start\nPeople off with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it was ... once said as you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly will come on at all in fact\nMost of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love because if we killed but our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right they don't want to do that\nBecause we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent no\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and so I think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you may get a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nHe's going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that's simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself\nAnd hopefully we'll listening right now I can see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money out of the gate and just you know I Want to\nI Want to take this dollar turned into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay it's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up as it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness in any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to at first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick program\nThen half the cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nAlso said to add to that because I Love where you're going you also can't be someone who doesn't take action\nYou don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not ... those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill that can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nYeah if you're looking to build some skills in the financial market and learn how to generate a greater

more visitors on line at Houston O T H ... that's Houston oh gee a dot com\n[noise] you are listening to powers trading radio show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs his record constructive element and half instructor it online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of and can we talk a little bit about\nPassive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but\nBut even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago leery about about building the skill first a skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh well you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm going to practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we got to have the\nStill first otherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same ... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just 'cause it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of her students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is why I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nDo you think you can live off less and they all say yes and then you talk to the people who have are tired and you say can you live off left and they go no because there's so many unexpected ... come up as we get a little more miles on our body I mean we could just go down the healthcare path but this\nBut there's just so many things that come up that multiple streams of income ended up being very very critical ends up being very very important to create that nice stability now whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nGet excited the best is yet to come I learned a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time to really even add investing into their life you know after all\nThere's only twenty four hours a day and right now we're using all of them and and the thing I Would like to bring up is Hollywood right there's all sorts of movies that have trading and that there was also T. T. V. shows have investing in it\nAnd they show it let's all encompassing kind of lifestyle when in reality it's not that the average trader doesn't have Eighteen computer monitors the average trader didn't just take their hypertension medication errors traitors not sweating profusely right now in fact when you're doing is appropriately your proactively investing\nYour lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in it and that's that's one of the things I I'd like you to expand on 'cause you you talked with more students than probably anybody I Know you know what are some of that life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom\nWell the first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason poor stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThat people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill\nThat will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again\nWe find with our students Ryan is they are not from a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier\nThe number one mistake than most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they've blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one they realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning new skills that can give you the freedom that you desire yeah\nAbsolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the stuff that you go through it very very first conversations he's just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time he just texted me with a\nPicture of snow skis saying hey can you use these the season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place but if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThey were trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me\nWhole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers that would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this that\nConverted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after not one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances\nTake control your retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that you're after and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have take classes to get your phone's writing if you are driving now

colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up in Houston ... and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and\nI said it earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you could reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you'll come after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and coaster Rica\nAnd so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they get raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked June or you training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course I Love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip was we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half\nThe class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another give away yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here ah right right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half day class now just to say you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes as our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like at hand senior retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve\nThose seats the number is eight eight eight five on seven eight seven to three that's eight eight eight five one seven eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at Houston O T H ... and you can scores and passes there Larry thanks for joining me always great to\nSo they were talking about how to take on a grand project to a giant project and really that's the way I see it\nIn life is you run against these giant ... projects you have run up against the judge ... projects you have to take on 'em\nFrom day to day multi multi year to year and so forth and today I was talking about how to do that along with the fact that that stuff all gets mixed in with your normal life so you get your normal day to day survival stuff you gotta take care of also\nSo you really got to look at these projects so the the two things have happened to me this week of may just come to light is\nAbout\nTwelve Fifteen weeks ago I ran into a situation where I'm\nI've lost about landscape becoming we'd gotten an argument about what they were doing for what they're willing to get paid and they wanted to triple the pay cut back to service so I had to let them go during the same time I also had a falling through my bridge and broke my leg broke my elbow tore my try stuff off\nI'm at right before that I had planned or faith he I fishy artist\nAnd all these things going on that was creating problems that I was to destroyed physically and mentally and emotionally to grow up there in tact these things and you know as I certainly feel through some of these injuries I started to get back the energy and thought process\nBrain wave\nEnough left over ... years ago tax with these issues and so I went out I started looking at my my one in my lawn in my house had been destroyed and their head to come up with a plan to get all this stuff done and it was a lot of different stuff\nNo way could I get it all done myself\nEven delegating I couldn't get it out so I drew prioritize what I was going to do and get it done\nSecond thing that happened to me is that we purchased a barbecue place about a month ago the turnaround mode and it was purchased one about a week ago this is a massive turnaround boat\nWith all kinds of things happen daily finding more and more and more challenges that we read it or rectify fixed it not even getting into the improvements we want to make were just taking care of the problems we inherited\nAnd I think that's the situation you got to look at your financial situation as you look at this thing you wake up one day and you got to realize you know what I've got a real problem here\nAnd the first thing you need to rectify\nIs the disasters that are taking you down\nThere is some basic things that are taking you away from the goal\nThere they're sabotaging you and your personal finances just like I've got some basic things at my house there were Savage U me that had to be stopped then you look at the next level there are things\nThat are occurring that have to be taken care of and then somehow fix so that they don't because it costs the recovery battle okay it's impossible to do a so as we go through the process here today we want to work around this and figure out how\nThe process should work and how to correlate the process between what I'm doing and what you should be doing with your fist you'll sit by the situation so the first thing was I had to sit down\nAnd write down all the things are going wrong in my house\nOr the wood on the side of our house rocks if you don't painted every year in because I get a hundred and ten degree temperatures straight at full sun have twenty car garage with all these giant would garage doors that need to be paid or they're just ride up curl up would curls of drives up falls off and that's you know fifty a hundred thousand dollars or the garage doors [noise]\nUh we're talking about situations where\nI have like twenty and they'll have like twelve doors that face the pool exterior doors that they get all that Cory not um so they get rotted away each year\nUm my roof had a leak out to a roof leak it had to be fixed\nAh my ... needed to be cleaned although that we've got set aside prioritize wise\nAnd my lawn was dying and I didn't have a landscape so I had to find a landscaper I had to come back in ... hair the lawn and tried to save the law and that was the first process so your first thing you need to do is figure our water all your problems you got in your life\nWhat did you get 'em all listed down we're going to prioritize them\nBut to prioritize them you have to identify the person that put him into small groups that can be handled together my yard is so large I have like Ted launches in my yard literally ten your house laws I have in my yard and there's no way you could work at all set up at the same time you\nIn turn every street there's forty four different sprinkler zones you couldn't turn them on and watch them go it could stand to watch 'em all go through because they take about eight hours to go through so how do you fix forty four different zones to each his own may have ten or twenty different heads a\nMajor problem right so I had to prioritize I'd say OK let's start with the most important thing the fraud very front out in front of the fountain first thing people see the driver beauty part\nAnd see what we can do about it condition all the grass is dead on one side condition on the other side it's flooded\nSo I had to go out there looking at this figure out what was going on and what I found was as I work through the process I knew that it'd be a watering process or at least I thought it did was work through the process I realized that I had two heads that were completely broken in those years we're getting no water at all\nAnd then I had another head or the other side that was leaking it right where the one had was leaking I had three heads all the same areas hitting the same area at the same time\nAnd it's because we're raised our landscaping I redo the front yard landscaping last year or actually this year summer this year and it it reposition where the sprinkler heads we're at now there's too much water one area not enough water in the years\nSo I had to go online and look this up and\nFigure this out on the irrigation system how do you fix those kinds of problems and what you need to do is as you go through your problems you see I got to fix as I got bad credit how do we fix my bad credit right I got these issues that are challenging my car keys breaking down\nThat is killing me maybe it's time for a new car you have to look at your family's issues and figure out what they are\nAnd how to solve them maybe we're not going to send the kid to a four year college where we'd have to go the first two years or into a a local college you know one one fifth because and then his last two years graduated from some big name college\nStill get same credits still get the same graduation from that school\nLots of ways to solve this problem but you got to identify the problems in your financial situation you also need to identify your your all your problems he got personal problems your wife spent too much money your husband's but it's too much money ah neither one of you understand investing you need information you need help\nAll these things are going on you you've got to start somewhere\nThat's I started with the front spot\nAs I researched and research how you should water lawns I ran into a guy or doing a pod cast on how to make you on look incredibly beautiful and what I found out was he actually fertilizers his lawn every four weeks yeah I've been told you fertilize in the beginning of the season and you fertilized at the end of the season\nRight ah\nI didn't really even fertilized during the summer but this guy said is absolutely yeah so I started fertilizer my yard\nAnd all of a sudden the grass started greening up it was amazing and I put on small amount so they would burn the grass I made sure there's plenty of water so wouldn't burn the grass and lo and behold the guy was right\nYou gotta feed that little monster so if you got some kind of an investment it's not working you got to go and they're feeding you got to go with her fixed it first\nAnd then start feeding it putting more and more investments in that area so we got one little run house you fix what's wrong with that right now is the next when you buy you fix it and then you keep building and building and building is what you're looking to do is to build this portfolio as I'm looking to develop this beautiful landscape\nI've got to work on a project by project by project a and so on and so forth so now I've done all these changes made all these changes to this area\nIt's time to move on because now they got to let that area CIT and see what the changes did most people myself included overreact you take dryers in the new over water you take in ... in areas that are condition nothing over a condition or instead of just fixing\nTo do what it's supposed to do\nThat's the key is just fix it get it done fix it and move on so now move on\nTo the tenth others ...\nWorking through them taking the worst one the next worse for next the next one after that nexus or so forth and finding all kinds of challenges\nThat are all different one of them so the hedge don't work so over their heads are buried some of the hedge a crooked now the fall over years that got into a weird position that at water where they're supposed to\nUh some of it just had the wrong hands where they should be a reason she get lots of water a low flow heads and there is as you get almost no water up high flow has just\nRidiculous stuff that has to be fixed\nThen you can't go to step two which is just start prioritizing the problems and then get each problem in attacking it individually with the knowledge justice or to solve that particular problem\nIs what it's really all about and if you don't do it that way\nYou're not going to solve the problem you're going to have an ongoing mess of life that just keeps going on and on on the way it's going now which is basically
