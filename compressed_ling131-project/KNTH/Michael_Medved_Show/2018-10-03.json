everybody\nFor everybody yes we're going to be talking a little bit about this a new attack on President Trump will get a response on that the new attack which is really an old\nAttack about president from a dodging taxes and he isn't\nReally a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well research in the New York\nTimes so what is the relevance of this right now it's obviously an attempt\nTo tilt the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets love it we've had this week the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing\nUm why is that happening we'll talk with us even more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News\nHe has a new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward president from\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there's lots of it that there is at least in increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from African Americans we will get to that as well on the ... show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective is as people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season\nAnd actually\nI Want to thank Mark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are helping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is a a basically it's almost a month long of one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful\nThis one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York\nUm and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family began in but also because on this whole Kavanaugh will matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective let me just tell you something that happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue and a a and normally I talked to my friends\nI was approached by a little kid and when I say a little kid and ten eleven years old\nAnd um it ... ... he asked that I'm not even sure if we want it you know I was with the car is a hundred people there and anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice and somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite plains that a big deal and I had not yet\nSeen the story about the alleged a bar fight and one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale\nAnd then I later in the horrors\nOf ice throwing and somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw wise or not\nThat it's okay to be under age in a bar find them cetera et cetera then no one ah was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar if they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay this whole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and girls in campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing is powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through\nWith Kevin on four in the back in the forest and the punching and the pushing and the nastiness\nAnd then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm\nA Kavanaugh was not arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up a bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw ice\nAnd a ... again I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement\nMean it was anything is more relevant than the idea that Brett Kavanaugh when he was at Yale I'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and that is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail of people's task to try to smear them and destroy them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat then sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you'll get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radicals from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice\nKavanaugh after he is confirmed if you think that's where politics should go then first of all tell me why secondly\nIf you are a little sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change your view on politics that is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more about results rather than just destroying the enemy\nAnd results for the American people more days where the stock market is is up more days where people are working where people get raises\nI mean across the board it's happening now and ah and meanwhile\nWhat what's the focus of the focus is all on President Trump not mocking but daring to question a Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd he did it at a rally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and do this wasn't a speech but first of all people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the president of the United states and what he had to say\nI Want to write I Wonder\nWell do you think it was it was one of them are good how did you get home\nI don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many [noise]\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know where\n[noise]\nWhere was I don't know what I Want to [noise]\n\nAnd I'm at a map flies is shattered\nOkay um [noise] look at ... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do didn't do it but is it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question judge Kavanaugh one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this was the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy does the president said what do we does he says the\nPresident was stating the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr forts testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous this entire\nHas been in disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats didn't do this the way that it should have been done and they circumvented the entire system and frankly they undermining our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted in inappropriate and this was which they've conducted themselves was\nOkay I I Believe it is with that in mind that\nCertainly the Republican base people who voted and put President Trump in the White House\nMet bases getting engaged and that's a good thing there's other reasons for having to do with the economy will speak with Stephen Moore a coming up about the future of the economy and its political\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... how many ... march thirteenth ... thousand yeah it was I'd read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing\nI had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up out of the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and saying you know it was a hundred times you know friends episode re route you know that you've already seen twenty times\nHow many times with the New York times run the story I I ... I worked on the campaign they must run three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they win one last year and now they're running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before the second point I made us look they're alleging tax fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of ... after you got the most them off\nTheir backs avoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax\nFraud when a lot of these like I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things will just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years has been funded by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason they're campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump a release of tax reforms\nI advise Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which was Thirteen they they did Thirteen thousand words\nThey don't even have you know a lot of the tax document\nMan who has you know warehouses full of ... jak document through all the businesses he's running through the ... and all but I mean I I

very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act or fix before so

progress made in this country\nPresident Trump has invited to the White House no okay would you go if he did no\nSee I don't get that as just an end to the same thing with with some of the\nUm in other words like you I I Want President Trump I Want Republicans generally to uh be a more broad based party not just to be the party of older white guys are to be a party that reaches out to everybody because otherwise we have no future\nAnd uh so why why if the president invited you would you not go to the White House\nWhere I think he's insulting condescending and and so lacking in any sensitivity or knowledge\nOf how American history you know central to American history of the story of black history\nSo when he says things like calling a black woman Omarosa a dog or calling another black woman a congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a tremendous Trump critic but he says extraordinarily low IQ\nWhen he engages in politically or you know advantageous tactics I guess with his base like saying the first black president wasn't born in this country and then he uses that\nTo elevate his profile I think this man is just about the fighting in the country about beating people racial hate and I'm not going to be in his company\n[noise] okay [noise] ... when you say that ... ... your your nose and he's going to be you don't expect that he is going to be removed from office do you\nI don't know I mean I don't know what Mueller has in terms of the Mueller probe if that's what you're talking to you\nKnow I'm I'm just talking generally he's going to be president for another two plus years two years three months\nAnd I'm OK ... during that time period and\nAnd this is a part of the the challenge and for your book and let me back up for a moment because a lot of people may not know but one you wrote a courageous book the guts you lots and lots of attacks on the left it was a book called enough the subtitle is the phony leaders\nDead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black America\nAnd what we can do about correct and one of the things you talked about was\nHaving um black leadership to talk more about achievement and a little less of a constant sense of grievance aren't aren't aren't you coming into that trap that that you yourself described in your book enough\nNo in fact I Wish that the president President Trump would celebrate the idea of black achievement in this society\nInstead of you know always talking about black people and the way he says oh you know they live in circumstances worse than Afghanistan their neighborhoods filled with violence\nAnd poverty and joblessness and bad schools I'm thinking wait a second that's your description of black American twenty Eighteen I mean right now Michael\nForty percent of black Americans on between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars an additional twelve percent between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars so you can see a majority of black America if either in the middle class or beyond this is one of the prime achievements\nOf the civil rights era in addition I say obviously the growth of black political voice in power as part of American society so these are tremendous achievement\nSo I'm all about looking at how people who were faced\nWith such disadvantage in this society slavery legal segregation ongoing racial bias and all around nonetheless had thought out the American dream and have kept it alive and and want to fix the ... you know like the Jefferson slogan they want to move on up right absolutely good\nStuff but this president instead he focuses on the twenty percent who who are in poverty disproportionately young people and kids often times because of broken families on the like\nAnd he makes set out to be the entirety of the black part like they're all going to mug you were going to take your job or are they going to ruin your schools I think it is just so deceitful and dangerous because again it is racially divisive\nOkay I again I I some of the same uh comments by President Trump and gestures by President Trump I've been highly critical of on this radio show a because I'm not one of those people who believes the President Trump can do nothing right or nothing I'm ... and but I\nAlso I'm a believer not\nOne of those people things President Trump can do nothing wrong and I'm not one of those people things that can do nothing right and he must be doing something right because we've covered on the air before\nThey're a bunch of polls and it's not just ... and there are six major polls that show that his approval rating in the black community has been going up\nAnd largely that's because we do have a black unemployment rate that is the lowest ever measured that people have been making the kind continuing the kind of economic progress that you're talking about right\nFirst of all the polls that you're talking about is a poll that by its own admission has too few black people polled so what you get it for a distortion the reality is with\nAnd I find that this is so troubling about\nTwo thirds of Americans think race relations or worst today under President Trump than they've been in the past you also get higher levels are getting more than fifty percent disapproving of how Trump handles race relations and the most difficult one for me to accept and I think this may surprise you Michael\nIs it forty nine percent of Americans say Trump is a racist and the reason that bothers me is\nI think it just shuts down a power station if you say something so flat we've than people think oh I'm a Trump supporter or I'm not but I don't want that I really want people\nTo think about how this country is becoming more diverse\nYou're getting greater sense of global economic and cultural mixing and how do we deal with that when you have a president who's\nSo I think the vice if on racial issues immigration\nOkay so let's let's approach that approach how other leaders can change and how the president can change to deal with this more effectively I Know what the hell do you have to lose that's the title of the new book by Juan Williams' movie right back [noise]\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee and the comics case it was in the hill and\nYou know it was very slow to come out but then there are many of the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they dismissed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then he came out so it's very similar because look at professor Ford she sent a letter to a congressman ... and it makes its way to guy and Feinstein\nAh and then her name is weak or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... doesn't think similar to me is a level that charge I don't think that anybody that\nUh you're Clarence Thomas throw on a better\nYeah but as a one there's a difference of touching the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission it was a government official and he was already a law graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh\nHas to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is ... or a character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you having done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself as a urging the choir boy he used to go to a bookish the was and then all of his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved the parties don't\nCount okay waist level if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really\nMight have been for focused ... Washington D. C. becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but ...\n... one um would you vote for ... confirmation\nNo not at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off even making all sorts of suggestions or got Clinton conspiracy theory against and the Democrats are I'm thinking wait\nA

investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what do they found well we don't exactly know nor\nAs the Republicans repeated again and again when they were resisting the idea of this extra\nFBI investigation\nWill they come up and say well we found that he's guilty as sin or we found that he is as white as the driven snow or or I shouldn't say white was innocent as the driven snow\nOr because I think it's very very tough when virtually all of the principles in this debate are white\nUh it's it's very tough to find some means of making this a racial issue but of course Democrats have been trying and trying and trying\nIt I'm\nSteve Gomez the former FBI special agent he's a wasn't special agent in charge of Los Angeles which is one of the most important bureau or offices in the country\nHe said it wasn't unusual that the FBI was not going to be in viewing Ford they were not going to be interviewing Christine Blasey Ford they're not going to be interviewing a judge Kavanaugh again I mean after all each of them spent hours\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary committee plus they have both been extensively interviewed by the staff of the Judiciary Committee apparently the um and and this by the way I think is a syndicated that judge Kavanaugh\nSpent more hours over thirty total speaking to the staff of the Judiciary Committee than any other nominee\nFor the Supreme Court or for all of the others combined\nAnd with more questions asked\nI think it's safe to say that he is the\nThe first nominee where where his drinking in a high school and college has become a serious issue by the way that was not the subject of the the FBI\nBackground investigation apparently they are speaking to Deborah Ramirez who had made those comments about his freshman year at Yale in the basement of Lawrence hall\nAnd ensure let let me speak personally for just a moment because as people know listen to the show I went to Yale once upon a time\nAnd uh I did my first year at the law school and so this was before a judge Kavanaugh or was anywhere close to the campus in New haven\nBut I ... at places like that are very tradition bound the culture doesn't change that dramatically\nAnd is it the idea that drinking\nIs a very big deal for a lot of people in college I think that's true I mean breaking news and once they're they're old Yale songs including the ... song which is very well known it became a smash hit are all about drinking\nThere are there there are lots of ah lots of references and this goes back to songs dating to the nineteenth century\nAnd I I Will say that does that mean that everybody gets drunk all the time\nNo I I I was thinking about it and I\nI didn't drink and college sorry um I Wish I could say I didn't look I turned out okay and where at least I think I did um but no I um I I did not imbibe I didn't like the taste of beer at that time\nAnd a and most of the people that I knew\nSort of and I write about this and right turns when I talk a little bit about my years ago\nAnd part of what happened is in the late sixties\nThere was a transition and people who have been very obsessed with beer became very obsessed with pot\nWhich I felt was more obnoxious I mean really more obnoxious because people made us so squeezed a religious thing of it with no flashing strobe light and oh man oh wow this is so amazing\nAnd I don't really think that anybody no not right\nHave it all or not members of the ... not\nNot anybody or had the idea that drinking beer was a path to light and\nUh I Know I don't think that was the case so maybe it's the University of North Carolina they've just published and this is part of the very needed role of a free press there's a website That's published some photos including photos of Christine Blasey Ford\nDuring\nHer years in Chapel Hill and University of North Carolina\nAnd showing her as something of a party girl there is a statement is covered now in the New York times today\nThe New York times not just Fox News it's the New York times is covering the allegations by her former live in boyfriend who\nSays that all of this stuff about how she was traumatized they were dating for ... years they knew each other casualty averse to they were dating for six years between Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he says a number of unpleasant things abound a Dr Blass Z Ford now is that off limits well he's still ...\nQuestioning her credibility for instance on the stuff that she was afraid of flying and that's why she couldn't make it to the hearings to testify earlier when it was very obvious to everybody that well this is nonsense they they asked her\nRachel Miller asked her about her flying and she said oh no I'm not really afraid of flying so why did you tell that to the committee and doesn't this go to the issue of credibility\nAll all of this stuff it seems to me that if you are going to come forward about something that happened too long ago from what you feel you have never ever ever recovered\nWell do you have to expect that there will be some pushback and um [noise] that was the way the New York times highlights their story ah Christine\nBlasey Ford's credibility under new attack by Senate Republicans but a includes the following the former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that she witnessed personally Dr Blass Z helping a friend prepare for a possible polygraph examination contradicting her testimony under oath\nDr Blass Z a psychology professor from California who also goes by are married name Ford was asked during the hearing whether she'd ever given tickets or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test she answered never\nLet the former boyfriend whose name was redacted from a copy of a sworn statement provided\nTo the Judiciary Committee\nSaid that when they were together in the late Nineteen Ninety she saw Dr Blass a use her understanding of psychology to assist her roommate of the time\nMonica el McLean before interviews for possible position positions with the FBI or the U.S attorney's office that might require her to take a lie detector test\nQuote I witnessed Dr Ford helped Micheline prepare for a potential polygraph exam man said in a statement Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs work and help me clean become familiar in less nervous about the exam\nMeanwhile ms ... who is a former FBI agent denied the assertion today\nShe says I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else very me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam might have taken it any time okay so here's a disagreement\nDo we know who to believe you know\nDo we know who to believe between a doctor Ford and judge Kavanaugh well we're going to find out a little bit more about the other witnesses and yes she identified it was Dr Ford who came up with a name BJ's mice\nAnd um [noise] a Kaiser Leland Kaiser her good friend who says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so she couldn't have been at that party Brett Kavanaugh was in fact that that party\nAnd then mark judge
