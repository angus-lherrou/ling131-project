managed to hold the house and hold the Senate it doesn't do any good for the country when the other side is just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre\nWe will get to that with Governor Jindal and I also want to speak to you about the proposition of revolution and\nCivil war their voices on the left and on the right to say we're in the midst of a civil war or a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed but when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left\nAnd Thomas Friedman in the New York times on the left\nTo people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying yeah civil wars here we're on the verge of fighting here is ah what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN about why he believes were in the midst of a civil war listen\nBut I think one thing we need to understand is the larger context of all of this and that is that we are in a coal civil war in this country a than these two events\nAre both lower investigation and the Kavanaugh nomination are almost a the the Gettysburg and and the the the\nAbsolutely essential battles of this cold civil war both the Democrats and the Republicans unfortunately uh own understand that and are exploiting their\nUh instead of having two parties committed to finding out the truth in these two important matters we are now into serious tribalism ear\nOkay Gettysburg and anti them\nGettysburg over the three day battle there were over fifty thousand casualties me fifty thousand a Antietam bloodiest single day in American history there were twenty five thousand casualties in a single days battle and by the way\nBoth of those battles for people who know your civil war history\nAnd I know a bunch of you to do both of those battles resulted in the union successfully turning back an invasion by Robert The late Robert ... in\nThe south in the army of northern Virginia had invaded uh Maryland and we're headed toward Philadelphia and maybe Washington DC\nIn the Eighteen sixty two in September of Eighteen sixty two when anti them occurred the union stopped them ... by the way and that's part of the story in my book the American miracle and a battle of Gettysburg July of Eighteen sixty three\nAre just less than a year later another invasion of the north this time of Pennsylvania by\nRobert de Leon the army of northern Virginia and again the confederates were turned back okay here's my question\nIn today's civil war if you think we're in the midst of one who's invading whom where's the invasion occurring because see that's what you had to do it Gettysburg and emptied them you had to turn back the other side\nThey were attacking your territory where is that happening in the United states right now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nThis isn't nutty stuff to me and and again it it it represents both sides I'm very glad I Want to pose this to our to our website over at national\nReview there is a a very useful piece by Jay cops who explains why Alexander Hamilton could be the best source\nOf why we are not in the midst of some kind of civil war and now look\nOne of the points and Victor Davis Hanson makes and and uh VH who is a a fellow at the Hoover Institution and Stanford and who have been privileged to me and I'm very glad he's been a guest on this show he's a brilliant historian\nAnd the one point that he makes that I think is worth considering is that the reason he believes we are headed toward real civil war in this country is because unlike previous eras in which there were very very grave divides in the United states I just saw this new movie called first man\nWhich uh with rock star break tumbling we went out and and saw that film last night and it's a terrific film by the way it will be reviewing coming up\nBut the the the point about that era of the Nineteen\nSixties and all of the terrible divisions that that wrapped the country and there was actual bloodshed and riots and destruction and all of that\nBut it wasn't geographical it wasn't so clearly delineated no there was one of the things that the civil war people say is that California should secede\nOr by the way they're a ton of people who don't live in California who would say bravo go for it or send California with its thirty eight million people and uh let them go elsewhere by the way\nHere's an interesting thing and I would just we're just having this discussion over the weekend that at our Sabbath table\nWhich is that if you look at the numbers without California not only does Trump when a genuine electoral college landslide but Trump would actually won the popular vote by over a million and a half\nHillary's three million vote margin\nWas provided entirely by California and it's just California's different from the rest of the country getting used to be it is now a and and by the way it part of the idea of ... different states seceding Massachusetts in New York maybe to\nA nut Connecticut not yet but uh okay so you have a non continuous country or they can all be independent countries there's a new revival up in Canada because of the true though administration of people calling for Quebec to be a separate country so why not\nLook I'm not serious about that and for the same reasons that Alexander Hamilton would argue in federalist number eleven a number of twelve\nHamilton says we are by nature one country because we're financially integrated with one another\nWe're making money on one another we are not separated\nOr in a meaningful way we're we're going to make war on one another because we're all financially and injure locked we we had a story like that yesterday\nWhere there was a bar here in Seattle ... and a group of college Republicans over at the University of Washington had said they wanted to celebrate\nThe victory for Brett Kavanaugh by staging of beers with Brett party at this um at this particular bar\nAnd the bar responded to those plans by posting something on their website saying we try to be totally non political\nWe don't want to be involved in politics at all and therefore are the people who want to stage eight beers with Brett or for Brett\nParty or not really welcome okay\nThere was talk that they were going to sue the bar 'cause you can't discriminate in the city of Seattle based upon\nPolitical point of view and a cooler heads prevail then instead of suing they just went in and had their celebration they weren't thrown out their money was still good\nAh they didn't insist on everybody putting on a magnet half they didn't insist upon a heck during are bothering the other clients they had their party and maybe there are some other people who are literally crying in their beer about Kavanaugh's confirmation is fine but meanwhile\nThe reason ... did not make a federal case over there just because they wanted to make some money that's a very good motivation now you could ask\nAnd this is a very profound question\nSo what happened with the civil war\nWhy was it that these cells in the north ... were financially integrated the answers they weren't that financially integrated the south had a completely different economic system in the south\nNearly half the labor force was slaves\nAnd everything in the south in terms of criminal law in terms of religion in terms of politics in terms of the economy was based on defending the institution of slavery\nAnd that was the brutal reality it was profoundly different in a way that California I'm Sorry is not that different from Texas\nIf you disagree and you think we are in the midst of a civil war well I'll I'll give you some citations from people who agree with you and we can talk about it they're also one of the ... civil war it was rather against brother low right now there's a congressional race\nWhereas brother against brother and sister will tell you about it and more coming up on them in that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nTwenty

can you think of one law that either a justice Kavanaugh is\nGoing to shore up or a law that he's going to strike down where he's going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nOh what I signed a law start there don't act equal rights I'm it\nWell that's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and that's\nWhere the fourteenth amendment constitution guarantees every citizen regardless of color\nOr national origin regard as the equal protection of the law\nRight and let me go ahead\nAnd that was the question that we're looking at all that kind of figure out what's going on I watch it\nYeah but when you ... what what what laws do you think right now concentrate power in the hands of white males\nAnd your name one because that would be unconstitutional\nLaw regarding equal a woman's right\nThat that's been in the last in Nineteen sixty three right but that's not being put minutes of fame there's a lot of course is of course it is if I Know I look Melvin if I dared\nTo uh offer a different salary for someone based on his or gender alone\nOr if I Would be struck with a lawsuit so fast and they have lawsuits like this all the time but the the point is and this doesn't mean that there aren't cases where sometimes people are opposed to hiring men by the way\nThere are cases where people are a whole post hiring men in some way they're imposed hiring women but the idea that this this gender gap in terms of pay is because of discrimination it has been answered so many times Lenny suggest you go to the website of Christina hot summers\nAre a woman by the way who's written about this so persuasively and and the idea that right now this is a problem for our world will get into that a little bit more close to two thirds of all graduates of four year colleges and universities in America are female and ah I suspect\nThat by the time my granddaughter is twenty one's right which is a little while

even with Trump is president\nAnd it is not true that Governor Perry said the Texas ... should secede when Obama was president President a and this kind of talk I notice entertaining\nGoing on one of

your show it's always great to talk to you and your audience as well\nAppreciate it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number when you say make so much sense in other words just to give people a flavor of what you're saying\nYou were Democrats Democrats you write can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nThey can defend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions they can fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods and lifestyle\nIf all of that is possible why do you think the Democratic party seems to be moving\nAnd the other direction\nOh my God I think this is really an important moment\nFor the Democratic party and they have to decide are they going to listen to their own extreme base or are they going to try to become and remain a mainstream political party in the United states now look at my list those and other policy positions that they're certainly not going to appeal to conservative Republicans like me and I suspect many of your listeners\nI think by by trying to come to the middle of the Democratic party can actually recapture some of those voters who voted for Trump who weren't consistent traditional Republican voter or\nThey can make the decision they want to become angrier and even more radicalized ... and they look they really have a choice if they pursue things like trying to impeach president proper trying to teach\nBrett Kavanaugh they insist on open borders they insist on abolishing ice or Medicare for all\nThose are great talking points and excite the base and they can raise a lot of money from George Soros and folks like that\nBut I don't think they're gonna win a lot of elections I I think that if anything there to help the President Trump wins reelection I think the worst thing they can do is to continue to go to the far left but I think they've got a choice to make do they want to come back in the middle or they want to continue to be the angry far left party\nOkay ... one of the things and I heard this a a theory from a friend of mine is a long time activist in in Republican affair she has a theory that what the Democrats are trying to do is to go so far to the less\nThan a there has to be set up a middle parties somewhere that would run some kind of quote bipartisan ticket\nAnd uh they feel that that that kind of middle party with a celebrity taking the middle would take enough votes away from President Trump to ah to\nGive Democrats victories in two thousand twenty what do you think\nI I think that if they decide if that's their plan President Trump can start measuring the drapes already\nI mean I was well planned on being an office\nFor another six years the reality is\nThat there is at least thirty five forty percent of voters they're going to stick with President Trump matter what he has shown that time and time again he had those voters in the primary against running against several Republican candidate he had a vote or a through his highs and lows with campaign against Hillary Clinton any that voters\nDrives entire two years is the reality is look the Democratic party should stop focusing obsessing with President Trump for the Republican Party they should come up with the real solutions to the problems that are\nConcerning the American people if they continue to go to extremes you know the problem that the Democratic party has right now is that they're trying they're trying to persuade anybody they're simply trying to fight and motivate\nThe most liberal members of their base\nAnd they practically given up on the middle class working class voters\nThat so famously went for President Trump now these are not always reliable Republican voters Republican Party cannot get complacent we don't own these voters they're not going to be loyal voters but they will vote for President Trump and they will vote for\nRepublican officeholders as long as they continue to deliver so as long as you got to cut taxes and cut regulations he's done what he promised they move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem is\nStanding with Israel and the international stage he's defending their Second Amendment rights is defending the religious liberty right these pointing conservative judges\nSo you know these are the voters that will go and fall and vote for leaders that are actually going to do what they promised they were gonna do President Trump is done if the Democratic party really wants to win back the blue collar voters many of them are union voters and many of them living in the heartland in between those two cos if they really want to get back those voters\nHave got to stop the the crazy rhetoric they've got to stop the extreme policies I'm not optimistic they'll do that but I I wanted to leave lay out the choice that the party faces\nYou can already see the Democratic candidates they're gearing up to run for president twenty twenty they're already trying to run that they're competing to see who can go further to the left and their policy positions are becoming even more radical but one simple example you listed as a few examples\nThey can be for multiculturalism that doesn't mean they have to reject faith or traditional values from the public square\nOr patriotism for that matter ... right\nThat they've almost made it into a ... for some reason the Democratic party think that's a winning issue to put down that the American flag or or put down patriotism are being proud of being an American and I just don't think that's a winning formula to be being a majority party in this country\nBy the way that's one of the reasons I think is so important that Ted Cruz wins this race in Texas because ... is really bad the entire farm on his support of a kneeling during\nThe national anthem for pro football players and ... again ... this whole idea\nThat we can have American is Haitian uh I mean you're you're a child of immigrants and my mother was an immigrant to this country and I'm One of the things that's great about most immigrant families is patriotism love of country loving America\nBut the Democrats by running against that\nUh it it's it's a disaster let me give you a challenge governor Jindal which is that I Would you write a balance of democratic\nParty I Know a lot of our critics there are a lot of people on the left to say it's even more true about the Republican Party they've gone so far to the right they lost the mental they've given up on the middle or what do you say to people like that\nOh look I think a couple of things I think both parties are absolutely guilty of thinking they're permanent majorities and I hate us in the column and the reality of the voter always have to remind them unfortunately if you think about the middle east everybody remembers\nWho hurt them yesterday and they would they want to get their avenge tomorrow and in both parties are certainly guilty of that\nBut just look at the Kavanaugh hearings as a great counter example look Brett Kavanaugh was not the most conservative justice that the president could have nominated he he's a fairly moderate establishment figure a Republican now I Am not a moderate ... between the two parties\nYeah law graduate yell undergraduate or graduate you know he went to a very good schools worked in the Bush administration\nAnd even before the allegations came out against him he looked at the Democratic history on existing extreme reaction\nAnd I think what you see it as you see that the regime overreaction from the left I I Would argue that look certainly there are folks in both parties that that go to extremes\nBut I think when you look at what the president is actually done in terms of cutting taxes cutting regulation in terms of the growth we're seeing the American economy\nThis is what a majority of the American people want it you know the the reason he won election and this is a very important point he didn't say one thing get elected and do something else everything that drives the Democrats crazy about President Trump yeah absolutely promised on the election trail he was going to do these things\nAnd that's why he won the reality of it is not that voters or you know the fact that Trump voters are disappointed in him or what he's done they're actually getting what he promised them on the campaign trail so\nBut I I think the Democratic party has got a fundamental choice I think part of the problem is that when you look at the activist base you look at the donor base\nThey will punish Democrats that want to compromise you know look at the Democratic party already made up their minds and cabinet before the hearing started they they tore person on that committee ... almost every one of the months ago came out and said they were going to oppose them\nAnd I think they're trying to appeal to the most liberal donors most liberal activists\nWhat they forget that was that's not where most American voters are most American voters don't want to abolish ice most American voter don't think that the police are across the board you know out\nThere trying to hurt innocent people most American voters want to stand for the ... the American flag and most American voters are to your point patriots I'm reminded when asked President Obama about you know he did he think America was accept Sean and remember that Canada wishy washy Andrea\nHe said yes we're exceptional the same way that Greeks increases exceptional and Brits think Britain as ... as an exceptional in other words we're not\nA but I'll tell you is exceptionally Bobby Jindal his piece Democrats trying some self restraint adjusts appeared in the wall Street Journal and it's terrific a governor I Know you have to run we will look forward to talking to you next time\nAnd we will be right back on self restraint and politics on the men that show with your calls [noise]\nYou an author I have been in this place for many many years\n... one of the promos that ... that comes on ... on your show in Houston it talks about war it's all about we're in a war\nAnd so and if ... if you're listening to talk to you\nCall so we're talking about how the war we're having with the ...\nI I think as as you know I I agree with you that does happen and I think it's unfortunate and I don't think you will hear that rhetoric on this show because I think it's wrong I don't think this is a war I and I'll tell you why David and I've said this many times of the goal of a war is to destroy the enemy\nTo kill him basically and uh the\nThe goal of politics is to persuade people\nMichael is this your friends who it is so don't know I'm a yeah OK you particularly don't see it but if your friends who for people who you are\nOkay you know what are you probably have some friends who have some strange ideas to right\nThat's right [laughter] wait a minute wait a minute what about ... or or\nNot my friend I I'll probably vote for him but he's not a foreign them are\nOkay well we'll vote for him a because again if you do that you're encouraging this leftward drift of the Democratic party David ... I'd like to sit down I imagine that you and I would find a lot that we would agree on and by the way I Do agree with your basic point that's why I went to your call first is\nBecause I think it is true that this tendency also exists on the Republican side but I'll tell you what was very refreshing to me and I think it's one of the most important speeches in recent years when Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor\nEvery word she said about a justice capital was measured it was balanced it was persuasive it was none of this rhetoric is the other side is all wrong and we're All right\nAnd this is the basic point because even if you leave out the independent voters the people who vote regularly and they go back and forth to Republicans and Democrats\nThe biggest group of prospective voters in America the people who don't vote at all\nWorn interested the people who represent this uh\nDaniel Tosh oh who are dumb as blank and don't vote and don't pay attention to try to get people to pay attention\nIt it doesn't work to say that we're on the verge of Armageddon and and we're all getting ready to\nKill each other when it actually works better seems to me saying well we have some good ideas about how we can change things for the better and in the midst of a big down day on Wall street today in a horrible horrible hurricane about the strike the panhandle in Florida\nMaybe we

were\nUm posted on V. contact which is um the Russian equivalent of Facebook and this is just\nOne of those things where when people talking about America and a civil war the reason they are so

so that we can get some I told you so rights when they end up losing their dream of taking over the house because if they take over the house this way with this kind of political appeal\nIt will be incredibly bad for the country or I mean you could say well it will ensure that President Trump gets re elected a because the Democrats will be so so hateful\nBut then we have two years to go through

B. bridger morning on the same alone show on a um ...\nMoment vigil was Michael methods marvel with malice making media machinist\n... Michael ...\nLet me make something very clear about something and I just said in response to a caller uh\nI Do not believe that there is a significant presence of Nazis or Ku Klux klansmen or people of that nature on the American right and I believe you probably can find more crazy anti American Left is at least somewhat more or who were present on the American left\nIn other words I I think that ... at the moment is more of a threat to the American political system and certainly to our educational system in our university system than is the American Nazi Party or white supremacists or area nations or any of those people however\nThe same principle obtains it is completely unfair and unjustified\nFor people to regularly tried to associate Republicans with some of those creeps in Charlottesville who were marching around um ... carrying torches and with Nazi paraphernalia Nazi symbols\nAnd uh that's not representative of the mainstream of the conservative movement\nIs also completely untrue that the thugs who wear black ski masks and smash windows and beat people up who recently were by the way attacking motorists in Portland to protest justice Kavanaugh Portland, Oregon they were doing that\nThey plan to do it by scaring\nBy basically suggesting that if you reelect Republican\nMajorities in the house and in the Senate then combined with the Trump Administration there will be a nightmare crack down on female rights by the way if you think this is a either a good political strategy or that there's even a little corner of this that is true\nOr you can give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nWhat is astonishing to me is that since President Trump was elected which is going on two years ago roughly telling on two years ago and in those two years the hysteria\nAbout the loss of women rights of women being forced back into the kitchen and when and being forced back into chains of women no longer owning their bodies of basic women's dignity in life being taken away it's all gotten so far out of control\nI mentioned before on the show in fact I mentioned several times but now there's there's all kinds of new evidence that I find very very amusing\nI'd mentioned that the tendency for these nightmare visions of a sexist future a patriarchal future with all women rights race and that's the popularity of The Handmaid's tale hamlet sales written in Nineteen eighty five\nWhere conservatives really were riding high I mean Reagan had just gotten elected a and reelected reelected with forty nine of fifty states so Margaret Atwood writes this idiotic book and it says it's a little lame book it's lousy it's not even good to read as fiction but the the vision of the book of course as people know now because of the great\nSuccess of the TV series is that the Christian right has taken over a country that used to be America is now closed gilly ad and basically has taken away all the rights to women women are now property they basically now are owned by men and owned by the government\nAnd okay that was bad enough in eight Nineteen eighty five what sense does that make\nIn two thousand and Eighteen\nWell the point is The Handmaid's tale is only the beginning there's another book that I called your attention to a cold Vioxx\n\nWhich is a a book basically\nThat suggests that in the future of women are are going to be forced to be docile forced to be obedient and not allowed to talk\nThey're fitted by a dictatorial government with little bracelets that administer increasingly severe electric shocks if those women\nDare to speak more than a hundred words at a time uh-huh why why are people reading this stuff okay\nWe've got my intention was this morning the New York times there's actually an excellent piece by Alexandra alter but I I don't think she wrote a tongue in cheek\nBut she could have\nShe starts out by this way by by talking about the situation in a new popular novel it's supposed to be a classic right\nA desert island three sisters have been raised in isolation sequestered from an outbreak that's causing women to fall ill to protect themselves from toxins which men can transmit to women the sisters undergo cleansing rituals that includes simulating\nDrowning drinking salt water and exposing themselves to extreme heat and called\nAbove all they are taught to avoid all contact with men always a good lesson\nTo uh our wives and daughters right\nThe water cure which comes out in the United states in a couple of weeks was long listed off course for the man Booker Prize and joins a growing wave of female centered\nScience fiction\nFuturistic works that raise unfortunate questions uncomfortable questions about pervasive gender inequality massage any

looks like she's about fourteen years old by the way\nShe lives in London she says I felt like I didn't need to invent a disaster because it was already a disaster happening\nWhat's that disaster happening right now when really what is it where is it where\nWomen's rights being denied\nMost of these new dystopian stories writes in New York Times take place in the future but channel the anger and the anxieties are the present moment when women and men are like are grappling with shifting gender roles and the messy continuing aftermath of the\nHash tag me too movement they're lending edit

was adopted into the award winning television series and you see the people dressing in the costumes of The Handmaid's tale all over as part of these protests let me tell you about another one of these books\nBecause I think it's kind of amusing\nWhat better way to force somebody into submission than to take away the one thing that makes him human language like The Handmaid's tale several
