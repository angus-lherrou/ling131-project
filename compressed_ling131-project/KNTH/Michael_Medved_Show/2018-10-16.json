I Know that you're finished that was finished the thing of the ... really interesting okay because what they basically want is they want a mathematical equation to explain where our universe come from\nIf our universe can be shown to be a reasonably probable outcome of what they call the quantum wave equation are quite ... corn way function\nThen they think they will have explained the universe but\nOne of them are a student proponents of quantum cosmology Alexander ... said well wait a minute math were saying that math is basically producing material universe but he says math is something that exists in a mind or we therefore saying that all the material universe there's actually a mind\nAnd that's not a very congenial a conclusion because it's basically a materialistic Lee inspired cosmology the other thing that's really strange is that in order to solve the equation that gives you a universal wave function out which our universe might be a reasonably probable outcome\nThe the the a theoretical physicist has to impose were called boundary constraints on the degrees of mathematical freedom of this equation which is actually in hurting information into the map to get the outcome they want so they're actually modeling the need an unexplained infusion of information to get to universal even if you get mad or out of math\nYou you still can't get the information needed to produce the universe for the anyway you can't get around a man in the beginning was the word so go on on the big bang yeah yeah so there's there's a number of these materialistic cosmology that are trying to circumvent\nThe clear an obvious implication of the big bang which is that the universe ... the material universe a physical universe had a definite beginning in time space matter and energy hocking in ten rows approve this with something called the singularity there I'm In the late sixties there's been an additional proof of this called the board goose the Lincoln Theater him\nAnd the citizens and cosmologists have been going crazy trying to ... tried to find a way to circumvent this conclusion hawking himself worked on circumventing his own proof\nHe was the originator of this cosmological idea that crosses popularized\nBut it doesn't really work for the reasons I specified and then there's another version of this where they want a it's called the inflationary cosmology were have one big bang after another big bang after another big bang it was mainly designed to circumvent the problem of the fine tuning of the universe\nBut what what would the odd a irony of that whole effort is that the mechanism by which you would get the multiple big banks itself has to be exquisitely fine tuned to tend to die\nAnyway there's no evidence for and there's no evidence is your incite released the cosmological models asked that it in a multi verse are far greater leaps of faith and we believe in God made right\nI gave a talk on this the other night here in Southern California and I remember the thing from Alice in wonderland says six impossible things before breakfast yeah well the the the the these natural cosmology force you to posit multiple uh abstract explanatory entities ... ton feels ...\nShut up energy strings multi dimensions of space to explain the very on the one God would explained\nOn energy field for them to\nThe dentist Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nVisit him in Seventy be answered whether losing Michel might have been out of your way into\nDennis Prager here for ... at American federal rare coin and bullying for years I've been recommending precious metal dealers but I wasn't sure where to turn when I wanted to make a change their mind your own portfolio strategy so I reached out to my good friend Michael ... he's been personally working with Nick ... at American\nFederal for years and I couldn't be happier with Michael's recommendation I was able to speak and work directly with American federals owner in ...

[noise]\nA a would be the United states senator a Democrat of course\nI didn't say and it's on\nRadio and it's on tape and you can hear it oh she did say that it was fine she had no problem with people going over to Afghanistan and fighting with the Taliban\nThat's against people like the opponents of this particular would be senator we'll talk about that race will talk about another race where a democratic campaign to re elected US Senator has just about collapsed and with it perhaps\nThe Fort Lauren hopes of the Democrats to capture the U.S Senate and meanwhile the house races very very much\nUp for grabs and are there is every attempt to try to use everything at hand right now this is like a bar fight and that's what happens in the last couple of weeks of the campaign that's why people talk about October surprises a because people will grab hold of anything of a\nBottle or a chair or a ... anything that you can find an ashtray and you throw it near her let me see what hurts and you see what steaks that's the stage of the campaign were in and what that means is that even when there is a gruesome assassination\nOf a a Saudi journalist and by the way he's not an American citizen he was living in the United states he had come to it we're talking about Jamal coast Chevy\nI and I'm not even sure how you pronounce this in proper Arabic I'd always thought it was ... but a lot of people are saying ... ...\nBut whichever way he's was chopped up into a lot of different pieces and his body apparently was brought back to Saudi Arabia is not a nice thing it's a terrible thing that had happened and if you listen to CNN who's to blame\nLove Trump of course why I'm Brian Steltzner was on with Fred Hyatt on CNN and this is what Brian Steltzner had to say\nTo lure someone to a consulate to December the body and take it back to Saudi but it is a crime of a different caliber ah I Wonder if you look at what's happened the last five days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric\nNot just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders has anything to do with anything at all\nOkay what what are the Trump's rhetoric\nHas to do with the actions of Saudi Arabia a yes we are aligned with Saudi Arabia and yes we need to be there's a powerful piece by Walter Russell Mead the wall Street Journal today\nThat make that case but the attempt to blame the killing of this Muslim Brotherhood affiliated journalists\nTo attempt to blame that killing on President Trump or on his rhetoric is it's just absurd\nOf the people who listen to Trump's rhetoric and share it when he takes on fake news or not and murderers and they are by and large not Saudi Arabian ah meanwhile this was the response from Fred Hi it on CNN too uh that charge\nIn a case like this with important through on the actual crime a ticket focus on the actual criminal and you know of the Washington Post were very focused thing we've got to get the facts and then there has to be accountability and there has to be consequences\nI think there is a larger picture which was also fair to look at which is that a dictators around the world feel emboldened when you have proven reaching out to Britain to poison his enemies when you have China\nReaching out to Hong Kong and elsewhere to kidnap people they perceived to be their enemies\nAnd went in each case is proposing enemies are peaceful ah you know or people who have done absolutely nothing wrong or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think is happening\nIn part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nOkay that's fair enough I mean the idea that there should be no us retreat and you need to establish norms and rules of law by the way of course they forgot about North Korea is North Korean our good buddy you may remember\nThat I'm Kim Jong London um it it also abroad had his half brother um murdered\nBecause he might be dissenting from the regime\nLook this is one of those things that there is obvious concern about and this bipartisan and it should be a Lindsey Graham who's become one of the strongest supporters for the administration in the United States Senate\nHad a had this to say on Fox and friends about the ...\nI Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it who's ... he's the thirty three year old ... soon jumped him over other people he's the son of the fifth in king\nAnd I think he's on a on a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us for that what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longer this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to have in their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate this guy is a wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered in a conflict in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it I feel used and abused I was on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good allied there's a difference between a country an individual thing NBS figure\nIs to me toxic he can never be a world leader on the world and what does the president did thank us up to the president but what I Would do I know what I'm going to do on fashion the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYou know we deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended\nThey have nothing but contempt for U.S foreign would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his tainted your country and painted himself while you're\nOkay this is probably not the right approach frankly because you have a situation in the country where the crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nOr is are in power because his father is old an ailing and uh I'm not sure that there is a power structure in place in Saudi Arabia that can simply replace him right now\nAnd there's a fine piece in the wall Street Journal and I mentioned by Walter Russell Mead the headline is don't ditch Riyadh and a fit of righteousness\nAnd he makes the point that we have to deal with these people and\nI I don't think anybody would say that we shouldn't go forward with some kind of a deal with Kim Jong on which remains one of the most promising a diplomatic initiatives of the Trump Administration so far\nI nor should we simply write all Saudi Arabia or there is breaking news the Washington Post is reporting that um that President Trump spoke directly to the crown prince to Mohammed bin Salman apparently he was together\nThe crown prince was meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and they may have handed or the phone he was on the phone with President Trump to a mum had been Solomon and according to present the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened in the house on turkey\nAny promises answers shortly ... disappearance\nA secretary of state Pompeo press the Saudi leaders to move quickly with a transparent investigation of the disappearance of democracy hoagie and yes it sounds like a truly awful business he he comes into the consulate\nBecause he wants to get papers he needs so that he can get married his fiance is waiting in the car outside now he's never came out of that council it or at least he never came out in one piece\nThey brought in a an expert with a bone saw they brought in an expert in autopsies they apparently packaged the various little pieces of his body and sent them back to Saudi Arabia\nThis is a bad thing is it ... ... fans even the norms of state misbehavior but then again\nMohammed bin Salman has a um a a real problem also with a with the policy that's going on in Yemen and the I\nGuess the Saudis are basically looking out for the American for American interests and standing up against the Iranians were the ones who would really stand to gain if there was some kind of big break between the United states and Saudi Arabia which I emphatically hope there won't be\nBut something has to be done with a show of arresting people who were behind this killing and making it clear that is not approved of or authorized by the government one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you remember may remember that\nUm last year the Saudis kidnapped the or whether they arrested\nThe Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri [noise] that was a disaster they also have this failed diplomatic confrontation with cops are which was a disaster we need a stable productive and strong Saudi Arabia but we also need a stable productive and strong US government\nAlec Baldwin says we need to overthrow it how why we'll get to it coming up [noise]\nOK doesn't that sound a little bit like a conspiracy theory\nWell it is now there's a history on this dinner this was originally called the Jefferson Jackson day dinner\nAnd named after the two founders as it used to be told of the Democratic party Thomas Jefferson\nWho started the Democratic Republican Party and then Andrew Jackson who started the modern Democratic Party\nProblem with those two guys they were both slave owners and big time slave owners hundreds of flights so they changed the last year the name of the Jefferson Jackson day party to another illiterate of name\nIt became the Kennedy Clinton day dinner\nOkay that's a little bit of a problem and hash tag me to do you think that I Know Hillary says that President Clinton had no abuse of power he was pure and does the driven snow but you think that\nJohn Kennedy and Bill Clinton each have a a little bit of a problem and the view of feminist by the way feminist had a very very important anniversary they celebrated we will get to that\nUm so what are they change it to I mean what democratic region of our Lyndon Johnson they they have Lyndon Johnson on tape using the N. word\nA bronco Obama is still a little bit too recent and especially if you call the bronco rama day and you don't have Obama there so I let him that he didn't come see you know what they did it the Eleanor Roosevelt there\nI'm Eleanor Roosevelt never got elected anything she was very bright lady um she was a I can you imagine because you can't do Kennedy Clinton you can't do Jefferson Jackson\nThe Eleanor Roosevelt said dinner maybe maybe they could make it the um Pocahontas dinner in the future\nAlthough actually now the the entire nickname for Senator Elizabeth Warren\nOr who is up there in New England the entire nickname should go back to what it originally was I mean the the the nickname that she was given was ... ... that's ... phony as an essay you X and a President Trump\nShould apply that name to her very directly\nThis is one thing that she has accomplished something amazing here she really has the United the country United the country in ... against first\nWhy is that well you just have to listen to some of the responses and why it is that President Trump should not must not have heard of that million dollars which the wall Street Journal strange but he says he should pay will get to that and more with your calls coming up on the ...

supposed to be as assumed to be\nA secure he's running head in the polls by more than ten points is an incumbent democratic senator this is not supposed to be in play he's running against congressman Lou Barletta\nWho um\nWas hoping to run a strong challenge and maybe eight eight truly over the top and disgusting ad by Senator Casey will actually end up helping the Republican challenger here is the way that adds sounded on Pennsylvania TV\nTwin daughters were for when they got sick there are no words to describe the terror we saw when doctors and they both had cancer and her whole world

alike model that they hired is a this road is taking off a jacket that says I don't care do you I don't really care do you just like the jacket did she wore apparently in one of her\nGoodwill trips but she took it off and before that uh the the entire thing the notion that that the attacks should be profoundly personal\nAnd a nonstop has also\nWell it's it's ... it's been reflected in a very very tight and very bitter Senate race in Arizona now there's a Senate race where the Democrats had been ahead but the outstanding Republican Congress men a congresswoman or\nWho's um name is Martha McSally\nHas actually made a big comeback has gained ground and in the debate with her democratic opponent was also congresswoman Christians cinema I'll make Sally made a fairly sensational charge at the end of the debate listen\nHe said it was okay for Americans\nHave joined the Taliban to fight All right I mean we're we're a at a time and we have to look at our wedding we apologize to the veterans\nMe for saying it isn't it true Martha has chosen to run a campaign like the one you're seeing right now it's forcing maintaining and ridiculous attacks and swearing my campaign and say this trying to cut cut cut and not share the full picture\nOkay this is a ridiculous and two\nThousand and three at the height of the Afghan war uh yes it's true Christian cinema at the time was a Green Party activist and was way out there on the left with anti war campaign or didn't say she was on the air with a libertarian\nTalk shows they lose at all I Want what if I went over and I wanted to fight\nFor the Taliban she's that'd be fine with me no objection if fighting for the Taliban against your own country is committed treason and what I think is sickening is the way that the moderator and the debate that they just had a basically cut off more of a mix Sally was making an important point\nBecause right now Christians cinema is posing as oh she's so moderate she gets along with everybody she's far far left\nTo I mean way out there to the left for instance listen to the way that she referred a to Arizona in some of her past comments and will and then the montage ends with a comment that she made about fighting with the Taliban listen\nAnd they started a laboratory that democracy and then my Arizona is clearly the meth lab [noise]\n\nAnd I hate that line someone and they have run it but I'm happy I feel and it's all the time\nThey are going to find the cattle ... century cotton and wine and there's a lightning in our brains are remaining money I mean I think the all crazy [laughter]\nMean as an individual I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go there or not you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban that I'm saying it's personal decision and I am\nFine she says I don't care if you go do that now she was already a public figure at that point and the entire notion she's running against\nAn air force colonel and of course I'm Martha McSally the Republican nominee is somebody who was fought for her country she is a top fighter pilot female fighter pilot\nAnd uh she will be an outstanding US Senator outstanding US Senator she's well qualified she won in the primary against the likes of Sheriff Joe Arpaio income trailed Kelly Ward and I'm Glad she won\nBut it it's very very crucial that she when this election and that are we not be complicit in a

because very often they've shown that different companies do different tests\nAnd they come out with wildly different results that's even why Elizabeth Warren had several different tests taken here\nAnd all of them show like most Americans the overwhelming majority of the European Americans and by the way also the over ... Wellman majority of African Americans there is a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth Warren's family\nBut the best case analysis for her the idea that she has one sixty fourth Native American means that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four great\nGreat great great grandparents who may have been Cherokee\nShe says family lore suggested the entire thing was a ridiculous claim to begin with\nAnd wouldn't it be better for her if she just backed off that no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be what does she thinking\nWhy is this a good idea\nIt makes her look ridiculous and make sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that because for goodness sake\nIf you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with a tribe no one in your whole family within memory is ever affiliated with the tribe you've never gone to India and events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the Native American community\nAnd ah then when you get hired at Penn or Harvard you put down that your ethnicity is Native American because that\nQualifies you as a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad\nNow is it the end of the world no it's not the end of the world but she is making at the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up and she chose to do this thing this would be a good idea or does she really saying she should get the million dollars that President Trump by the way did not promise here is what that\nIs based on where a that's number three they're under Warren audio Jeremy where where President Trump makes the original offer to Senator Warren he's doing a rally in Montana\nOr over the summer listen\nCharity\nIf you take a test that shows your your [noise]\nOkay and it shows you're an Indian right but the uh\n... that whole idea shows urine Indian means that you would be accepted by some kind of try and there is no try in the country the ... someone with one sixty fourth Indian blood as an Indian\nAnd they do require you to be in a rural member of any tried to actually show that yes you have a personal history\nThat has involved you or someone in your family or someone in your background\nShe has none of that and so she can't\nCollect the million dollars in the wall Street Journal is wrong and that the um of Wall Street journal and they should tell you what their editorials said and why I think they are wrong and seriously wrong about this it's bad or they basically suggests that Trump would look good if he just paid or the money\nAnd I'm here here's what the what they say in a their editorial they say write the check Donald you'll look\nGracious and you'll have them using talking points photograph it will last the entire two thousand twenty campaign she says I'm miss Warren now says Mr Trump should make good on his post to write a million dollar check to charity of ms Warren proved she had Native American blood he\nDidn't say she had to prove jihad Native American a bloody said she had to show she was an Indian and that's right and if he doesn't do this he's ...\nWhat you call in and give her right or an Indian better I'm as Lindsey Graham actually spoke on that she was willing to uh he's going forward with his own DNA test and he's going to out Native American Elizabeth Warren here's what Senator Graham and to say\nWas before and if she could be anywhere from sixty four to one thousand Native American you have a challenge I'm going to take a DNA test all have you have I've been told them our grandmother was far Cherokee Indian it may all be just talk\nBut you got to find out in a couple of weeks ago so I'm going to take this new are going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be rebuilt here this is my ... this is reality and say why anyone I just I'm dying to know why you know I didn't really think much about it but she's less than one tenth of one percent\nI think I can Vader I think I can beat her to Peter with us for a million dollars from the president to not want a casino enemy about\nOkay he wants a casino and a million bucks uh I've I've I've good luck with that Lindsey or by the way can you imagine how are the headlines and some of the more left leaning papers was South Carolina senator says he wants to beat\nHis colleague from Massachusetts are abusing woman again really ... by the way it does this have anything at all to do with feminism or hash tag me too if you think it does you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six looks the one thing that a Senator Warren I think established\nIs a really bringing Americans together and a news busters put together a collage showing the way that major networks including some that are usually reliably liberal reacted to this Elizabeth Warren ploy\nThe Cherokee Nation criticize Warren's announcement saying that are you sort of being a test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage\n... people questioning whether this revelation really did when her at any point for ... this is the reason it's controversial when she was at Harvard law school and when she was at the University of Pennsylvania ... represented herself and Native American shape contributed to a Native American cookbook\nCalled powwow chow\nCherokee\nThe Cherokee Nation called the president's attacks Doris it but it's also criticizing Warren thing she is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage adding a DNA test is useless current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person the ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nIn the video war and says she respects the difference between family history and tribal affiliation I'm not enrolled in and try to only trying to determine tribal citizenship\nHuh [laughter] oh boy\nOh boy is right I mean really what was the lives of more and thinking and what is her side of\nThis is there a sign of this\nNot that I see a there was a um Cherokee Nation secretary of state and yes it is a separate nation officially a was on CNN with Jake Tapper and ... junior had this to say\nThe problem with the DNA test as it it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're\nRelated to somebody who live long ago that may have lived there in North and South American maybe in a native peoples of those continents um it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common than we have some legal basis for citizenship that\nWe determine consistent with federal trainees\nJust holy unhelpful for any national later to cling to DNA to determine the artist tablet set their Native American in this country\nAnd by the way it doesn't really established require DNA there is a very famous American and he's a featured character in my book the American miracle\nName Sam Houston and Sam Houston was an official member of the Cherokee tribe why not because\nHe was born that way but because he went and they live with the Cherokees and he worked with them and he was adopted by a local chief and he learned the language and he was deeply involved themselves a Senator Warren and your free time after you lose your presidential race\nMaybe could explore your post Cherokee heritage of one one thousand and twenty fourth maybe from an ancestor two hundred and fifty years ago we will get to that issue and more with your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six we'll be right back\nMy pillow was known for his specialty buy one get one free don't you might be a little dog dog\nPam I I Will say that President Trump has told outright lies things that he knows not to be true because he's been told but where is there an outright lie here on this issue\n[noise] I you know he said find out if you have I don't know exactly what he said\nBut let me ... he said he oh sorry that million dollar let Pammy way I Am wanted let me let me play it for\nYou okay I just wanted to be fair here listen to what President Trump said here's President Trump's original offered over Elizabeth Warren ...\nIf you take the test of the shows your your [noise]\nOkay is it shows you are an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world in the country\nWould accept her as an Indian based upon this DNA test that shows that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who was in India that's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm from ... in your color and uh and the previous hour said Trump that brought us down to the gutter he really had and I mean you guys I I just saw\nAn age limit my buddy you let me ask you\nThis okay do you think that is honorable or for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] no I don't think she should have done that I look at it it was trivial and he shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what Trump calls out women he called he said Dr for it doesn't matter and she was lying or not we want and what do you want it that's all he cares about winning he doesn't care who he dumped bond\nOkay look I I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on this show I think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who has made accusations of intimate kind against him\nTo attacker is horse face and they put that in a tweet today\nUm it's probably we probably reached a point in our world where ... if you're going to be attacking a female you can attack or the way President Trump is attacking was with Warren but don't attack or looks I think we can agree on that and Pam I appreciate your calling\nMe and carrying enough about the show to actually call even\nWith a complaint the point is that the fact that a Trump or a can a\nOccasionally makes mistakes I Would never say he can do

I think Democrats are going to mess themselves over by trying to do that the American people don't want an impeachment crisis\nAnd and you have\nDemocrats now will promised that if they take the house they're going to try to impeach President Trump they're going to trial and preach justice Kavanaugh aren't really\nThat helps the country how it doesn't at all and it's absurd\nLet's go to Doug in Houston Doug you're on the Michael ...\nMichael McCaul event [noise] yeah I think that should be some money I'm he made it\nMade a statement and the statements that ... million dollars it proved that she was an Indian yeah she was one one thousand twenty fourth and the answer should pay about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm I'm sure you've done the math but the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now\nIn the URL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany this is something you'll find out about the ... movie uh they used to count someone who's Jewish who was eligible for execution liquidation if you had one sixteenth\nA Jewish background now she doesn't close to that\nOne sixteenth Jewish background means what does it it means a great great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years\nAnd it's absurd she cannot prove that she's in Indian she cannot show that she's in India and therefore I think it would be wrong for President Trump to even pay the one thousand one one thousand and twenty fourth of it\nAppreciate your call and and your sentiments Sean San Diego you're on the Michael Mann that show\n[noise] [noise] yeah you made um you've had a comment earlier and question whether it was racist or not or their

president to call her ... or some other African American or\nAn entire no but if if he were calling if he were calling somebody who was falsely claim and like for Rachel dollars on\nYou remember Rachel dollars all who pretended to be back black yeah\nOK it would probably not be received well in the Pocahontas thing hasn't been received well but if the calls are Rachel dollars all Harriet Tubman\nOr if he called or by the name of some black hero 'cause Pocahontas was not a bad person she was a good person she is somebody who's remembered fondly in American history for goodness sake if you look at that Disney movie\nOh she paints with all the colors in the when I I I Do not understand why when President Trump's whole point about\nElizabeth Warren\nIs that she's a phony that it's insulting for him to use the name of a one of the most famous Native Americans in our history\nOr to make fun of her now do I think he should save he's going to say it at all I should say folk ... which is how the thing yeah\nYeah I think that would probably be better uh here's the way the President Trump responded yesterday to the ...

was asked about the ethics making news that Elizabeth Warren just might be as much Indiana's one sixty fourth with a great great great great grandfather who may have been Cherokee here's the president's reaction went off\nA moment okay there are tons\nOf angry women out there and right now in the media mind they are led by Hillary Rodham\nClinton again that went well or an by Elizabeth Warren yeah that's going well and here's my basic question\nAside from the personalities of some of these angry women there's a new book and I haven't read it but it just amazes me that they publish a book and think this is going to really speak to this moment in our history has by someone named Rebecca Traister\nAnd it's called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nUh-huh\nOh what is the power of women's anger and what's the purpose of that women's anger let's say for justice for the sake of argument and I'm Serious I Will let you express this please\nLet's say that this record number of women who are running for office on the Democratic side there's also record numbers winning running on the Republican side but leave that alone for a moment let's say all these angry democratic women\nWin and they come sweeping into Congress what's gonna happen next\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six how will it make America better how will that enrich our life as a nation or one of the points that Gerald science make in his column today most Street Journal\nIn that is each it's more likely not is it that\nThere will be a divided outcome in this election says look it's possible that the Republicans will hold on in the house and they'll definitely hold on the Senate\nAnd and yes that's possible it's also possible in the sun likely but it's possible that the Democrats will make the house that they could easily do and take this and that that's going to be much harder for them\nBut the most likely outcome is that the Republicans hold the Senate probably adding to our set majority and or the Democrats takes housing narrowly\nSo what does that look my ... year old Syed says is that looks like\nAnd even more divided America even more bitterness even more\nConstant nonsense about the end of the world and if this happens then we can go on and this was the end of America as we know it more apocalyptic\nInsanity the American people really want that if you're voting for the angry women now they're ... let me just give you some\nFlavor of this this is the way that this new book good and mad has written about\nOr is this the Meyer says uh has\nIts lassie partners ... Myers says in USA Today as America grapples with the hash tag me too movement tidal wave Rebecca Traister his new book good and mad the revolution in power of women's anger\nServes as an amen sister venting session that's what we need a vending Sasha and you can do vending session right here one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Traister hits\nPause on current events to explain what's fueling the rage\nAnd she assures the reader that it's okay to be angry and the book starts out by talking about a blank not a bank a blank what is a blank a blank is also known as a which is bridal it was a Muslim\nTorture device from the Fifteen hundreds put on women's jaws to prevent them from talking\n\nThe or they were used as a book that talks about a blank isn't going to mince words red hot emotions sheep from the plaques type on the page you can practically hear Traister striking each letter on our keyboard\nLike a permit GIF okay\nSounds like a lot of fun it's just a just a great deal of fun and just like Hillary when uh she was on TV I interviewed on CBS and she was interviewed about uh bringing up to date\nHer approach to a a abuse of power in a sexual arena listen what role\nIf any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct\nNone no no no well I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side\nAs he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House\nIn terms of today have said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now [laughter] now and there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut I can get us where the investigation of the current incumbent against whom numerous allegations have been made\nAnd which have dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and as I Believe came out in the right place\nIt it came out in the right place showing that the president was guilty of lying and obstructing justice\nBut people should really read Ken's stars book is this book is called contempt and by the way it gives the light of what Hillary says she did nothing to demean the character of the president's accuser she did a great deal she did a great deal to demean the character of Ken Starr\nWho was a special counsel was a former federal judge who is an honorable and decent and patriotic individual\nDo you remember the term vast right wing conspiracy she kept saying up to the very very end up to the final DNA test and know that DNA test came out much more conclusively\nThe lives of this war as it has to do with a blue dress in something on that blue dress you may recall\nUp until that DNA test came out she was absolutely convinced the bill was as pure as the driven snow an innocent as he could be and this was all a vast right wing conspiracy it was um the ultimate conspiracy theory\nOf ... what what is she doing for her claws here actually on MSNBC on the Morning Joe show maker Brzezinski talked about this and then Joe Scarborough chimed in and listen\nDemocrats than than the last few days talking about bill and Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren plans for twenty twenty [noise] are\nThey missing the methods they had a critical midterm yes they are either but it will guide twenty two days to sell me two days so I don't know me from Hillary right now talking about\nMonica Lewinsky thing and adults at the age of twenty two when she was taken advantage of that you knew very severe ...\nPoint of what to think of it they don't come after me to play this is not what the democratic ...\nDown okay go to the phone banks boy you're way from blenders in your kitchen call the Democratic voters don't hurt the cause of\nGermany was in reference to blenders in your kitchen is that I mean drinking something or is putting your hand in a blender to destroy I don't know what what is that\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Trevor Noah I'm who doesn't generally make fun of the left I felt they had to hear listen\n... investigation of the current income than known all have very [noise]\nOh I'm Sorry Mary look here's a thing that's all cool maybe it was different in the nineties but today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the presidents of the United states right I forget internal president with anyone as a power imbalance personal bomb attacks to me I have trouble you\nSmash he'd be like I don't know if you're watching the game and I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that [noise] I also don't cause him to return to deflect and make this about Trump like you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Hilary especially when you look for these sitting in a glass house [noise]\nOkay this is is truly a strange to have the Democrats\nLeading into the final weeks of the election with\nI'm angry women Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton Christian cinema\nReally those should be the standard bearers and by the way there's a governor's race down in Oregon where they're\nReally could be a big Republican surprised not just because ... is a good candidate but because Kate Brown the incumbent governor has tons of her own problems or we will be right back with more on what angry women can and will achieve we'll be right back [noise]\nAre just like to point out that one of the most well known facts of male female sexual dynamics is that\nWomen tend to be attracted to powerful men [noise] uh and not so much the other direction by the way men don't necessarily [laughter] aren't necessarily attracted to our for women so if you want to invalidate the [noise] you know those kinds of relationships there could be\nEven angrier more frustrated women than the one who wrote the book you mentioned\nWhat is it I think the problem in in the abuse of power the abuse of power was not only\nIn terms of pursuing their relationship which has certainly Monica Lewinsky was very enthusiastic about there's no question about it\nBut uh was in concealing their relationship and a a hitting back at a great number of people and by the way using federal resources it's it's so astonishing\nThat right now people on the left I mean I Know on cable TV all morning they've been dealing with\nPresident Trump's angry reaction to Stormy Daniels that entire matter as embarrassing and tawdry as it may be\nInvolved the time before President Trump was in the White House long before\nAnd uh does that mean that it's utterly irrelevant no I mean there there are ongoing legal action some of which by the way has been dismissed out that Stormy Daniels defamation\nSuit has been dismissed\nShe can't sue President Trump for saying that she's not telling the truth let us go to Lou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the ...\nOkay Hi Michael I'm Out when you're talking about the anger thing there's there's two points I Want to make is one is that depression and there's always angry and so the response it gives an angry response to something\nAnd then the only way to respond is with that same kind of anger it makes sense right that's the way he communicates the second point\nI Want to make is that um when has a one have there been things against a man or against you know\nThere's things against women that
