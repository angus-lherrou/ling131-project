{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "All I gave me ... producer yeah could be who knows\nHow the Democrats so overplay their hand oh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party has been completely taken over by the not clash and the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been a back then sure entire life is kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems\nAnd the irony is that with all of sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general is a co chaired a Democrat this is\nWhy you do when I have some conservative talk about the need to move it's all a conspiracy and so I uh against or conservative and they cited a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with a public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC when it's on their ...\nWhether it's Charlie would look at the whole ... rose and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are for urban kicked out are liberal Democrats there because they are in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who are naturally it could be the same in your state capital if you have a capital where the Democrats are in control\nThan the sexual harassment by going to be mainly\nDemocrats not only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges or what is in jail for another reason as well just in for the Democrats keep getting up\nAnd you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there are a while I Can't stand Al Franken the personally it is and it's politics there he probably shouldn't have left to set it because he was groping some woman's behind because I'm not saying what he did was right or whatever but but if they want to have that standard fine because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold there so\nThat gets to my point and everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence will this road they've gone down\nWell not so I just this whole process you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years there including Democrats or where to go forward and said you know there's a reason why we have ... limitation this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school and other than a than a Senator Feinstein was it was a person of of the principal\nShe would have dismissed us things that I Can't do you think something happened in high school and and you know what what do we have nowadays is\nEverything is considering the same level as rape or a you know and and but\nIt's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and this makes it an unwelcome workplace\nSo we in effect had the effect of ... the real serious stuff of rape and all these these are putting everything on the same class what about Senator Feinstein that this is the way she wants to go out and the end of her career and and all her so well remembered how she got in in Nineteen Ninety two she was watch along with Barbara Boxer and so called year you're the one woman there were boxer defeated\nResearch just enraged Bruce surgeons in her dear old friend of mine there\nAnd Sean mentioned Feinstein was seen as modern only by comparison to a colleague Barbara Boxer all your national leaders\nOf the national scene these two people directly boxer was most pernicious there and so uh you know Senator Feinstein should be ... ... we're we're retired and she's saying I remember as a six year term or are there and so these people just never want to leave the national stage\nAs Sean I wanted to ask both of you will Kavanaugh yet be confirmed do we agree\nNow I ... ... ... no doubt Ninety eight percent sure uh and that's been largely depending what called the FBI finds look there's another finding too I welcome the FBI or a asking people questions on their own one big reason most people that are going to be asking her accusers\nAnd if the accusers lie to the FBI centered Bradley and Lindsey Graham of both said they need to be prosecuted and I think I think for herself was going to be under serious scrutiny when she has a statement of the day she has makes great inconsistencies under the suggests strongly that a U.S federal prosecutors actually ... anybody\nOne thing and this was when I realized when they hear the ... century FBI stuck with the way an FBI close works at that level as you fill out a form I forget the number of cars I filled out and I just don't or at three hundred dollars you know it but yeah and you fill out the form\nAnd you lift people so suppose I listed Sean steals a friend of mine there which I Would have the bad judgment of doing to me it was they were called valley but then they go to Sean and he says all these nice things about me and then they say well you know anybody else who knows\nA A R ... well I Know Sam and they take them to go to those people and they say some nice things about me\nAnd they say well gee you know anybody else and they keep going till they finally find somebody who is this something negative I felt at six FBI clearances where they've gone to this we're done and seeing all these levels there and still to come up with something there he's probably ... you can get ...\nYou know I think we've given our listeners hope they start out very angry and you I think you've helped us I think you've given them

picked up a few California seats that figuring that'll get them into the house do absolutely\nAnd again I think everybody listening should understand that a few seats literally could make the difference it's possible that one party could end up controlling the house like two or three seats\nSo let me share with you some of the discussions I've already had with people than my goal is to have further discussions with you one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you know the number one eight hundred nine five five one seven seven six go ahead and get in line now you might as well I have a feeling it's going to be a a a a a an active three hours\nBecause and ever since a sort of the middle of the talk show day friday\nOr all kinds of things have busted out and we need to talk about all of them so why don't we take them in sort of chronological order and uh and I have questions for you and uh just less just share thoughts and see where we all are because\nThis this is not just\nA confirmation hearing any more [noise] this is not just a battle like the ones we've had in the past contentious things like that though the slander of Robert Bork by Ted Kennedy in Nineteen eighty seven be at the battle for Clarence Thomas or just a short period of time there after that was of course accessible [noise]\nUh but when the Supreme Court is a very very big deal in the battles over it or a big deal\nAnd the moment Brett Kavanaugh was named as President Trump's election I knew I was in ... in support of his nomination because I Want constitutional is on the high court uh I I was thrilled to have Gorsuch that was a replacement\nFor the late Antonin Scalia a V. Anthony Kennedy vacancy it was\nA kind of a fifty fifty Justice Kennedy a lot of rulings are came down on what side of the bed he woke up on and and he's been replaced by a solid\nConstitutional list which is a a a wonderful thing and and now we have a situation in which ah\nWith with with Kavanaugh here comes another constitution list and there is no way in the world\nThere there is no way that the today's left is going to allow a another constitutional list I'm On the court flood of people said they didn't get this bad for Gorsuch Gorsuch somehow made it in what seems like a walk on the beach now compared to today's standards and and\nBecause they'll give you one\nYou know there is that old precepts that when you win that election you've you've heard this a million times elections have consequences right and they do that's why ... knows Morocco bombers electrified consequences and one of those consequences or Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nOn on the Supreme Court two constitutions shaping judicial tyrants because that's what you're going to get when Democrats main people at the Supreme Court but but it was Lindsey Graham said in that magnificent Thursday or\nA moment of his ... said that as as as he said as the Democrats at us as as he said to uh to judge Kavanaugh when you get on the court when you see something you sort of minor in Atlanta Kagan you tell them Lindsay said hello\nBecause I voted for them and I would never do that and what these people are trying to do for you I still what are we in four days later after that Lindsey Graham moments\nI I've I rarely them as a\nI I may have leapt to my feet sharing I'm Glad I wasn't driving because I it was it was so magnificent it brought such moral clarity and moral clarity is what we need moving forward in this crazy week this crazy week\nA week made necessary by Jeff Flake and we're going to talk about him in a minute in fact we're going to hear from him in a minute but that he is at some\nEvent in Boston some radio station is doing something\nAnd he was just a it in one and they have an interviewer was asking him a bunch of things and since you know Jeff Flake runs the world now I guess we'd better probably\nYou know figure out what to what the oracle says in believe these days but the moral necessity of this is something that I Am addressing in a town hall dot com column that uh that will rub tomorrow and that is that this is not just a a Supreme Court battle\nAnymore this this is not just a victory that we should seek a because we wanted constitutional list on the Supreme Court this is\nA moral assessed city because it's not just about him reaching the court anymore these kinds of tactics these kinds of things that you've seen\nThese these ... speckled bottom feeding\nTactics by today's left from actual senators to cartoonist stew column writers to two pundits to people all walks of left his life\nThey can't they simply cannot win they simply can not\nWhen they have dash against the rocks\nThe basic precepts of jurisprudence and not even jurisprudence thinking about a couple of contracts innocent until proven guilty that's not just all that's not a law school precepts that's not something that's just a courtroom ideal innocent until proven guilty\nHe's a basic human decency and it's what you were forty anybody who's accused of anything same thing with requiring evidence\nAn allegation is made well what's the evidence that's the first question you don't accept an allegation on face value this believe women saying\nIt is a scam it it is political bullying Jeff Flake was bullied him that elevator and and and folded like a skinny seventh grader on the playground and and we're now in this needless weaker FBI probe\nWhat's the latest hang on the White House has authorized the FBI to expand its investigation interviewing anybody it seems to edit it deems necessary as long as the review is finished\nBy the end of the way oh did you hear any bugs today that the FBI I don't know what kind of leakage is going on there imagined that an FBI lake but there was buzz earlier today that the FBI it might be ready to wrap this up like tomorrow\n[noise] okay whenever you got till friday you got till friday that is what grand ... Jeff Flake told us a last friday as you know how old are you can have my vote you'll have it in committee but you could only had it in the full Senate\nAfter a week of of further probes and and look the best case scenario the best case scenario is that this week\nGives a frozen Boehner to the Democrats who are demanding it\nCreates a comfort zone to ideologically vague people like Jeff Flake provides a ... I Would say cover ... provide comfort for the Republican votes of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski\nAnd maybe here's where cover comes in and maybe it provides cover for some Democrats who I think we want to vote for Kavanaugh I think they want to not because they like him anymore than Cory Booker does but because they really need to wind up\nAs you know there are dead you know Democrats famously running\nIn states that Trump won and won big Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and these are people they don't just want to vote for judge 'cause they probably don't want to vote for judge Kavanaugh but they need to vote for judge Kavanaugh 'cause I'll tell you right now\nIf Joe Manchin votes for judge Kavanaugh he takes a big bite out of Patrick Morsi's attack on him Patrick Morrisey is the west Virginia attorney general he's a magnificent man\nI think he's gonna win and that and that that would be fantastic so just be a wonderful thing to Patrick Morrisey be the senator from West Virginia and set of Joe Manchin Joe ...\nJoe Manchin is one of those Democrats who does not make your teeth sketch\nAh he's a left of center you know big labor but just socially conservative sort of tired of sometimes West Virginia guy and I know that territory very well as the first place I ever worked in radio backed forty some years ago\nAnd and loved it than love it now um love it so much that I Want them to have a conservative centered [laughter] so let's so let's go Patrick Morrisey and Patrick ... right now\nI like ... him to vote for a for cabinet which mansion may do\nAnd this week of FBI foolishness\nMay give them cover and so if we get to the end of this week in the deck is cleared\nAnd the nonsense as as as old as all played out and we have a successful full Senate vote on Kavanaugh is confirmed it will have all been worth it right it will have all been worth\nIt but first we've got to get there first of all that but I just said\nTo actually happen and it may not be it really may not have you met today's last have you seen these people have you seen what they do have you heard what they do\nThey will move heaven and earth to prevent this not not just this nomination their goal is to stretch this to the election or wind back the house so they can impeach Trump and when the Senate so that even if he they they don't impeach him which they won't\nAh you'll never get another nominee on the court\n'cause when you boil it all down is all about making sure that they're sacrament of abortion\nIs untouched that's what this whole thing has always been about you know that right if not I'll help you out with that [noise] so um\nFor some of the lowest things have happened over these last few days I'm gonna share them with you because my my gut thought is some folks may overplay their hand Mark Davis in for my comment that happy Monday\nIs Jeff Flake job and I and and by the way I'm not trying to turn them into Ted Cruz her turn him and to me this is what a responsible Jeff Flake ought to have done at that occasion ma'am I I Am so sorry for anything\nThat happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm open to your experience and you have every prayer and every good wish for healing and ... that's all I have to say about your experience your victimization I have exactly to the proper deference that anybody\nShould have for that however\nWhen you identify judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone that is simply not been born out in the fact it may in some investigation may play out but next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote needs to be based on what the evidence shows\nAnd what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me no matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I got a got that's how it goes on but it didn't sense now we have this week of hell but\nWait a minute on that wait a minute on that what is this week going to do\nWe're together today and tomorrow I'm enormously grateful to once again the talk show God's you're smiling a Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday of course in and moving on a permit [noise] by the time we get Wednesday Thursday Friday was friday being just opposed a deadline for this entire FBI dog and pony show\nI I think there's a possibility here because as bleak as it may look and as a twist it off as I Am about a ... doing during this week you realize we are talking about today's left right we are talking about today's Democratic Party right\nI I think the air hangs thick with possibilities that they make overplay their hand so profoundly\n... they may reveal such a deep by guide hatred\nAnd the things they say and they do and I'm not I'm Talking about a cartoonist columnist and United States senators and everybody in between\nThat the pendulum of empathy may swing toward judge Kavanaugh has millions of Americans just a good grief enough enough this man has suffered\nEnough then there is still no\nOf the type of wrongdoing that originally created this problem for him\nI think by friday that may be the landscape I pray that it is okay nothing a year I'm earning let's uh let's have you on TALK back to the one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six

on Jane number one of the month of October Mark Davis in from Michael welcome welcome I'll come\nSo there is a it's been a busy busy day like made me a date it's not but President Trump had a big news conference a that was mostly about trade issues and it's just funny ... baby we can wage this in today maybe tomorrow a because as a conservative I'm sketchy on tariffs\nIs they're not my favorite thing but I just finished arguing with the results sometime it's just these countries are falling into line as as as President Trump tosses out all these sharp elbows cherish next thing you know here we are signing a big old deal with Canada and Mexico was worth a trillion dollars\nIt it it seems tremendous so there there was a lot of of Trump Audie\nIt's MORNING here was one of my favorite part and he was talking about Kavanaugh and talking about past alcohol use something he knows by his own admission nothing about so play this and then I have a question afterward go\nSays he didn't lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull his if I don't think he did\nHere's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't trust [noise]\nWhatever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I'd be I'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing\nBy the time we get to friday will it just be an unholy matched the nomination dashed against the locks or the death of a thousand cuts complete I I pray not I certainly hope with every ... bone in my body that I Hope that's not the case\nAnd um and maybe this is cause for some optimism because and and it sounds it it it sounds\nMaybe a little snarky and I don't mean it too\nBecause I think their recent events that they kind of backup what I'm about to say and that is that today's left today's Democratic Party may overplay its hand so ...\n... by the time we get to friday a whole lot of Americans and maybe more than a few senators are just going to be saying enough\nIs enough there's nothing new here\nWe've had the entire week the FBI probe that everybody was raining us to do okay we did it are you happy now\nThe answer of course for many will be no of course they're not going to be happy now some people will never be happy because you know exactly what the game is delay delay delay attack attack\nAttack a lot of people who said we just want to we just take it to friday and next week are going to be the exact same people\nWho are then going to say what's not enough it is an artificial deadline I mean why in the world where we are just trying to get a lot of fire people afraid of the truth oh my gosh you'll hear all of that garbage you'll hear all of that nonsense and so just hopefully Lindsey Graham and the quote I played last hour\nOr said look at it I think he might have heard some of what I heard a little bit of bugs to\nTurn out to the FBI might be about rapidly so they had a nice full weekend how to talk to five or six people how long does it change you know I mean how many questions you have\n\nSo uh the I don't know when the FBI is going to a set to make his findings known\nI I Will tell you I Am comfortable asserting that I have no expectation of additional damaging information this very FBI\nHas looked into a judge Kavanaugh six times dishes time number seven\nAnd so what's the likelihood oh my gosh he is a gang rape is what how did we miss that I don't think that's going to happen [noise] real quick\n[noise] you you host a talk show you'd take calls and then there's a little tape loop in your head that sometimes rolls of a previous call I Want to go back to a gentleman\nUh it was a very uh it was it was an invigorating phone call gentleman from Columbus of I I think for his call\nHis main points were Republicans don't want the truth Kavanaugh's a liar a it's all terrible and you know it did where we're just trying to get the bottom of this and it's an instruction game going on and or or a cover up going on blah blah blah so I asked him several times what\nIs the evidence what is the evidence that's a Dr Ford is telling the truth what is the as ... and saw that pesky evidence that\nThe doctor for this properly identified judge Kavanaugh has so has her attacker gentleman replied with a sentence that began\nWill judge Kavanaugh is lying dot dot dot and someone will know so that that's re stating your premise you're not telling me the evidence that he's lying you're telling me that you think he is alive I'm going to get the gentleman over the benefit of the doubt I think the idea of where he might have been going\nAnd this is a concept that I I think it's going to be heavily played this uh this week I think the gentleman's the end of his sentence would have been that he's lying about some things so maybe he's lying about others\nOkay a concept in law the juries are free if you find that that a witness if you find that a witness has indeed factually lied about one thing you may then cast whatever amount of debt you walk on everything else that witnesses said oh that could be interesting huh [noise]\nSo perhaps the gentleman's point I Want to get I Want to give him full shrift ah is is that he found judge Kavanaugh not believable on some other things\nAnd that struck him as evidence that he's lying about everything that that's far from a from a gracious interpretation but it if if it ... but it's something that the gentleman is is entitled to however here's the thing he has not caught judge capital in a\nLie about anything and nobody will no one will that precept only applies if you find that someone absolutely provable he has lied about something\nThat we have now is judge Kavanaugh talking about some drinking episodes and there are some people from his pass to go ... you might be under a play on the drinking episodes he was he was getting a little harder than he let on\nAnd then there's all this year book code language of you know the Renato on this or a loved me us as they said there's also learn to your book a ... channels trying goal and booze and this and that just so stupid\nBut here's the thing are in their ... and everybody\nStarted Googling stuff is rule I don't think you do lose the truth about that rule I think he might be soft peddling that\nWe're never going to know\nOkay we will never not this week for any wake ... ever learn the judge Kavanaugh was factually misrepresenting anything about his way word moments at Georgetown Prep\nAs such there will not arise any basis for that legal precept of if we caught July and about a and B you might have been lying about the Indy so\nWith that are in a moment a boy the the United States to be in the Senate gallery today because there's red hot Senate action actually there's not really actually there's red hot Senate talking [laughter]\nThere's no real action we're waiting for action we're trying to take action we thought we were going to take action button Jeff Flake sort of that he took action he and Chris Coons got a closet and\nAnd took action to bring the whole thing to a grinding halt thanks guys [noise]\nUm but but Chuck Schumer refers to some of exactly what I'm Talking about there but now they're moving the goalposts and it is not that there's any evidence that judge Kavanaugh\nIs is a horrible cereal sex criminal but rather they're going after going after his credibility on other stuff and you'll hear a\nSenator Schumer attempt that in a moment the one thing I said I wanted to share as the last hour of evaporated\nWas this amazing quote\nFrom a woman named Elizabeth last us I think we have rich Lowry to anchor a National Review it is an excerpt from a book that she wrote called witness for the defense\nOr she is an expert in psychology law human memory I Witness testimony I saw another article tweeted somebody in the New York times in like the year two thousand or I'll find it if if I Need to ah it was just a very compelling a essay written by a woman\nWho was raped I guess some time prior to two thousand 'cause she wrote it in two thousand and she said I I think there was a lineup identified my attacker I was one hundred percent certain that that was my attacker\nAnd I was mistaken\nAnd her courage you're talking about courage that takes courage to admit having blown call [noise] but as morally\nNecessary to be sure and uh and and you know what else can is morally and intellectually necessary for us to recognize\nThat this can happen to anybody\nTo anybody even Dr Ford so here is the excerpt from Elizabeth loft is in her book witness for the defense\nFor how can we disbelieve the sworn testimony of eyewitnesses to a crime when the witnesses are absolutely convinced that they are telling the truth why after all would they lie\nBut there's the word lie that's the word that gets us off the track you see I witnesses who point a finger at innocent defendants are not liars\nSo they genuinely believe and the truth of their testimony the face that they see before them is the face of the attacker the face of innocence has become the face of deals that's the frightening part so truly horrifying idea that our memories can be changed\nInextricably altered and what we think we know what we believe with all our hearts is not necessarily the truth\nMan that's a paragraph that as a paragraph from Elizabeth last us in her book witness for this at\nA woman with expertise in psychology law with his testimony human memory things like that I never ever ever actively believed\nThat this entire thing was a trick so dirty that they find a woman who would under oath make up stuff and intentionally why I never believed that and as I watched a doctor forge testimony on Thursday morning she you know let's let's go let's go to the\nDictionary on another word she seemed what's the word everybody uses\nBorders credible means it may it may it it ... what does it mean it means somebody who's the believable in seems believable yeah but it means more than that and we'll examine and takes more your calls and looks more audio of this busy busy day Mark Davis in from Michael in bed stick around\nI I guess I mean are they are I mean this is Saturday Saturdays this week ... I'll be friday is this week this work week you know [laughter] so do do do tease me much don't these me so a hated it when will this FBI thing ramp up I don't know so let's uh let's\nContinue to take a look at your thoughts as we had to Los Angeles Robert Mark Davis in Michael how are you sir\nYourself Hi great [noise]\nYeah I'm here to stay room just now that there's no evidence that just kind of an allied allied several times in in in that area it kept fading about what the witnesses said it didn't happen that's not what they said they said they'd never remember\nA move\nTo okay Dr forge allegations quote from judge Kavanaugh are not merely uncorroborated their refuted by the very people she says we're there you want to I guess what someone to say is that they're not understand I I and I understand completely and judge Kavanaugh pointed out the various people who have no memory of having been there\nAnd he suggests that direct ... have you know\nThat's not what he said he said\nOh the weekly stated it they have to go back and look at it that\nSays that that I'm actually I'm looking at the court right now in the quote from Dr from judge Kavanaugh Dr forwards allegations are not merely uncorroborated each refuted by the very people she says we're there and we can have a semantics game all day and semantics as important it's the meaning of words are people I\nI ...

I Know it I Know what I Know you're just mistaken but you totally believing in your heart and in your mind you're not lying you're just mistake it now\nThe intent to deceive pies that important

it a little closer to home honey [laughter]\nDoes this dress make my butler Meg see I see you understand me completely now you understand me completely about ally is something you said that you know is on true with the intent to deceive show credibility what his credibility credibility means more\nThan just presenting well credit\nA judge Kavanaugh is credible because he brought\nPassion to his testimony he's not credible because she spoke with clarity and conviction of Dr Ford is not credible because she spoke with with with conviction and she spoke with passion she spoke with when we're her own identified certainty\nYou remember do I understand it up to ... that's a thoroughly fair question I Would indeed and if you're asking me the day after or the month after I absolutely would if I sit on it for thirty some years is there a possibility that I remember the wrong person yes there is\nOkay if the parking within your family your wife right ... thank you about a man is something short years ago would you believe why right what you act like he was some kind of political a job or something\nGot you got to go to another another very another very fair question another very fair question the first thing I don't want to do is put him down and kill us over being honest with each other that too so but but to your to your actual question would I Believe her I Would listen to her love her care for her but here's the thing\nIt would be my job as just as a rational human being if she says something and let's say she is saying it about a public figure and nobody else can corroborated in any way shape or form I mean I might\nVery well just defer to her because I Love her and it's my job to support her an honor her\nBut I could not blame the world if the world remains skeptical because the world must require evidence is not allowed to religion\nIs not about whether Russell Ford believes Dr Ford is about whether we all can and without evidence we can not\nWell liked by that's your opinion and\nThe benefits that that's all that's going to do that is called the way life has to me that's the way life has to be we cannot believe people we cannot invest in people's stories with no evidence we can't you know that right we can that's a crazy world\nWell you have you gone by the world in\nA sari [laughter] that's that's a crazy crazy country it's a great how do you want to get or somebody who she is\nHow would you like it Don how would you like it if somebody did it seems some woman comes up and I don't know how to make a Twenty years ago men Donnelly points you Don trying to rape me in in in Nineteen Ninety eight I Know it I Know it and you know for all your heart that you didn't do it oh we got to believe or why why do we have to believe are done you know what\nThe problem with that in that race look bang bang\nBang you\nHave a black man that happens\nAll the time that well as much about ... ... you know what you've just made my point and you just made my point it would be unfair to believe something about you know without evidence unfair\nI'll bet another dog you might make commission or anybody else is on his mother is you might be about the unfairness of things that happen without evidence so let's all live in the best world we can where we act on facts and evidence I think that's just a just a a good idea Dr awesome thank you best everybody in Columbus go about that\nScene here too that there yeah we can do this let's roll to Tacoma wash Hey Ron Mark Davis in from Michael how are you\n\nHello Hi Ron oh\nIs that our colon you're

Louisiana's go join us live right out of the box in the next hour or so sit tight for that but meanwhile Senator Cornyn was talking about viewing all those all of this testimony through a very personal lens\nAbout how long the FBI probes going to take her there was bus I mentioned earlier making rent this thing up tomorrow that seems quake\nOr the development from the White House today was they've essentially said look\nWe're not limiting the scope of this in any way examine what ever it is you want to examine\nJust so long as you're done by friday and so there is any color which are reliably from the Democrats' side saying wait a minute why does this artificial uh a limitation on the scope and timing of the investigation ... woman your buddy Jeff Flake\nWho who established test no longer than a week\nAnd and no further than the scope of what we've been testifying about so far but in a in an environment where the goal posts are always moving and the terms are always changing lettuce heading into the United States Senate the state of Louisiana has been very very well represented of late a junior Senator John Kennedy is on the Judiciary Committee\nYou've seen a lot of hemp senior center is Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana who joined us right now what a pleasure to have you sir welcome to the Michael ... that show\nThat mark thank you for having me\nEnormous pleasure thanks for being here let me ask you the thirty thousand foot question first and then we'll we'll start to dig deep uh how how does how do you spend the weekend how did last week strike you and where do you see this drama right now Monday October first\nI was so angry last week the way the Senate Democrats sacrifice Dr Ford's confidentiality the way they abuse the approval process where instead of allowing a confidential vetting they deliberately put out this letter afterwards I was furious\nSo I went home and joy my anniversary and didn't think about it at all\n[laughter] and if you are a smart man you're a good senator and a very smart man and it was probably a very mentally healthy thing to do good for your health and good for the marriage so now we're all uh how many years may I ask\nTwenty nine well congratulations to both of you happy wife happy life is good for user so now we're back at it and I've been listening\nTo from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell to John Cornyn whoever comes after him and it seems like we're all just sort of biding time waiting to see what the FBI fines what do you think they're going to find\nI think they're going to find exactly what has already been found that Dr Ford made obviously Dr Ford has some terrible experience and she has made allegations but all for people who she says should know about it do not know about it she has a backup statement well they weren't really involved so maybe they didn't know about it\nBut at some point in our system of life not just government not to have all been like\nFor people say something didn't happen in one person says did you go with the four particularly want a man toll reputation as on line or a woman's reputation or anybody's reputation it's not about male female it's about fairness and for people said it didn't happen when she said should know that it did ah you just got to go with the four\nAnd so I think they'll be out there and\nAnd I think there'll be a vote for Kavanaugh and I think it will be approved\nCenter Bill Cassidy with us from the great state of Louisiana is there any inside buzz in the hallways about what the heck happened in that tight space with though with Jeff Flake and Chris Coons as they walked out of the hearing room the other day\nNo I don't know that um I in fact I Know they're on sixty minutes last night but I just saw them and I didn't look at it um you know I saw on the screen it was muted and I didn't use it\nUh because the reality is is that for people set it didn't happen and there was a four people alleged to be witnesses and by the way by the way it's like it's like having a lived his life and such a sterling character\nUm that that doesn't fit a pattern either and and the Dems are trying to come up with things that would suggest there is a tavern wrongdoing but frankly none of it when Michael ... is your is your spokes person you know you got you you know you got and grew to go after somebody\nYou have the quote of the day it was new did and I didn't earn muted can sense once you get another lesson in life from Senator Bill Cassidy so you have a break my piece is pretty interesting and and it seems to be that if if we got FBI probes in our minds and things we want the FBI to look at it everybody wants to investigate everything\nYou have an idea or two about something that might be investigated and that might be collusion that actually exists among Democrats to smear judge Kevin I'm\nTotally so Democrats are trying to make out like this is some sort of organic uprising of people coming out to say the judge Kavanaugh was not\nNot not credible even though the for people that they said were there set it didn't happen but there's clearly is a tactic a strategy with tactics or what you smear him you create doubt you create down there for you\nThe way they want to take back the Senate and they'd be infant Democrats at which point they would block a future Trump appointee by the way there's already a website for the woman Coney Barrett that was nominated it's stop I'm\nI'm a considered I'm Sorry I considered it stopped Coney Barrett dot com and it says Web site coming soon\nSo if you move on Trump comes up\nWith another appointee and Kavanaugh for that reason I got a point and\nThey already are preparing now this is ... this is a strategy and its fooling them and if they're trying to fool the American people that just have FBI going after people wait a second was this part of a strategy that you seek out someone to testify against\nJudge Kavanaugh did you deliberately not released a letter\nUntil after you knew you sacrifice Dr forest confidentiality that you do it as part of a tactic is part of a strategy to smear judge Kavanaugh in public as opposed to having dealt with ... let's find out\nMark you know I mean here of the American people or they're trying to see the American people that should be turned up that should be you know if you will like cast upon it\nIndy by all means if we if we got questions everybody wants to be asking all these questions we got a couple of questions we liked to have asked ourselves hey I've got a couple of remaining couple of minutes let me get greedy when he ... he was also on the Finance Committee big day of the White House I don't know about you as a conservative DNA and me means that terrorists are not usually my favorite thing\nBut do not advantages and this may be on the list of stuff to Trump's made me a believer I mean here's candidate here's Mexico saying okay we're ready to play nice now how did they strike you\nI think the president said he ran said he wanted to redo NAFTA me read it NAFTA it's warm or promises he made that he has subsequently kept\nThink NAFTA has worked well for American workers in my state we have a positive balance of trade with Mexico and with Canada um ah you told me or for taxes you go along the border with Mexico there's so much prosperity where they want was not it's\nCreated a lot of jobs for a lot of folks in my state and across the country but it didn't need to be done and the president has already done it and he's going to take care of the American worker as well as how a trade with Mexico and Canada I think it's a good thing\nHow's your what's your um crystal ball in the midterms\n[noise] you know if the if the people are focusing upon the economy and a part of the fact that President the president made promises and he kept promises that I think Republicans will do okay\nIf we're focused on things that are peripheral\nOr which of course Democrats are trying to keep a focus on things that are not in a pocket book not in the kitchen table then then we're having a tougher time so I'm hoping the American people are focusing on my gosh my life a lot better now than it was three years ago let me go with the team that brought me though that better life\nAnd finally back into the halls of the U.S and I don't know if you have a chance to run into a Joe Manchin Joe Donnelly Heidi Heitkamp strike you as the kind of people they voted for Gorsuch all three of them who might ultimately they're looking for a reason to get some cover to vote for Kavanaugh said that they don't get killed in their own home states\nI think you just I think if you're just being fair if you're just being fair you're going to say everybody Dr Ford says should be a witness so they either don't remember or that it didn't happen\nI think the FBI will find the same thing so I'm hoping Donnelly hike camp others will say they're going to vote on the behalf of fairness\nShouldn't be about electoral politics it should be about what is fair to a fellow American and this will be fair to a fellow American um after both Ford and Kevin ... so unfairly by Senate Democrats so I'm hoping they vote for fairness\nSenator and Dr Bill Cassidy of Louisiana thank you sir appreciate you being on the program a much appreciate your time have a wonderful day\nThat you mark you bet\nSenator do definitely a robot senior U.S under from uh it's kinda funny Louisiana up some ... turnover last few years 'cause he's been around since I think the twenty fourteen elections and John Kennedy was on the Judiciary Committee just been around since the last election hey speaking of Senate news do polling news bowling news\nIt we we talk about these these states Trump won big and and where you might have some folks you might really want to go ahead and vote for Kavanaugh we mentioned Manchin of West Virginia and I came to North Dakota\nDarlene Indiana going through the head of Claire McCaskill right now who in Missouri is in a statistical dead heat against her Republican challenger Missouri attorney general a great energy and a great candidate and Josh Hawley\nVery goes for forty seven forty four with the margin of error of about four points so a boy wouldn't that be a high quality get if we could storm Missouri we will see I estimate germs they're still happening in a couple of months Mark Davis in from idols sticker out much more to go\n... by seven genes Seventy six zone Michael message\nGotten to the root of our issue or the garden\nYou hear a president get there in Iraq that bad that they\nKnew who said that I was gay but maybe it's a bad cell or something but not not at all as a by by supporting President Trump's nominees because I Want justices that will interpret the constitution as written I have a feeling that if you oppose President Trump's nominees that's what's driving this whole thing you just don't want him on the court\nAnd it's about what he did a good I'm Sorry\nNot fair I wouldn't mind you they are not a cooler up under the under these conditions and I'm not I don't know K. and waiting and waiting to react whatever you want\nWell so he was okay so so the ... so the the couple of moments where he got a little too snarky those outweigh the proper indignation that he should 'cause I think a couple of moments you know you said you understood how somebody might react pretty emotionally if they're being falsely accused of something you seem to have some empathy for that\nThere's no evidence to support Dr Ford story none so when I'm getting from years you don't want to actually get the judge Kavanaugh on the court because of like thirty seconds of of conversation with two senators and they're\nNot I don't really know if you got\nIt alone raped women should carry it is\nWell I'm married by by figures were I think his record is fantastic on racial issues in women's issues because people of every race in both sexes deserve a constitution that's respected and and also I think we really just kind of disagree politically on the court and I think that's what's driving everything but I notice now you're awesome I'm Glad you're on the show God Bless you and I'm Glad you're here today\nA lot of Michael ... none of my dot com for all things uh mid late into
