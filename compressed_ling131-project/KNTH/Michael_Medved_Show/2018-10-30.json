Sinai and they're right\nThe Jews brought the aid judging God the ten commandments into the world she said that they were chosen God chose the Jewish people and people didn't laugh at it\nThe\nNotion of chosen as they either believe it or they loaded not that there are people who don't believe that don't well that's true but the historically Jews have been heated up for it because people suspected it may be true\nAnd it doesn't have anything to do with the individual Jews ... Jews are uncomfortable with this most Jews are not religious posters don't give a damn about Sinai but it doesn't matter this is this just bought the Jews represents what Israel represents\nSo this

is due to land in Pittsburgh and\nA short while to help anticipate his visit a we'll be speaking with Lou Weiss who wrote a terrific piece in the wall Street Journal yesterday he's the father of New York times writer Barry wise or he is a long time member\nWas a long time member of the tree of life synagogue which was struck by the terrorist attack\nWhat does he think\nOf the president of the United states are coming to visit\nPittsburg at a time when there are some folks including the mayor who is not Jewish by the way the mayor of Pittsburgh saying uh know may be the president should not visited there a one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six or there is so much going on in this country right now to drive us apart\nAt a time when we really ought to be trying to come together and I think that some of what is driving us apart is naked and cheap and rather ineffective politics on all sides and\nJust strange strange situation\nBecause at the same time that I think many many people feel frustrated with both sides of the political debate at the moment\nThere's evidence everywhere that the amount of interest in participation and passion with this election\nIs just Ryan Zinke and surging and may in fact set records\nAre there are elements of a recent stories that show obviously some of the worst in our country but there are also some stories that show the very best\nAnd one of those stories as it struck me and I'd like to begin with is before we talk to a little Weiss from Pittsburgh\nIt's another story about Pittsburgh and about the way that this entire nightmarish attack was handled which is very very much to the credit of some of the participants are there is a I'm\nA doctor who's the doctor and chief and in charge of the hospital to which the killer who is now being arraigned he's has twenty nine charges against him yes he faces the death penalty and I think that's appropriate the um\nThe doctor in charge of the hospital introduced himself to Robert ... hours after he was brought in wounded and treated in the hospital and uh he had um a a a a very brief word\nThat he delivered when he went in to look at the killer\nAfter he'd been treated here's what he told him he said uh I Am Dr Cohen\nAnd this after the killer had been brought into the hospital or screaming or I Want to kill all Jews I Want to kill all the Jews\nHere here is that Dr Cohen his name is Geoffrey Corn he is the president of the Allegheny General Hospital where some of the victims\nAnd the killer were treated eyes he says he when he came into the room with a killer there he asked me who I was I said I'm Dr Cohen president of the hospital and I turned around and left and the FBI agent that was guarding him said\nI don't know that I could have done that here's what Dr Jeffrey Cohen had to say\n[noise] so um [noise] I've been invited to a Steeler game\nA couple of weeks ago and my inclination was I had to get back to normal life so I went to this\nI talked to the nurse and took care of him before I went down to the game and you know I broke down and tears as to what all those men [noise] ah I went to the game and came back but I went to see the shooter and the cops was already a she looked at him\nAnd I wanted to try to understand why they do this than I have no answers I asked them sorry the only sort of Roger you said about the only guy that I introduced myself to start to roll your president of al ... journal [noise] um\nThat are left the FBI agent in charge looked at me as a ... foot of the time for a leader fully\nDeserve fall the chaos going on the gentleman didn't appear to be\nA member of a matter of society\nIt was just so the noise\nHere's the noise the boys were soldiers were being slaughtered\nThought it was time to rise up and do something\nWe would use the word saying things that we were leaving the\nDoing things like that so far to the fourth\nOkay I'm at that as a balanced inappropriate statement\nThere are too many harsh and ridiculous words some of them by the way many of them on the left we will get to that Dr Cohen a continued his comments he had this to say\nWe have one very simple mission thread alligator which will take care of sick people we don't air force so they are ... says about for so so so what do they say saucer faces so it makes a very simple\nFor our staff to do the right job so I Will tell you that I'm very proud of them cause they did a great job you have to fulfill\nIsn't that ironic that somebody who is yelling at me every once in a hospital I Want to kill all the Jews is taking care of by George or nurses Jewish hospital president of the country to check on him out\nFor and there was also the attending emergency room doctor who cared for the killer was also Jewish the nurse who cared for and his father is a rabbi and I'm\nA colon and says Dr Cohn and we just heard from is personally connected to the shooting beyond his role of the hospital he live so close to a tree of life synagogue\nThat on Saturday morning he heard the gunshots as the massacre unfolded he knew nine of the people who were killed nine of the eleven\nThat didn't stop him from going in to check on Bowers look this is America\nAnd it really is and I I was reminded of something it's not nearly so dramatic because it doesn't involve killing and shooting in horror\nButton involves part of the beautiful part\nAbout the United states of America years ago I did a book called hospital which actually was one of the most successful books I've I've done it was a big bestseller\nAnd uh it was about some of the pressures that physicians encounter and some of the problems that physicians encounter dealing with those pressures that was a profile of thirty real life medical professionals\nAnd uh when I was doing a book I I went to Pittsburgh and I was doing a TV show and I was I'm told I was going to be on the show\nWith a um a a leading expert on substance abuse who treated a lot of doctors who would come to substance abuse so I come to the TV studio\nAnd uh there is a husk Hasidic rabbi who was a sitting there and um I introduced myself\nAnd he says oh I'm I'm Dr ... and and he is uh Hasidic rabbi and he is also one of the world's leading experts on substance abuse and\nHe is in charge of psychiatry at St Francis hospital a Catholic hospital he graduated from Marquette University a Catholic university\nHe's always been Jewish she's from a prominent Hasidic dynasty I was floored because I Know there's rabbi ... from his work he's written one of the best Bible commentaries I've ever read period it's called live every day\nAnd [noise]\n... again there's something about that there's something about this story and it it actually move me to tears of today the local Muslim association\nIn Pittsburgh has announced they've raised a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars to help the people at tree of life congregation at the service that they held in Pittsburgh on Sunday\nAfter the shooting the a Muslim leaders of the community\nWere very prominently involved and given the some of the harshness between Jews and the state of Israel and and Muslims around the world this is a beautiful thing and it is a great tribute to the United states of America\nI think it's also a great tribute to the United states of America that um many people most people are going to welcome the president of the United states respectfully\nAnd with dignity and gratitude when he comes to Pittsburgh or in moments frankly we're going to be speaking to a Pittsburgh are named Lou whites\nWho was talked about some of the eternal evil aspects of what happened in his city uh we'll be right back with that and with your calls on the ...\nThe responders and community leaders the

with all of the attempts\nBy various people to make political hay out of this tragedy that the president is going to be honoring today by doing the right thing and going to Pittsburgh is Lou\n... conceded\nIf the president had decided no I'm not going to go to Pittsburgh people at random what\nYou're not going to Pittsburgh you're not acknowledging they're paying you are not doing you know\nHe's doing the right thing and now let's hope that he does it in the right way and it would certainly be appropriate if he got up and you introduced\nA\nMaybe his daughter and son in law but at

happening right now ah this was on CNN\nOr did he say to people who criticize you for opening your doors to the president at the time\nWhen I first said that the president was wealth of I've received a lot of emails to numerous accounts I Can't keep track for every email I read too if you're reading that one so I just cannot keep up with it I've received many emails that I'm\nNot happy with those words on the ... thing that saddens me as those emails also could face to face\nIt just continues in this vicious cycle hey follow getting more hateful of getting more and that's just not the solution we need to be better than us we can be better than is\nOkay he is completely correct\nAnd yeah it's it's not appropriate at this point it's always appropriate to disagree that's our fundamental American right and disagree in criticized\nBut the idea of hatred or about calling the other side of evil or a very prominent Democrat just called President Trump evil evil or it's completely out of

the tragedy on them they should just be quiet and let the president do the right thing and respect the dead I mean blaming the murders for their crime and do not bring some politicians do not agree with into it\nUh yeah and and again this is a time when even people who you made profoundly disagree with are are feeling some of the same things I mean this is one of the\nOne of the things about the nature of the shooting I have not heard anyone or not even David Duke or some of the prominent American Nazis or I even have a ... even ISIS I don't think\nHas a commended Robert Bowers for what he did and I I mean I I don't know if you've heard the story earlier Jose about um\n[noise] uh that Dr Cohen who is the president of Allegheny General Hospital who came in and introduced himself to Mr Bowers after he got out of the emergency room it's a powerful statement ah really again we're\nAll Americans are above all we're human\nBeings above all the um the the attempt to try to blame one side or the other\nIt's it's just wrong and and by the way to blame mass media for this is just wrong now having said that\nDo I think that uh there might be more attention paid by a media platform like gab\nDot com [noise] which are actually had done a lot of the posting negatively anti Semitic calling for death of Jews posting by the killer here [noise]\nYeah that that kind of thing should probably

the nation movie dot com\nOr talking about the uh\nThe on the ongoing reaction to what\nAmazingly amazingly has been designated the most deadly\nSingle attack on the Jewish community\nIn nearly four hundred years of American Jewish history Jews first came to what is today America when they came to New Amsterdam which later became New York Manhattan Island\nSixteen fifty four right I mean shortly after the Mayflower as thirty four years after the Mayflower okay\nAnd nonsense in of the political ads\nIt's gotten quite crazy [noise]\nWhy is it okay\nFor a former presidential candidate very prominent presidential candidate former U.S governor [noise]\nEnded up by the way of physicians\nAnd or somebody who should know a lot better Helen Howard Dean\nThe former Democratic national chair\nWas just on MSNBC and Governor Dean had this to say about the way he perceives the current struggle politically as a fight between good and evil listen\nClick evil lurks in the hearts of men that and it does and what Trump has tapped into is he a and eventually will overcome that because of where the Republicans are always about the past and they're always have that fear of the future\nAnd the Democrats are made plenty of mistakes but they are about the future at idealism and making America a better place I think in the end hope wins over evil but it takes a long time and it looks at\nBoth of those working humankind and that's what this struggle about from that this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\n[noise]\n\nIn a normal country that would be reason to alert the secret service the president of the United states is evil [noise]\nDoes anyone think that's acceptable one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I Know I Know they're going to be\nCloser to call in and say well Trump calls the other side of evil\nActually I spent some time yesterday\nI was trying to look that up about times that Trump had used the term evil to describe specific opponents look he uses all kinds of ... in in temperate language and I wish he would he just ah may have helped the governor of Florida when\nUh the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida when the race which I think is a shame because I wanted very much to see Ron descent as the Republican win that race but it's wrong for the president to call the mayor of Tallahassee a stone cold these\nUm any ages did that I I think the\nMayor Gillum of Tallahassee is morally compromised ethically compromise I think he has a lot of problems but this is the president of the United states you can't use that language Mr President but certainly certainly Howard Dean to save the president of the United states is\nEvil\nDo you think it's appropriate for a former Democratic national chair to use those terms one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThis is one of the problems is we have just had a demonstration of evil\nAnd there have been three\nCases very prominent cases one not as prominent as the other two\nBut it should be in which really evil was displayed\nThis a killing it's a double killings a homicide in Louisville and they have apprehended the perpetrator and in\nLieu of all there was a guy who tried on Sunday to get into a Baptist church a black Baptist church was stopped the door was locked\nHe was armed he apparently had it in mind to kill some black people and then he found two people at random track them down or killed\nA a one\nOne African American shoppers sixty nine in front of his grandchild put the gun at the back of the guys had assassinated him\nAnd then he called a black woman in the parking lot and this was a guy who was just mouthing off about the N word and\nAh and by the way it has a history of violence in the history of psychotic behavior\nFormerly married to an African American who you'd also abused by beating her and using the N word with her\nUm this is a real problem this is a very real problem\nAnd it's a real problem when you have somebody who sends out\nBombs to Fifteen people none of whom are criminals none of whom are evil but you see this\nIs the problem it is evil to try to blow somebody up because you disagree with them politically\nIt is not\nEvil to disagree with them politically sure you can express contempt or you can express dislike for George Soros or for Brock Obama or for Hillary Clinton\nThere lots and lots of people who dislike them but when you use the term evil it puts it in a different category and it simply is wrong\nAnd what Howard Dean is doing here is wrong it's also deeply wrong with Don Lemon did\nA Don Lemon\nOn CNN had\nDone this to say about the biggest terrorist threat our country faces\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group or a wanted ethnicity\nBut we keep thinking that the biggest terrified of something else some some some people who are marching you know towards the border like feminine so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest her for in this country is white man most have been radicalized brought up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know have a Muslim man there is no white guy band so when we do about that\nAs you suggest we should have a white guy ban ... would you ban white guys from doing about the white guys who work with the with CNN are they okay\nI I mean should there be no mixed dancing between white guys and other guys uh I\nI mean what what is going on\nThis is this is completely completely weird and crazy and unacceptable\nOr let us go to Deborah in Brooklyn New York Deborah you're on the Michael Mann that Joe\nHi Michael how are you today I'm very well uh\nI Love listening to your show I find your voice very soothing it's like therapy\nOh well that's my wife was a professional therapist though but go ahead\nOn there you go I uh I was a Republican uh up until now Donald Trump came along and I'm now an independent [noise] ah I I I like when you do the things you say you call it like it is I could get it at that handles I mean there's always a buck\nAnd I want to know why there's always this but he is what he is he says what he says that it seems like we say oh okay that's just Donald Trump them again so why can't you say he's evil and we why we are far so what\nDo what do you use do you think he's evil\nYes I can even evil is a strong word say yeah there is a person I Would say the things he says how we say\nWell wait they'll ... they'll have two different things there are two different things Deborah and this this goes to the heart of your challenge and I it's a great challenge I I think there are things that he says that are outrageous but speech ... in in and of itself\nTo coal speech evil if if you are saying I I order you to go out there and murder these people yes that's evil\nBut to make some stupid remark and and Trump makes a stupid embarrassing remarks virtually every day I mean it's ... and it's it's tedious after a while because when you talk about what he does what he has achieved as president you recognize as a former Republican Deborah don't you that he's had some successes as president\nYou know what yeah his way he is the way he doesn't articulate radically eloquent as nothing about and that is it a leader on line line that pregnant at the United states but it all it all against everything he does that's good because he he acts like such a total\nOh okay what would you hold on hold on for a moment of an alleged bronco Obama was extremely eloquent\nHe was almost always dignified um he spoke very well\nAnd I think he did a terrible job as president\nAs President Trump makes fun of himself frequent leg rate he has he is not eloquent or he has all the Arab world and and childish and all those things but\nNot his record on appointing judges his record even on foreign policy is record certainly on Middle East policy\nAnd his record and managing the economy\nHas been admirable don't you think but it's\nOkay so what do you care more about do you care more about what the president says or what the president does\nAs I'm very very important look what's going I think it is important thing I think it is in ... I think it is important but I Would prefer a ... and ... a president who does the right thing\nAbove a president who says the right thing\n... you know the normal American person whether they're white black they're under a lot of culture shock I call it a lot of stress in the nineties we add diversity visa than we've short corporate landscape change and when I was at Eighteen the illusion\nYou know the American what the minority at times in American lost their job and they ship and somebody and and and this has nothing to do with the synagogue shooting but I'm just saying a lot of people are

visiting a Pittsburgh he's accompanied by the first lady of the land is accompanied by around by Jeffrey Myers of uh the tree of life [noise]\nTemple that was\nConservative synagogue was attacked by\nAn evil evil gunman who of course now is in custody\nThe president's also accompanied by his daughter Ivanka and his son in law Jared Kushner uh both of whom live their lives as religious Jews\nAnd ... [noise] what is so sad and and honestly it makes me kind of bill that\nVirtually everything vis president does including things that are fine that are normal\nThat aren't necessarily brilliant are deep for profound but that just normal president things ever everything is going to be controversial and I I I just anticipate this controversy coming across I have to give you a little bit of a visual description of what happened here\nIn front of the synagogue and the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh\nThey have set up a series of memorials to\nAs the fall and to to the eleven people were killed\nWere murdered in that synagogue and people abroad flowers and\nAnd by the way President Trump a and I think probably through the influence of his daughter or maybe through his staff or a son in law who knows he knew that the Jewish tradition is that in in Judaism when you go to a\nTo honor someone at at a at a grave side um\nYou you leave a a Little Rock a pebble um sometimes it can be a larger stone but it's it's the idea that it's not something to say just on the stage there\nAnd the idea that um there's a phrase in Yiddish that that\nMeans that the the dead don't smell the flowers so ah basically that's a sign of morning and the president and the first lady and volunteer and Jarrett all brought they had a tray of of stones I Believe that secretary and the new ...\nWho was also a Jewish as secretary of treasury who lives with them [noise] okay here's here's what I Am anticipating and honestly this is a case where I Hope I'm wrong\nI'm\nThe series of Jewish stars six point and stars stars in\nDavid ... referred to as the ... the the shield of David and\nOkay that those stars have been set up an honor of the fallen here but they have been put in front of what is obviously crosses a that you would have on a temporary grave\nSide so\nWhat the president is seeing a sea seeing a Jewish star but behind that Jewish stars across\nSome idiot and it's not going to bring up a an element of controversy because what it shows is the president of the United states and the first lady very respectfully\nAnd some early or leaving their rocks on the cross bars or the cross behind the star of David\nDo I find it offensive that they used process to set up this temporary memorial this is not at the graveyard this is that the synagogue itself where the killings took place\nI think it's fine uh let let me also say\nI think it's it's a shame that controversy has erupted over a campaign stop\nIn Michigan that I'm an advice vice president Pence was involved with and and here's the background of the story and I'll do it very quickly because we have some outrageous material to get to that that really does need attention\nBut what happened with the vice president was he was campaigning for a a fine candidate named Lena Epstein\nWho is running in a a contested hotly contested congressional race to become a the first Jewish Republican woman in the house of representatives and that would be a good thing they\nWanted because the vice president was making campaign of parents to have somebody say some kind of\nA memorial prayer on behalf of the people fell in Pittsburgh and that's also very appropriate what wasn't so appropriate is Lena Epstein\nFor reasons that are completely unclear a lay now seen as a member of a Jewish congregations she's fairly active she is proudly unapologetically Jewish but she apparently selected um\n[noise] to deliver this prayer a a a Christian um who actually went to a Baptist seminary\nAnd now styles himself rabbi and he was there wearing a prayer shawl and he said this prayer in the name of a of Jesus\nAnd no it's not a good thing it it just isn't because of the people who died were not Christians they were not\nJewish Christians they were Jewish Jewish they were members conservative Jewish congregations\nAnd this is not a controversy that the vice president needs or the administration needs or anybody needs right now\nAnd uh does that mean that Lena Epstein should not be elected to Congress do of course she should be elected to Congress but it means that if if we're going to be serious about trying to build a broader base of support for this administration\nThere could have been much more care\nWith that one now meanwhile the protestors who were trying to disrupt the president's visit\nTo um\nTo Pittsburgh it's just awful\nAnd and uh uh demonstrators said Trump is fanned the flames of hating us partially responsible for this tragedy and his only making things worse by coming allergy making things worse\nAnd what does he have to do with this tragedy the the person the killer Robert Bowers hated from because he felt Trump was to surrounded by Jews\nAnother protester named Suzanne suffered a said the president's\nA visit is not something that people here want\nHe has promoted more negativity than he has support and solidarity he's fostered an administration of white supremacy and he is not welcome\nHere in our time of morning said one of the organizers I'm of the protest I look this is\nThis is all crazy and wrong there was a um a comment on uh\nThe the buzzfeed from one of the protesters who is they're trying to say to the president not to get off the plane and Pittsburgh\nAnd the protesters said uh I'm here to honor the eleven people that were lost to hatred and to send a message to Trump Lewis fanned the flames of hate and is partially responsible for this tragedy see if they repeated enough it becomes kind of a reality in people's minds\nAnd and that is is wrong and it's despicable and it it leads to to craziness an ... it it truly does I mean if someone wants to explain to me how Trump is responsible for this tragedy by a classic and I ...\nAnd and somebody who was so anti Semitic that he had totally rejected Trump\nIt's outrageous and\nIt's outrageous enough that it can lead to kind of thing that you hear from Jim Carey who used to be a talented actor\nAnd used to be a very funny comedian and now\nHe just won the Charlie Chaplin award for excellence in comedy\nAnd a here's the way he accepted it in his acceptance speech listen\n... modern times he criticized capitalism talking about drought a chance and\nThat's what we have now we have capitalism without a conscience\n... he showed the common man being fed through gears of the brutal dehumanizing industrial age he took on the American right wing of his day it's worst evils hatred of immigrants contempt for the truth greed and the abuse of power\nWe are fighting those same evils today [noise]\n\nIn America and the United kingdom across the globe and we need to be clear shameless snus is not an will never be a superpower\nIt is the mark of a villain\nKidnapping children is not what great nations do\nOkay I'm there's much more and he even dedicate this award I ... it has this I mean you're talking about a flavor of ice cream that has now been marketed as a way to resist\nPresident Trump because he couldn't resist the ice cream you should resist President Trump's somehow by eating\nA okay she ah came back and apologize to them with Jake Tapper after her original statement which we played on that show I Believe it was yesterday a and\nHere's what she originally it said that she's kind of apologizing for their here she is\nGoing to one of the folks who really wants to run on air puzzle let alone a crowd of radicalism so radicalized element of more people than I'd rather go the hard way who who\n[laughter] hot the way the way I'm\nAllowed ... away from both on them all around the way that was going on for a long line of credit [noise] minor\nOkay this is not the way he's condemned either the bomber or\nThe synagogue killer this is completely\nUnfair and and by the way that Jake Tapper was attacked for this and he's responded\nI'm somebody I'm a road in that uh this is one of the most widely responsible uninformed downright offensive things to err on CNN and that's saying something\nJake Tapper showing his true colors by refusing to put a stop to this nonsense time to label the show not the lead with Jake Tapper but the mislead with fake tapper\nAnd then Jake responded to that by saying I immediately went to moan at Sharon and David Urban to rebut it and later in the show is we just played a Julia you off he apologized and took it back well she still apologizing she was on MSNBC\nWith Chris Matthews yesterday and a talking\nI don't know which side of the issue she's on now but again talking in the idea of nationalism lesson\nLet me go to a judge Julia you know I saw it and I thought a lot about history I World war two was the turning point that was the assimilation of Catholics Jews\nDid that's when we got through the door because of all the service our fathers and grandfathers fought in that war all of them you should see the the star of David ... cemetery and all those tunes it's unbelievable\nAnd ... along with the crisis in I just thought that was the door opens but now I Wonder about certainly not universally in this country not universe yeah\nAnd it's interesting you mention World War two because when Donald Trump said that he was a national asked he didn't just off the cuff have international as he\nSaid well I have an old fashioned world word and I know I'm not supposed to say well the reason it's an old fashioned word and the reason you're not supposed to head as because national haven't let us to to World War Z and\nTens of millions of people dead and horrible horrible ways including and Holocaust so there's a reason for that stigma and handle kind of dredging that up and apply it to himself as the president of the United states has you know as we used to have the leader of the free world as frankly horrifying\nOkay is it fair to compare American nationalism to nationalism for Hitler's Germany or a\nA N puerile Japan [noise] didn't that an absurdity and utterly
