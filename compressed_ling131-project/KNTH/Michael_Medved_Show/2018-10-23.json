Pittsburgh\nAnd basically everybody is incredibly upset because last night in front of a huge crowd\nA cheering crowd that was out there to support beautiful Ted\nThat's the new name that's remember the artist formerly known as prince or the Kennedy formerly known as lion head is now a beautiful cat which is appropriate because he has worked closely and effectively with President Trump and it's good that President Trump came out to use them to support Ted Cruz in his home town\nIn any event a President Trump dropped the N. word no he did\nAnd a lot of people have suspected that this was a word he was comfortable with well\nHe said it on\nNational TV international TV and now the world has been shaken to its foundations\nAnd uh the likes of Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon and the people chrysalis are over at CNN\nOr people have basically ... down their thunder ... this is apocalyptic\nIt's the end of the world because President Trump uses the N. word no not that n word that would be serious this is actually also serious enough and then word that I'm comfortable with the N word as nationalist\nAnd someone tell me what's wrong with being a nationalist\nWind is that anyone should actually be upset about this here's what President Trump said last night in his um rally on behalf of beautiful Ted's listen\nGlobal as level as [noise]\nThat was frankly not caring about our country so much [noise]\nAnd you know what we can\nWe're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm\nOkay he's encouraging people to use that word I'm Out I'll use I'm a nationalist too I I Am and I I don't understand why people should have a problem with that word if you want to try to answer that question you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLook I um I just finished my very [laughter] lengthy too lengthy I'm afraid chapter on Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt is regularly rated as one of the greatest of all American presidents he's on Mount Rushmore\nWhen he ran for president in Nineteen twelve he called his program the new nationalism\nAnd uh that was and then and then ... Woodrow Wilson who was running against him was so ah compelled at Theodore Roosevelt campaigning on this idea of the new nationalism that he came up with his own program called the new freedom\nIn any event there is nothing wrong with the term nationalism is there but\nIf you look at the dictionary or you just Google or anything it look it up what are the synonym for nationalism here the first three Senate\nPatriotism patriotic feeling and flag waving okay is there something wrong with that I I Am not\nEntirely comfortable with President Trump using the term global as derisive Lee I don't know anyone I honestly do not know anyone who describes himself or herself as a global is um\nAnd at a a ... and ... and that's a word that's problematic that that's but that's not what people are freaking out about what people are freaking out about this President Trump saying is a nationalist for instance here is Don Lemon reacting\nAlmost in real time just moments after President Trump dropped the N. word Don Lemon on CNN [noise]\n\nI'm a nationalist\nUsed that word we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favor to be All right and is loaded with native and racial undertones and global as well global is I've been uses a fuller\nOf sorts sometimes even against those in the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nWhat just happened to make president come right out and embrace nationalism\nAnd claimed that now would have happened to you\nOkay what is the problem with nationalism a a nationalist\nOr nationalism and this is a again common definition a person who advocates Political Independence for a country patriotic feeling principles are efforts an extreme form of this especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries\nThan a patriot her patriotism that's listed as a person who vigorously sports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies are detractors vigorous support for one's country in other words that's why patriot patriotism is listed as a synonym for nationalism\nAnd um\nDo I think this is may be part of a political strategy for him to help a push the Republicans over the line and hold the house of representatives in some of these furious house races\nI I kinda think Trump just set it but maybe it is maybe it is and I'll tell you why because for ordinary Americans I I mean\nBasically the people who live in this country and yes that includes those all important suburban women\nYou hear that the president said I'm a nationalist ... what is so terrible about that and uh the\nChrysalis are rights on his face Trump seemed to be simply saying that well past presidents and politicians cared a lot about other countries and what other countries thought about the United states\nThat he cares primarily about the U.S and what is good for us the problem of course is that words matter and the American president referring to himself as a nationalist has all sorts of problems wrapped up in it\nLet's start with what nationalism means here's the definition that he found that says quote a sense of national consciousness exalted one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis\nOn the promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or super national groups\nProblem there\nBut we do not elect a president of the United states to be a citizen of the world or a public servant or the world we do not we elect a president to represent the United states and\nTo defend our country and to defend our constitution and yes to defend our culture and there is such a thing as American culture\nNow the term white nationalist or if I daresay so the term black nationalist which is also a term that that's a problem let me tell you why it's a problem\nBecause what that suggests is that your real nation is something other than the United states\nThe United states obviously\nHas nationalist about America patriots who serve our country who fight for our country who worked for our country of every racial religious\nAnd or ethnic background it it it does\nAnd the idea that there is something racist about saying I Am a nationalist America specifically and from the beginning\nHas always been a nation\nThat has not to find our nationalism or our nationality based upon race or blood or where you were born\nI mean going all the way back to before the revolution the idea was you could become an American by choice by picking yourself up and moving here and embracing the American idea\nAnd we've always had that we've always had that\nAnd you know we have we talked on this show many times and and it is true it is documented nobody argues against is close to ten\nPercent and maybe over ten percent of the continental army that fought with George Washington for our liberty\nWhere people of color they were black people mostly former slaves because that's why they were here and the idea\nThere's the French there actually recorded descriptions of when the French arrived to work with the Americans at Yorktown one of the reasons they look down on the American army was not only not specifically uniforms and the French were about nothing if not speak to uniforms\nBut because there were so many people of different complex and in that arming one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nDo you have a problem with nationalism does that mean you have a problem with America\nWill be right back on them and that you [noise]\nSide said not that no and we have to come together and fight it and that's\nWhy this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism and seems to me I don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ...\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real crime than the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what will you and give your heart to\nIs our nation not a race not an ethnicity and the fact that\nThat there are so many people out there in a commentary and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism\nI honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side I think if anything it helps\nOn the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYou know like I I'm a I think that uh America is neither a a a country founded on nationalism nor international is a more global is I mean\nHow can you say that we weren't hounded on nationalism a we were founded on individual is on nationalism\nOr no no I'm Sorry we weren't we were founded by a lot of people who came together to a\nRisk their lives and in many cases to give their lives at twenty five thousand people died in the revolution\nGive their lives for the cause of the ... a nation not a not a school

followed politics ... he's also an expert because he wrote the book on it literally on the question of voter fraud and manipulating elections\nJohn is a a columnist for National Review he has a

to his right now and one of those thirty eight states and you probably are us don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you make sure you're making a contribution\nTo this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking at this John Fund that the momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people have baked and the cake any negative attitudes they have the President Trump and I think that Trump's anthrax\nAs a personality had depressed part of the Republican base\nBut the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law and I think that it's best to show the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in a violating norms and politics\nAnd at worst almost extra constitutional so I think the prompt\nManaged to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own ... over surprise on their feet and having to blow up in their face\nYeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller\nA who is long considered our most endangered a senator senator from Nevada he strongly supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and that appears to have given him a boost I think they're running tied now right now in Nevada are they\nI think of the election were held today Republicans would lose none of their seats and the only question is what the Democrats lose two or three or four affairs\nWow which means they of course Republican control of the Senate what about on the house side\n[noise] I Would say the Democrats because of a variety of good factories including the fact that uh\nYou know suburban women become one of the most resistant groups against Trump twenty five point gender gap against them\nOr we're against Republicans I think there are sixty percent chance to take back the house of sixty percent of a lot lower than it was two or three weeks ago because I think that as the issues start to be talked about you to remember most\nOf your listeners are into politics Michael you and I are into politics\nThe average voter doesn't pay attention to much closer to the election so when they actually look at the issues the ... center right country that if the Republicans frame the issues property they tend to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some extraneous event like that who found the financial meltdown\nOkay two two issues which are very much front and center at this moment ah one is the alleged had horrible a gaffe that President Trump made last night and used and when he called himself a nationalist do you think this is going to alienate millions and millions of American voters\nI think it may be hundreds and hundreds of reporters and journalists were once again appalled by the fact that the president\nIs you know troll ... telling them I mean a notice when he said and he said I don't I'm not supposed to say it but I'll say that anyway I mean look the president may not be the most elegant speaker but boy does he know how to use language as a weapon up but he doesn't use whatever years as a trigger word from one of them like he he pulled the trigger\nRight and a map pulls the trigger on on them to watch their heads explode and I it's just extraordinary I'd like to hear people I even offered to listeners to call up and say why nationalism was a bad word\nA one eight hundred nine five Seventeen Seventy six our

Senate ... that are listed when you just click on it\nOn the Internet are national feeling a national uh as patriotic feeling pardon me patriotism and flag waving and uh nothing wrong with any of those three things what about we we had on\nYesterday and Eric eggers who is a very concerned about uh the confusion in American voting registration suggesting that as many as twenty four percent uh of registered voters right now are really shouldn't be voting\nNow you've written about this um extensively do you think that's a very big problem two weeks from the day\nIt depends on the state are you know I I hate to draw national brushing twenty four percent sure sounds high to me I think that the problem with voter fraud as it doesn't show up until the very end with an election as close and somebody gets desperate and they put their thumb on the scale and send the street money out\nAnd it all happens quickly at the very end you know under the cover of a ... you know vans and everything else so we may not know what happens\nBut we do know that we need to watch for it and if there's anything on toward\nThese bad with these with like in Georgia you know these ... these are not people are being prevented from voting it just means they have to show up at the polls and fill out a provisional ballot and prevent their id it doesn't we're not permitting anyone from voting we're just making sure the person who's voting is the person they say they are\nYeah I mean while I'm there is a um a this additional at any thirty six governors' ships that are up in in this election right now right\n[noise] yeah it's a big this is the big casino yeah and these\nThese these governorships will help decide how redistricting is done after the next census which one to two years\nRight which will also help to determine whoever wins what will be a very close election you don't think there's any chance the Democrats win more than thirty seats are you\nThere oh no no no in fact I think I think the governorships they're going to be a lot of swaps the ... Democrats will take back some Midwestern states that have been in Republican control for a long time like Illinois\nAnd the Republicans are going to take back I think they'll pick back states where the Democrats mismanaged the finances so bad that um you know they've given up any chance of governing by Connecticut by the way even Oregon even Oregon make elected Republican governor for the first time in Thirty years\nRight which would be amazing Boyd is Kate Brown ever deserve to be voted out of power in Oregon now there's one surprise to look\nFor is there a Republican candidate against Angus King in Maine\n[noise] there is but ah and he's a good guy but unfortunately Angus King has this impenetrable independent damage because he technically runs as an independent so he's got that nailed down\nOkay except I understood the New York times today random forming piece about the Democrat there's a democratic nominee against Angus King whose name is Zak Ringelstein and he apparently is a big Bernie Sanders guy he's been endorsed by democratic socialist\nIf we could encourage anybody listening to us up in Maine vote your conscience vote for the real socialist votes or ringelstein

this um [noise] there's a great deal of controversy about Stacey Abrams who is a candidate\nFor governor she's the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and she's running as Brian Kemp who is the Republicans the states ... states Stacey Abrams is state senator and a\n... here here's the problem is a two fold problem one of the items that seems to me is more of a problem\nThan the other and ah the one that's getting all the attention today is\nA CNN is reporting democratic candidate to be George next governor explained her presence Tuesday at a Nineteen Ninety to protest that included burning the state flag\nShe said that was part of her opposition to Confederate symbolism her a involving came to light on social media\nAnd the statement to CNN Abrams campaign said that the actions\nIn college where part of a permitted peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag it's part of Georgia State flag\nAt the time of the protests in Nineteen Ninety to the states flags states flag contained the Confederate battle flag emblem which had been a prominent feature state flag since it was adopted Nineteen fifty six when the battle over to the segregation was raging in the south\nOf the Confederate battle flag emblem wasn't fully recover removed from the states flag until two thousand three\nAnd then the same as in the uh Stacey Abrams campaign says during Stacey Abrams college years Georgia was at a crossroads struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues and\nSymbols of the confederacy the sharpest of which was the inclusion the Confederate emblem and the Georgia State flag then it's a goes on to say a crunch time in public services deputy city attorney in a state legislative leader of all been focused on bringing people together to solve problems\nOr educate the fact that back in Nineteen\nNinety two she participated in a demonstration against the state flag\nThat's not a problem it seems to me and shouldn't be a big problem in our campaign at so long time ago and the flag was changed anyway she's not burning contemporary Georgia flag I'll tell you what is a problem\nShe has gone on record and she is standing by it about basically blowing up the largest Confederate monument of them all\nAnd this is one then I have spoken about this before on this whole issue of Confederate monuments I\nI Can't understand why you would decide not to blow anything up but to move a statue for instance the best example is in New Orleans they had a statue of Robert he lay on top of a pillar and it really looked over the whole city and it was sort of like the Nelson's statue on top of a pillar infer fog or square in great\nBritain in London and having Robert de Leon such a prominent place looking over the whole city I get it problem don't blow it up but they and I don't know what they're putting on top of that pillar of anything maybe that took the whole pillar down they moved all the statue okay\nBut when you're talking about Stone Mountain I actually looked it up the Stone Mountain memorials bigger than Mount Rushmore\nAnd its carved into the side of a mountain and it took about Thirty years to do all the carving it was a very very big undertaking\nAnd in the side of the mountain is an image of Jefferson Davis president of the confederacy Robert ... commander of the army of northern Virginia and his chief lieutenant Thomas Jonathan Jackson's Stonewall Jackson and they're all riding along\nAnd Stacey Abrams is taken the position that that monument has to be removed and crashed and honestly I don't understand it\nThere are lots of African Americans in the state of Georgia Stone Mountain by the way it's over three thousand acres of beautiful beautiful park and it\nIs owned I'm pretty sure by the city of Atlanta is three thousand acres and their trails they used to have a whole neo Confederate theme park is the New York times points out where they had a plantation house that's all gone\nIf they put up appropriate signage that looks at the side of this mountain as\nA historical symbol wouldn't that be a better way to go than simply sand blasting it or ruining it are knocking it down and because of the size of Stone Mountain\nYou're putting in mind that the Taliban remember them they blew up these Bhutto's because they took over the Buddhist were over twelve hundred years old and they blew them up in the ... valley\nAnd uh basically that was a that was before September eleventh\nAnd I went on the air and I talked about it and I said this was an act of terrorism against the past\nAnd look I understand that you can move a statue but the notion that you have to blow up a home mountainside\nIt's it's a little bit nutty in uh the New York times they point out that the David Huckabee\nWho is a Georgia syndicated columnist no relation to the White House press secretary\nAssailed misery roast position writing that she intends to run the most racist and divisive campaign history of Georgia politics\nRemoving such symbols won't keep one black father at home with his family didn't want to take a single illegal weapon off of a single street in a single black neighborhood\nAnd a ... ... ... look I I understand that the whole history behind the Stone Mountain monument is a a a it is a terrible thing because they started putting it up started plans for Nineteen fourteen\nAnd it was associated with the rise of the clan all of which of course was presided over with great approval by a southerner Democratic president Woodrow Wilson and yes Woodrow Wilson was ... Virginia I Know he was governor of New Jersey before\nBut uh the idea that you have to blow up that memorial ... why would Democrats want to be the real Taliban of American politics I don't get it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number we'll be right back [noise] like\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but\nWe're very different place in our country right now but to literally blast away is itch three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there in a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a needlessly polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the Michael Mann that show hey\nNo market hard I'm well you're very good ... and I can listen to your explanation about a year\nOkay maybe I got older their heritage you\nKnow no I never I never say that this was their heritage I never say that they have ... heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay are you hearing me outfits you find that oh\nBeautiful historical and all that how would you feel if there was a Stone Mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they don't they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that their character\nAgain and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage and that's not\nThe point the point is if there was if there is an art work a piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move aid three acres culture that it took Thirty years to make you only\nBlow it up or\nIf there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and I again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that outfits should be blown up\nI think it's important that it be preserved date is part of the record of history\nAnd they didn't have any statues in Auschwitz but if they have them there that should be preserved as part of the historical record as well and given the fact that ah they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place that was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have T shirts they Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside it's a ... some people get Confederate souvenirs no of course not because you're right this is a dark chapter of American history it's not one to be celebrated\nBut that doesn't mean it seems to me following the Taliban example of blowing up monuments from a different era we will be right back on the ... that show [noise]\nIt's four thirty year at a um to Seventy and have them one of three three the answer for you to use weather traffic of me [noise]\n[noise] well that's our news on the feeders in Washington President Trump is criticizing the Saudi\nOperation that killed journalists demolish Augie calling at one of the worst cover ups in the history of cover ups Mr Trump tells reporters in the oval office that he's expecting a full report on the killings soon but he says quote they had a very bad original concept and it was carried out poorly\nCalled the events Africa showed is that the worst cover up ever\nSandra Day O'Connor the first woman on the Supreme Court says she has the beginning stages of dementia and probably all ... disease O'Connor made the announcement on a letter on Tuesday she said her diagnosis was made some time ago and that as her condition has progressed she has no longer able to participate in public life\nO'Connor eighty eight was nominated by President Reagan and took her seat on the court in Nineteen eighty one on Wall street that out on by a hundred and forty six points that has backed property won the U.S and the lower by fifty this is that's around new\nSlogan drivers we get the answer [noise]\nSuits for thirty one we're up to sixty one degrees here we picked up one forty if I were sitting here with a a chance to to showers and maybe even a thunderstorm rolling through the area this is after two am by the way\nOut of the chance to arrange it thirty percent forty tomorrow's chance Rand kicks up there to ... percent temperatures will pick up to the upper sixties\nLanes closed due to an asset highly thirty said both north and south and approaching to eighty eight women she you know when that reopen some loss in the right lane and race ... easily more than ...
