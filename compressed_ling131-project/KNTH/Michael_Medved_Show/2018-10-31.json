state why is there suddenly a Republican problem with a will to do suburbs in this country\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] the New York times asked that question in the business section today they take a look at some of those areas where\nRepublicans are not running well where the Democrats hope to sweet to power in the house of representatives and they happened to be parts of the country that have done supremely well under the leadership of President Trump\nWhat's the problem here\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number there's also a new Republican at addressing that and also there is another big issue that we are prepared to take on which is the issue of Halloween\nIs the focus\nAnd the expenditure in the concentration on Halloween of a great national celebration\nIs that a good thing that ought to be encouraging applauded or not such a great aspect of American Life the great Halloween debate which we run through every year to this year with a very different perspective by the way\nBetween myself and the most formidable person that I ever get to debate on which is my wife Dr Diane ... coming up also and this edition of the Michael ... that show\nBut first off I uh I think it's appropriate to uh to offer a golden turkey award for a truly remarkable performance in a faithful candidates debate this is one of the closest Senate races in the country and by the way\nIf you look at the polling right now even according to the polling\nThere are almost a dozen Senate races where the Republicans had a real chance\nOf a of making big inroads against various tablets Democrats now one of the Democrats or Republicans are very much hoping to knock off his Joe Donnelly of Indiana\nWho by the way is an idiot I mean this is not a bright capable member of the U.S Senate this is a guy who got elected because he was running against a very weak Republican candidate he's running behind all ready but then there was the debate\nLast night and a Joe Donnelly both in what he said and the way she later explained it stepped right into a wealthy stepped into unpleasantness\n[noise]\n\nBigger Academy Awards first and foremost I'd like to thank God\nFor years and the Grammy I Would like to thank my wonderful aging more powerful than the people's choice\nI Would like to share this with every single senator and\nNow it's time for another golden turkey award nomination [noise]\nAnd on\nThe Michael ... show or the golden turkey award going to Joe Donnelly he is running slightly behind the Republican candidate Mike Braun there's also an independent candidate\nWho may be taking votes away from the Republican those are terribly wasted votes in in a faithful election like this anybody who's thinking about voting independent in Indiana\nThink again think again this is a very clear choice you can choose a clear conservative Republican an outsider who is running for more Washington reform\nOr you can choose senator Donnelly who's a unparalleled eloquence led to this in the midst of a televised debate\nOr state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job or director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even\nMore incredible job than you could ever imagine okay why\nCould you not imagine that an African American as credible job he's Indian American but he does an amazing job\nBut he does an amazing job\nOkay this is an amazing job uh this is a job that is going to cost him his Senate seat I certainly hope and and listen to this because he just a couple of hours ago issued a a quote an apology explanation\nHere's what he said I misspoke\nI meant to say and instead of but that would have communicated what I've tried to do my entire life that I make a habit to seek out and promote people of color for both my campaign an official staff\nNow isn't that problematic\nTo seek out and promote people of color\nFor both my campaign officials staff\nDon't you want to say senator Donnelly I mean isn't the right thing to say I seek out the best people regardless of their color or their background but he does an amazing job okay this is it an amazingly poor job or an amazingly poor job\nIs also um reflected on the part of Nancy Pelosi she was on the ah friendly confines of speaking of the friendly confines I Know I Know that's Wrigley Field the cubs weren't in the playoffs this year but um\nYou know I've congratulations to the Boston Red Sox and what an amazing year in London amazing season and they're being talked about for a hundred and Nineteen\nWins but that of course includes the playoff wins in the world series wins\nUm mariners still two thousand one hundred and sixteen wins okay meanwhile in the friendly confines of the Steven cold beer show Nancy Pelosi was on last [laughter] and and again I'm ... please before you vote\nThink whether you really really want to install this lady as speaker of the house of representatives just a heartbeat away from the presidency here's Nancy Pelosi\nUp until today I Would have said if the election were held today we would win what happened today to change that [noise] but now in saying is we've away [laughter]\nWant to say that on on Hillary's fireworks barge\nDay\nWhen we on the ground for not yielding one grain of sand how long are the curtains measuring quick yes walking precincts and if everyone votes will have even if they are victory but we ... Democrats will carry the house we have to think of victory the Senate governorship it's going to be great and I for Mac\nSacrifice a gold or something [laughter]\nOkay um I don't I don't think you have to sacrifice would go no no goats sacrificed in the making of the sad or she came back and suggested does this\nSolution which actually echoes Hillary Clinton hauntingly for the question instability in polarization and the society listen\nYeah how about you if you weren't let us on white and purple side is that an inclusive message that you're sending out there that it's not America's either written or blue\nCould be said that unifying our country I think it's time to heal there's been a lot of talk lately about um oh oh\nLowering the temperature of political discourse have you have you seen evidence of that well I think when we when you will see evidence of that\nAh when when we when we're going to tone down the political discourse\nBecause a calling for investigation of a sitting justice of the U.S Supreme Court that would be Brett Kavanaugh calling for his investigation and potential impeachment calling for impeachment of president that's a that's a great way to tone down the rhetoric right\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this um\nAndrew Gillum the a democratic nominee for the governorship in Florida who right now is running very slightly ahead of the far preferable a Republican nominee Rhonda Santa's\nIn any event Guillaume said this about his opponent when he was on the Daily Show with Trevor Noah\nHis campaign has been inundated by racism when people supporting him all his other tolls on who's saying\nDo you think of that will be the defining characteristic of this race no I don't I mean I think um I Do\nA missile defenses [noise]\nProbably given too much harbor a two races and the phone and talk to them I um [noise] he spoke at conferences with on the opposite of justify slavery quite\nOkay this is simply not true he did not offer a book justifying\nSlavery um [laughter] you don't you think you would have heard about that before now so what did he actually say in his book what he said in his book was true it's about the constitution and yeah we'll talk about the constitution and birthright citizenship and more coming up with your calls on the man that show [noise]\nAnd go oh for sure and then that's coursing right now we're our politics [laughter] something that is um\nI think what we need to understand it not just about right or if it's not just about political points about football I think people lives on out on the line and going back to the Republican Party and going back to travel\nAnd it's just the three men and Kansas convicted of trying to bomb Somali refugees and they said in court that anti Muslim rhetoric how to influence that decision to take people's lives is is not just a matter of rhetoric of a distraction for the cultural\nStandpoint this is a matter of people dying all over the climate that's being created\nBy by not only the White House and condoned by by people like Steve ... grand that people are dying people are literally dying over there and I think I think that is one thing that Americans need to consider when they go to the polls\nAnd this is a country that want to be right now the last week that we had the last two weeks\nIf I were any other country I shall travel warnings to the United states over in the climate and the violence that we say\nOK really\nIf you look at the murder statistics we're still\nAt less than half the murder rate\nThat we had in the Nineteen eighties and this is something that all Americans should be proud of it's not just a Republican achievement but there's a new ad frankly that that was run 'em by the Trump reelection campaign though this is not the Republican campaign committee\nThis is the Trump twenty twenty election campaign and the ad is one of the best Republican as I've ever seen and really mean it\nIt hits exactly where this problem came to order which is why is it that right now the places where\nRepublicans are facing the stiff its challenges are privileged suburbs places that have done very well that are earning lots\nOf money lots of new jobs lots of new businesses lots of new\nConstruction of those places that are doing so well why are people in those communities leaning against Trump\nAnd yet in down crowd and communities in places in the mid west in in rural America in a small town America\nThat really have suffered recently and haven't yet partake in fully\nOf the new prosperity that's\nWhere Republicans are doing well have the party's flipped positions the Democrats are now the party and the rich and the privilege and the comfortable and secure\nAnd the

in the way\n... ... how do you sleep\nWhen the world keeps turning\nAll that we built to come on gun how do you sleep on the world is burning\nEveryone answers to someone\nDon't lie to me don't lie to me you lie to me don't lie to me don't lie to me you lie to me\nYou can build towers are bronze and gold you can build castles in\nThe sky you can you smoke and mirrors all cliches not today not today can't you see on crying can't you see we're crying where's the New Horizons where's the new horizon how do you sleep how to use leap pad you sleep\nActually President Trump doesn't sleep much I mean he's tweeting at two in the morning and he's tweeting again if five the next morning\nOr all that we build has come undone how do you sleep how do you sleep enough is enough how do you sleep when the world is burning how to use the patio sleep every one of the answers to someone\nAnd then can't you see I'm Crying can't you see we're buying can't you see we're all crying every one answers to someone\nOr the song sounds like this Barbra Streisand's newly released song [noise]\n[noise]\nWhat can you\nYou\nYour lives\nOkay um it it goes on like that here here's a question and I know that\nThe music business is changing and people are listening to music on Spotify and you download something and you can listen to it once and then throw it away but the core of the music business for a very very long time and I say a long\nTime [noise] ah oh going on two hundred years I mean really for a very long time okay a hundred and fifty years the um\nThe music business has been about\nGetting music that you want to keep and listen to\nAnd enjoy and um I Know this again last night um I came home I went to see a new film which we're going to review on friday with my wife\nAnd we came home from the film and we were doing some work and I know we're ready to go to bed and I just had a again a to hear this particular very obscure piece of music\nAnd I I collect CDs I have a lot of a compact is and um and and so I was able to find this eight Russian folk songs by on a totally Riyadh off [laughter] it's a very obscure his music and I want to share with Diane 'cause she didn't know it and so I\nPut it on even though I haven't listened to the CD for a long time I was glad to have it because it's beautiful music can anyone imagine\n... said two years from now I say ten\nYears from now where President Trump is no longer president he's term limited don't worry liberals he's term limited\nWhat some of them want to put on this song don't lie to me about President Trump\nTo hear more of this can you imagine sitting down in your living room in the middle of the night\nAnd saying yeah let's let's share the the musical experience of moving\nI I think that they the Democrats should employee this song in campaign of it [noise]\nUh no I meant that Democrats should because that would absolutely ensure that people are in the right mood of despair and\nI see I don't get this\nI don't get it and look I I I knew Barbara Streisand years ago I actually worked with her at one point and and by the way she's a very nice person she\nIs not a mean evil nasty person at all uh she has kind she's considerate and I think most people who have had any experience dealing with her on a personal basis I Will tell you that\nAnd it's sad for me to see this\nAnd and I'll tell you why I I I Know that Barbara has serious aspirations as an artist but somebody ought to tell her somebody ought to tell everybody on the left there is no lasting art there is no art of lasting value that is created for the politics of the moment\nDo\nHow do you okay honestly because it has a\nVery short shelf life\nOn the campaign songs that various people writer not songs of people turned two years later\nAnd frankly you can think of things like a blowing in the wind is blowing in the wind had a general political meaning but it wasn't specific like this aimed at one candidate or\nAnother and if you want to create music that really can do what music can do at best wishes to nourish the soul and maybe uplifted country wouldn't it be useful if the left would get off this this\nIs incredibly hard isn't one sided perspective she's asked an important question by the New York times of question was what\nDo you say to those people who maybe your fans who may love you're singing may love your work\nBut also love Donald Trump for answers kind of astonishing and very sad we will get to that with your calls coming up\nAnd then later in the interview she thought of something he'd done well and she said what he's done well you've asked me what I think he's good at he's good at marketing\nThen later she she says in the interview she blames Donald Trump for making her fat\nI'm not joking\nThe or the interview concludes with ... asking Barbara how are you feeling these days and she says I Want to sleep nights if we take the house I'll be able to sleep a little bit better\nAnd then ... and if they don't don't know I've been thinking about do I want to move to Canada\nI think she'd promise to move to Canada before Trump won the election I mean the presidential election and then she says I don't know if I moved to Canada I'm just so saddened by this thing happening in my country it's making me fat\nI hear what he said now and I have to go eat pancakes now and pancakes are very fattening we make them with healthy flower though I'm and flour coconut flower\nOkay good for her ... does anyone think it's fair to blame Donald Trump for making you\nFat and that's what she said ah let's go to Jeff in Seattle Jeff you're on the Michael ...\nMichael ... the the whole bomb thing going out\nWith Trump saying you know is fake news is evil or why are they the new people and the left as missing opportunity where there for ... try and get try to put a face these people who exactly are the lawyers who is the fake news is that\nLike Lawrence O'Donnell is if people on Rachel Maddow Don Lemon is that the guys was you know him as a B. C. is that a lot of people you know they need they need a fortune to name these people who think this line\nHe he won't he won't because frankly he doesn't watch fake news as he sees a heap and you've heard the stories about how we only allows Fox News on air force one inning apparently gone to a bit of a tiff with millennia because he caught her watching CNN\nOr why cording to according to Don and why am I watch all of them you know listen to try and was in the bits and pieces of all of them good dogs I mean you know he says it does he watch his show but\nMy issue is is they need to try and force him to say who are these people for these people could come out and say I you know who is\nWell again I I I'll tell you I I think you actually I understand what you're saying and I I Do believe that President Trump would gain a lot by inviting some of the people who have been most critical\nTo him becoming a White House sit down and talk it out\nIt's a it it actually would make you look so different but but the polarization a and to the extent that President participates in it I I think he's hurting himself will give another example coming right out [noise]\n\nAm ten Seventy kept him want to reduce the chances of that\nSort of the volleyball I knew you'd Washington\nThe suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacres but indicted by a federal grand jury the indictment which was expected was announced today it charges Robert Bowers was forty four counts including hate crimes\nFederal prosecutors a previously indicated they plan to seek the death Beverly authorities say Bowers opened fire the tree of life to the dog on Saturday killing eleven people and wounding six including for police officers\nBoston ... accused of hitting somebody with a can of beer that was thrown during a parade celebrating the world series wearing Red Sox\nThey say the camp struck with or injure a man who was on board with the amphibious ducked both hearing the players and their families wasn't clear if it was the same candidate hidden damage or World Series trophy at will now have to be repaired and winning section on Wall street 'cause our two hundred forty one points ... this was as ...\nStuck in traffic we got the answer [noise]\nFish three thirty one we're sitting here with a Seventy four degrees and feeling damp and getting ready to get flat out west\nHundred percent yes it's still more ring throughout Halloween Night overnight lows denied him we'll be right there and they're about sixty right in their low sixties so breezes aren't going to help the front of a five sometimes even ten miles an hour and then they're going to shift to the north west after midnight\nMass involving a Jack knife Eighteen like to look out for I wait time coffee lay out that on at ten south minor delays they're often ask them block she left lanes I forty five Gulf ...

in her interview uh that she doesn't care about what\nTrump supporters feelings hurt Trump fans of Barbra Streisand who might also be trumps borders the whole thing is too bad and it's an example\nOf everything that's wrong about this moment of polarization the um ... more of a stress in an interview have you ever met Trump and she says no\nBut when I was editing my last TV special for Netflix and we were looking at audience shots there he was sitting next to\nBarbara Walters but he never came backstage to see me or meet me so I've never met him\nI take a President Trump takes abate invite her to the White House disarm\nHer she she writes she speaks in this interview very movingly about Bob Dole she said the most terrible things about bombs all when he was running for president she speaks very warmly about\nMcCain now that he's gone um she said awful things about McCain when he was running against a bronco Obama but seat honestly the face to face with people and I've never met Trump but\nI have heard from people who know him that he is actually a very different kind of person in person than you would think\nAnd uh uh\nThere's there's no reason to allow this this kind of insanity to continue it in her new album the album is called walls\nAnd I'm Maggie Haberman writes Barbara Streisand his new album one that has the musical and bought him a diverse singular dislike of President Trump boy I Want to buy that loves to get an album the student body image of singular dislike\nAnd the rare instance of her political views entering her music not so rare\nOne track already released don't lie to me as a direct address or fell her native New Yorker who now holds the oval office there are similar messages throughout the album\nAnd here's a ... ... people say on the other side they say well but it's a subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they want it to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation with a another country and ... by by that\nContext I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point the real point about this is that\nThere is neither political will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump is on very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground\nAnd virtually all Republicans and nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the doors open to everybody nobody wants to remove borders I shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works\nThat's the kind of thing you can win\nThe or by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well in in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true\nHe would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not possible birthright citizenship is not going to\nChange 'em\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practices the wall Street Journal and again nothing new York Times of Wall Street journal which has been very supportive of President Trump generally because Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism he can always draft and campaign for a constitutional\nAmendment but Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less than an amendment to the constitution so he's making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day Mr Trump made a political mistake this year by not trading legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security\nThan Republicans could have run on an immigration accomplishment and steady one of the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that word but here's my basic point about this politically I don't think there's anyone\nWho was excited by President Trump saying he's going to address birth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump who wasn't already supporting the Republican and getting people excited over this by the way I Do think it would be possible to curb birth tourism\nBy enacting some legislation around it saying that in special circumstances where people are traveling to the United states not for the purpose of long term residency but simply to give birth to a child here in the United states then you can question whether that child really is in the jurisdiction\nOf the United states and that's okay but generally\nTo challenge the idea that a child born to someone who has lived here\nFor ten years and where the child grows up entirely in the United states you want to try to challenge the citizenship status of that individual\nWhy not make more citizens who are actually committed to this country and so make sure that there is some kind of commitment or naturalization if need be\nBut uh if there is any down for the parents but creating a process where people can go through American innovation\nIt seems to me is much better than obliterate in the idea of citizenship as some Democrats seem to want to do or the idea of changing the\nConstitution to change the status of people who were born here whose parents may not have had the right to come here and the first place we'll be right back on the ... that show I go to some of your calls coming up the great hall of wean debate [noise]\nEight hundred nine five five seven genes

treating later with our granddaughter and I will admit that sounds perfectly nice and benign but what if she sees costumes that scare her what is it I don't know what she's dressing as what you're wearing\nShoes dressing up as a lady buck oh call that one ... aren't going to be ... yeah there's that species\nAppropriation [laughter]\nWhat she does ... like I said fine so maybe she has tried to copy become a a lady but but I don't think that when it's offensive\nOkay and I I can understand that for a two year old just it'd be pretty interesting seeing people wearing all these different costumes but what about the emphasis of uh on blood Gore um the the dark side of the supernatural\nOr do you think that's a a wholesome ingredient to inject into our cultural bloodstream every year with this force has\nLed a wouldn't look I'm not in favor personally I Do see a lot of our neighbors making mock graveyard on their front lawn and hanging out skeletons and that and having goes pinned on their head jury\nUm I you know I think that they're not doing that scare anyone I think they're doing it because it's so very clear that these are not real\nIt's very clear that these are decorations for a holiday that lets you bet that there's death\nAdmits that there is\nA sort of a scary side to the the season changing into a dark and coal time of year and I don't think that that's negative credit people doing it they are doing it because they consider it turns and I don't think it it's hurtful to kids to see that\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number if you are a great fan of the Halloween holiday or a non fan of the Halloween holiday or you\nCan join us in this exchange a one eight hundred nine five five Seventy seven is your story and sent us a tweet at a it's an md that show on Twitter\nUm it it it does is Halloween coming right after the arrest of this bombing suspect and right after the the truly truly horrible events in Pittsburgh and it was just four days ago\nOr does it feel a little bit different I mean again with all the answers on graves and and funerals and skeletons I I I when I Walk in our neighbor and I know exactly where you're talking about sweetie I mean there's a skeleton hanging from the tree\nI'm I don't see anything positive and then what's what's why is that a a a sort of a benign or worthwhile influence\nBut I wouldn't say that it wasn't that a worthwhile influence I think it's an expression of a holiday but it's universally understood to be secular to be fun to be different from the rest of the holidays which are more I'm upbeat\nAnd I don't think that it's meant to give the neighbors a negative message at all and and I don't think it's injecting it into the culture I think the culture is embraced Halloween and sales for the holiday have increased every year because of the fact that it's an escape it keeps it takes us out\nThe horrors that grace the newspaper front page it let's just go into the world a fantasy and less as I Do things that are fun like bobbing for Apple I mean there are things that happened on Halloween that or see how they remind us of the harvest remind us a time of year and that for positive for the holiday\nOkay what's the last time you have seen a what people would call an appropriate movie Halloween a scary movie\nYou're asking me I don't go to scaring\nThe I don't want them and they didn't do any of the last thirty five years you\nKnow like scary movies that are about other topics too you know that's just spent and slapstick attract considered pretty scary and ah violence in nearly every movie the only ones that I go to Iraq ...\nI I understand but since you were so particular about movies I mean it's kind of\nHow it is not a celebration scary stuff how Halloween celebration where kids go out in the neighborhood and they see each other all dressed up and make but face paint on and they can put out a bag and say trick\nOr treat Asian paying homeowners willing willingly overturned on their way of great pain had the worthy\nFace paint you're you're not making a case for black face costumes or you\nKnow and making Kelly wouldn't either I don't think at this point\nYeah maybe maybe someone can go as Megan Kelly this year with um\nI was thinking about that first time that I I trick or treat it and our new neighborhood while enlisted in northwest I dressed up as a clown and I met our neighbors and so a multi colored hair and clown makeup\nAnd well and then I'd have to be on the clown\nOkay well I I I certainly hope not oh we're speaking with Dr Diane ... clinical psychologist and best selling author and also\n'em or last year what was it was a hippie\nUh-huh well that's the end there plenty of people who look like that in uh Seattle area there coal homeless people want to let's see if homeless people come to your door trick or treating what's the appropriate response die\n[laughter] that's a good question I don't think I've ever seen that um I don't\n... I mean I feel bad for them anybody has a dress up at my door begging for candy I I Do have compassion for\nUm a let's go to a a Tessa\nIn snow Paul me Washington You're on the Michael ... show hello Tessa\nHi Michael I think that's ridiculous to sit here and say that the kids are learning how to panhandle during Halloween I mean you can say that for every holiday that's out there couldn't less you're asking him to sit on a strange man's lap Easter you're sitting here telling them to pick it up off the ground\nFourth of July you're telling them it's OK to set things on fire [laughter] I think it's a silly argument to sit here and say that panhandling is what we're teaching kids at that time\nWell sent out except most people generally in the in the rest of the year you would occasionally sit on somebody's lap and uh you would occasionally like different things on fire I don't know any other occasion and die You're welcome to jump in here\nAny any other occasion where you come up to people you may or may not know and a hold on a bag and expect them to put some good bird\nThough it's generosity between neighbors you're sitting\nHere having an open and fun time and you know kids that are younger obviously do it under supervision and then let the older kids I'd rather have my teenagers go trick or treating than going out in the neighborhood and causing trouble\n... things like that as well\nThe thing that makes its day difference is that it is one day set aside and you're never fully recognize as a time of being appropriate to go in the neighborhood\nWe all recognize it together it that we expect to have kids and knocking on the door asking for candy it's not a big surprise where he just jumped in front of the door and say give me your handy\nIt's something that we ought to sit here and we choose to participate in and those who don't just turn off the porch light\nLet's go to Tom Glenn door or California Hello Tom you're on the ... that show

prospect of Julia dressing up as a lady bugs and drawing tickets reading for the first time [noise]\nIt's it's pretty appealing [laughter] to be honest about it but I still don't like the whole focus
