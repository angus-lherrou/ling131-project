that scrutiny however these camcorders and these body cameras and I miss pro police as they come and why we dedicate so much time to\nAssist in the families of officers have been killed in the line of duty so you you won't get an argument for me about how bad the conviction of this officer was however this look I mean you've got a guy walking down the street with a knife in his hand trying to veer away from the officer and he pulls he shoots are sixteen times\nYou're not going to have any other outcome than that one and the video tape the tape confirmed it these body cameras on these dash
