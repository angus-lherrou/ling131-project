question about it everybody instinctively understand the\nReal clouds it's over this great country of ours [noise] really scary ...\nReport yesterday packages center the Pentagon and sent to the White House and Senator Ted Cruz is Texas office [noise] part of\nInvestigators at the FBI and now there is some direction in terms of who may have sent packages that tested positive\nFor the deadly [noise] um component called ... which is a can be fatal\nIt is something the terrorists use and there is some information just being released right now from Fox News [noise]\nFreaking now on the Mike Gallagher show\nThe two packages center the Pentagon this week the week that initially tested positive for rice and are suspected to have been mailed by a former ... a former navy sailor U.S officials evidently no the identity of the person who sent the packages investigators say the envelopes address the defense secretary James Mattis\nThe Navy's top officer admiral John Richardson\nContain a return address leading them to believe that came from the sailor\nMaine has not yet been disclosed but they are on it and uh I'm confident that law enforcement will get to a conclusion of this but I Want to get in and this is reminiscent to me of when\nThe board Bernie Sanders supporter gunned down Steve skull leash and tried to kill a bunch of Republican congressman\nOn that baseball field\nThis is what so dangerous about\nThe getting your face strategy and this is what is one of the shameful aspects of the way the Democrats have been behaving through this whole judge Kavanaugh process through the political\nBattles that we're fighting with Maxine Waters and Iraq Obama and other leading Democrats encourage people to fight and get into one another's faces and\nScream and yell and corner people on elevators and chase them out of restaurants there is a dangerous dangerous aspect\nTo that is you're responsible and it is reckless and is it really is is is vile for the Democrats to be playing this game it's really really dangerous for the Democrats to be to be going down this path\nAnd I know passions are high and people are mad\nAnd and Americans are are frustrated and I'm hoping and praying that that frustration and that anger and that rage is going to be is going to absolutely translate to a red wave on November six I really feel I I don't know what's gonna happen\nOr Mitch McConnell is on the floor of the Senate We're gonna play some audio just like we did yesterday the Senate majority leader is on fire people who are have been short of subdued like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell they are unleashing right now\nOn the travesty that's taking place in America the sham of an FBI investigation you don't want to know what's I watch a sham this was all orchestrated by Chris Coons and Jeff Flake\nAnd we need Jeff Flake to vote yes on judge Kavanaugh we need shoes in college to vote yes we need Lisa Murkowski to vote yes we need to have it on to get confirmed there has been no cooperation\nTo these accusations and to these allegations and we'll see what the\nFBI concludes and it could come today the finish line is in sight there are reports that the FBI could wrap up the capital investigation by today\nThat of course it wasn't going to be sufficient for the Democrats cars are going to play a game and they've been playing a game\nHere's an example of the game we we have the clip right with savannah Guthrie and Chris Coons\nDon't have the number here in front of me I Want you though it's a clip number tennis is from the from the today show on NBC this morning and I have to hand it to savannah Guthrie she called out the Democrats\nCharade in a very powerful way\nOf these guys are joined that they have now they're like the the the\nLewis and Martin Act of twenty eight teams are going around looking at us we're nonpartisan no look reached across the aisle we got to make the world a better place to buy a I'd like to build the world to give the world a coke is perfect ... you know\nListen to what savannah Guthrie exposed with Chris Coons\nAnd the fallacy of the Democrats wanting an FBI investigation sevens background check so that they can decide\nWhether or not Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court\nI Want to getting ... getting into the latter Eighteen year old Seventeen year old cat wrote about his way [noise] you know give me a break my thinking what that's really what we're getting hit with a really fair if it were a valid point can't wait to find what\nSavannah when Dr foreign came forward um with what President Trump despite described as a credible and compelling\nTestimony ah I thought and uh my friend Jeff I thought that that deserves a brief a weeklong further investigation to show the victims of sexual assault in this country that we take that seriously and it's worth investigating I Do think whether or not\nHe testified truthfully to the committee is a question before us found the FBI isn't going to reach conclusions they are going to deliver facts\nFrom further questioning and then we the Senate are going to have to make an ultimate decision I'm On a Democrat I think it was important we work together to accomplish that yeah\nDefinitely I mean ... and ... they were already going to vote against hatch happen I anyway and they voted against SAT scores that as well so I'm sure people might find well wait a minute and I think that what's wrong with a profit and ... along partisan lines [noise]\nI'm saying I I decided I was going to vote against judge Kavanaugh after days of interviews and after reviewing his speeches his writings and his opinions on the DC circuit\nThey lie God she just lied\nA savannah humble humble humble hollering uh uh I uh I reviewed\nHours of yeah you don't want to conservative on the bench and he and and senator Coons set a it's edited it as it is much said that in that interview\nWe just don't want to conserve it we don't want a conservative we don't want to Republican the White House we don't want a Republican to be able to appoint a conservative we God Forbid\nRuth Bader Ginsburg passes away in the next few years and then it's going to be\nSix to three conservative majority that's the Democrats and the liberals worst case scenario\nAnd and I get that but the game they're playing with this investigation it's a sham it's a total sham they don't care\nYou want to know the second lie that Chris Coons told senator Coons told if they cared about the woman's accusation and what they were really worried about her wellbeing and her claim of being showed us terribly\nAssaulted thirty six years ago that she can't get on an airplane and she needs to have two entrances to her bedroom and she's afraid of close spaces and she's been traumatized all these years you know what you do when you get the allegation\nYou don't sit on it for six weeks you'd take it right to the Senate Judiciary committee and you deal with it Christine\nBlasey Ford whatever you think of her story\nDoes not want Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court that is not just beautiful whatever you think\nShe didn't care that he was on the DC circuit court\nShe didn't care that he ... he worked in the White House and the kids start investing in care about any of that over the years it's the Supreme Court that she decided oh my gosh let me contact the Washington Post and tell them what I say happened thirty six years ago to try to stop him\nFrom being on the Supreme Court what ever you think of her and all the stories that are being revealed about the polygraph and the ex boyfriend saying she absolutely knows\nHow to beat a polygraph and knows how to give instructions on polygraph since she sat under oath she has never done that\n\nWhatever you think about the the the ... the the refuting her fear of flying because she flies everywhere including on small planes evidently my wife was terrified flyer I couldn't get Denise on a small plane ... if if I if I dragged her on the plane she was so afraid to fly north thing she could ever fly on was a commercial jet\nAnd I'll tell you when they report it delivered to the Senate and\nWhat do you mean by that it'd be a legit you are you saying that they're making something up about some illegitimate child\nRight a while though said that I I get a better taking
