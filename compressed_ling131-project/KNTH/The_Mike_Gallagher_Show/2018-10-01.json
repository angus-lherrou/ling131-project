stuff happening in this country\n\nOver the weekend Jeff Flake made the rounds ah he was with\nHis buddy uh Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware a flake with his shocking announcement friday that he was changing his mind and he had been a solid Jasper Brett Kavanaugh he asked for another week\nOf the FBI to conduct a seventh investigation limited in time and scope all ready to Democrats or Halloween already there screaming I'm already they are complaining about the limitations and the time and scope they're calling the investigation a sham um there's not going to be any\nSatisfying conclusion you know that in terms of the FBI investigation there won't be there will be nobody's going to be happy with what the next few days\nThat's where we are unfortunately as a country what matters is getting judge Kavanaugh confirmed at this point unless something emerges that is conclusive that somehow corroborate each the claims that he did any of this stuff\nWhat we know so far is that the witnesses to Dr Christian laws you forge allegation have not corroborated what she said in fact they said they don't know what she's talking about they don't have any rent a memory of it they there's no\nAffirmation I Am very sensitive and mindful of the fact that there are undoubtedly sexual assault victims who don't have core operation it does have to boil down to\nIn this case undoubtedly he said she said and when Brett Kavanaugh went to that table and dramatically defended his name\nDramatically defended\nAnd explain ... claimed with rage and grief what he and his family have witnessed\nThat that kind of turned everything as well because you got to people the accuser and the accused who sounded and looked and sounded credible\nOver a thirty six year old

Manhattan rather by its location in just those two blocks a lot of homeless people bear a lot of really really scary people and one of those scary people walked into the Burger King I'm sitting there by the table at the table by the window\nMinding my own business reading a book like a dummy shipping on my Diet Coke because the Diet Coke always offsets the whopper is the way it works in my mind\nAnyway the guy walks in this guy shovels him and he starts bothering people who are standing by one of the kiosks and I can hear one of the the the people the customer say step away from me don't touch me don't touch don't put your hands on me\nAnd the guys mumbling something you're not black these like in a black a sweat like a black track suit\nAnd peddling that you can put this video up on the strange that people can see how their story because at this point the security guard for Burger King comes over\nAnd he's asking the guy politely I heard the whole thing is it's just a few feet away from me you got to leave now buddy you got to go\nWell that guy pulls out the scariest looking nights it looked like a home made like a shank ...

calm level headed person a little bit bonkers me let me start before we talk about\nThe reversal by Jeff Flake his change of heart after he was confronted by a pair of activists shut the senators only elevator friday morning which is good news but it gives us a reason to stay optimistic to stay upbeat\nUm the Dow Jones industrial average was two hundred points today\nUm investors are cheering the news of Canada joining a trade deal with the United states and Mexico [noise] um [noise] the impending collapse of mashed NAFTA\nEverybody it's not as sharp rights over hot air dot com it's not quite a big as big a deal as a Brexit but it certainly had President Trump's critics quite exercise over it now however it looks like everyone can go back about their normal business after months of stalling and\nPreening Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau came back to the table if the eleventh hour and\nAgreed to join the U.S and Mexico in this deal last minute trade deal reforming NAFTA just what the president wanted huge victory\nAnd as a Peter Navarro put it\nThe president has put together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history that's not hyperbole\nAnd it matters because it affects every single one of us it affects every one of our bank accounts it affects every one of our retirements are four one K. is our paychecks\nHere's a Peter Navarro this is a cut number one again just two minutes of good news in a sea of bad news 'cause there's nothing really good about the cabin offshore nothing\nAll we can do is hope and pray\nThat\nThe senators come to their senses the cabinet gets confirmed\nAnd it's crucial because this involves way more than just one man has a lot more to do\nThere's a lot more at stake than just Brett Kavanaugh will get into that and just a couple of moments as well but I Want you to uh see the White House trade advisors on Fox News over the weekend it's just cut number one here is the way Peter Navarro describes what President Trump has done with our economy and trade\nPresident Donald Trump is very quietly been putting together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history [noise]\nAnd uh it's it's really truly extraordinary and I think quietly because the media has under report in both the actions we take him and the results and humid days this last week the United nations\nWere president ... traded a groundbreaking with South Korea open negotiation with your hand and work with our allies in Japan and Europe the issue strong statement against the behavior of China\nNow now if you need any proof about a corrupt news media all you have to do is acknowledge what Peter Navarro says about the way the media has under reported all of this\nHuge news it's a Trump keeps winning I Know Trump haters hate to hear that\nI Know it makes you crazy to hear that\nIt's a fat he keeps winning he's not pulling the gal out of his ear okay he's not making up the unemployment numbers let's just not a tweet from the president at midnight these are facts\nAnd um [noise]\nPart of why they're threatened by um it's part of why the left is so desperately trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh they figured this will be a major defeat for the president it will be incidentally if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed let's start with one of the big\nTakeaways of the last few days one of the biggest takeaways is watching the stunning\nUm crowing by leftists an activist and progressive over the weekend on social media about how getting in people's faces screaming at them shrieking at Penn cornering people like Jeff Flake\nEffect change this is why we do it\nThat's what they should Ana Marie Cox all these other folks got on social media this is why we get in your face is because it works Jeff Flake\nCaving and Jeff Flake changing his mind after he was be raided by the activists\nIn the elevator and they are activists I don't know if they were sexually assaulted and if they were my heart goes out to them as my heart goes out to any victim of sexual assault the Christian plaza sea Ford was sexually assaulted by heart\nGoes after and as the president said her testimony was compelling what makes this\nOn fulfilling for everybody is the fact that judge Kavanaugh's testimony was compelling as well\nIf you are wrongly accused of such a horrific thing I Would think you'd react with the world watching precisely the way he did\nWithout a doubt\nAnd so we are left with a he said she said here's a major takeaway\nIf Kavanaugh get derailed and the confirmation fails\nIt's open season on every Republican in public office it is they're ... they're going to because they believe that getting in somebody's face and shrieking and screaming and berating somebody in public works that's what Senator Jeff flake gave them on friday\nHe has to know it can't be a stupid man\nAnd a word about Jeff Flake before we open up\nOur phone lines and we dive into all of this here on a Monday as we get ready ramping up for what's going to be undoubtedly a very tough week worried about Jeff Flake regime about him he's as productive as complaining about the whether\nHe is who he is he admitted on sixty minutes last night shockingly but he would have never changed his mind the way he did friday if he were up for reelection\nHe told the world if I had any accountability here I'd never do this he thinks that's a good thing he he thought that was good to tell Scott Kelly of CBS and sixty minutes but if I had been up for reelection I would've never partnered with\nChris Coons from Delaware my buddy and I would have never started the day saying I'm a firm yes and then with all the drama and the hot lean and the dramatic entrance into the chambers and sitting there and
