question\nLet's go conrail alright Seventy years old ... says and he's entering his tenth year of retirement he says I only saved up however much I needed to live I just found out my adult daughter is unable to pay for her son's college and it's killing me\nIs there any way that you can help me support than\nThat not run out of money myself ooh\nSee there's the heart string question again who and it's I mean again I Would love to sit down with Russian and share it with him hey okay you're Seventy retarded sixty\nLooks like a a you know maybe they give him a package hopefully didn't pull the trigger on Social Security too early but long story short yeah you want to be compassionate and you want to be able to help your grandchildren this case a and take a little pressure off your daughter but you don't want to jeopardize your\nOwn retirement because what happens if he runs what happens of restaurants that among you know\nWas was going to happen which is the first thing that normally happens\nWill they go live with their kids you know 'cause they can't afford their lifestyle so there is the divide you know do I do I continue down the path of what I've already planned for and that's my own personal finances my lifestyle but my heart is you know hurting that I I Can't\nHelp my my grandson in this case from his daughter you know you gotta you gotta make some hard line decisions and you maybe you can throw a little bit of money towards their you know you can help them maybe research and and uh there's grants out there if if they're not in a position of having you know a already\n... plan college fund which I did for every one of my kids or the day they were born up put twenty five hundred dollars in their account and then I regularly systematically put money in that account ever since and that's when it's not such a burden\nTo address whenever that child gets two college age and I've got one coming up in the next two years but I'm not ... because\nI got a really great start on her fun as well as my other ... but it's no different than somebody trying to catch up on retirement you know they they they lived a respectable lifestyle and they didn't hurt\nFor anything or want for anything but then they get\nTo where they're turning the corner and they're looking into retirement in the next ten Fifteen Years and going holy moly I don't have any money say well that that scenario applies exactly to college funding so that's why I always try to let people know you know instead of maybe sending them that hundred dollar bill for their birthday\nI'm or a you know they used to the the grandparents used to send a a savings bond but those are so stinky now that it's not even worth the paper written on almost but long story short why don't you contribute money towards their college fund\nOr knowing that they're going to be able to appreciate that down down the road and there's plenty of programs\nIn in the a system that you can contribute to a a child and if it is that one child doesn't go to college it could\nEventually passed down to another kid in that family so that that's a respectable prospect of what you could do and this sounds like unfortunately for rusted it after the fact in the child's already gone to school and so again I Would just maybe if you can you know\nShred a little bit off the side but definitely Russ don't jeopardize your own lifestyle that would be the my number one concern for you\nOur next question is from Diana in Katy she says I'm sixty three and currently retired the majority of my money is in the market at the moment and the crisis have two thousand eight hit me and my family very hard\nIs there a way that I can keep my money with you without having the same financial scare as I get in an aide while my money is in the market I'm Glad we had a question from China because you wanted to talk about that that market dropped into that\nYeah you you're exactly right I was just gonna say that's a good job um yeah you know we're we're going on a strong eight years and I mean excuse me ten years from two thousand eight\nAnd a lot of people it's like anything else it's like you know unfortunately people pass away in were distraught but through time you know we get better and that is exactly what's happening\nTo us in the society has done that to us in regard to I everything's fine everything's you know gung ho don't do looking review mere but\nI'm always conscious and always reminding people okay let's stress test your portfolio and let's find out what it would look like if we had another two thousand eight\nAnd if we did have another two thousand and\nHow you fair and could you stomach that kind of lost because some people last up to fifty percent and depending on the ... you know the ... position they are in their life depending on how close the our retirement it may be a good idea to reassess churn risk because here we are ten years it can't sustain this\nToo much longer in the last another year may last another two years I don't know I don't have a crystal ball actually I Do have a crystal ball in my conference room\nBut as a prop but I Do that purposefully to let you know that does not work\nAnybody says they have of course of all their lives to their teeth so no but everybody's got an everybody's got a perspective in in in a MSNBC and and the Yahoo and all of them they got all these suggestions but it you got to personalize it to you because it's your money\nIf you follow somebody else's lead in it and they thought it was a great suggestion is as an investment tip and you follow it\nAnd you lose you can't go back to them\nIt's your money and it's your fault it's your\nResponsibility so you need to step up\nAnd take responsibility for the solvency of your retirement plan and do something about it let's get it stress tests let's find out how it's going to happen or or how it will fare if we do have another two

investment plant that has zero can no risk but does have some steady growth\nAbsolutely again I Can't\nGo to the restroom almost seems like anymore without getting permission from the fact that\nOur

adjust take my Astros hat\nOff so I could the headphones fit better a\n... if we our our our our show is all about a building up wealth\nUnderstanding the markets understand in the world today and understand where we are going or bottle in our philosophy is to save aggressively invest conservatively that's the key to building up wealth over the long term to save aggressively invest conservatively\nAnd ... as we ... you know we talked about the markets we talk about savings in the importance of of of building up of wealth in in one of the ways to do that is not losing money which was\nA\nA task easier said than done this week uh for a lot of people in the markets in it you know there's certainly realizing that there's risk in the markets in and it it it's been a big shock to everybody\nInvolved or what happened now if you've been listening to the max out saving shall we been warning you we've had a very expensive market we have a very overvalued market and on the show last week we actually said we sure did you know are actually put hedge on for our clients last week this first time I've done that and about a year\nAh it it really we we we just said we we were talking we've been talking a lot about the NASDAQ we we said look at our of our two reports or do we said the NASDAQ accounting for Ninety eight percent of the S. and P. five hundred not the NASDAQ but five stocks the fang stocks plus Microsoft\nUh it was Ninety eight percent of the total Ehsan ... five hundred that's that was a warning sign we said you want to stay away from the NASDAQ sector in ... you want\nTo be careful with the market overall and uh you know we we we pointed out the interest rates were going up and and\nSure enough it was a time precaution ... and sure enough uh we've had just a lot of problems with this is a live show you can call us up at seven one three three three nine ten Seventy or if you\nCall to low how for yes\nOf course when you start interest on famous now\n[noise] you know that's a great question effort okay two years ago we had the lowest interest rates in the history of the United states and and so rates were we're not paying very much now ... the fed funds rate at that time with about point\nPoint one three percent and and now it's up to about two two and a quarter percent which means they're starting to pay more if you're banks not paying interest I Would look at some people are we use TV America trade holder assets you can purchase a a a a money market fund\nTheir uh their money market fund that you have to make sure a lot of the money markets some of the money market funds aren't paying anything she got a check your money find if I wanted if you should be getting at least one point six percent on money fund or more right now are close to it\nAh overall how you can do a little better out for the other thing is you do what you can go down to your bank and ask ask how much a one in two years C D pays it in in that that that could give you a little bit more funds that way or the problem with the banks is a lot of the banks are paying you virtually zero on your checking in savings accounts or they're just sitting there\nAnd and so ah the the difference between a zero in two percent is a pretty big big amount of money in so I Would first of all I Would talk to the bank I Would say you're concerned about it what can you do I would look at CDs\nOn that ah check with a couple of other banks to see if they have better CD rates is well you can take money from one bank to another\nAlso you can talk to a a you could go to like a a a ... mirror trade a Charles Schwab it in and just say you would like to ask them what their different money market funds are paying and look at those those are short term a ... that says that help\nThem to go up on\nYeah it's going up almost everything in in which ... either your CDs to your loans your to your car loan is off priced off of the treasury rate in the treasury rates have gone up the benchmark for the short term rates is either the\nThe three month treasury bills or the uh the fed funds rate it and so those are really been going up I mean a ... probably up close to a a one whole point in the last year [noise] so uh yeah so rates are starting to go up\nTo like live or what you got\nThere it should yes it should your rate should be going up\nYou know what\nOther quick thing out for the government did some work on money market funds over all\nEnd up so you want to make some of the money funds are much more conservative but they're very short term and they're not paying ... check with them you want it basically have a short term or medium term money market fund or a CD is what you're looking for price with a couple of banks see what your bank is going to offer and then make a decision\n[noise] okay thank you sir\nYeah but I think you just have to ask them questions out for in ... you should be able to get a better rate if you ask what the CD rate to look for science this is your concerns of money you don't want to take a lot of risk\nI think suffered a great question\nA really great ... that's one of the things that's going on out there is is uh yeah I was talking to one of our clients the other day and it and he had so\nMany elsewhere and I said look check your checking to make sure you're getting paid a decent amount on those money markets a because there's different types of money markets in summit particularly at the banks they're paying you zero on your money and so you can just go to a\nAh we're in the uh I think the federal treasury money market right and I think we're getting about one point six something\nIt's going up here recently so I don't have the exact number\nThat's a lot more than if you took the bank getting zero in so interest rates are moving up we had the highest interest rate in in in seven years in the ... and the ten year or\nLast week a early this week and last week when rates where it a\nThree point two five so doing a little work you can pick up some extra money if your money is at the bank and they're not paying anything check with another bank and ask them what the CD rates are and ask them what you can do to get it up you know you don't want to get caught where they convinced you to try to buy a new a tea or something but\nJust there there's ways that they can boost boost up your returns but you got to ask questions at the bank\nSo ask questions that's one of the key things what can I Do to get a better rate\nDo you get any questions or comments seven one three three three nine ten Seventy here under ... saving show or what ... what a week in the markets are you looking at some of these returns it ... it's pretty remarkable a number of the the the indexes were down over five percent ... down ... percent on the\nAverage ... if you look at him and I'm\nAn ... he was down four point one percent\nOr the ... at the dad was a four point or two percent or the NASDAQ was down to only three point seven eight percent you say a hothead well you said that was going to go down more well it went down the week before in in the NASDAQ in the in the ass and be held up\nIn ... and so looking at the bottom ... uh you know really so far the uh uh uh this decline\nThat they did the Dow was near the bottom I ... I think it was that about seven point two percent to\n... that that was down seven point eight the essence he was down seven point to the uh uh the Canasta\nComposites fallen ten percent in the last about ten days so ... and this is this is really what uh what we've been talking about what these markets is is is just a tremendous amount of risk\nA you know you're pretty much back to where the market at one time a Thursday and yesterday was trading back where it was in July in in May of this year so you know you you gave up\nOne two three four four or five months of returns in basically two days ... and this is this is a danger in these markets you get really expensive markets you know we talked a lot on the on the on the ... saving show about the the price to the uh the ... the ratio the price to to\nMax out savings advisors we have a risk they die you're destined for retirement\nIf you would like some help managing your retirement go to max out savings dot com to set up a point sets max out savings\nDot com\nDowntime with your family that's your downtime pure hydrogen middle to ... green specialized hollers bucket ... when you're not working using groom him money self ... monitors services was here the hydraulic systems or keep your equipment was\nSelf ... to design them in Seoul hydraulic system for mobile and industrial applications\nTo oppressive manufacturing well when you think ... the hydraulic shock\nI Am Sam alone you know me as the host of the morning show right here on AM ten Seventy the answer but I'm also the owner of Houston's cutting edge\nMedia somebody called five well new media had by twelve new media we three amazing videos\nTo companies use on their website selling their story involves all her for the sighting animation Bradley had five twelve new ...

Brecht city in Europe you've got the Italians threatening to leave and they get ... in a big\nProblem there you you've got a ... if you look at South America there's ... birds\nVenezuela's collapsing Argentina's in his financial problems Brazil's got a new president coming up and\nAnd that's that that they have problems there markets him sold off and then if you look at it and it just the huge problems with Iran and Saudi Arabia in Syria Israel in the middle east in it's a real concern in the turkeys markets have collapsed all over the world in the ... really the biggest one is really China I\nYou know we've been talking about China a ... Jamie diamond make two points he was impressed with\nWith by the way I went to look the points backup I heard him on a Bloomberg Radio in the mornings are driving in and and uh\nThey vanish they ... they just gave but\nWhat Jamie Dimon said he was very impressed with ... they're negotiating tactic of of getting getting a deal with the ... with the Canadians and the Mexicans and then going over to to the European then going over to China he thought that was very good strategy was very impressed that's a lot of positive things this goes back to what we've been saying for a month or two that look\nUnderneath it you've been hearing about a trade skirmish who per year we've been saying it's much worse than the last couple of months and say look\nThe establishment now realizes that threat with to China and they're coming on board this is a tough policy it is a hot trade war and it's going to be problems and that's what we're seeing so a lot of things are happening a lot of negatives are starting to hit the market and this is one kind of research on what we get some calls stacking up let's take a call from Oscar Oscar\nYes that's it you know what Charles fair but you know this very hike or get another that from people and yet the burden and people don't realize how much of it that could really is\n... I mean I think I don't even think uh the the inflation numbers take into account interest rates for ... and I I I I for one belief rising interest rates has actually inflationary and there's not a lot of\nWork for property taxes are inflationary too and so I I that's the way I\nBelieve in that but and then you're talking about what's happening all over the world with with countries you know that we're we're there you know there are no a drain on that thing is that there's no there's no there's no control over the world to the dollars\nThat well the fed is starting to drain so now we do put too much in the world and people borrowed too much money there's massive debt in the United states that honestly if we don't look back on the world to look at the emerging markets there complete mess as in so\nGet like Brazil or any of these countries they don't have no dollars to pay back what they already oh and nobody's going to invest any more than a broken country that'd\nBe soup yeah I mean right now we're kind of the best house in which the swearing to be a a bad neighborhood let me ask\nMy real question and all of this the it'll be like on TV I watch and they say well let's get another typical you know four or five percent slip you know the the downturn and I'm thinking what are they talking about they they think that there is a very you know like four or five\nPercent drop or for the most\nAnd I'm thinking whoa wait a minute a different world than than than if you're ... years ago and\nThey say they don't think this is nothing what's going on right now and and that to me I don't think it's I think there's more to it than what they're saying\nNo I I think so I look I mean the question is how does this play out but he doesn't look good and I think\nAll of this turmoil is a ... I think it won't sell until after the election because if the Democrats take the house okay you dating you know Trump with his agenda\nAnd they're going to cut into Trump's power and I think that I I think the American another like if the ... they could take the house\nNow we got we got three weeks for people to get worried and you know what I'm hearing you know had one of the top a pawn shops in the in the uh country combined talk to me and they're like hey we think you know some of the people they had\nThought sixty five percent chance of Democrats when she got three weeks of complete turmoil here I you know I think he got to really have a risk management plan in place for your essay I ended up\nHere in Vermont fairly for next month of the elections are over so\nOkay thanks I was going to it's a good point to it let's take another call from Randy although Randy ... pretty good\nHere the ... you know you were talking about ... euros down you know ... you know and and I was kind of looking at liquidity and um and the spread of stocks and things like that and I remember I think we talked about it's about\nTen years ago when that when there was no ... we had Dan ... Fifteen twenty twenty per cent\nSpread Brad GSM and\nNobody wanted stocks [noise] I'm not saying that now so much so I got a barrier but there's a sense to me that the the the big boys the big banks and pension people you know or\nOr start selling and they try to scare the little guys like me you know into panic selling and then they come back in through things up so um that's kind of aware fail it but it's like you said the economy seems to be fairly stable\nAnd uh uh and they do have growth in the economy vote we I think we've gone over extended over a little bit but\nI don't know if there's any reason not to necessarily better there\nWell I tell you a couple of thoughts are first of all the spreadsheet don't see I tell you where you see and what we're icy and okay you're not going to see describes where I see to spread this when we call in\nTo our traders TD America trade in in in and they've got computer programs like head we can get this thing done uh go into the market I think he probably looking at a seven percent or a seven center five seeing her three sent\nMove that they are ... up or down depending were buying or selling in those spreads that the computer programs are telling them to get beyond that are are starting to really why napping here uh so so you don't see the spreads when you pull up your little account\nOr not your little account but when you look on the regular system you're not really see when you're seeing you know a\nThousand to buy or whatever we're ... we're getting is computer programs behind the scenes telling us what those real spreads are to get size out which you know when we're buying or selling something we tend to be substantial in so we're not that substantial ... compared to\nYou can get a decent return a look I I get a church here somewhere that uh where is it a whole bunch of ... the two year treasury yields has gone up above the DSM ... five hundred dividend yield for the first time since two thousand and eight\nOkay it's average the two year if you look at the line average close to zero through a good chunk of that time frame and now it's a well over two percent\nSo uh it's that's competition for stock so you can the bill unlike any time in the last ten years you cannot put money in cash and get paid a decent amount of return while you wait around and continue to make money\n[noise] uh predicted by and I'll take it all out star search\nOkay thanks Jerry you know keep you don't want limited everything but you know I think it would look at it we looked at a lotta thanks for the call Jerry or to get any questions or comments seven when three three three nine ten Seventy we ... we looked at I've been looking at this market uh we got defensive\nA real defensive about a week ago and we're already pretty defensive but we put the Hedges on in in ah\nThe what I'm looking at the church you know I'm looking at the Dow and uh tell you what I'm saying well look at the S. and P. here and I'm looking at this in worse right here\nWhen I see is we talked some about the the moving average if we don't do huge we're not we don't really invest based on technicals we're best on fundamentals in value but when we're trying to understand the market we like tons of like we look we kind of kick over that I'm looking at a market that literally\nWent from the fifty day moving ... above the fifty day moving average to be under the two hundred a moving average in two days that's extraordinary that's a huge drop in and then at rallies above it and one of the interesting things uh one of the things we're kind of struggling to understand is is\nIs that the indexes are ... under the hundred two hundred a moving average which is not real appear underneath the two hundred a moving average that the NASDAQ is that's not good that's really bad and but it should have rallied above it the\nThe index funds that cute cute cute ESP wire above the two hundred a moving average it I I don't know I don't know if if if that means that the buying came in on the SP why in the cute cute cues for retail\nFor it if it's sort of being kind of held up a little bit to not triggered the ... more self signals coming off of these these different programs and I don't know the answer to that\nBut but what what I Am seeing is is I is what I appears to be breakdowns from the bull market that that's going from two thousand sixteen\nOr up to this level it and to me that I don't think this is over with a I I think you've got to be cautious and really understand the risk and you have to have a risk management program in place for your for your retirement ... it just\n... everything is sort of going against the market the tide is kind of coming out right now and ah\nAnd ah the ... and it it's not just interest rates but it's it's the\nThe Chinese that there was a story this week actually it was a story but a vice president Pence had a very important speech a vice president Pence said that Clinton George W. Bush and Obama fundamentally misunderstood the Chinese Chinese challenge to China challenge\n... and he said he said they basically assumed that they would become a strategic partner over the last twenty five years or so instead what would it would instead what they are as a strategic competitor ah\nIn in ... and that's or strategic adversary I mean this is a I think the quote was actually strategic competitor I've got both fair but a ... that's a big difference between a strategic partner strategic competitor ... and he said well we kind of hope was we'd have China would be more toward a free market\nDemocracy rule of law and human rights and they all become part of the big global trading world ... and if you look what's happened since president Xi is come in\nIt it's you know the free market the ... the government's clamping down more and more on it they're installing communist officials on the boards of these companies if you look at the democracy or you know there's ... there's only the Communist Party if you're not telling the line you're out\nOr if you look at the rule of law there there there are there and\nThey're arresting people for corruption and people are disappearing and\nAnd uh they're stealing technology or they're not I mean it it just it ... they don't seem to be ... any type of rule of law and they're ... they're closing down churches and in putting in camps and different things like that and\nIn ... it's really kind of go into a hard line Chinese or the hard line communist\nPlace it's going to compete against us and that's so we fundamentally misinterpreted what was happening in China and this is a big deal for the vice president of the United states to say they were not the the patch last\nPast three president said we thought they basically he said they thought they were basically be searched Egypt or partner instead they turned into a strategic competitor and so this makes it very tough to solve China's problems and so all of this stuff is adding up and piling again now the good thing is we can bring those factories back it's good for the United states but\nBack to your four o one K plan you know\nHe now is it time to sort of be cautious in his we've talked about we've actually had some a phenomenal cars by the way this is the last segment so if you want to get in here uh seven one three three three nine ten Seventy seven when three three three nine ten Seventy or\nWe'll get your questions answered the if if you look at this\nEverything is sort of what the quantitative easing is ending that pushed up asset prices are interest rates are going up all keep in mind which one of the biggest drivers\nFor stock prices has been corporate stock buyback programs but their debt levels have gone up over the last five years quite a bit in and and so now the cost of borrowing money to buy to buy ... stock\nIs is is is starting to eat into profits in so they're going to slow down the stock buying too so that's another thing as so that's another kind of\nThing hitting the market and then if you look at higher interest rates were someone goes well look I can get\nTwo and two and a half percent or something like that on on a short term treasury or you know why that why do I need this again more pressure on the markets in all of this stuff is building up but what's happening with corporate America right now right now we have a China trade were all these\nThe bedrock of corporate policy in the last decade was look I can go close my factories down in the United states I can shift them overseas to Mexico or particularly to China\nThey'll go build the products over there I'll save money I can lead to all my workers in my profit margins go up it's a great deal and then the stock price goes up and I get my bonus\nIn it and so what's happened is all of a sudden we don't know what's going to happen\nIn China if you're sitting there with your supply chains are coming out of China if ... if this thing really blows up or something really bad happens those supply chains could be flat out shut down and you're out of business which means you're having to look and maybe maybe not pull everything out of China but you got to have a second alternative\nApple the vast majority of their products are made in China\nWill you know what happens if a board breaks out or something happens everything gets shut down you know instead of the the the two destroyers going within three hundred feet or a hundred feet of each other the destroyers crash into each other in a skirmish breaks out in in in in the end and boom we shut the trade down from China apples\nOut of business so they're going to have to start spending more money to reallocate factories are putting money in in in in Wisconsin now so they're gonna have to start spending money to put these factories in to build these things up or when you spend money at church eating into corporate profits or maybe you only have so much cash flow\nAnd and and so maybe instead of buying back stock you put into companies in the other thing with rising interest rates is a Frank minority of Guggenheim Partners said this week in right after ... uh uh that he made some comments that look we see if rates go to three and a half percent uh\nThe ... most corporations can lose a tremendous amount of their ... their instead it's going to be used to eat enough to pay corporate debt interests\nAnd as soon as that happened within ten minutes after he said on CNBC the market started falling apart again this week in it and it just shows you everything is kind of working at some now is the time to be cautious now's the time to have your defensive plan in place so into the ... could be\nShort term bonds it could be cash or it could be money fund or those type of things you don't sell everything but what you do is you decide hey what what am I pretty confident in what do I like what am I hey you know I've got a big profit what am I really this has been okay I kind of a you know\n... ... those are that's what you start looking and seeing because you know the market quite frankly to go up the new highs in here and so you have to understand that but but you have to understand you want to be more cautious the time everything is starting to work out the tide is coming out so you can still swim around some but you better be cognizant you learn to be caught when that\nThat tide is ... is coming out it's like when I'm fishing\nIn in you know sometimes we'll we'll run up on a on a bar or something and you know for racing down the river whatever you can get pretty far up in those bars and or a you know that tide starts coming down you better get off of that bar pretty\nQuickly otherwise you're going to get stuck up there not be able to get off in\nIn in in so uh it's the same thing with the market and so I I think you have to understand the world we live in today are in and say look you know those are some of the things you need to look at we're going to be writing about this and our ... said report which is coming out if you're not on the list is is a free list or do you do\nA state taxes we talk about

but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning as our primary focus\nAnd so that's you we love to help you if we could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and what are the areas that are probably the most important\nOf decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six or sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed anytime between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and\nThat's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll tell you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to make your seventies they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why would you take your sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive their will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy so an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy\nAnd I I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is a higher okay\nSo if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I've mentioned do we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at uh we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or
