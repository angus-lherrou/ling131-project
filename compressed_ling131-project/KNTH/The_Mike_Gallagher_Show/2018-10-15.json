Rio de at a Rio\nIs that the ... that\nHe basically converted sixty minutes into a pep rally\nThere are those who will see his ranch as worthy and those who will load them whatever unity can be made to exist by the president exists only within those camps that sixty minutes went looking for something greater is more proof than viewers needed\nThat their approach to the president left them sixty minutes\nOut match the president best isn't Leslie stall and sixty minutes according to variety magazine [noise]\nMeanwhile I Will play a little bit of a ... give you a taste of it um first of all Leslie stall asked the president about\nThis uh the possibility that the Saudi Arabians that the Saudis rather killed a Washington Post journalist in the embassy in Turkey the guy was seen going in and he'd been a critic of the king and the Saudi hierarchy and uh he\nWent into the embassy and was never seen coming out now there's a report that\nHe actually recorded his own killing on his apple watch\nSomething about the the way the the watches connected to the cloud and he had a recording going and the authorities the uh figured out a way to get it off the cloud it's just awful and the president was very very strong in condemning\nOr the possibility that he was that this man was murdered years ... number one this is of audio and video courtesy of CBS is sixty minutes and gravy cut one\nHow everybody what to take care [laughter] you know there's a lot to say\nThere's a lot at stake and [noise]\nMaybe especially so because this man was a report\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that if something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and they will be severe punishment\nFor me is very strong in his condemnation has very forceful denunciation of what could possibly be the Saudis um murder in this guy in their embassy\nBut the bottom line here is that the ... the president cannot get a break from the media and we get that we understand that I liked watching the CNN or the sixty minutes interview\nLast night because frankly I kept saying to myself and this was a a point I made this morning with a with a buddy of mine if you've been in a coma and you woke up yesterday just in time to watch the sixty minutes interview you think wow this guy's a breath of fresh air to the American people really elect a guy like this\nLook at the issue of climate change people on the left are so worried about the condition of the planet and I shouldn't say people on the left a lot of us are worried we're not oblivious just because some of us happened to be conservative doesn't mean we're we want the planet\nTo be harmed by\nAny man made\nFormula now\n... you look at the condition I mean anecdotally pollution rates are so low um smog in Los Angeles things of the past you see things that are ... definitely changing emission standards are so\nHigh right now we're careful as a culture about what we put into the air and the water we really are way more than we used to be is it enough well\nPeople get apoplectic about climate change you should be called global warming now they changed the climate change and the president's address last night the Leslie stall sort of suggested the way I Believe most normal Americans feel on this difficult subject\nYeah things might be changing they'll change back\nThey too hot or too cold it's too mild as to dry it's too wet that's what the climate dodge but the president and the president acknowledged last night on sixty minutes\nThat you know maybe it's not a hoax it's not necessarily a hoax he's just not sure that managed to blame\nFor climate change and furthermore he said it's going to all change back was his when he said and again this to me is what normal people kind of think this is the way people talk this is the way people feel most of us aren't activists\nMost of us aren't extreme on one side or the other and there's a lot of extremists in the climate change controversy which listening together to what the president said cut number two again from this ah really extensive\nPretty comprehensive chat that the president had with Leslie stall of sixty minutes\nDo you still think that climate change as a hawk [noise] but I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and Koreans have dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nAnd watch this huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean or anything to the level and you don't know whether or not that could have happened with or without man you don't know when you're a scientist your scientists that no I have noticed that disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nMight have said now I've seen the hurricane situations I change my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact [noise]\nWhat an ... I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about that is they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with like all those tests that they say when they say that and they haven't what about scientists say it's worse than have\nA [noise] you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda us they can't learn this answer is also has a political agenda\nBut he he talks like normal people talk frankly he talks like we talk he thinks like we think\nThere are scientists who are divided on this subject there's no settled science here he is right for every scientist who will tell you the United states of America is creating them contributing to the demise of the planet and the polar bears aren't going to have any ice in ten years you can find another scientist you says no no\nNot true there's all these different patterns and it's and there's no direct attribution or proof that man is contributing to the destruction of the planet that rhetoric advanced hyperbole I'm not a scientist I don't know the answer I don't I don't I don't pretend to\nI'm just telling you there is a debate there is an ongoing debate and it's okay to acknowledge\nThat there's ongoing debate\nYeah the climate is changing their hurricanes it's wet it's dry it's hot it's cold\nYou know I mean all this stuff that has thrown I bought a thrown out by people who worship at the altar of climate change is refuted and again I don't know what site is right\nThe president doesn't either he's just not sure man is causing climate change so those are the kinds of things that this president says that are refreshing that are appealing the\nRasmussen daily tracking presidential poll came out today he's a he's holding steady at fifty one percent according to Rasmussen the majority of likely voters approve of the job he's doing in spite of all that as being thrown at him\nAnd she wouldn't be she will interrupt every time he tried to answer she's she's walking all step out of all the answers yesterday in is is it that way in the past that people trade as the president in the United states\nWell actually it's yeah and that's that's par for the course I get a there is not one thing you said that I disagree with in terms of who you know what really played out how that played out\nBut it's business as usual and as long as he continues to be large and in charge and confident and cool and collected and firing when he needs to be hey it's I it's I'm fine with it\nI Would I I did not have a negative reaction and other than\nLook at her going after him and look at him wanting her away and answering questions you posed to a one eight hundred six five five might maybe Assad differently we'll find out\nYour voice coming up on this Monday edition that might Gallagher show and yes I'm going to give you the very unhappy ending to the bearing the dog story coming up next [noise]\nTen twenty eight with my Gallagher on AM ten Seventy the answer whether trafficking news editor weigh in two minutes\nCrucial message about life insurance a third of the people don't have life insurance card to buy it's complicated I've looked at it over the years you got to work out what you need to get a research to find the best quote\nAny more policy genius has made the whole process a lot simpler I Love policy genius compares quotes from the top life insurance companies to find the best policy for you\nTakes about two minutes to get a call if you don't know the first thing about life insurance they got all the tools to get you up to speed this is a real user friendly process over four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance\nPolicy genius doesn't just make life insurance easy\nThey also compare disability insurance home insurance even auto insurance so whether you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all shut your search good policy genius dot com about two minutes you'll be able to compare quotes and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones policy genius the easy\nWay to compare and by life insurance policy genius dot com [noise] mind Gallagher the phone with\nUs and below Jay peak project ...
