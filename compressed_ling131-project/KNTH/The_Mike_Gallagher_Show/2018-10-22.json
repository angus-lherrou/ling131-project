but it was gonna\nGive me hope but\nGot a chance of winning the other words if somebody's going to know something that we don't know and if you listen to my show\nSixteen you remember what it was\nThere was a little blurb and the New York post reported that Hillary Clinton who was going to have her big victory celebration at the Javits convention center because if it's big glass ceiling you know a woman breaking through the glass ceiling and reelected president of the United states and all of that\nShe had a fireworks display planned they were going to shoot off fireworks along the Hudson River after she claimed her inevitable victory and a couple of days before the election there was a little blurb for the New York post\nThat\n\nExplains that the Hillary campaign had quietly pulled the permits for the fireworks display and cancelled the fireworks display\nAnd I read that to you on air I remember saying to you I think this is a sign I'm telling you this is a good sign\nThey know something they know how silly it is the order hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe millions of dollars worth of fireworks and she could lose\nThe Hillary campaign know knew she could lose and of course we all know she did here's my little fireworks story two weeks before the midterm election\nPresident Trump's approval rating according to a brand new NBC Wall Street Journal poll is out it's the highest level that he's ever had in this poll it's forty seven percent and there is a very intriguing aspect to that number\nPresident Trump's approval rating before the midterm elections\nIs now officially at a higher level then former President Obama's was ahead of his twenty ten mid term elections in other words\nPresident Trump is now more popular according to a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll that will that broke rock Obama was at the exact same time of both of their president Xi's\nLet that sink in let that sink in\nI'm going to do something very similar to twenty sixteen because frankly there's a lot of optics that are the same there's a lot of the same things at stake this is a crucial election\nWe must hold the house we must hold the Senate and as we see this onslaught of thousands and thousands of migrants crashing through border fences and\nEntering Mexico and threatening to invade the United states as we see this happening unfolding before our very eyes I like our chances\nAs we somehow saw Brett Kavanaugh I'd get confirmed I like our chances as we see people yelling at a leader McConnell in a restaurant in lieu of all a guy screaming at him and disrupting his meal\nI like our chances as the media goes all land for the Democrats the way they always do big race in Texas\nBeto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz you got to hear this ABC reporter here's an\nABC reporter this isn't an opinion host this isn't a pundit this is a reporter for ABC\nYou got to hear this the reporters name is Paula Ferris\nAnd she's marching around covering Beto O'Rourke in

lot\nIt's not been widely reported the hill writes about it they talk about the fact that this is a higher approval than that Rocco bomb and had the Trump is more popular than I'd let that sink in for just a moment if you believe that NBC Wall Street Journal\nPoll you\nWouldn't believe it from the media coverage but let that sink in that we are now we're witnessing a president more popular at this stage of his presidency Denver rock Obama\nYou'd never get that from ABC NBC CBS you never take that you'd never get that take away from what is throated President Trump morning noon and night every
