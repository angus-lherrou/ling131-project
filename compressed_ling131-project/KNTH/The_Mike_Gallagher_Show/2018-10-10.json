I don't want anything to get a new way of of a a continued successful Trump's agenda president needs all the help he can get and\nListen I I guess in Nikki Haley is very popular but to get an email like the one I got from Dan of Chandler, Arizona I got to read this email from Dan\nHe writes Mike I always used to think of you is one of the most calm reasonable temperate hoesch but you absolutely blew it today with your uninformed unfounded mean spirited conjecture and innuendo around Nikki Haley\nYour accusation that Nikki Haley might be the anonymous New York times editorial writer was unforgivable ignorant and wrong because the times published an angry report does that anonymous letter written by Nikki Haley who condemned everything about the letter including the cowardice of anonymity\nNikki Haley has been a loyal superstar all captured the Trump Administration and you conducted your own little micro Kavanaugh lynching of her character looking like a complete fool\nThen you open the telephone floodgates to be All right not jobs calling her a Neal Kahn the favorite ... euphemism of contemporary anti Semite Sebastian Gorka told you off good will no he didn't\nHe he gently chided me and said be careful Mike at all of that they'll be like the mainstream media was not I don't want anything to get in a way of success for President Trump\n[laughter]\nAnd then Dan I'm Chandler, Arizona concludes by saying all and he he puts all kinds of bold letters together in caps and you put a lot of time and to this email when President Trump here's what you said about Nikki Haley this morning he will formally disown and condemn you\nAnd you'll have to stop playing your cherish clip of him praising you he won't be walking over to you again anytime soon today's show was the worst failure of your career\nOut yeah let's see what the White House plays out\nLike that ... many people have been fired by President Trump's tweet by now\nIt will turn it off and I think it's I think how many people that that down in that Oval Office went down and it's an ... you know yeah yeah and that the last ...\nYou could see their faces and and it was a love fest yesterday\nDolly in many ways in the oval office the both of them as sort of the sort of a mutual admiration society which is great you know I'm ... I think one of the my theory about some of the anger that that people had over my reaction to the to all of this is that\nPeople don't want anyone to contribute to the median\nFantasy of chaos in the White House and I know there's not chaos and the White House I Know that that's a media fabrication and I know that this is not chaotic what I don't want anything to distract from winning we gotta win\nMan we got to win on November the sex and we got to keep letting this president\nTo continue with the enormous results he has gotten on behalf of the American people\nSo you know it was just bizarre I just wanted to share with you how odd it was that there were some anger a that just seemed very misplaced\nI'm and I again I I Want I Want this president to win and I want people I Want a winning team and if you liked Nikki Haley so much Dan of Chandler guess what why or why are you are celebrating her leaving\nAnd going into the private sector when this country needs her doesn't make a lot of sense almost seems a very almost like contrived\nNote odd stuff more coming up are tracking hurricane Michael give you the latest developing category for hurricane information and more stay with us\nTen twenty nine now but I gather you're showing him ten Seventy the answer why whether traveling a news coming up in one minute [noise]\nMine's gambling mornings with assemble loan loading show with Jay ... news along with ... in the morning information and entertainment weekdays from the conservative team and capital of the world on AM ten Seventy the answer\nNow you can save up to half off on closing restaurants home improvement item area transit\nMore gain the ages of new online shopping site called Houston say go to Houston saved dot net in this week's selections their new items out any way to keep checking to see what's new is so you don't miss out on something great go to Houston save dot net this week we're featuring family more back to the Lone Star\nFord museum and half price isn't the gallery one aviation history and more you go to Houston things not to get your tickets\nDistantly conservative we do not apologize for that we do not think our listeners suffer from talk radio fatigue we think they're energized every day\nWe are always conservative we are ... them and be the answer [noise]\nWith\nNews how much time I sing in\nAs hurricane Michael causes it on the Florida Panhandle those who didn't evacuate when they had the chance now being told they're probably on their own if they run into trouble\nBeing achieved Brock Long says Michael is a dangerous category ... hurricane maximum sustained winds of one hundred forty five miles per hour and ... well above that\nIt's expected to make landfall early this afternoon along Florida's Gulf Coast flooding rains and potentially deadly storm surge are expected and after Florida Georgia and the Carolinas expected to feel the impact of the storm rip off\nInside if you're Charles Grassley says it's time for his Democratic colleagues dial back their dangerously divisive rhetoric on Wall street a sell off underway the Dow down three hundred sixty five points more details said that's alright news dot com [noise]\nUses am ten Seventy the answer\nYou in life is an important one am ten Seventy the answer we're interested in hearing about how we are making a direct him positive impacts all your life\nEach day our hosts scan through your busy world of responsibilities challenges and the desire for personal growth and every day or wish they would you hear positively affects you and your family we may be your main source of much needed information only provide your perspective about the news that is true fooling\nTimely maybe is giving you unique insights that just the right time we would love for you to tell us about it here's what we want you to record a video message on a camera or a mobile device and share your story with us for simply sharing your story with us he will be automatically eligible to win a grand prize\nOf an apple I've had through my hand in apple pencil us until October twenty third to share your stories today and good am ten Seventy the answer dot com and use the word story for all the details contests rules tend to submit your video that stadium ten Seventy the answer dot com\n[noise] on the cayenne th at all and I and I had I hard\nRadio the sea is am ten Seventy the answer\n[noise] stuck in traffic we got the answer [noise]\nHit us out of ten thirty to thank you for listening to a um ten Seventy the answer and the Mike Gallagher show if you'd like to join the conversation away you know Nikki Haley one eight hundred six five five my one eight hundred and six five five am I.

about to see why\nThey put their faith in a guy like Don Lemon who is just as it becomes on glued when a gash rightfully points out that Democrat\nActivists in protesters who chased a U.S senator out of a restaurant are indeed a mop\nDon Lemon doesn't think that's mob mentality Don Lemon is a Democrat period\nBut let's listen to the lady who almost became president ever so close ... close she could she could feel that you could taste\nBut alas she didn't make it across the finish line the American people rejected Hillary Clinton and she still can't quite get over it evidently listen to what she said about Democrats Republicans\nAnd civility this is a cut number eight audio courtesy of CNN\n... criminal ... political party that wants to try to form for what you care about that ... if

understand\nShe's saying do you can't be civil with Republicans not until Democrats gain control of the house and the Senate she almost became president\nWith that kind of mindset and of course thankfully the voters saucer or hurt or call them deplorable ... herder demean more than half the country with the wave of her hand\nKnows who she is and what she is\nBut you're not going to have a Democrat in today's party condemn Hillary Clinton's comments you're not going to have a Democrat\nCondemned the behavior of these protesters who are hounding Republicans and conservatives in the public space chasing a Fox News channel personality through the subway in New York\nHarassing him trying to get people to to try to incite people against him\nLove to know what would happen if these two so called Democrat liberal comedians who've a rash Brian kill me it on the subway with the video rolling 'cause they think they're so cute if somebody stuck a knife in Bryan kill made what they'd be saying that they took the video down by the way from their stupid no nothing cowardly\nSite but these are Democrats here's a Democrat Don Lemon looking check this video out last night he's got Matt Lewis a Daily Beast columnist talking about the behavior of today's Democrats again don't get don't get\nFooled or snow covered by labels like antifa or\nFascists or even protesters right these are Democrats who are Shea hounding and harassing people in public listen to die and lemon with Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis listen very carefully\nTo what a liberal Democrat host like Don Lemon it has to say about this mob behavior from the Democrats\n[noise] is it my behavior no it's not ... ... people who are that and they're angry with the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy with no matter who have before you jump in okay I make up why I Can't make it even the rub thing we have\nA you know you're in you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you are giving a liberal\nOr a moderator and host of this and I try to tell you that you're giving up on tell me why they do a thing it's\nNot about look up the word mob and the dictionary yeah I definitely\nLook up the word modern the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the count the times I ever felt and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest\nYeah and it doesn't say where you can ... higher than the handle what man as clean as\nOkay okay I have a drink so you can do whatever you want and you can leave that so if you want but let me finish I'm not well maybe not going okay well then set up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much\nIn the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want it doesn't tell you that you can't do it at a restaurant and doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field and tell you that you can't do it on the cable news shows\nYou can do whatever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right is just beyond\nWhat a jerk\nAnd more importantly he reflects an attitude of today's Democratic Party because nobody's condemning\nThat belief that that's not mob behavior to chase them a a a husband and wife who just want an evening out to have a dinner out of a restaurant shrieking and screaming at them and cruise ship them no no that's not my behavior says Don Lemon and use shot up Matt Louis for daring\nI'm doing fine thanks my good\nMy position is is um ... especially with the comment from Dr Lehman that you can protest anywhere any time a decision I say we should take on a stronger position and give them you know it's like fire fight fire with fire and that means let's show up at\nCNN let's start the same tactics you might not agree\nWith you know I Do because because I didn't want to do what they are I don't I really don't
