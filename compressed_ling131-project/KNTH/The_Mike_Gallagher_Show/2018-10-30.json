Pittsburgh\nUm and yet the rabbi of the of the synagogue where this took place\nHe told CNN very clearly how he feels I was show appreciative and show relieved to hear\nFrom the the rabbi who was on

crackpot like her on a panel\nAnd incidentally for the record she later apologized when she recognized the backlash that she was receiving on social media she she did back up her words a little bit where she backtracked to some degree not much\nBut to some extent she apologized that's a gash on CNN they invited that there was a guy on Fox Business the other day who said that the state department is infiltrated by George Soros Fox fired him because CNN went after that guy\n'cause she in and they all do this now I don't know if you've noticed this went on cable news now\nThey're all playing
