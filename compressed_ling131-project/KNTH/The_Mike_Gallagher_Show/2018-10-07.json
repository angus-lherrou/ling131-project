the strategy trap the history of the United states real estate is a fundamental part of every successful investment portfolio what you need to do is you need to get educated you need to get out there you need to find out what these strategies are\nAnd you need to steer clear of the flipping and mobile homes and the and all these other things that people are going to want to take your money teach you how to do\nAnd leave you with no money to invest it's really important to us that when you're done with our program\nAt as as you've gone through the initial training you're going to be a member for life but when you've gone through that initial training you have the money in your pocket you need in order to actually to what we're teaching you to do that's our measure of success lifestyle some limited\n[noise] so what do I mean by creating wealth and passive income\nPassive income as your key to retirement I by definition if you're actively working you have a W too or you're working in your own business you are still working you're not retire if you have enough passive income\nTo cover your monthly expenses\nTo pay for your lifestyle every year and I remember at the beginning of the program we talked about that lifestyle design hey this isn't a thirty five thousand dollar a year lifestyle that Motley Fool is proposing\nYou're taking everything that you want to do and your

the life that you want to let\nYou know and if you have to start with single family houses two hundred and fifty three hundred and fifty dollars a month you buy enough of those and you can retire\nIf you have enough income to start in multi family we suggest that you do so why because of the way most of my family is valued single family homes are valued based on what your neighbors are buying and selling properties nearby for no matter how well you run that property you're not going to double the value of it\nIs based on what your neighbors are paying for properties in your area with multi family the property is valued based on that operating in time if you can make a ten percent improvement and not operating income\nI you're going to do some water conservation and save on\nUtility

sales are better prices are less customer actually got\nTwenty thousand dollars more than they were asking on their home and we hit insulated their home less than a year ago\nSo not that the insulation alone was causing factor but it sure didn't hurt Supreme about that and then we'll just talk about solar addict fans why this is a good time of year to do it we most think ... ... fans is there to remove heat from the attic and it certainly does a good job at that\nHowever we're going to talk about how it also removes moisture odors sometimes you have some funky odors and your attic whether you had a critter that died up there or you had a we went to a house that actually had a fire\nAnd unfortunately and they had mitigation and they had all of the cleanup there's natural with any kind of incident like this St got everyone in the home was okay\nBut there was still in there still was at a lingering smoke smell so wouldn't that be a great great cause suicidal addict fan so we're going to talk about all\nOf these things and of course we're going to talk about battles and why we give them to you for free why did we flew to stop it so we can get air coming into the house in much more so than a talk during the show about all of those things give you a great offered that you can not turn away from [noise]\nAnd then help you get scheduled for your free attic inspection and ultimately get your schedule so we can make your house great again this is the energy our my name is Dave brown and we're talking about energy efficiency in your home why does it matter at all [noise]\nWhere do you lose most of your energy in your house is\nIt the walls is it the attic is it the flow within a talk about that I'll tell you I'll give you some facts we always talk from a factual based a knowledge database here I guess you when you do it so long you become a bit of a nerd which I have over this information\nBut ultimately when you're warming you're home during the winter insulation is this thing that's going to take care of keeping the heat in your house now when you went back to happen\nOr would you want to just do your hard earned money out into the street so insulation is always going to be your first line of defense in terms of keeping your house is he in the house [noise]\nAnd then when you want to keep that heat out of the house insulation again is the same exact answer\nI always try and toxic always at every show about what our value is now I don't mean oh you are not our values it's are like the letter our values\nAnd then you hear are value thrown around when when you're talking about insulation any type of insulation our value is always going to be discussed whether it be\nA blown in insulation batting insulation whether it'd be spray foam insulation each material has it's different set of our values so let me tell you what the our means our means resistance resistance to what days\nResistance to the transfer heat so what that means is if you have a higher our value you resist the entry of heat in the house during the summer months and you resist the exit of your heat or deleting of heat from your house during the winter so our values key\nIn every area has its own code that says this is what we deem as the right amount of our value to have\nSo they get house can be energy efficient\nSo if you're feeling that maybe your attic is not up to snuff this is a program for you to listen to keep listening it's going to be a great show and we're going to give you some special just for being the listener that only listening as of this show can take advantage of\nAnd we're also going to give us a very special offer if you plan on going any home and garden shows so stay tuned ah my name is David Brown this is the energy our and I'm the owner of advice you can visit us at attic buddies dot com\nThat addict buddies dot com where your friends in insulation business a whole motivation is to help you received the most you can for your dollars of course while giving you the maximum protection\nFrom the transfer of heat in and out of the house if we do that than we we've really done a good job I always like to say that we don't want to do every single house we just want to insulate your house\nSo stay tuned we're going to take a quick break this is the energy our my name's Dave brown and you're listening to the energy our with ag buddies dot com\nSee you are listening to the energy out with his age browse check out they've rounded out of buddies that I'm for low rates on installations lady embarrass solace addict as\nCIA your what would you\nDo if you're a he was running all day long why that's easy I call adding buddies addict buddy George loves them\nWelcome back this is a round and this is the energy our what we talk about ... ... how we can save money on your energy bills we sat there we have to we see\n[noise]\nWelcome welcome welcome energy what a word no energy it kind of ... it really involves everything that we do on a daily basis\nNow heat energy is really the robber of our physical bodies right if we get to how we get tired and I know I I get tired when I'm sitting on the heat and when we in our homes where we supposed to be really the most comfortable\nIt's pretty annoying when our house won't cool down\nAnd it's certainly an annoying and the other way around and we can't heat our house sufficiently enough\n[noise] now this time of year what kind of in that zone where it begins to get cool and\nMay not need your air conditioning as much and you're not quite running the heat and would you be surprised to know that this is the best time to insulate your home\nWell we you could think number one the prices of insulation are actually more affordable during this time so this should be the peak time for insulation or for doing a insulation drive on your home this should be the time that you take advantage of the prices number one\nOf the fact that it's actually cooler so you can get more work done in the heck if you want to be kind to the people who are doing the work\nRight but you also gearing your house up and getting ready for the next heavy season so if you do it in the middle of the season you really won't feel the full benefit truly important that you insulate during this time because\nYou're preparing your home for when it's going to need and use more energy which brings us right back to the song that we heard coming into after the break which is\nEnergy [noise] now [noise] insulation\nThe properties of it is that it has our value each substance has all that you've now\nThe blown in insulation which is what we use primarily an addict has our value of about a three per inch so you'll see that code is about Thirteen fourteen inches you multiply that Thirteen terms three that's going to give you a value of our thirty nine\nThat's like putting on one of the most comfortable downer feathered blankets or in a winter's day oh gosh you feel so comfortable\nOr vice versa it's like putting a shade of trees\nOver you on a hot day it doesn't allow the sun to penetrate and so when you slow down the penetration of the sun into your attic into your house you're cool down your house\nNow what happens with your energy usage and this is where we want to talk about the benefits of how\nYour energy bills go down because it's not fighting your AC unit or ... H ... system is not fighting against this heat it's really a thermostat that is doing all of the [noise] the brain work\nTelling a track system it's getting hot we need to kick in because whoever set the temperature they said it for Seventy two and it's starting to feel like Seventy five so Mr age back go to work\nSo now if you have more insulation you can give Mr age back arrest\nAnd we're in we're all kind of veterans of things and break at the most inopportune time isn't it funny how ac units tend to go out when it's the hottest right now what\nDust mites feed off a mold and dead human skin and they are just horrible creatures to having your attic if you were to install too so addict than based on your square footage of course sometimes only one\nYou would see it drastically reduced chance of getting mode and your attic call addict buddies eight three to four or five eight four zero three six for free estimate welcome\nBack this is a round and this is the energy our what we talk about ... than attic insulation how we can save money on your energy bills week after week after week [noise]\nThank you please thank you thank you [noise]\nThank you [noise] welcome welcome welcome\nBack this is Dave brown I Am the energy our host and it seems like they're applauding all of the special rates that we announced only for the listeners\nSurgery just tuning in we've been talking about a special rate on insulation I'm and we're going to give away some more free stuff but you got to listen to the program to get all of the benefits now the first thing we talked about was\nEnergy efficiency we tried to educate gee I always try to give you a nice framework on white different things to do and why you really need them\nAnd then I go into the details of how it really really works\nAfter that then I give you an opportunity to take advantage of some really great specials that's why it takes kind of an hour to really build up all this information and then allow you to take part of the things that you think would benefit you the most\nSo we talked about bone and insulation special rate of Ninety send a square foot for 'em by the way we used John Mannes insulation it's hypo allergenic and anti asthmatic it's the best product on the market\nI've seen other products and it's just not as good as this John man but products\nSo we use that blown in product we also do some really value added things that really help you along the way with the free baffles are we clear yourself it then so that keeps breathing [noise]\nNow once we've done all that and we insulated the attic and we have\nAir rated it and let let the air coming more now what we want to talk about is adding some active air flow at the Airflow what are you talking about days act of answer is\nThe installation I'm a solar addict fan so why should I Do that Dave well I'll tell ya [noise] ridge advance just are not enough ... will allow air flow to come out at a very slow rate maybe fifty\nSixty cubic feet per minute and it just doesn't keep up with the pace of the heat builds up and yet even during the cold months so you want to introduce active air flow now\nIf you have a really steep proof you probably won't need an act debate Airflow as much because this deeper the root for the greater the draw kind of like a woodstove when you have a longer um\nPipe you get more air coming through that woodstove and so the fire burn higher right so I had it gives the same way if you have a steeper roof you have a lot more draw that's coming through that addict so in that case if it's super steep you probably won't need an active air flow but most homes\nIn this region has shallow roof pitches and if they have shower\nRoof pitches will damned is nowhere for the heat to go and that ridge vent that's pulling air at about fifty cubic feet is no match for the Ames credibly powerful dirty wide Remington so addicts and pulls at Fifteen hundred and fifty Cuba\nPermitted oh my God [laughter] that's just a month\nThat night and day so you you've ever sat in front of a fan on a hot day and how good that feels but when you've been hot and you sit down and you get a nice breeze come across\nWell that's exactly what you'd be doing when you add a show addict fan you're adding active Airflow so can you imagine how your age fax system is gonna really love it now\nYou know imagine what age back at the age back system could talk what would it say\nI have a feeling you have a deep voice and it probably be like hey you may lead me up and is erratic all the time I'm ... that's just my rendition of what what what age back good sound like [noise] and jokes aside anything\nThat's it's an environment and it breaks down much more quickly so just just imagine if H back was human and how much it would love the idea of you at him and wanted to sell addict fans\nJust to cool down environment it would feel exactly how you feel on a hot day and then you feel that nice cool breeze it would feel relief\nSo many tell you exactly how this works\nThe sole addict fan takes energy thumbs converted to electricity and turns of fan that sucks the air out of your attic it brings it in dues to soften vents I remember when we talked about those free baffles that we were going to put into your attic\nWell that's where they come in handy\nThey come into play I should say they allow that air to continue to flow all the way up to the soul addict fans which is sucking air do at Fifteen hundred and fifty cubic feet per minute and if you have to that's three thousand thirty one hundred cubic feet per minute\nPulling air through your attic cooling the air and take\nExtending even further the life of the age ... system cooling down the interior attic therefore the heat transfer does not happen as much do insulation and ... and a layman of your roof doesn't get baked all day long\n[noise] it is a God powered which I Love to using that term so that you don't pay for the electricity every month like a wired band it's also like Tom ... and it comes with a built in thirty percent federal tax credit so therefore\nThirty percent of the price of the fan is given back to you in the form of cash and that's not a good deal I don't know one\nBut I Want to make it a lot more clear let's talk about the fan itself it's Eighteen by Eighteen all the way around Eighteen Inches by Eighteen Inches\nAnd it has a fourteen inch diameter hall so you have a four inches of flashing all the way around these are leaked proof they go under a layer a shingles and on top of the other layer so they're really active another layer of shingles to keep the water\nFrom coming into your attic and of course when bag buddies crew installers him we do I use a ... silicone so that we actually have another layer of protection so that you don't have to worry about that as possibly being a problem\nSo we talked about thirty watch all the fans Fifteen hundred fifty Cuban beat them in an era getting sucked into your addict cooling down the addict\nI'm at the rate of Fifteen hundred square foot per hour so you're turning over that air right when you do that you reduce the chances of mold and moisture [noise]\nIt has a beautiful censored ... into the attic and reaches true temperature not the surface temperature because there's always going to be had at the surface\nBut it's going to be a nice little dangling sensors hanging in your attic so that it reads humidity and temperature so humid if the humidity or rises above Seventy five percent it kicks on the fan if the temperature rises above eighty five degrees which is almost every day\nThe fan kicks on\nThat's the kind of real protection you went in your headache now\nOnce you do that here's what we want to have to you just as an added value this solar addict fan installed us to digitally and regularly nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars okay it's not going to be that much\nWe're going to take off a actually two hundred dollars so it's going to cost you seven hundred and Ninety nine dollars installed\nBut don't forget you're going to get to thirty percent federal tax credit so that's going to take on another additional two hundred and some odd dollars haven't done the math so you're talking about is just a little bit about five hundred dollars per fan\nAnd that's of value that you really can't say no to and if that is not enough we have instituted in New\nService that we wanted to unveil right now we're going to blow your roof off of pine needles\nAnd lead\nIf we're already up they're installing solar fans why wouldn't we then turn on our blower\nAnd blow off all of the debris deck and first of all cause leaks in your roof debris on your roof cause so much problems in this is the season where you're going to have more of it\nSo the value of that is normally typically we charge ten cents per square foot so now you can just call us if you weren't roof blowing will be happy to do it\nIs ten cents per square foot\nIn many of your roof area is\nGoing to be a lot larger than your addicts or an addict as Fifteen hundred square feet your roof could be about the thousand square feet\nSo were blown off for free when you get to a more fans installed so how's that I mean that's a real good offer [noise]\nI if you combine that with all the other offers the insulation if you get the installation and the soldiers and you're talking about uh you know almost a thousand dollars off whatever services that we're offering you\nFor you it's meant for the sun right so we're not talking about one two three punch we gonna knock out the sun and if we knock out the sun we are really we're protecting our home thank you you know this is like giving your home a big hug\n'em if you really love yourself you tend to be home if you love the country and your family you tend to love your home it goes hand in hand I'm so these products are expressions of love\nFor your house insulation if you have your house properly insulated if you got a Eli de lights where they need to be showing love for your house or you've got your home airtight as much as it can possibly be you're showing love for you on\nYour show love for HPV ... system you're showing love for yourself you're showing love for your investments\nAnd you know I work pretty hard for the things that I have accumulated over the years um they don't necessarily make my whole life but if I'm going to buy something and let him take care of it right [noise] so we're talking about another way to take care of beer with radiant\nFor you know some companies use to spray on radium barrier\nAddict but he says the green company so we stick with products that won't harm your house there no off gassing or any problems that might occur if you were to breathe in uh the material right so for that we don't abide by the spray on writing embarrass we use attack\nOn radiant point the radiant ... has a Ninety seven percent effective rate versus\nThe eighty five percent rate that you would get from a spray now here's the downfall of the spray the spray on is human dependent so if that person is in the attic and just this feeling lazy that day and\nThey don't want to fully cover the wall the decorating well then\nYou're not going to have a fully covered addict will you the beauty of the radio for is that you cannot get away with ... or ...\nI'm I'm trying to think of a polite way to say but doing it ... behind job [laughter] right family show so we'll we'll talk in terms that everybody can listen [noise]\nYou can't get away with that with the radiant for him so we're talking about a product that is going to be more effective and you can't cheat in any single way and then it doesn't give off any gases or anything it's a super tough durable um radiant for oil you know it looks like so before but it's not\nCheap like that it's really really durable I mean you can't rip it with your hands [noise]\nIt would take a you know act of Congress to poke a hole in this thing and then of course you'd have to have it have to be something super super shark we have to use razor blades to to cut sheets and then we install them right on the um\n[noise] the ceiling Joyce\nSo that whole entire interior the attic is covered whereas when you see them spray those Joyce never get sprayed just in between\nThe Joyce\nSo with that being a a an issue\nYou're really not getting your money's worth with the spray on and you're getting a product that can harm you and your pet send your children so that's why we chose the radiant foreign [noise]\nIt's a lot harder on us ducking promise you we can move probably at the rate of about two hundred three hundred square foot per hour so could be a multi day job on some addicts\nSome addicts don't need it to be quite honest I'm not ... it's really an assessment case by case thing\nRight so not every addict needs so we only recommend it to people they need it and he was a little secret uh I'll tell you a secret if you're not gonna leaving your house forever [noise] maybe you don't want to spend the money on the radio barrier a lot of people will tell you that\nIf you say you need it they will do it I think that that is a not in your best interest and I think that's not good there's\nSome of\nThat in mind and with the whole goal of helping you increase the value of your home we have to do and bound to do what it in your best interest so that doesn't mean no one should get it because we just recently did a job\nIn a house that really couldn't get any other protection and this was there forever homes all the conditions were right and then we said hey\nWhy don't we rainy and Barry this particular area it'd be attic and then to add if we can take care of that with solar addict fans and they did the job but it did the job they immediately the comfort level increased um no room that was hot it was now\nNot hide anymore it was neighboring a side attic and we also put some\nUm some batting up on the wall and a whole entire house felt immediately better\nWe love it when we get those reports are so here's what we charge for the radiant barrier for all right it is two dollars and fifty cents a square foot [noise]\nAnd it is a little bit more expensive than a spray on 'em at the same time the value is much higher with the attack on and if you're going to do something you you probably want to do it right so it's two dollars and fifty cents square foot was attack on us\nAnd worked every cent she if you add that to a proper insulated attic\nA solar addict fans right and you have your roof blown off so you have any potential fire or any leaks that can occur from needle pine needles or\nTo breathe so forth you really made your household again and this is a really important thing to do in the off season in the season when it's not burning up\nBecause the prices the labor and all of the benefits are going to be much more affordable right so let's go back and let's look at everything that we talked about so we started out learning about our values our value is the resistance to the transfer of heat\nWe want to keep it out during the summer we want to keep it in during the winter\nWe talked about how are we can add our values and what it does to the different devices that you have in your house how it extends to like a life of H. back system how it extends the roof ... under lame and observe I've seen roof that looked like a you know\nLike a a a ripples or ruffles potato chip [noise]\nYou don't want to have a ruffles potato chip roof\nOkay so we talked about that and then we talked about some of the great special that you get when we come out for free estimate with data base number one you're going to get a free estimates which is the first whole idea of it all [noise] Ninety send a square foot rate on insulation\nOr you're going to get free baffles free software Cleary right and then if you get to solar friends in stone ... get free roof blowing of needles and pine needles thing everything else that can really damage your house right and then the radio barrier speaks for itself it's two fifty square foot\nWorth every penny works better than the spray on\nAnd it will do your addict some good it creates a barrier where the heat actually never enters into the attic\nA low in Mississippi the rate of this product so that means on one side all the heat would be behind it if you put your hand on the interior side you won't even be leaked that's called very low a Mississippi rates trying to say that fast it doesn't even Mitch\nOr transmit the through into the act so your cooling dang addict extending the life of all of the wonderful things that you play step in there okay so we're the last thing we talked about is special home and garden show rate\n[noise] number one if you come to us without going into the home and garden shows because unless you got other things to to look at I Would say go take a look but if you're going to home and garden field again insulation definitely come to us at first you don't have to walk anywhere you can just pick up the phone dollar number\nAnd get the home and garden shows special bring us any literature if you do go and ...\nThe deck price whatever price it is and will give you a lot more service and we'll give you the experience of a company that knows exactly how to install insulation properly which three baffles that keep their photo shop for clearing\nWe'll give you a really good advice in terms of what you need and what you don't need a it's not about giving

against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nLowered talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart beat who very important factor in life\nYou would take them\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium the fish and say okay you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's not due process and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so\nIt's nothing to really mess around with that what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our

seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's their link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like\nTo discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spin the nickel magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more arrests or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting goal in life you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nAccounts they may need
