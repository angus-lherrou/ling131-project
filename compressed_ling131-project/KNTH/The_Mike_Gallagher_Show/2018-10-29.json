higher\nThan Brock Obama at the same point in both of their presidents these but that's exactly what is happening\nThe latest Rasmussen Reports daily presidential tracking poll for today shows the fifty percent of likely us voters approve the president's job performance\nAs we get nearer to the mid term election the president's approval rating keeps climbing\n\nPresident Brock Obama had a an approval rating on forty four percent on October twenty nights two thousand and ten\nThat was of course right before a week before his party the Democrats suffered a huge losses in the twenty ten midterm elections this bodes very well for us\nThis bodes ... very well for Republicans and Americans who want the president's agenda to succeed\nThe Democrats want to stop his agenda and they are doing some of the most unimaginable things to try to do so I'm going to give you an example there's a big story a breaking story with the thousands of migrants illegals hate calling the migrants because it sounds so warm and fuzzy doesn't it\nIllegals who were marching towards the southern part border thousands and thousands of them\nThe president is warning them you'd better you're better stop you better turnaround in fact the president even sent a tweet\nJust moments ago that says many gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border please go back\nYou will not be admitted into the United states unless you go through the legal process this is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you\nWell that's true the Pentagon according to a U.S official today will deploy up to five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border about Twenty one hundred National Guard troops are already fanned out across the border according to\nA department of homeland security official who spoke to USA Today on the condition of anonymity there will be five thousand active duty troops more added to the border\nWe don't

slicker colonel colonel collector who wrote a a great book about the militant normal you need to get it and courage says it over and over again talks about normal ... having to be in charge\nNormal Americans understand without a border there is no country\nAnd normal Americans are appreciating the president saying I got to send the troops to the border to keep these thousands of illegals who are in this organized caravan from crossing the border and editor in our country illegally turned back you know the Mexico offered them asylum\nThe Mexican government said we will give you health care we will help you we will we will houses you we will clean clothes you we will help you know we don't want Mexico we want to get into the United states that's the land of opportunity\nWithout a border we

the last caravan that they ... frenzy about actually only brought fourteen or by the end of the care of and they know it's ...\nAnd there are spreading hatred or across America and and at the end of the day may ... again inspiring people like miss Pittsburgh mass murderer\nCan you ... slip those words sink in this vile disgraceful excuse of a TV commentator blames Fox News and the president\nFor the massacre as if somehow the massacre at the synagogue had something to do with this thousands of illegals who were marching towards our board\nDid you hear Joe Scarborough say it's a lie that this was an election issue oh it's an election issue dummy it's definitely an election issue you may not like that it's an election issue you may prefer that people didn't pay attention\nTo these thousands of migrants marching towards the border but it's most definitely election issue you Shane its ally doesn't make it so\nDespicable and Americans are paying attention all this crap is happening a week
