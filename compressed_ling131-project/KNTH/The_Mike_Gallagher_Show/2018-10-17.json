shattering about Trump's calling porn star Stormy Daniels horse race\nThe economy just keeps booming uh and uh the world the world is noticing and the culture a couple of interesting things I started my day with a knock down drag out argument with a dear friend of mine and it's okay I mean Mark Davis and I I'm\nNot don't always agree a hundred percent we definitely don't agree on this one has to do with something in the culture to culture pieces to culture stories I Want to share with you I watch the counters last night the reason I watched it because\nI'm a lot of people didn't watch it I don't know if the ratings are out yet last can you check the overnight and see what the news is about ABC's re boot of the Roseanne show\nA big they fired her for her tweet about Valerie Jarrett\nI wasn't gonna watch and then I read somewhere that she didn't want anything bad to happen to the show because she wanted her friends and the people she had worked with for many years to be okay so it wasn't like Roseanne herself was calling for any kind of a boycott of the show and I was interested to see how it how it was and actually it was very good\nIt was Roseanne without Roseanne but it was the same vibe it was it was really a good good after show\nAnd it dealt with the fictional death of Roseanne Connors the character dying of an opioid overdose or she died of a prescription medication overdose which is a very real story line\nFor many people in this great country of ours\nAnd I happened to be a big fan of Laurie Metcalf the character actress who plays your sister Jackie\nThe day encounters or played by John Goodman I I think he's a tremendous character actor and they put they put out very very powerful performances and you know we're going to see how it plays out uh again I watched it only because\nI didn't think that it was um something that she she wanted to show to to succeed even though she's obviously very upset about being fired and\nFor good cause one tweet have you heard\nBill Maher lately have you seen Chelsea Handler lately what about Cathy Griffin you go down the list of people who say the most horrific things about conservatives about Christians about Donald Trump about Republicans that's all fine Roseanne one offensive tweet and she's done\nNow\nWhat's interesting is and I've got the argument on tape we're gonna play a little bit of it I don't think Marco mind because there's the movie the first man and I'm going to revisit the controversy only\nBecause I find that kind of interesting as we lead up to a mixture she at the bottom of the

and when I Walk in the morning it was all over\nThe news and I'm like oh\nAnd that's characterized as racist so it's just made my stomach off my feet and then the network called and said [noise]\nPossible fast can you have for something you've done which is I forget the ball and some other way that I can remember [noise]\nAnd then I had\nI'd be happy to go on all all the ABC Show is fine and apologize fat I they said no I wasn't allowed to do now\nNot too long after that my mom was watching TV and saw that it was canceled\nVery sad to see that um she uh sent out a statement today saying Roseanne was the only show on TV the directly addressed the deep divisions threatening the very fabric of our society specifically the show promoted the message that love and respect for one another's person who'd\nShould trends and differences in background and ideological discord the show brought together characters of different political persuasion and ethnic backgrounds in one unified family\nAbove all the show celebrate a strong matriarchal woman in a leading role something we need more\nWe're up in our country is that the ratings had a solid serious premier last night the counters it was second in its timeslot at last a CBS but it beat the voice on NBC and had about Eighteen point two million\nTotal viewers will see how that were that goes from here [noise]\nHour as we were all along here I Am ten Seventy the answering the gallery show President Trump's me criticized withholding Stormy Daniels the orange dark horse race horses detractors mail to point out she's been said in the most disgusting things about him I Want to get your take on the president and fighting back against his enemies also genetics just joined us to talk about the great responds his movie\nCapital of the nation has receipt that's next hour right here on AM to Seventy the answer\nBreaking news breakneck face serious he stole my Gallagher show\nWe're not going to make America great again there was never that\nWay I felt like we got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... districts Nineteen Seventy eight Mike Gallagher has been a voice so clarity for millions of Americans say those oh it\nWas funny if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the ... started\nDown shown owned by the most famous man on the planet\nAnd you've been grade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studios mice yeah like\n[noise] we had a comment\nHillary Clinton about threatening Americans would say [noise]\nYou know if we win in November civility can return of course are inherently threat is that up to the point of the midterm elections there is no civility when you know people do low Democrats kick 'em [laughter] and of\nCourse the other part of that an implied threat that inherent threat is that if the Democrats don't win on November the ... which like it or not is a more than a distinct possibility they're never going to be shovel\nI guess they're never gonna ever\nHave a civil adult exchange with those\nWith whom they disagree and then the law comes President Trump and he called Stormy Daniels\nOr space in a tweet yesterday\nCue the righteous indignation cue the screaming and yelling\nHow dare he I mean what a shocker President Trump called somebody you name we haven't heard that in two years have way\nLindsey Graham I saw him on TV this morning saying he's the president he shouldn't do that now the first thing when Senator Graham said who is a staunch Trump defender and supporters seems supports the president has a president's agenda to do right by the American people which I think\nAll these Americans should should be the way that's the way most decent Americans should feel Lindsey Graham started by saying he's a fighter remember she has said awful things about him\nNobody ever notice is that nobody ever remembers when he call somebody a name they have said plenty about him\nPreviously and that's what people mean about a fighter here's a here's our Ari Fleischer\nHe was on Fox News later this is number eight a here's Ari Fleischer\nSaying that how Trump hurts himself when he calls a porn star like Stormy Daniels a name like horse race here's cut aid from Fox News and brave you\nKnow center of this is where the president has his own worst enemy he's in the middle of a victory and he takes it down if you're not just by engaging in that kind of unnecessary rhetoric\nWhat's happening over call anybody horse face and just don't do that when you're the president or a mosque in some ways of the way they put out about Mika Brzezinski\nTests as American counterparts so hard hit off on his himself as something he can actually pretty this for that for the last eight ten twelve months and hair as they can return to that type of mistaken over ... I was she went in case like that to\nDiminish says what if the proper victory a set of hitting home runs that headed up now I I don't say there's\nGonna be disparaging about our our Fleischer I think he's a nice man I met him a few times and ah he served of\nCourse in the Bush administration\nI'm so he's a an establishment guy he knows the establishment world very well but don't you find it fascinating and again I don't mean there's just respectfully towards Ari Fleischer\nBut isn't it isn't an intriguing to listen to a hundred and that's what ... is now he's like me like me and he's a he's ... he's a guy with an opinion\nWe all have some of them have some of us have platforms whether it's Ari are appearing on Fox News or maybe what the radio show we're we're we're basically just guys and gals with opinions so we are\nWe're not we're not really that we're not certainly an elected leadership were not in the government\nWe can impact people I guess I suppose it's fair to say we can change hearts and minds but in the scheme of things we're certainly not as ... we're certainly not as important as the leader of the free world\nDon't you find it fascinating that Ari Fleischer thinks he can tell this phenomenally successful president\nHow he's making mistakes\nIn other words those who writes or who opine can sit on the sidelines and say oh you're making a mistake you're wrong here for doing that\nListen I wouldn't call a woman horse race I admit it I'm not like Donald Trump I don't have this kind of personality frankly most of us don't\nThe guy I keep calling him as a ... he called him the beast forget name in the the the limousine that drives that he drives around in the stretch Cadillac limousine called the beach that's the secret\nService nickname he's the beast\nBut here's rule is kind of simple\nYou come after me I'm going to go back after you tenfold I don't care if you're a woman I don't care if you're a man I don't care if you're a gold star family I don't care if your Mother Teresa I can see him calling Mother Teresa a name\nIf she said something derogatory about him every body\nHe\nAttacks everybody he calls a name everybody he disparage is has disparaged him first\nAri Fleischer knows that Lindsey Graham knows that\nThat's what Senator Graham at when he started out the clip I don't know if we have do we have the Lindsey Graham touch somewhere guys I just saw kind of rushing around in a hotel room this morning a here in Florida on uh on TV religious that he's a fighter he's a fighter but he ... he shouldn't do this you shouldn't say that when he's the president\nAre we not gonna accept the fact that he's not going to do things that traditional past presidents have done\nMeanwhile oh I don't know there's a couple of pieces of news you might find interesting if you're worried about the president calling a porn star a horse race\nBut you asked is back on top is the most competitive country in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand and eight it's ... it's the index produced by the world Economic Forum America climbed up ... one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries\nWere now ahead of Singapore Germany Switzerland in Japan we are the most we have the most competitive economy in the world\nAnd the fact of the matter is\nIt is likely due to all the economic policies the terrorists that are starting to pay off more good news about the tariffs ... terrorists are controversial we can have that debate I get it All right to have the dialogue\nBut United States steel Corp workers or about to get the biggest wage increase in at least six years under a new deal negotiated with the company and according to Reuters\nThat's a sign that the games from President Trump's clamp down on foreign imports are starting to trickle down and the impact American workers so he cares about American workers so he cares about American companies solely cares about Americans\nWow what a what a novel idea on American president worried about American workers\nOh wow I it's been a long time since we've seen that it seems wages were frozen in the last contract with US Steel Pittsburgh based company\nTrump's trade policy coupled with a strong economy has sent domestic steel prices shoring helping US Steel posted nearly sixty percent increase in pre tax profits in the June quarter now the left they hate that they hate companies making money\nBut hey companies passion that profit on to their workers but normal Americans normal people appreciate the fact that the thousands and thousands of US Steel Corp workers who are about to get the biggest wage increase they've gotten in six years are thrilled with that news\nAnd guess what that's due to that's due to\nPresident Trump's economic policies including the tariffs including international\nTrade including domestic policies that are making a huge difference so while the media gets all hyperbolic and hysterical about something like the president\nCounter punching a porn star who he defeated incidentally in the courts remember this week and the reason there's been such\nAnimal is here's a court of a federal judge ruled that Stormy Daniels lawsuit against the president tweeting about her her defamation suit was thrown out and she has been ordered to pay his legal fees which according to the president are substantial\n[noise] that's why this is Scott Scott such contentiousness around and while the media slapping about horse race [noise] name the the horse race name [noise]\nSteve says he's greatly offended Steve I hear your very offended at President Trump calling Stormy Daniels horse race\nAt first I Want to keep up the good or like you're saying I just saw that brings us to say yeah what's\nWhat's a that a Trump insulted horses and all the women that old and loved horses\nOh All right All right Steve goodbye tip your waitresses ... will be here all week
