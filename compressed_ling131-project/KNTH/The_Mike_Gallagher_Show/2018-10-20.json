{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "This mission returned which also popped to mind the retirement news network and\nThis is mission retirement Megan most applicants have Hopkins glad to have you on board on the program today just like golly Joseph is answering your questions about retirement we have a lot more to get the Joseph I don't want to waste any more time\nYou're ready to go this is a very unique question I Can't wait to hear if you have any experience with something like that you've been doing this for years so there's a chance you've you've met at a client lay in this position Russ writes in from Missouri city and he says this I'm forty years old\nAnd I just hit the lottery not to make a lottery but a pretty big amount of money I've never had this chunk of change before I don't want to lose it what should I Do with it kills the have you ever had a lot into winter before\nI had one wouldn't it wouldn't a humongous amount but it was a respectable amount of money\nBut you know you've heard the stories you can read them all day long on the Internet you get the athletes first come to mind you know they make all this insane amount of money this is what I Would do you know if you're in any kind of debt you get out of debt than I Would establish an income\nSo you if you take the you can take the pay out or you can take the lump sum so what most people do they take the lump\nSum and that's the best bet to take the lump sum\nI you know what it is for the time value of money I Would just have to find out how much and how many years 'cause normally the payouts on a payout is Twenty years\nUm you know I I did it because the payout is more than a lump sum if you didn't know that would basically all the payout is is an annuity that's that's that's what the payout is is that gonna buy your twenty or nobody but if you take the the pay the lump sum 'cuse me why most people do\nFirst of all you want to be able to secure\nA lifestyle that it's going to last ... on your nose and so that's where an annuity can be a great advantage\nYou took a pay you took the lump sum but you're going to secure your lifestyle with annuity because what is the new witty annuity is a lifetime income machine so you just got a gift from God in my opinion so secure that\nWith something that you can't spin out of you can't spend enough money to to not secure that lifestyle in the future get out of debt secure your a lifestyle\nIn in the future and then start getting crazy when I say crazy start buying all the crazy toys and and that that's when we understand that you start hearing from a lot of relatives you heard from the IRS but any way that that would be my suggestion is secure lifestyle get out of debt and then you could start playing but do those first two things first\nAnd that would be a pretty good way to approach your future on that\nHave rats congratulations on the lottery winning my goodness I guess what did they just if you can't win if you don't play right just right someone's gotta win ...\nGuys on it I it's a little cute story a you know so many people\nAre out there and they you know they're trying to get the big hit a you know to accelerate 'cause they're always trying to catch up and so there was a story where this man and woman there were you know behind on their finances and so forth and and they were on their knees for months praying to God please God let us win the lotto win the lotto you know it's kind of don't you\nKnow and then finally answer him said hey work with me here at least by a lot of\nTea [laughter] help me help you write him yeah [laughter] yeah you gotta meet got half way so that\nOur next question comes from Bonnie in ballet or she says my husband and I have three grown children they're all in their thirties and they all have children of their own\nMy issue is that it never fails that one if not all three are still financially dependent to some extent on my husband and myself we do not want her grandkids can ever suffered that's why we continue to help our adult children\nBut it's getting to be too much and we're afraid it's going to affect our retirement what do you recommend we do\nYou get this question a lot don't you\nDo and and sometimes you just gotta allow your kids do to grow up you know I mean I'm not telling anybody not to help their kids to the crazy things we do for our kids because we have heartstrings but sometimes it gets to a point where\nYou don't it's it's it's like a baby bird and the mother bird syndrome you know in in order for baby bird to fly inevitably the mother has to do a traumatic thing she has to push the baby bird out of the ...\nAnd that's kind of like the idea and in the closet and I'm trying to get across the here as long as somebody feels like they have a life preserver a a ... income stream that's always available to them from their parents [noise]\nUm I mean you're not letting them fly it sometimes takes hard love and so I wouldn't tell you you might want to start you know\nTaking the spigot and starting to tighten it a little bit\n... have the conversation you know your mother and father or your ... your your data NIH whoever we're talking about you know we we worked our tails off to get to the point where we are today and I just want you to know that we felt like we did a good job raising you you know I don't know people have college educations or whatever the case may be but it gets to a point where\nYou're going to need to know that we can't continue to help us we have been\nYou know and that may be a you know a a front it may be um you know not completely true\nBut you gonna have to draw the line the scene in at least get dumped some backbone otherwise they're gonna be you know like a jelly fish over there and you know every you know Tom it turns around are they going to be reaching out for giving me and I think that's selfish in my opinion from the kid standpoint\nNow again there are circumstances where they may not be in a position where they're I mean when I give you example\nAnd the day were there ... has been\nYou know a housewife for um\nUh the family and and the husband ended up cheating on her and they got three kids and she has no income\nYou know and and and everything is in his name so that's a perfect example of you know it'd be proper to be able to help your kid but ... and try to get them back on their feet but she's gonna have to go out there and find gainful employment you know and she knows that but she's willing to do that but just to have somebody be a freebie I\nI'm I'm totally against that because you're playing it what you're playing with fire and you're not going to probably like the end result so I Would just say tough love and and try to do the best you can of getting them\nOff on their own so you know when referring to someone's financial future whatever whatever scenario we're talking about with anybody here today most people today unfortunately gives second class allegiance\nTo first class important what I mean by that you know the kind of putting our back burner you know they're not they're not prioritizing what is most important for their financial future I Would promote you not to be the person I Would tell you to take action now\nBefore something else gets in a way you know what is at its life\nI guess the way for everybody you know that's what we can all say that put crashed and they in certain areas in our life call me right now just so ... you're talking to ... if you don't know what that means I put your best interest over anybody else's\nIf you want the opportunity to sit down with somebody like that this was when we do our workshops so many people come in because they finally are going to be able to sit down with somebody is going to not give them you know the Kool Aid advice you know which is what they're required to sell because their company ... and you need to sell this us industry has someone has\nComplete unbiased opinion because your best interest money it's that's of interest to you if you'd like to have that opportunity give me a call right now Joe some Hopkins\nOne eight hundred nine to five three one three six again this one eight hundred nine to five three one three six\nCans have re in town ball right here and he says that I'm sixty three and currently retired the majority of my money is in the market at the moment that crisis have two thousand eight hit me and my family\nPretty hiring is there a way I can keep my money with Hugh without having the same financial scare and they did back in two thousand eight while my money is telling the market\nWell I I Would say yeah I'm Glad that you have not\nYou know have ... that was our last\nCrash was and he realizes he is on the market which I think it's a mistake especially if you are retired now he seems to be a little bit younger um of age to be retired but congratulations to him but yeah if you if you walked away from a guaranteed income which in this case is a salary or income\nThen I Would definitely be the person that would promote you to real lying your positions\nFor your financial future I think it's a mistake\nFor you to be a hundred percent in the market because you never want to be able to risk more than your then you could afford to risk and\nYou know it it it gives you a lot more back bone or swagger like I like to say if you're still working and you could be a hundred percent in the market because if you lose ten thousand dollars nobody's going to write you a check to replace that like you have to issue are retired\nOr because you're going to have to completely depend on to come back up through the source that it went down and that's the market so\nIf you are no longer working then yes you need a real lying yourself\nWith maybe not so much risk so how much risk and you take well it's not a matter of okay is the sky blue is turquoise what

I mean you see that's about to point two percent a year in economic growth\nThat China was getting over us and you want to know why China is growing at ten percent a year most like because they were taking huge amounts of of our economy away from us in transferring it over to China and and so now we're we're in the process of seeing the these factories are ...\n... there's something called the supply chain in the supply chain is simply with a big corporation when you pick up your product at Wal Mart or\nOr whatever it's you know you buy the a toaster oven or the a dress or whatever it it came from somewhere and it had to be produced somewhere and some of the parts for the toaster oven had to be produced somewhere else they came together\nThey produced a toaster oven then they had to shift a toaster oven to the United states will that's called the supply chain now maybe they made the toaster oven in China maybe some of the parts for the toaster the heating element in the courts came from Vietnam and it all comes together and the supply chain in it arrives at a nice box and you pick it up and\nPut my all my cash in in in a safe for the safety deposit box it in ... and and I would have the same amount in three years in Germany\nVersus if I ah I if I put it in the bank and a CD or in a treasury notes and got less money back what are you going to do with the money you can stick it in the safe deposit box\nBut that that it ... understand okay we have five thousand years of history reasonably good you go back two thousand years it's much better than the history is much better if you dig down really deep understand it the people understand what the knowledge we have from that time\nFive thousand years back in history the bank of England did a study what did they find we had the lowest interest rates in two years in the last two years ago in the history of planet earth or five thousand years unless there was some civilization that I didn't know about before that you can listen to some people will tell you yes I don't think so but uh\n[noise] so that was a unique time in history ... and so actually the to the ... the lowest interest rates in history that the zero interest rates that the Federal Reserve understand\nStock market crash has happened materially more often than than the interest rates hitting zero like they did materially more often\n... and so what we're seeing is is that that was the ... that was a fundamental outlier that was a literal black swan up all the black swans that happened the black swan the biggest black swan out there was\nThe zero interest rates that's changing so now let's take a look at interest rates you can get\n... on a two year on a two year a one year CD you can get two point six percent so there's opportunities out there on a one year treasury we liked treasuries in here to point six percent of the latest numbers I've really been going up\nA on a a even a even a ... a three month treasury bills to point two percent\nYou can go we we've looked in a way we own some of the uh the the ... ah I think it's a G. P. I. L. which are are basically treasury short term treasury E. T. S. that are paying reasonably good they're a little below this because the rates are going up so quick they're lagging a little bit but when they go down they'll they'll go the other way but\nSo uh\nSo you're getting so we're entering a very dangerous time for the stock market but there's opportunities because for the first time you get over two percent or more an extremely safe investments\nAnd so you want to increase your cash levels before if you if you sat on the sidelines you weren't getting paid anything to do it now you are okay now is when the dangers particularly ramping up a ... we had a client called not a client ... when the client it was just a caller called in\nLast week in the show and he said I'm not getting any money on my CDs on my money market sounds like he just had a bunch of money and a checking account well if you go to the bank and say like a one year CD you get at Wells Fargo and I just pulled the numbers off of TV it's about two point\nWe used to the marriage rate it's about two point six percent\nOf full disclosure I use Wells Fargo but they're paying a lot more now because the the you know the reputation has been a little tarnished so they're trying to work real hard to get back and everybody's good graces\nOr so so\nThat the good the bad news out there is things are really starting to work about against the in the in the stock market and talk some more about that the good news is there are other opportunities are starting to come up opportunities we haven't seen in years for not huge returns but to protect us when the time comes we're gonna have a lot of money to invest\nIt really good bargain what let's take a call from Rick hello Rick how ya doing\nUm I Want to you or your brain I'm sure I think you know a lot of it\nFrom getting in a retirement okay are trying to think of the strategy\nTo withdraw money I have a four O. one K. and tax deferred and how how can I minimize the tear I'm going to pay on that money coming out\nOkay a\n... a couple of ways are what say I I how much do you have outside of your four one K. saved up\nBallpark out for the oral one about a ...\nOkay good ah the reason I I asked that question is\nTypically for retirement the numbers about four percent of years which you can take out the ... seats in numbers of the the the study by your Benji in a number of years back was four point to three percent\nA ... some words for four and a quarter somewhere in there you can take out a year\nAnd then in the ... do you think about that as it then it should grow with inflation overtime so it it will keep going up and you can continue taking the four point a to five percent out uh so what you want to do is you take your ... K plan it typically you roll it over into an IRA roll over\nAnd then what I Would do is I'd set yourself up on a monthly pay out to get a check once a month\nOr you can do it ... or\nTwice a week you know every other week if you want but typically most people just once a month in in and then\nAnd then you you take it out now ... a year for four and a quarter percent now if you need less than that if you can get by with less than that that's good uh so if you can kind of get by with three and a half just keep the extra money in their cars remember Rick you'll never run out of money the first five years of retirement or ten years\nThe danger is if you live to be Ninety Ninety five that's when you really gotta be careful and that's why you want to minimize taking out as much as possible early\nThat I can point in the reason why I asked about what you had elsewhere so\nYou want to work with your taxes in your Social Security to try to figure out where you are and the tax thing to try to not kick you in two different levels\nSo let's say you're you're you're making do with eighty thousand dollars a year or between your Social Security in in your retirement or in all of a sudden the ... the car the car breaks down you need to buy a new uh\nYou'd let's say you just need to buy a new car completely gives out and you you find a nice car it it's thirty five thousand dollars in ... and you don't want to you want to put down\nTen thousand to keep your payments as low as possible and then and then finance it out well if you take out\nAnother ten thousand get it keeps you up to Ninety thousand dollars so yeah okay that's raise your tax bracket if you take it out of your Seventy five thousand you know once every five years or so then uh you know fully a buildup backup overtime then you haven't raised your tax bracket up in ... and that's\nWhere it's it's important to have that money outside of your plan to allow you to do that maybe of medical expense comes up or something happens some emergency you don't want to have to dip into your ... your up into your IRA role money yes because at that point in time it's always going to be at the highest marginal tax\nBracket no matter where racket you're in\n[noise] uh\nAre you an advocate a holding a if you don't have to have Social Security or ... or maybe Seventy\nYeah absolutely yeah yeah ... ... again\nNo one ever runs out a truck runs into trouble five or ten years it's Thirty years in the future or Twenty years twenty five years in the future and and what's so tough to understand is we don't know what's gonna happen\nWe don't know if we're going to have a big inflation they're going to have more inflation personally we don't know if we have a deflation we don't want to ... a World War we don't know what's gonna happen so that one way or put things off\nTo to get to have better clarity the better off we're going to be in and remember up until age Seventy with your Social Security goes up about eight percent a year that's a pretty good return\nYeah what ... or ... or what ever happened to the tax rates are they going to grow up\n[noise] you know [noise] I I don't think so ... if if if the if the\nDemocrats get control the house I I don't think you can see any more tax cuts and you might see the higher higher earners taxes go up\nA ... with ... the real danger going forward it's going to be all types of of\nOf of of fees and assessments and all types of things like that which particularly scary in a world of of big data in a in a sensors and everything else you can come up with all types of toes levees and assessments in fees on people and that that's going to be the bigger problem in the future\n[noise] wow [noise] okay Harry will go up and\nUp banks are great questions right they yeah they some good really good question uh that that's the thing is how do you make your funds last in in in one of the things I really like here is ...\n... with the interest rates rising is is for your interest rate component which is a little more steady we're finally getting returns that I think think justify\nThe wrist or the interesting thing we have somewhat of a flat you'll curve and so when I mentioned the CDs in the in these these these I mentioned the Treasury's because uh we also invest in individual corporate bonds but but the treasury says it's kind of a good guide post so if you kinda get get the treasury yield curve\nIt'll give you some ideas of where the different rates are different things and you can get a certain percentage over that\nUh by investing in corporate your CD sometimes\nA interestingly a treasury\nShield more than CDs in less than a year which is fascinating to me\nThe assets are to be divided equally among my children ... and so the ... and that's a simple case of really someone trying to do the right thing to help out in all of a sudden his miss titled the account so understand\nWhen you have an account where you're writing checks out of a\nDebt be careful with the ... at the pound it has to be a done a certain way otherwise you can avoid out parts of your will it wreck your state plant uh same thing can be said for a better fishery forms we we see this a lot of people will roll over their IRA ... they'll retire from\nYou know the proverbial Exxon and uh and then they'll just decided to use their existing IRA accounted they opened up with five thousand dollars Twenty years ago when you know it's worth but I don't know\nTwenty five thousand dollars now and they just roll it in there and well they forgot that that they did that when they only had two children and now they had another child but since it was such a small account at the time they forgot about it in\nTime has passed no one remembers what happened then all of a sudden you have the IRA with one of the children is left off the beneficial reform and to understand your beneficial reform is something there that you off you have to watch as well in the past a lot of the stuff\nOr you didn't have\nAccounts the typically the stuff all went to ... and now more and more of these accounts are tied in with with with joint type of accounts ...\nBig amounts of stock or rolled in there are put in there by mistake in Britain mixed messed it just destroys your state plant so something to think about we're going to be where there's a little complicated it's in the ... same support it's a lot simpler than I made it right here\nAre so if you want to copy that just go to the website ... savings dot com Senate for the Freeh report\nA markets you know what can I say um\n[noise] let it just doesn't look good for the stock market is market his uh his sold off here it's gone down about ten percent and the NASDAQ we are clients where we've hedged or hedge have a short on the NASDAQ right now we're out of the group\n[noise] for our clients we did that right at the top ... it really it just it just didn't look good and uh\nThe ... the the NASDAQ\nHas fallen ten percent it's come up a little ... the S. and P. and the Dow are down about several of them over seven between seven and eight percent\nOr ... it just doesn't look good at struggling to to stay above those ... uh levels and it went to ... looking at something when markets start going down and doing things unexpectedly people tend to turn to technicals a lot that are in\n[noise] if you look at the average is the only major average still above or not that is not broken the two hundred a moving average is is the Dow Jones industrial average which is quite frankly the easiest one to manipulate it uh the rest of them of all broken down a\nB B that the uh\nThe the S. and P. five hundred is is basically\nA ... at the that ones at the ... the two hundred day uh the uh the the the\nHas completely broken underneath the two hundred a moving average the transports of broken under two hundred a moving average the Russell two thousand is broken under the two two hundred a movie average in in the N. Y. M. C. uh has broken under the two hundred a moving average now the interesting thing is on the U.S some peas under the two are right after two hundred a moving average\nThe choo choo choo and the SP why which is the indexes are above those numbers a little bit\nWhich I find interesting I think the reason those things are hanging above it I think if they break underneath those averages is going to trigger an enormous amount of selling of people in these index funds and so I think they see ... I\n... that's something I've not seen where we're we're like the the the NASDAQ Composite\nTypically if the NASDAQ Composite goes down to a level on and moving average the the two key accused at the same place in the same with the U.S and the five hundred [noise] all the money is piled up in the SP why in the cute cute cute those were above those numbers if they break underneath the lookout [noise] uh I\nI just see a market this breaking down and and so I think you really have to be cautious I think higher levels of cash treasuries a money market uh\nThose type of things I I think is what you want to look at it here we ... we were very defensive for our clients retirement money right now uh you know ... it's\nIt just interest rates are going up quantitative easing is ending inflation's going up the trade war we believe is much more serious than people think is we've been saying uh you're seeing tightness in labor markets companies having to\nPay more for workers more for transport more for just sticks\nThey're having to put new manufacturing in the United states from China that's more expensive uh they're under pressure to do things or the dollar is going up that's pressuring Ernie everything the tide is coming out in the investment world and so now is when you want to basically be heading for the safety of shore\nAnd and so uh\nSo this is something we're going to watch or what this is the last segment if you'd like to get in with the question or comment and give us a call here at seven one three three three nine ten Seventy seven one three three three nine ten Seventy here on the ... same show the last segment of the show\n[noise] ah so I think you really have to have your defensive plan in place it just I you know a\n... ... if you look around the world at the markets are breaking down or the emerging markets have broken down badly China's down well over between twenty five and thirty percent uh\nThat rallied a little bit on friday a you know it it's just a\n... a emerging market way down an emerging market bonds down everything appears to be selling off in here and you and I to me the smart money is backing away from this market is getting pulling back in and they really are putting their defensive play in a place in and I think for your retirement I think that's going to be really important\nFor the way you did you see the story about the uh\nThe UN postal treaty the United states is pulling about pulling out of\nThis is a fascinating story it the the poster treaty was it's a hundred and forty four year old treaty and it's sort of if it's bases set up so if you were in South America or Africa hundred years ago were Asia and you wanted to mail something to the United states\nYou know they back over in those countries maybe people may twenty five dollars a year and so you couldn't charge 'em a couple of bucks for postage\nSo they they gave 'em reduced rates and so it was kind of set up so if you wanted a male something in in you know Saddam Iraq or Peru or or a gun or somewhere like that you could sit there and\nThat you get a discounted rate to mail it to the United states because people just weren't making any money well China has\nJust said the un set these rates with China they're postage is is is is subsidized over there so the Chinese have in manufacturing been mailing small packages like to point two pounds to point\nA a four point four pounds or less packages to the United states have vastly reduced rate in some cases they were paying a quarter of the price it cost us manufacturers to shift the product a couple of states over\nThe Chinese were able to to ship it for a quarter the price end of the United states at the same thing I think it was a huge advantage\nTo a it was a huge advantage to Chinese manufacturers or this is a big uh this is a big hit on alley Bob uh you know because a lot of people using Alibaba's to shipping products cheaply into the United states\nIs using this ... this ... this ridiculously subsidize post it just was hurting us manufacturers could not compete\nAgainst Chinese manufacturers even if they could produce at the same price\nFor small orders because the Chinese could beat them on postage\nSo there were maybe it was costing them two dollars or two fifty to ship the small package and it was called the American manufactured ten dollars amazing stories so President Trump is pulling out of the un postal\nA treaty and that's going to be there I think they're going to do within the next nine months or so receptive things but it's just an amazing story of\nFang stocks Facebook apple Amazon Netflix Google or we wrote about these two reports ago said they were Ninety eight percent of the total return the S. and P. five hundred stocks are are breaking down\nA China I mean I'm hearing on apple Apple's having trouble selling into China now ah and there's some question on their earnings that was probably the strongest one of the group

absolutely\nFantastic show lined up for you but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am can rewrite the host money matters with Ken ...\n[noise] jak I've been\nIn the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting you [noise]\n[noise]\nI Do and all the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same ideas that we talked about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh at the end of last month we not work with over eight thousand families in forty three states we are honored we are privileged and recently parents named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states\nAnd this is actually the sixth year in a row and without our clients that would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you I Hope you guys listen to the show right now are having an absolutely fantastic\nWeekend I Hope everything is coming up roses for you and we have a great show so let me go over with you what we're talking about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances show for you and I we absolutely do and\nAs money matters are from his grown and I've just mentioned that we have a we were not work with over a thousand families what I've also come to ...\nIs that we have a great responsibility to those clients and you know when I first started this business back when I was a a you know I said I've been in his business now for twenty nine years so it's actually four years old when we started and when I was four years old\n[laughter] you know I didn't quite you know I I never didn't think that we would be where we are today but I actually also didn't really think about that we are going to be where we are today I just kind of went with it and you know as things progressed just kept on going so now as it's as I always would come to where we are\nI've come to the point where I realized that we have a responsibility to all these families that we work with\nAnd so one of the things that I thought about was you know you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do [laughter] that that would be a bad thing right so one of the things that we decided to do was that we would have what we call vision one hundred\nAnd vision one hundred is that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong as not stronger as it is today\nSo how do you do that how do you build a company that's going to be here a hundred years from now serving our current clients their families down the line and all of those kinds of things and so to do that\nI studied a variety of companies that have been in business for a hundred years to see how they did it because if you think about it the last hundred years have been you know fraught with all kinds of things we had world wars\nWe've had a you know bad economic times we've had boom times technology's changed I mean everything it's like all kinds of stuff that happened but yet these companies endured and so what was it that enabled them to endure\nAnd so I Want to take you this uh this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and then you're investing life because we're a financial advisory firm\nSo it'll it sounds kind of a you know philosophical this week but I think we're going to ... I'll bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as a from\nWhat we've decided is that we have to go so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy that helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to accomplish\nSo in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are that we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want them to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that and philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nWhen you retire we specialized work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a barren market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just last year money you're you're you're not financially uh have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nThat ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that endures\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six a core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay\nSo that's the first thing I always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrifice honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that what'll happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nKnow so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something\nYou know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is\nIt will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if it's for example if you lied on your resume to get a job and you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise] now\nOne of the things that uh I Am not going to apologize for is that we would like to have you if you are the person that we specialize in working with as a client\nSon to do some selling here or if you are over fifty if you
