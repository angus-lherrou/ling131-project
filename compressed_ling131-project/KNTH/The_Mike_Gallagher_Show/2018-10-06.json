{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "This mission retirement I make another attack alongside of how can you can read him today by calling eight hundred nine to five\nThree one two three thinks he used that number to set a visit with Joseph in his office he wouldn't be happy to sit down with you and began planning for your dream retirement he makes his mission each and every day you can also go to his website mission retirement dot com that's\nWhere you can submit a question aunt just that's just my answer your question on an upcoming shall speaking of questions just stuff we have more to get to be ready for another I'm ready Girl Scout okay that writes in from ... today and she says how accurate are some of their retirement calculators that you can play with on line\nYou know I I think they're pretty spot on and the reason why is because they had to be in compliance with which you know what you're trying to accomplish and they just can't afford to have bad publicity out there so I think for the most part it's from a ... a data entry result\nUh out getting um is is spot on\nThe the problem is and this is what I keep saying to everybody whenever they brings up to me and that is because it's kinda like doing a robo adviser you know you want to do everything computerized and if it everything works out hunky dory but the problem is you don't know how long you're going to need this money\nAnd so I guess you could have different scenarios if I if I Lived in this age then I stay in a really good chance of what I like to see as the percentages\nIt's like it's it's like the old um the joke that the the person gets on the airplane and the pilot starts his little routine in the beginning\nHe says and by the way we have a fifty eight percent chance of landing in our destination well how many people want to stay on that airplane\nI'm getting off [laughter] you know\nBut you know what it's it's amazing to me where you get that same scenario you have a fifty eight percent chance of not\nRunning out of money for you die most I mean not in most but you wouldn't be surprised how many people are just going to say okay that's fine oh how\nCould that be fine that could it's not find for you to ... board an airplane to get your next destination because that's the the the statistic that the pilots said well in this case we're financial pilots and I'm going to tell you you have a certain degree of a ... year\nIn in is that is that okay with you and and you know obviously\nWhen it's fifty eight percent [noise] and they're still working they're going to go okay no that's not acceptable what do we gotta do to fix that okay she that's where you get the mechanics to come in and try to fix something but most people they don't even want to know\nJust like just like Larry he didn't want to open up his envelope because he's here to know what the truth is he doesn't want to know what the truth is and that's that's worse than finding out because then if you find out you got a problem then I I can tell you there's a way that your subconscious kick in\nAnd and make it right I mean if there's a possibility your mind will find a way to make it right if that means you've got to go get two other jobs to make it right and you have the the means to do so you're going to make it right but\nIgnoring it or to just think that is not going to happen in your life is just negligence and I think that's just that's just sad in my opinion because he is about a plant and it's not it's something we do I don't know fifty times a week and we do it upside down in our sleep and so just no different than how many times as a guy that\nWorks at ... the loop change oil and a week\nThey don't know but they do it ...\n... ... every day over and over and that's what we do and it's just it just seems so you know Melba toast around here but when people walk out it's just like if they'd been rejuvenated and it just gives us so much pride and know that this set this value added this we bring A People's table [noise] it just it it just is revolutionary to them\nAnd that's what gives us our reassurance we're doing the right thing\nAnd the other question this one from Jerry who writes in from the wetlands he says I have a couple of life insurance policies one of which is pretty cheap but our house is paid off and our kids are grown and gone so I'm not sure if I even need life insurance\nI've probably done the expensive one but I'm Wondering if I should keep the other one just because it's so cheap\nWell again I Can't it's not a purple pill answer but I wouldn't I wouldn't just just discount the bigger one because I Would ask Jerry if he was sitting in front of a jury tell me why did you\nWhy don't you take these insurance policies out what what's what's uh what's the purpose of the little one was the parts of the big one obviously there's one that's probably going to pay out more his passing and the the small when I get that uh or it could be a different than when he applied\nLong story short his what was the purpose and if he can give me a good enough reason why he had that reason in that region which still apply today then that might be a respectable ideas for example let me give you an idea see this is it thinking outside the box\nLet's just say that let's just say that the small one was twenty five thousand which basically is a barrel policy and the other one was two hundred and fifty thousand\nThe big one okay so\nI Would ask what's the reason for okay so the twenty five it's cheap um I ... it could\nQuite to a barrel policy you want to keep that when Jerry okay that makes sense okay as long as just a portable now let's talk about the big one what is the reason why on the big on well you know just trying to fill\nThe gaps well we you know what I owned it ah so that God Forbid if anything happened to me while I was in my working years that my wife she could pay off the house and and and live debt free\nOkay understood good job okay so now you are a debt free\nSo you don't need any more and and now you're going to not be working anymore so you don't feel like you need any more I get that but let's talk about what is this money for that you've a mass was it for well you know what it is for mixture that me and the wife we have a a good lifestyle okay All right\nTell me this if you could incorporate that two hundred and fifty thousand our premium into your budget that can have a I'm not getting anything\nThis I'm just giving you you know straight unbiased device let's just say you had an interest in leaving the legacy for kids\nDid you know that there's nothing better than giving your loved one's life insurance because it's a hundred percent tax free that's a heck of a lot better than you thinking you're going to hand me down your and don't get me wrong I'm not complaining [noise] um but if you were going to I was going to inherit is your child your IRA while I'm inheriting a hundred percent\nTaxable account\nI I mean if you give me the option from attacks perspective to get a hundred percent tax free money versus a hundred percent tax money I might choose a hundred percent tax free money and\nThat's what life insurance is so you might want to maybe incorporate that intelligence that mentality into whatever you were thinking that you believe is a legacy to your kids\nDidn't make the can down spend that money more aggressively and still keep the life insurance so again it's not a perfect answer because I don't know the background of his circumstances but that's something that's like thinking outside the box and frankly\nThat's what we do we think outside the box it's not melt it tells you know the toast and we're down the street where we're going to show you hybrid type intelligent results are solutions and get the results of what we had and then let you make your decision it's just a suggestion\nBut most people take our recommendations because I Know retirement planning can be very complicated and render overwhelming and we get that because we get those responses from people\nBut there are options to help you get to where you want to be we can offer you those options I'm off you over thirty eight years of experience folks non biased and you're talking to fishery\nIf that's of interest you give me called Josef Hopkins at one eight hundred nine to five three one three six again this one eight hundred nine to five three one ...\nDon't forget the website had two mission retirement dot com for much more information are questions continue this one comes from Ross in town row he writes in and says Joseph is a bad mood to take money out of my IRA\nGet pay off that once I turned fifty nine and a half I Need about fifty thousand dollars in order to be debt free\nAnd that's a small percentage of my total IRA balance I'm just not sure whether or not to take it out\nOkay if you could pay down some debt and you can borrow from her for all and K\nThat would be an option that you might want to consider now understand that for all in case they are by law they're required to charge an interest in you can see 'em all the way up to five percent but what is your interest rate on the debt you're trying to pay off let me give you a point in case I have a\nA a husband and wife that came in a not too long ago from one of our workshops and\nHe's over fifty nine and a half\nThey have thirty thousand dollars and say oh the IRS and they have twenty five thousand dollars\nIn credit card debt now that the credit card debt is in excess of\nTwenty percent interest rate so what that what happened was they fell victim to charging these credit card companies and then they can't pay him off when they're supposed to be whether it be it in the month or surely within this you know 'cause you know you get to Eighteen months free interest\nAnd then it job jumps up to this incredible ridiculous amount of over twenty percent so they come to me and he's got about two hundred and sixty thousand dollars in a irate so is it prudent for him to consider first of all you don't mess with the IRS if you can't work out some of the payment plan then you pay them\nBecause that's Palestinian interests that it's kind of like\nThink about there you go outside and you turn your faucet on full blast does it just bug you\nIt bugs me and that's what that that's kind of the mentality of penalty and interest is not going to stop to you shut the spec it off and so you want to get the\nGood Saturday morning and welcome to the backs of saving show I'm ... and we are talking savings investments in your retirement here on the max out saving show\nOur show is all about saving for retirement building up wealth understanding the rapidly changing world we live in today and uh\n[noise] the\nOur motto in our philosophy is to save aggressively invest conservatively it makes her savings advisors we manage money for retirees that they're they're already rollovers trust and things like that using or value investing approach to the stock and bond markets in\nThe end of\n... it's a little different approach from the idea of just buying the S. and P. five hundred index funded riding markets up forever which I don't think are happening and I and I think things are rapidly started to change a against ah\nAgainst that strategy and we're seeing this would have been talking about this on the show a lot ah [noise] and we talk about more today\n[noise] uh but but we always try to start to show making sure you're saving or you have some type of playing for retirement [noise] the easiest plan is to simply\nPut put money away in your four one K. plan or your four four four three be you're ... you're you're qualified type of programs\n[noise] ten percent minimum plus the company match\nFor retirement and and then put it away over the long term term use of power of compounding of money over Thirty years\nTo build up well ... that's the most sure fire way for most people to get rich in in the ... and then once you put away a ... that's ten percent plus the company match gets you got Thirteen percent so some people say Fifteen some people say twenty percent with where we started this show out\nTen ...\nTen twelve years ago yeah it was a we'd call up and talk about saving we said Ted no one has had a show about saving money and they said I'm saving Fifteen I'm saving twenty percent we have clients coming in saving\nTheir come to us or saving twenty five percent or more uh it just depends on your situation but the minimum should be ten percent plus the company match in and so it's exciting idea we're really helping people save and build up wealth and ... it it's it you know it's one of the you know the things that\nI really enjoy about doing the show is to help people out in this is one way we do it in ... and ... were made a lot of progress the savings rate in the United states has gone up\n\nAnd and and and and we're making about but still more than sixty percent of the people don't know how much they need for their golden years this is a story out of I think it was Bloomberg\nIt up yeah Bloomberg uh it it basically ah people thought ah they needed a the the different numbers came in sixty percent of the people did not know how much they needed they they they conducted a thousand interviews to try to come up with this ah\nIn sixty percent of the people had no idea how much they would be a Fifteen Percent said it was somewhere between two hundred and fifty thousand to a million or\nEight percent said they plan to never retire I guess where they are or and or or they might like to work and fairness and then uh you know it was about ten percent or so a present said that a little less that there'd be two hundred and fifty thousand or less and [noise]\nYou know there are people they can retire around two hundred and fifty thousand or less than they have a pretty tight lifestyle\nBut I've seen people do it but you really need closer to a million dollars to retire or more are and and so I you know have a plan and you know it doesn't have to be that some people use real estate ah some people use their four O. one K. plans\n\nSome people have all their money in their house and then plan to sell the house and moved to a cheaper but but I have some type of playing for retirement in place is that typically you're going to get a certain amount from Social Security\nAre in but you know ... that\nThat's never a sure thing and I think it's even less sure thing for people with bigger money and this is something we've talked about in the show I'm not sure in the future you can actually depend on Social Security up I think they'll always be some type of safety net\nUnderneath but I think for for wealthier people uh I I I think that can be somewhat endangered in the future particular way we're spending money running up deficits\nAnd and not controlling a Social Security one of the things that's been incredibly damaging to Social Security is the ... the disability\nWhich is to get a lot of people you know there's some truly disabled people out there that need to be on Social Security\nAnd in ... that just can't function and then there's a lot of people out there that basically just don't want to work or couldn't find a job and when it came up with a reason to go on Social Security which is early in their forties or fifties which is draining Social Security\n[noise]\nSo so that you know the these are so I'm not sure you can really depend on Social Security for retirement so have a plan a at a minimum if you're younger particularly start saving if you're over fifty you should be said in your behind it ought to be a minimum of Fifteen Percent Fifteen Percent\nCome up with the planet and I've seen different ways to do it I mean some people will say continued to say Fifteen Percent someone will say they'll buy a piece of property\nWith say you know Fifteen year mortgage or something on it and then figure hey I'll have paid off at the end of that time and then it'll go up and die you know sell it and that will be part of but that's not a bad plan either but have a plan of some type for your retirement [noise]\nAh I think I I think the days are over of the stock market just rising up we had a Federal Reserve that\nThat ah after two thousand nine when rescued all the the banks and the country and came up with the idea the trickle down economics but\nThat like Ronald Reagan's trickle down economics where we give people the money you know where to let them work more than they can get paid more and they don't get taxed on it so the work even more and then it'll spread through the system instead they said look what we'll do is we'll just make the rich people richer by raising asset prices\nAnd it really didn't work and it led to a huge income dispersion in the United states and I think we're starting to see kind of the end of of Federal Reserve central planning of the economy which really we've ... we went through a decade\nOf of dealing of ... of Federal Reserve central planning and really we have gotten very little growth with two percent the last decade we average about two percent growth the worst decade of growth since the great depression the ... and actually there was more higher growth\nTimes in that decade than there were in the ... decades so the idea that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates to zero in the economy trucks along and everybody feels richer in war has been an abject failure and and so we're moving away from that so we try something new with Donald Trump\nDonald Trump said look I think if we cut taxes and cut regulations the economy will boom and that's what's happened now we have four percent plus growth rate coming up uh we we exciting\nNews on the economy or\nThis or this week three point seven percent or unemployment rate three point seven percent or the the some of the jobs were real good because they lost some job through the hurricane but three point seven percent unemployment\nLet me put that in perspective\nThe last time we saw three point seven percent unemployment was I Believe Nineteen sixty nine\nForty nine years ago exciting things are happening to the economy once you allow people to keep their money that they earn ... free them up from government regulation and the economy starts booming ... so exciting things are happening there\nAre but understand ah that you've got you've got to take charge of your own retirement and and so a ...\nLot of interesting things happen to be talking about the markets huge moves in the markets as we huge losing interest rates this week the\nThe cabin or hearing that was a a complete circus or\nYou know just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it just went straight into the gutter and uh you know\nAh I don't even know what to say about the Kavanaugh hearings a cabinet or can't be headed Supreme Court the safe thing I can say about the rest of his none of us will be in our job is the Democrats are going after us either in so uh uh ... and by the way\nUp\nA couple of things the Democrats' way overplayed their hand on that\nUh you know they they basically ... you\nKnow they just overplay their hand uh they they the you know they had a pretty good hand to play in in and then they they went and came up with one thing after another and are just completely ... I've never heard such wild uh\nAccusations and just completely and substantiated and what they did is it was a real mistake because what they did is they just infuriated the Republican base out there so they're going to be turning massively to boat\nThe independence or looking at this and go on this looks like a lynching and ... and they're like I don't want anything to do with this ... and so they overplay their hand you know if you look at the Democrats\nThe Democrats were fired up for this election coming up I mean they were like hey this is it I'm not going to vote and we can make all my friends vote hey we're going to sit there and do something typically\nIn the ... ah the after a presidential election the party loses seats afterwards and these it that you know the ... the ... the Senate worldly holding buy a seat or to them and it's pretty close a couple seats\nOr is it the house you know even the house who's close in a not a good thing in the city as the Republicans control there's a lot more Democratic senators coming up for election this time so there are more vulnerable to the house\nAnd you said like three and a half for what we got the three and a half percent on along but I was talking about that's going to be an area that that could get us in trouble for for three and a half professor\nYup yup lick a gun lock who's ... she's one of the top a\nFund managers out there his number was three and a quarter hit it on the thirty year you when it went through three and a quarter\nOr the other day and it's it it's a three point effectively three point four right now okay so we're ... we're at the law by three point four were pretty darn close to three and a half percent but if you look at the at the trend lines that go back about Thirty years and these things\nWhich I'm looking at right now the the you know we're breaking out to the upside in it which is probably inflation's breaking out at the same time\nAnd then the question then\nWhich of the ... which are the first one to be the ... the name I mean we won't be hit the hardest thing go up talking about the hardest one [laughter] it'd be hard\nHard on her home building real estate companies with high levels of debt and also the stock market the U.S and the five hundred\nBut we're we're we're getting to the uh you know the the phone\nYeah you can keep in mind one of the problems you run into Oscar is\nWe're doing the corporate America is doing massive amounts of stock buyback programs we have one of the most expensive markets in history now and they've been borrowing money just trying to borrow money there they're going through their casual and borrowing money in which means they're taking on additional data higher rates to buy more more and more expensive stock\nI think they're gonna have to start raining in their stock buyback programs which is going to put additional pressure on the market\nFor these people that the airport at all the fight back for a flag to them right\nOh yeah no I I think it is I mean now keep in mind Apple's got so much money they're just using ...\nOkay but some of the smaller ones that are going to be really affected by this right\nYeah and you look at a company like bad back and beyond they just boarded a bad earnings to stock has fallen apart they bought huge amounts of stock and borrowed the money at higher levels and now they're in financial trouble\nOn okay it'd be interesting what happens from here on the ticket that I really appreciate it\nOK asking yet we're trying to expand the public this week for our clients on Wednesday late Wednesday\nOr we when we were seeing breakdowns in the Russell in different areas and the market and we we we put we put a ... a a head just short on the on the NASDAQ a late Wednesday and Thursday and just fell apart in and they continue to go down friday\nSo yeah we're cautious\n[laughter] very much\nThanks Oscar look I mean\nI think in our ... saved report to report to go we pointed out that the fangs post Microsoft was about Ninety eight percent of the total return on the S. and P. five hundred year to date we pointed out they were grossly overvalued and they they and we said we would avoid the group and since then they started to sell off\nIn it and if you look at the the ... on the NASDAQ this week\nGetting really broke down a starting Thursday morning\nIn in a in a ... by by by uh\nFriday afternoon hitting gone through a friday morning it actually gone through the hundred a moving averaging rallied some but this is a pretty big break down a overall on the NASDAQ to me that he ... in so uh\nThe Russell two thousand is broken down the NASDAQ has now broken down into the fifty day in and the question is what's gonna happen with the S. and P. B. S. and P. hip to fifty day in in rallies back\nBut [noise] if this is kicking off cell signals to a lot of ... of technical people out there in in in ... fun to different types\nThe things like that at one of the things that drove us on Wednesday to to sit there in in in it make that move for our clients was ... I was watching the the the\n... the twenty five day and a five day a moving averages which we don't do a lot of but just with the NASDAQ I just felt it was so important because I felt like these people are doing this trend following in I could see underneath it with China\nWith problems with privacy with problems with a with a political leanings of the of the tech companies in any irritating the conservatives and the Republicans and the Europeans going after him privacy in anti trust issues everything was starting to work against she'd be the tech sector and so\n[noise] so we were watching very closely and just so what I figured it was Wednesday afternoon I started watching it it broke down a little bit kind of under\nThe five and I thought well if it goes through the twenty five this thing is going to sit there and fall apart it in and so for debating all day long with what to do with it in it\nAnd and I looked at the elections coming up in four weeks the Chinese situation was deteriorating by the ... and I was thinking there's no way this thing's going to hold up and we decided to go in and interestingly enough\nThe next morning the thing opened up down big truth to twenty five that we're watching just blew right through it on the opening it in is everybody hit the thing and then once that happened it triggered all the ... programs in the computer programs which you do a big chunk of the trading now to start in his shooting selling their position to the NASDAQ\n... and ... and it was straight down through the through the twenty five through the fifty in through the hundred day you know in a matter of\nA a basically a ... less than really adept at trading day and a half ... and so what we saw was you know the market went from about\nEight thousand down to almost Seventy seven fifty or so\nFor two hundred and fifty points on the NASDAQ very quickly\nThis a big drop a good deal or three over three three three and a half percent very quickly or just on that type of thing and and so in some stock sell as much as five percent or more a during that time frame this shows you the power of this ... this is one of the things we're really concerned about in the market is is\nIs how these markets are going to react with the biggest there's three big factors out there they're leading the investment and moving them market right now white to a stock buyback programs by corporations\nThe the indexing fad which has reached the level of basically the the Internet fad in Nineteen Ninety nine and quantitative a trading programs in artificial intelligence trading programs on Wall street those the big drivers and so once those things start kicking off\nThere's nobody underneath these markets\nBack in Nineteen eighty seven we thought the stock market was going to collapse\nBecause of portfolio insurance\nI don't think there was ten people on Wall street I'll say twenty people on Wall street to believe that at the time I I happen to know one of them was a mentor and ... there's probably not five in one of them was by mentor and then we believed it it it no one else I knew even the people that he talked to no one believed it\nBut but we understood what was going to happen you did you start getting some selling\nWith the portfolio insurance and so the the the wall street brokerage firms and insurance companies do this once it went down below a certain level they had to put in futures\nTo sit there and and make sure they were protected on the downside to they didn't lose money well once they did they started selling their futures that put more pressure on the market and made it go lower\nAnd then when it was lowered it put more pressure on these these hedger ... to to to sell more things to protect their portfolio additionally\nAnd it became a self fulfilling prophecy this time around and it was so that was a liquidity event we've only seen Nineteen Ninety nine was in the liquidity event\nEven two thousand eight really wasn't a liquidity event until very late in the cycle where the liquidity dried up in the the uh the the bond market\nIt and it really at the very end or\nThis time I think you could see a liquidity event because of those three particularly the artificial intelligence court programs in the\nThe ATF where where they will be nobody on the other side of the trade because the ...\nThose guys have just been forever and now when they turn to shelters\n... they're going to want to show but there's going to be no buyers and all the court programs and all the artificial and tells you approach I'm going to trigger it two things are either going to say sell sell sell are they going to say oh it's out of our bounds of predictability and they will immediately pulled back from the market because the computer programs will be will not work\nAt that point in time because because things will change and so that's going to completely drain out the liquidity out of the market\nAnd and so this is something we want to watch very closely over the next couple of day or the next couple of weeks to see what's going to happen in remember we have the election coming up uh in the elections coming up here in you know less than three four weeks less than a month in and so there's a lot of ... to to you know with the other thing we looked at is like\nThe ... we can't really we think we're going to hold the Senate the house as much tougher it's hard to predict exactly what I think we're going to hold the house just because how badly the Democrats have mishandled\nThe cabin off thing in particular uh\n[noise] but it's very very unpredictable and so it's real hard for me to see how the market's going to go up up on top of that thing and and and so all of these things are kind of converging on the markets and I think you really have to have cautious we hadn't put ahead John in probably a year year and a half\nSo uh it was very unusual for us to do this and I think you really have to be cautious on the markets overall I'll tell you what you got any question to come and give us a call at seven one three three three nine ten Seventy seven one three three three nine ten Seventy and is asking pointed out this week\nThat this is not a trade trade scripts if you listen to the media if you listen to the rest of Wall Street ... at at the beginning of the year last year they said look this is a trade skirmish\nPresident she's coming over here will be ironed out here shortly and we'll go on our way [noise] the terrorists won't ever be put in they won't be put on don't worry about this\nMove for and we said no this is a very serious thing Donald Trump is serious and we have a serious problem of very very serious problem with China stealing technology and\nAnd actually I didn't even say I said it was a problem with them seeing technology I really had no idea the depth of it's gone in and I think what's come out of this more and more this is a hot trade war I don't see there's any way you could look at it any other way I think some of these some of these terrorists might be permanent uh\nI I think this is I think this is a tough deal or a couple of things happened this week that we're really of interest or one of them was the uh\nThere was a big Bloomberg story on on um that the Chinese or a army intelligence ... defense group has was sneaking in illicit chips into mother boards\nThat we're going into American companies' servers and this ship about the size of a half the size of a grain of rice\nWas communicating waiting instructions for somewhere which could have been used to sabotage and bring down\nTo to break to hack into companies to steal technology including apple including Amazon including the CIA and the NSA possibly\n... and so but they also possibly they don't need to know exactly what they but they could have been used for in case of the war against China China could've collapsed or Internet using these things they were in the servers and Amazon and apple now\nApple and Amazon have denied that\nHowever this report was pretty specific uh about about what had happened in pretty specific about a meeting at the Pentagon about a year ago telling people not to use his company anymore\nAnd in Amazon went and bought another company that was ... involved in it to get control of it\nAnd and so this is that why this year like Ted what does this have to me it was the spicy what this tells us is we cannot depend on the hardware coming out of China or or in software in some cases\nIt and so this is a real danger this means that for key menu for key components of our Internet for defense systems in corporate America they are going to have to be made in the United states of America because we can't allow this stuff being made in China and they're sneaking in little bits of\nOf information to allow them to hack in typically remember when you hack in to a system there is a form the software this wasn't software this was they they put chips are hardware chips in place\nAnd so this is what this is very bullish for silicone valley very bullish for Austin I take your Austin one of the big winners in this thing is because what this means is we're going to have to move more and more factories in it of the supply chain is going to have to move back to the United states\nNot just because the job but also for national defense ... and so this is a big deal it's a real deal the supply chains are shifting every single major company news on in the world in the United states in particular is looking at their supply chains in China\nThe factories are now coming back here I'm hearing stories of this out there in in ... and so this is exciting stuff and and so this is but this also means it's a very tough situation with China and it it it's not going to go away I mean most reached they just had a story\nThey have Interpol is like the international police organizations so they have an American run at once in a while they have a European and they had a Chinese person run it well the Chinese person goes to China to visit relatives he disappears\nHe disappears so\n... we don't even know what's going on in China they're stealing technology there jailing people it will they're putting in camps all over the place they're taking over the south China Sea they're threatening our destroyers they're putting a illicit chips into our computers\nAt the uh hello uh this is a big deal this is a massive shift we were in the process of moving our entire manufacturing base to China and that's come to a screeching halt\nThis is very good for jobs in this country for workers in this country for manufacturing in this country and it's changing things but it's putting pressure if this is one of the reasons why the Chinese a big ... buyers of our bonds will suddenly the bond you'll start going up\nThis week so big changes are happening or by the way it if if if you have a question or comment this is the last segment of the ... saving show you can get in here seven one three three three nine ten Seventy were life on Saturdays and Sundays I think we do replays but if it's Saturday you can call in a\nSo so a lot of things that we're dealing with the trade war we're dealing with a an election coming up we're dealing with breakouts in interest rates above that that what we both people perceived danger levels on the ten year was three the danger level on the\n[noise] the thirty year treasury was three and a quarter it's broken above that time precaution if you've been following them accept savings of port we ... we said you want to have higher levels and cash shorter term bonds\nSo when interest rates right up you just kind of ride up the little the increases in rates every time and in the short term\nUh and you want to be cautious and now you know ... week to week two reports or do we warn you about the tech sector and we said it was a bubble and we said to avoid the sector and now it's started to break down\nAnd and so uh interest rates may sadistic\nThe ten year bond his is risen to the highest level in seven years so these rates are definitely moving up in here and this is affecting the stock market we have the ... if you look at the emerging markets it's like a disaster area out their emerging markets Argentina turkey Brazil sold off\nA it's one of them after another uh ... if you look at the European markets are starting to sell off you look at\nChina China was down twenty five percent rallied some in here you know the United states\nJapan's doing OK but the the S. and P. five hundred is virtually outside of Japan the only only asset class in the world that's holding up right now and the rest of them are all breaking down all over the place and and uh you know in the in the problems are ... starting to manifest themselves in the United states keep in mind\nIf you're a multinational company if I'm moving my factories that that means I have to spend money that means you have to spend more money to resource my products and my costs a little more money\nIf I'm hiring workers here the unemployment rate's three point seven percent part for me to hire workers I got to pay more money if I ever if I have workers in the United states they're all they're all hearing their friends are getting raises they're going to want raises Ryan wants to raise in so [laughter] you know\nIt's it it it it kind of a ... it's\nSort of feeding itself well uh yeah I have to build a factory back here that you know it comes out of the profits a little bit you know so we're looking at higher cost tough to hire workers higher wage cost all these things are starting to wait we're looking at terrorists you know if I get hit with the ten or twenty five percent terrified come back and\nCheck the price up ten or twenty five percent or do I eat some of that\nTear off you know figuring out they have to dig into profit so everything is starting to work\nAgainst corporate America and then you've got some of these idiots CEOs like bank of America and you know deciding in city group that they don't want to do you do business with gun dealers and you know starting to you and we're going to have read banks and blue banks out there and you've got the other CEOs that uh yeah the guy on Facebook or one of their their employees\nShows up at the hearing to kind of back his friend up on the Capitol hearing tobacco judge Kavanaugh up and and he gets to be raided by Sheryl Sandberg at Facebook because he stood up for his friend at who happened to be conservative I mean ... the one of these corporate executives thinking that they're going to go round trashing Republicans and conservatives all over the place and not\n... as scape some type of scrutiny or or or or something else on top of them were were maybe we have to put laws in place\nTo uh to to mandate what they can and can't do never mind I think you can I think this is over I make a prediction you're going to see some CEOs in\nThe United states major multinational sued for a\nFor breaching their produce you duties shareholders by letting their politics given the way of good business practices\nAt the you know it's it's one thing if I think business is going to go this way I'm going to do it's another thing if I take the corporation and moving in a direction to to to to to further my own political agenda and that is a breach of the ... duty for corporate CEOs and I think you're going to see some lawsuits before this is over\nOn that subject would actually be talking to some people on that subject\nSo corporate America their profits are going to come under pressure at the same time it's very high so it's really a time precaution in these markets we wrote in our ... most recent max out saving report\nIt we have some of the highest levels on a ... basis in some other ones you're looking at Nineteen twenty nine Nineteen Ninety nine in some cases two thousand in in a I mean these things take time I mean but we're seeing it already it's starting to what's happened in the emerging markets\nA the daughter's going up the higher the daughter goes the less profitable lotta multinational companies are because about forty something for forty two percent sometimes it's\nThe five percent of their revenue comes their profits comes from overseas so\nYou know all of these things are starting to work against the u._s. stock market and I think it's really a time to be cautious so anyway ah those are interesting things this week big breakout on interest rates the upside a very tight labor market inflationary a\nBig breakdown in the NASDAQ went down went down to the two hundred hundred day moving average the fifty day as a warning sign\nAnd it barely held the hundred came back up above the hundred a not a good situation suit time precaution look if you want to hear more about this or if you want to talk to me a couple of things you can do you can go to our website ... savings dot com that max out savings with an S. dot com\nWe talk about retirement planning Social Security estate planning reducing your income taxes you name it we talk about it and we try to have more fun\nThan a human being should be allowed to have one talking about all of this boring financial stuff down there is no doubt and this week is no exception because we're going to have an absolutely fantastic show\nLined up for you but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I Am Kendall right the host of money matters with Kim array [noise]\nBecky jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is an honor it is a privilege\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so if you would like to learn more about us you can find us on the Web we are at money matters dot net\nAnd one final thought is not to brag at all but uh recently are actually for the sixth year in a row I was named one of the top one hundred a financial independent financial advisors or by parents and\nWe love you\nWell thank you end up but without our clients we would be nowhere so therefore I put that one I give it to them now let me go over with you what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land of personal finances so first of all I'm the economy is strong\nOkay by all measures we got a um uh the employment data looked a little softer than people thought but that's okay it's still pretty strong about two hundred thousand jobs a month now which is an economy our size that's pretty darn\nAnd and so the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and we saw that the ah the ten year went ah which is the most watched interest rate that uh uh traders look at has gone up and now it's looking like it's going to have around three and a quarter if it stays there that's a big thing so I Want to talk\nWith you about have you review your bond portfolio lately\nOkay because if you have an ... you are you should I think so we'll talk about that also\nSince we are a retirement planning specialist we talk with our clients about a planning around all of the things that we can think of that has to do with achieving\nTheir goals having them we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay we want you to go play and have fun and just relax and enjoy and so to do that we believe you need to have a a a plan in place that addresses all the things that could harm you\nAnd believe it or not when you are retired there are actually Eighteen risks that you face they're Eighteen of him\nAnd properly designed plan in my opinion is one that addresses all Eighteen of those so we're going to talk about risk number seven this week which is financial elder abuse okay so if you have an older family member or someone in their seventies eighties\nUh or or older I Want to talk with you about that it's a big big deal uh unfortunately now also we're gonna talk about Social Security this week so ah we're going to answer the question when should you wait until you're Seventy just start collecting Social Security\nOkay so there are reasons why you may want to do that and so we want to help you understand that uh that strategy\nNow also from a from an investment standpoint you know we want as I said we want you to enjoy your second childhood so whatever that means to you if you if it means playing a lot of golf if it means traveling if it means spending time with your grandchildren whatever that means to you that's great we want to help you achieve that\nBut if you lose a large amount of your money in the next market downturn then I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nSo therefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that is called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by hold myth that is a I heard or I've called because I've heard it and that is that if you sell\nYou know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing\nAnd that's like the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I wanted to go with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nDoing very well and\nBuses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week\nAnd this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nBut this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your or not it to your very ah what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive end up before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and just puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she's like a big dog you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\n[noise] and uh so the the update 'cause people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that\nA noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she slots and boom a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she pays right on the patio and golly I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but I Hope so [laughter]\nAnyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you review your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market we're falls and crashes it's like this this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a a a couple of months ago we\nReduced the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up\n... and ... because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we wanna we wanna make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your ... or better yet go on our website money

on this show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and

play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring a financial stopped\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisor for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients and\nEven with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start and then there's another which is how should I collect it and\nIt's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married\nIn ages difference in income different in health all those kinds of things there actually\nEight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nOkay so how do you figure that oh well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's ripe for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our firm we put we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so\nBe that as it may I Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy\nAnd start claim Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually\nStart when you're sixty two or ... assuming you qualify so you can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you are going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy it increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive there to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to sort of some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to weigh two you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter] if you don't want it I'll take it [laughter]\nBut uh anyway yeah so if you if you feel that the you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait till you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon\nIf you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period than we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement so\nHere you got two options won it and they are they all start with going to our website which is money matters dot net okay so the website is money matters dot net now while you're there you can either decide you want to visit directly with an advisor and if you click on meat with an advisor we'll call you will schedule time to visit\nAnd we want to look at a your entire financial life we want to look at from agency and we want to help you make the decisions
