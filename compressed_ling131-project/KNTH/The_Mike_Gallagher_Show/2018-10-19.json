the Republicans in control the house in the Senate did all roads lead to November the ...\nAnd we've got some real extra central threats going on we got thousands of migrants headed for the U.S Mexico border\nFrom Honduras from Guatemala wondering what's gonna happen and isn't it fascinating and the Democrats thinks that somehow this is their political moment somehow they think it's to their advantage\nThe thousands of people are doubling down against the president who has vowed to close the border this is as far as many of us are concerned a threatened invasion of the United states I don't know how you describe it\nThousands of people saying we're going to illegally cross the border and and and come into the United states whether you like it or not\nNot only with the American people not stand for it as president won't either and the ones who are out of touch the ones who are going to lose on this issue or the Democrats the crazy\nDemocrats as President Trump called them last night and another one of his political rallies you had to stop and men to Montana more on that and just a moment\nIt's important for me to listen to smart voices and I try to do that all the time when you call me at one eight hundred six five five might listen carefully I think I Know my audience better than just about any radio host in America\nI Believe I was one of the few radio hosts

everybody laughs but I'm always afraid that in a room full of six hundred people fifty or more think he's telling the truth\n[laughter] so I always have to correct him no you you're the one who actually wavered on President Trump in the beginning you're the one who had to come along you're the one we had to win over\nAnd for some they still haven't won we haven't won them over rather they still haven't seen the light they still haven't recognized the extraordinary accomplishments of the first twenty months there too great pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes\nOver Weekly Standard and the other one by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has freed the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with a Fred Barnes piece over some facts because I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that as you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the polls don't believe the lie\nThat somehow but rock Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy that we're enjoying right now\nFred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're gonna posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it Fred Barnes rights but rock Obama is a proud men\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he stoop to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punch no surprise there either if the Democrats won the election twenty sixteen Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring to Fort Point two percent he's referring to the growth rate for the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct\nAbout the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening the shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of gross from down to up\nThat's what tax cuts deliver\nAnd tax hikes do not here's the Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this ally that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of in Deering that he had such a head makes such a silly claim here are some facts ...
