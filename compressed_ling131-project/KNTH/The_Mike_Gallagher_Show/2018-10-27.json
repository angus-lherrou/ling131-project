associates a state\nAnd retirement planning if you have questions are jealous about your retirement future if you'd like to sit down with him and begin that plan that strategy session to secure up your retirement to feel more confident about your retirement future\nEight hundred Ninety five three one two three six days the number that eight hundred nine to five\nThirty one thirty six gas that we have some more questions and we have some more time on the show you ready\nI'm ready to go home hot ...\nGay darling rights to you from spring valley village she says that my husband and I are both retiring in about three years we've done pretty well and we had about ten different retirement accounts like for all and K as an IRAs\nBut the thing is they're spread out all over the place and we're not really sure what to do with these and retirement\nWhich should we use first when we retire what kind of income can we expect we've done a good job fading out it's just that we don't know what to do now one of our brokerage just told us that we can take four percent withdraws in retirement and that should be okay but we aren't so sure\nYeah [laughter] so so so you know military post answer you know took four percent four percent ruled been around forever and it was created by the economist but here's the problem\nWhat if your portfolio is stressed out like it would have been in two thousand eight there's a lot of people that had to make some dramatic changes in their lifestyle in their\nFinancial future for retirement some of them had to dig into their kids' Educational Fund it was not a pretty sight\nBecause everybody thinks that the market's going to be you know la la land forever and ever and that's not true because everybody's got a timeline\nIn if you need to tap in to your retirement portfolio and it's going down the same time then you have double trouble is kind of like you just installed to stick it on your\nBucket instead of just one or better said you got to stick it on one part of the bucket that is your income but then you allow the stock market come along and get hit it with about two or three jobs with a ice pick\nAnd it's it's declining faster than you wanted\nAnd surely faster than you would plan so\nHere's the problem you know what ... what are these investments going to generate as far as income I have no idea because I don't know what kind of investments they have but some of them are going to be you know it's gonna be diversified I'm sure are going to have some bonds and there's going to have some equities and mutual funds and blah blah blah blah blah but the first thing I Would tell you especially if they're getting closer to retirement\nBecause that's typical I I mean maybe not ten or eleven but four or five is normally you know I see that all the time because maybe they\nRepresented multiple companies and created multiple phones case but it's time to maybe consolidate trying to do to bring the the scarecrow back together after the ... got a hole in the ... so we're gonna we're gonna consolidate those monies were gonna give you a salad snapshot\nOf what exactly you can expect\nWith this a mass amount of money and then we're going to show you what your ... gonna be 'cause most of the people when they're retiring\nThe majority of their money is in qualified plans meaning I raised for one case things like that one because they were more discipline\nTo contribute through their paycheck than to save after the money gotten their hands because at them and get their hands that's when they go spend it\nSo you find that few and far between the somebody's really disciplined and have a respectable amount of non Iraqi money but regardless consolidation for a ... in the spring valley village and that would be highly recommend it and then get yourself a plan you know what\nNot that you need to stay with a budget but it's nice to know what is your budget I mean what's coming in what's going on right it's a good idea to just kind of have an idea are you really hemorrhaging money the way you live near lifestyle and if you were when you like to know sooner than later because you don't want to be able to go\nIn a position on it being a position where you had to go back to work and then you're not going to get a when we're finding right now if someone isn't it position normally they're referring to us that come to us after the fact that we're going you know what\nI Would have never told you retire this is why you're going to need this and that's not even stress tests for goodness sakes so when I say stress tests many though in a bad market or\nYou know health issue that was unexpected recall those the curb loss of life on the show\nYou know and so now you're stuck and you had to go back to employment and maybe you can't find a job that you had before that was paying you the money you had so it's always about being proactive in Bree proficient in going forward with a solid plan\nThis is what we do for a living upside down under water every day these are the things we address for people they walk out with that value basically that sounds a sleep sleep soundly at night ... music so that's of interest to you were here for you my name's Joseph ... got almost forty years experience you can reach me at one eight hundred\nNine to five three one three six again that's one eight hundred nine to five thirty one thirty six\nAnd ... website if you want more information about Johnson and his team if you'd like to submit a question if suddenly be answered on a future shall we just had on over to mission retirement dot com that's mission retirement\nDot com bust that here's a question from rusty he writes in from friends lead he says I'm married and I have three kids\nYou are in high school one is in college I'm Wondering what I should do with my old four O. one K. since I'm changing jobs have around seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars in it and that's the lion's share of what I've saved for retirement I don't see myself retiring in the near future\nHow early in ten years but I don't want to lose that have already said should I Know that can I knew for all and K or\nLeave it alone lap four one K. questions today\nThey are but the the you know there's a lot of money out there and for one case trillions of dollars but good good good point for ... yeah you can move it over into your new four one K.\nI Would just tell you I I Would not be able to answer your question until I saw what your choices were for your new for all and K for example what we're looking at a fortune five hundred company ... choices other day\nAnd they had like fifty five choices in about a third of them were all a target funds and target Pfizer fine what that means is if I have a target fun of two thousand twenty five\nThen what happens is when I get closer to two thousand twenty five it's that the target fun is thinking that that is when I'm actually going to retire so they'll start becoming really conservative in regard to the positions in that in that target fun\nWhen I get closer to that age or that in this case that year so it it's it's not that diversified as far as the choices so the point is if you took your four O. one K. and you self directed it into an IRA then you have\nUnbelievable choices hundreds of thousands of choices you know in Iraq versus a foreign K. so as long as you know that you have opportunities in in you know I don't know what your what your passion is there's some people that they they can actually take some of their money and they can self directed into real estate\nMoguls wanting to do that so you can do that if you wanted to so there's endless possibilities and choices in an irate versus a four one K. and also I I liked the fact that hey you're going to have choices in your own K. you this is a point in time when you could maybe let off the gas or put a little more gas on it\nOn on a switching over to an irate so they can go both ways so I'm\nAlways about the point of diversification and self directing that money but you know I have I have absolutely took some clients that it would be your best interest to move your old foreign cage and your insurer new for okay but we have a rule of thumb around here and that is if you're no longer with your last job either should your money\nYou want to get it out of that other place at least you can do that\nI like that that to get her off than if you're moving your money should live with you in right absolutely goes back to that the other question that came in and I think\nFor I think it was ... and Darla had all those different accounts ten and boy I I I Would just think if you're not sure where all your money is that you can't\nPinpoint that that's probably an indication that you got too many accounts right\nRight and that's why I was telling you I I mean that's a lot to keep up with in in the sink you know if you had to enter I mean like I said most of them have four or five but I if I was asked you okay\nJones can you tell me how your allocated in that one over there and then this one here and there to get you know it's gonna be a guarantee they're going to say no that they're not going to know and that's a problem if if you can't tell me how your allocated that's problem number one because here we are we're you know\nNine plus years in this Bull Run it's like a helium balloon it can't sustain it forever so my question is how do you plan for that are you pro active enough in addressing those issues that potentially could hit it at any point\nShould know that you're not going to go you know dramatically backwards and that's again we keep I feel like I'm just always\nYou know kicking this tire a dead horse or whatever you want to call it but you know it's about being prepared it's about being prudent having a plan in place\nAnd then then ... once you have a place is just tweaking it\nActually owned by someone who's currently

October\nBut by me back up your ... I think it was August we we went and talked about the the fangs Facebook apps that books and Google\nWe wrote about in the report that Facebook apple Amazon\nNetflix in Google and Microsoft contributed to Ninety eight percent of the return of the year to date in the S. and P. five hundred\nWe said these things were heading for trouble are we said we said that ... was vastly overvalued comparable to Nineteen Ninety nine a we laid out the case it was a bubble and a ... earlier in the year we put in some little charts of different bubbles in the fang bubble was in there\nAnd we said to stay out of the sector avoid the sector it was going down in a\nSure enough it started going down and it just completely falling apart now and we said everything\nIs working to get to where we're the big trends are changing in in the world and you know this this affects your retirement and one of the things over the last decade or so it's really the last decade it's if it's been\nA real you know I I I really think it's almost been a a a different than the Federal Reserve has stepped in and and and basically you know we've pretty much have relied on a free market a a democratic free market capitalist\nSystem and and the Chinese you know they're more communist Russians or ... or ... you know going back to more of a communist system in and I think\n... and some of the ivory towers a at Princeton and Yale and places like that I think they figured out an alternative way which is more of a manage the economy you using using um\nMoney ... at the Federal Reserve and and and so when we got into a financial crisis uh\nIn two thousand eight rather than the Federal Reserve stepping up and say hey we're doing some things wrong here uh we're instead of them going look we're not growing our economy uh we're we're losing business to China uh globalization we're letting too much of our factories and equipment move overseas we're not we're not educating our people\nAre when we're not deregulating economy it's becoming over regulated or over tax instead of the Federal Reserve saying look we can't cannot afford these entitlements of\nOf Social Security disability Medicare or medical costs are sparring out of control we can't afford this we need to change this is an opportunity for better reserves said\nTo basically to wash their ... step back let us hand list will get the economy going you guys don't need to change anything\nWe went through the worst economic crisis since the great depression and didn't change do you think\nYou look at the great depression and you look what came out of it it was one major change after another to try to improve the United states if you look what came out of the two thousand eight\nFinancial caught virtually nothing changed because bin ... and the Federal Reserve stepped up and said let us try a new way that's different from the free market capitalist system it's called ...\nAnd what we can do is we'll flood the world with money and everyone will grow in an asset prices will go up in in in the economy will trickle down and it hasn't worked so when did they give us they gave us the worst level of growth in in a decade since the Nineteen thirties\nWork the worse it averaged about one point nine percent I I think it was the first decade we didn't have growth over two percent\nDuring the year ... or ... at an annual basis two percent horrible so what happened she started listening all these politicians look we'll just never see growth again in the United states\nDon't remember this one those jobs are never coming back\nYou know we just have to ... we we have to uh train an educator people Paul Volcker you know ... I've been a credible critic of the Federal Reserve it Paul Volcker ran the Federal Reserve did the way the Federal Reserve is supposed to be run ran it tough with inflation got out of control he shut it down you know he made some comments the other day\nThat he even Paul Volcker was\nWas really you know when you talk about an elite to we tend to dock elite ... Paul Volcker was in ... Paul Volcker did things right way he did things what was the best interest of the United states of America and he he didn't let politics getting his way in and he had some comments in one of his comments was\nHe he talked about Donald Trump and he's no fan of Donald Trump but he goes you know\nDonald Trump wrist seized upon a with a middle class he realized that uh you know that that they were having huge problems and they were being ignored\nBy the people in Washington the elite 'cause they ignore them and he got into it and that's why he got it but he he said something even more interesting he made some comments about globalization he said you know I think I tend to all these conferences he attends conferences that have very high level\nIt it's an there'll be conferences and they go on and on and you know the economists would get up there discussion globalism how it was fantastic all around the world was growing and stuff\nIt and he said inevitably after these ... ... you know the conflicts come up with the question and answer session the you know a hand would go up and it's it ... the person would ask\nWhat what about the middle class or what about the working people in the United states what about them and the answer was we shouldn't these elite people was\nWilling gauging retraining will retrain them you know they'll go back to school well we went to a decade of that in the middle class in this country in the working people have sit there had been seeing their their standard of living plunge\nIt well this is going on and now this is all to and yet all those people in Washington did not get that and understand it so now there's been a revolt in the country and things are rapidly changing\nAnd uh the\nThe China that everybody bet on for the last twenty five years yeah opening up and becoming a new modern society you know just like the United states but instead of red white and blue they have read it was written yellow and all\nThey happen to you it goes to the other person that's on the account\nVersus if you have like a a humidity property or or a tennis in common account then a\nVisiting happen to you the other ... the the the accounts show the other person's name and your name for the state and then it goes through your to your state and through your will to probate if people talk a lot about avoiding probate that's good but I understand you can kind of accidentally\nOr avoid probate an inch screw your whole we'll up if you're not careful so so it it seemed ... saved support just go to our website ... savings dot com let's take a call here from from Oscar Oscar how you doing today\nThey're pretty good you know\nThe the dollar situation all over the world cup dollars yeah or the dollar drought and places like Brazil and turkey and Iran and urgent you name it the Central America\nThe dollar ... syndrome that people are coming over here there's no dollars over there and I I think that's part of what you're talking about here the\nOpening of China no dollars either because the customers are broke all the dollars that the company of crude oil in dollars\nThat they have accrued ... they're not going to come back we'll be there so they won't be able to grow\nAnd so the whole world right now really most of the world is a research from the Russian right though countries also\nAnd I I think if you were making like a weatherman and the ... ... dollars are lacking that's where the problem or in the country do you agree with me on the\nYeah no I look I say I think when the fed flooded the world of dollars over the last decade lots of of of companies\nAre in countries borrowed in dollars 'cause we're seeing cheap and uh\nAnd now they're ... interest rates are going up and more importantly the dollars going up and so if you're in your country and and the ... going up twenty percent against your currency well your businesses in that currency in your your debt that means your debt effectively went up twenty percent and they can't cover it it and so\nYeah ... China China China isn't it yeah I you know the more\nWe look at China it never gets any better it actually gets where we wrote about just three or four years ago I'd try to the debt levels and they've completely spiral out of control but here's the thing ... is it we wrote some of this about a year to back on their their currency\nA foreign exchange are going to hear more about that I think they got about two three trillion dollars if I remember right uh it's either two or three ... in\nIn the uh the the the reserves they need about ... I think it's ... they mean about two point five trillion two point four trillion to maintaining economy their size or foreign exchange reserves\nSo is they dip into that they they don't really have the three trillion dollars piled up to defend their currencies everybody thinks it's only probably about six hundred million or a five to six hundred billion or\nLess ... and that's not as big numbers everybody thinks in and I think they're having a tremendous amount of difficulty controlling ... maintaining their currency it in and keep in mind that this was one ... uh Oscar and what you and all our listeners understand let's say you're in China right\nYou're worth a couple of million bucks we'll say you're rich and us five million dollars over there\nOkay you're seeing what's happening in China you got a family over there\nWhat are you going to do I'm asking you ask her\nThe family comes and they go to San Francisco or whatever New York and you know they're they're just getting over here they have an ... babies are they coming Monday and real estate and all over the world because they want to maintain their uh\nOther thing that ... the on earth is going to confetti so they want to come out and and make sure that the hell out of your ... going on that getting ...\n... yeah but it's even worse than that\nIt's if they're if the government falls apart or if they're ... if if someone if their family becomes you know somehow dragged into one of these purges or something\nThey need to be able to get out or they need to get their family out they're going to lose ... ... and and so there's massive money pouring out of China and now with this ... with the with with with the ah\nBasically the reform back to hardline communism it's you know it it's going to be harder to keep their countries want to watch their currency says yeah China has massive problems their debt levels are materially higher than the United states their corporate debt levels\n[noise] make car corporations look like you know the uh the rock of Gibraltar a day in and look they're in trouble over their their their economy but I Want a when what people understand is what\nTheir economy boomed because they opened up to a free market system over there were everyone kind of ... ... it's it's ... ... it's reverting back to a communist system so that they they have no chance to recover it I I made it a little comment about sign of Kim and Kim China\nThey basically put some guy in charge of both companies they didn't even merged with companies just said look this guy's going to be in charge I mean that's what you're dealing with a child\nIf the people do that no big highrise buildings and all these properties of the group [noise]\nYou know you don't you don't you don't know man that were there and the only the ... okay so let's say you have all these white elephant building standing by themselves and the bureaucrats have to fill 'em up\nBureaucracy is another one at a real estate is basically the the ... the cities that they develop they're not good at that\nYeah I've toured some of the city some of the in the cities who did you come around the cities in at night there's like no lights on in the buildings are like ... I think is\nThere like you know bureaucracy here\nDo you think that all the room and all the infrastructure the improvement as far as real estate whether it's you know this step above ground because you know the ... doesn't belong to the people we belong to the government and you believe that any bureaucracy can take care of him he buildings\nCan take care of them are getting filled up can take care of hustling to get the ... you know the building filled up and and going at the end up being going\nYou know bureaucracy and that's one of the Chinese ... there's a big weakness for the very big part of what they've done and and bureaucracies cannot do what they have to do it on the you know they they see the\nProperty is going so there's a lot that they cut another going into the weakness of communism\n... that kind of falling ... ... ... they were sort of in a free market type of economy and they said they're starting to drift back into communism and I think that really is not understood by anyone out there because they're all looking at ... and edit it in in respect to the United states in the trade war but they're not looking is like\nThe actual the economy of their own country I mean isn't doesn't work yeah and they were to get to give you an example if we suddenly decided to become more communist over here what do you think would happen to our\nCars were already are let me say something the other really pissed me off of South Korea and let me these\nThese these ... you hear all these people say be nice to be nice I mean I you know this guy went overboard that's got to do that about sending packages I mean that that's terrible [laughter] but the\nThing is yeah we cannot be nice when they're going to pick our constitution we you know we gotta we cannot be nice for election thing you know we cannot be nice\nWeather quite the new things to us and for our constitution because we put a lot of wars and and they were not life or what we\nDid and to be nice if not right\nAnd you don't want to know I I agree Oscar it's called standing up to a bully\n[laughter] yeah but the thing is standing up to order like that there are constitutional piece by piece you cannot be nice about that because our forefathers thought\nYou know it barely porridge and these other places but we could have this ... and now they're tearing up by ... and everything in our way of living by by going communism or social is\nUm you know look I Know I think a good good good points Oscar thanks for the call thank you very much yeah look I think you know I was I think you're right I mean this this is what we're dealing with I mean I generally think it's it's standing up to bully\nOr in you know we don't do things like they do and uh [noise] you just got to stand up to these people and young let them seem real human look we got boating coming up\nYou get early voting out there now there's huge or early voting I'm hearing all over the country massive for early voting if you haven't voted get out there and vote or or you can wait till election day uh\nYou know I just make sure you get your friends to vote you know in ... ... talk to your family get them all out devoted so important to vote for this election it really is I mean\nWe're now seeing that the Democratic party's really becoming almost more socialist in a way in in ... oh you need to do is look in Venezuela and look at any country you know people forget Nazi Germany the Nazis were socialist\nI mean I I that's forgotten by a lot of people but it you know so ... I I Am getting a lot of questions on the election\nI think it's looking really like we're going to hold back at work in a hold the Senate I'd be shocked if we are no I I mean I've been saying it's a coin flip I think it's really leaning toward I think we're going to hold the house I think the Democrats are so badly\nI won't say they miss played their hand I think they showed their hand to what they were going to do and I think the American people kind of seeing who they really are and and so I think it's looking really good I mean it's the ... you know\nUh the uh\nYou know I where does it go look it it doesn't look good for next week or ... in this market could just completely melt down next week I don't think they're going to allow that to happen a but it there's really ... I think at a minimum it has to go back to support\nWhich is really a on on some of your numbers on the S. and P. is is probably about I think it's twenty three would have I have on that number a twenty three Seventy six maybe a year\nTwenty three Seventy five or twenty five Seventy five excuse me ... and that's simply going back to the uh the twenty five fifty each ... that's going back to the February ... I I think this market is going to go back to the February loews\nOr an retest it and it was sort of see how that I mean if it goes back there in in the elections are coming up\nIn in ... we hold the house in the Senate you could see a relief rally a ... we'll see how that goes uh I I think that would be very\nUh you know the uh [noise] looking at some of the other uh\nMarkets around the world are looking at the German market determine market has blown right through it went down in in in\nIn sort of test you didn't really tests the lows basically blew right through the lows came up through the February lows in a bidding plunge back down through the February loews or so a number of these the European markets are through the February lows\nThe uh the uh\nEmerging markets as we discussed earlier in the show the ... there through the lows through the February Los in breaking down or China's broken down underneath pillows a you know it and so really it it it's just\nIt's just I mean the the the the the Dow Jones isn't the best shape and that's thirty stocks and as we've been saying that's the easiest one to manipulate I mean and I always have been feeling like they've been really trying to hold that went up to try to give her even one idea that things aren't that bad but\nUh you know emerging markets are down twenty seven percent Shanghai's down thirty percent off the top or you know it's the Nikkei was down Thirteen percent off the top I mean it's just not a pretty picture almost any way you you look at it a couple positive this week a\nLong term rates drop some which means a government bonds they went up a little bit uh this kind of a flight to quality gold was up some uh we made some adjustments on our goal portfolio or we sold one uh this week uh we're we're\nGoing to probably buy some more back I I think there are ... their little down trend now but I but gold\nGold was up on the week and then I think you're going to see later this year or the first part of next year you can see a very substantial move up in the gold stocks I think that's one way or the gold stocks are going to do well in here we really liked the whole sector\nOr\nThe or we you know we're still short the NASDAQ a ... as as we've talked about on the show for weeks or in in really ... that to to us was really just an opportunity and uh the Dahmer was up ... the author was still up this week so you know the the the crisis\nWe're really seeing the uh we're seeing the dollar or go up and we're seeing interest rates start to drop a little bit I think you're going to see spreads widen corporates I wouldn't be in the junk bonds right now that sector and all I think that's why I think if you\nDo see a slowdown in the ... you could see a little too slow down to the spreads or get a wide nothing hurts you there you want to be in very high quality bonds high quality short term bonds or you want to be in treasuries you want to be a money market funds you want to be in T. bills you want to be in CDs you end up being precious metals I mean I think those are the real\nOpportunities in the in the market here let's take a call for a man who in how you doing\nHow are you I have a ... thing to ask you about what China and you know everything that's been going on with them for so many years but the fact first of all I wanted to mention several things and I'll I'll give you points right off the bat manufacturing and then the chemical ... and then the pharmaceutical and a\n... where China and the relationship that they have and of course caterpillar and the United states if I understand that China on fifty one percent of them in there on the Dow right\nYeah I Know they don't do fifty one percent they might on fifty one percent of of maybe a company in China that produces some of their products\nOh you mean caterpillar yeah yeah but they don't have the one person they do not yes\nOkay but if I understand that whenever they agreed to manufacture or are there is in agreement by and\nThere are a lot of they got it got to it's a good point and typically what it is is if they want to put a factory or main sell something in China they have to have like caterpillar China in a Chinese company owns fifty one percent of that subsidiary right so but that but the main company to do not\nBut my concern is you know how many how many companies is that there are ... that are U.S companies and then also I Know they have bought a lot of our hotel over here and resort and things\nAnd they've got to think they got a big hole and Hollywood and everything but one thing very much concerns me that I've gotten a raise rate and gotten quite a bit and not\nFrom Iraq is that the pharmaceutical manufacturing Ninety percent of our pharmaceuticals or in China and of course there's been a lot of situations where\nNot only that they did this and Charlie him saying put the odd things into the pharmaceutical calls illnesses\nThat have been situations because of the lack of control [noise] uh what uh what they do over there it's not like the FBI here but uh\nThat's a big major concern when you got a pharmaceuticals and vaccines and all kinds of things and now you're saying that said that and all that kind of stuck and month than to it I mean if\nIt does on an arm and company mayor\nYeah but I'm saying it's it's it's been very you know that situation than saying it might have pharmaceuticals the help that that that can affect you know if somebody decides to uh adult to write\nSomething just by Alan out at one time you know they they can cause a major situation of killing a lot of people\nYeah yeah look I I'm not sure ... right now most of the drugs are produced are produced here my understanding is they\nCome in here and their package care\nYou know in in\nYour actually manufactured there\nYet that you know that's news to me I think some of 'em are but I think\nThe majority of them are are here but look at it it's a real concern because I Do know as you point out the FDA it's really a stickler for I mean ... ... it's surprising what they'll deem is unacceptable I mean people will be pretty shocked\nA that these things have to be a very high quality purity exactly by the way it has they have to detail exactly the manufacturing process and they can't even deviate from the manufacturing process\nHere so yet look this is a concern in I'm not I don't think they they produced\nA huge amount of the drugs or I might be wrong on that but make no mistake you're right they're out to get every single industry and move it to China and and we've just been completely ... asleep at the switch and the more research you do on this as you've done in the more really worrisome it really ... I mean I I\nWell well when they when I stopped me an hour and become an enemy yeah and there is a bigger say are and they have so much of what we have you know not only are manufacturing but just how much and I got her hand and something like\nThat that's a major issue when all these crazy people love it here with these corporations and you're talking about it that corporations that are out there\nYou know running down where there are all part of that one world order of global is something you know\nThat yeah oh yeah and I'm coming up by that but there\nIs a lot of things that they have to consider it you don't make it don't make deals on other work\nNot good points that I think for the call me back to bite yeah and that's why it is that right and that's what's happened things for the call and I didn't mean to Russia but I've got to finish up a few things from near the industrial look here's the good news and the saying is\nYou when you talk to Democrats in Republican politicians they all get it I I I tell you what I think if there's one issue that they're probably closing ranks on more than the United states in anything it's China\nAre are are executives I think behind the scenes are probably more positive than we realize because they're afraid to say anything publicly because they will be sanctioned by China or their company could be\nBut the but I I think the establishment really gets the threat to China now in in where I where I think it's just rows not well known I think it's having ramifications\nShould junior seeing these markets look I I think you've got to be cautious in here I think you've got to have your defense on the field in this market the good news is that I didn't get to get enough time to talk as on this today as one or two but I Try to expand ...\nSince two thousand and eight to two thousand in sixteen almost the fed funds were close to zero which means you got close to zero on your money funds in your short term money on your treasury bills and everything that's moved up now ... now to point two percent\nTo point you know well over two percent on treasuries money markets are getting up there there's now it for the people that are conservative cautious what money and the silence there's opportunity to get some fear rates of return that's helping out the you want to have cash on the sidelines you would have been high quality situation she wanted to be very defensive\nWe're probably going to go down to the February Los\n... and I think they ... they wouldn't have to decide what to do but I think he wanted to be in high quality safety have your ... playing on the field in this type of environment right now I think the decade of of of writing that the uh the ... the index S. and P. five hundred index Monday's over and done and\nAnd this week we have a lot of boring financial stuff to talk about because man has it been event fall on the markets and we have so much to talk about with you but before we go one step further let me introduce myself I have been a sort of I Am can write the host of money matters which can rewrite\n[noise] that you had\nBeen a a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years [noise]\nAnd I do\nFeel good and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd as a farm are for money matters we specialize in retirement planning so we work primarily with people that are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and that we currently work with over for a thousand four hundred beautiful wonderful families we are so blessed\nAnd all the ideas that we talk about the show these are the same idea that we talk about with them every day of the week when we visit\nSaudi go over with you uh what what we're gonna talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land a personal finances so um first of all\nIf you haven't noticed the stock market the Dow the S. and P. have been on a decidedly downward path shall I say I'm over the last what six weeks now\nAnd uh so many of you who have been lifted a show for many many years now may be wondering if it is time to get out of the ah stock market up the S. and P. and other things and so I've been getting a question a lot and it reminds me right now I have two thousands\nAs you guys may remember for those of you who've listened to the show for low those many years or who have been getting my weekly a market alert email\nYou know the I in two thousand seven in November we uh we said it was time to sell and to get out of the stock market and and to stay out until an June of two thousand nine when our by came\nAnd so those of you follow the advice route of the stock market during the credit crisis during the stock market crash of overweight\nAnd that there are some similarities right now to two thousand seven that I Want to share with you because it is looking like there's a there's a possibility that it may be time to sell so I Want to talk about that with you\nKnow also um this week we're going to continue or in our a journey down the Eighteen important risk that you face during your retirement and we are a number eight this week\nAnd of course number eight has very timely since it's called market risk [laughter] I didn't plan that ahead but boy is it tightly right I'm I'm kind of going in order\nAnd a number eight is market ... so what that means is\nThat when you are a retired person or you are about to retire um that is one of the biggest risks that you face in terms of your investments is that you get hit by a big downdraft in your investments and now you don't have as much as you at once had so uh\nWe're going to talk about number eight market risk now also\nSince we are a a firm that specializes in retirement planning a one of the big topics that we talk about with clients are pretty much I Would say every time we visited seems like\nUm is Social Security so we're going to have some ... we had to have some questions or that or I Want to share with you and of course the answers to those questions about Social Security that I think might be on your mind so we're going to have the ... does security queuing day now also\nIn view of\nOur philosophy so because we work with people who are mostly retired are retiring soon our philosophy of how to manage your money\nIs preservation of principle comes first okay we want to grow your money certainly we want to give you the income all those things are important but first and foremost we want to make sure that we protect your principal\nBecause for you to be able to go out and enjoy the all the things that you want in your retirement if you get hit by a big bad bear and it takes down twenty thirty or fifty percent of your money you know that's going to change a lot for you so I'm going to ask you the question the average bear market and this is according to net Davis research going back\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the U.S and he went down to fifty seven percent in in Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nAt age sixty or at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or eight Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter]\nSo so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great in the right and that's how most shows are just stopped there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally a that's you know that's the part of the shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to\nPay a gift tax okay because the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gift\nAnd college in most cases is more is is is expensive and you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a a\nWe think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society and a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala that uh in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they fell strategy but we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life\nYou've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it and so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells a philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to yourself signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven or strategies said to sell both of those were very very near to bear markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and take 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out\nAnd uh those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't and the market to rebound quickly after that but in in ah in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it's not like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I was very feeling now I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline\nAnd in the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers that looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we're close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course are so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nOr it's right anyway whatever point being\nLadies and gentlemen is that if you are retired are retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is a market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I changed my mind I think we're going there\nThe vast majority of people did not expect it you know if everybody expected it probably wouldn't happen right\nSo

thank\nYou Jack I've been a certified financial planner professionally for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same idea that we talk about with our love it and most\nValued clients\nEyesight didn't lead do and I you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and us so we we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisor refer money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's a thing we're proud of but without our clients we forms probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go that's will kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net and\nWhen you're there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff well this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that\nSo here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five refrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect Social Security I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escapes twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply is now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months at age eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply as kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but uh I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\n[laughter] that's good\nHere's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss day form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later alright\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question [noise]\nWhatever you have this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that are that requires we want to help you with so uh we had seminars that I'd like for you to go to because at\nThe seminar we talk about do you have enough money to retire on we call that a magic number we want to show you how to calculate that number\nWe we also want to talk about what our five strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four O. one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her or the IRS once attacked eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we don't [noise] I agree [laughter]\nAnd you know we want to show you how to beat that if it is a tall possible we want to talk about diversification or how much risk should you take with your portfolio we have a way of calculating that we call it your hurdle rate\nH U R D D L E and so we're going to talk about that at the seminar we're also going to talk about three basic pitfalls of retirement income planning that we want to help you to avoid so there's
