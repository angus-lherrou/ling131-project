never thought I'd get inspired by the Washington Post but I I've interviewed Dan Balz a number of times over the years of various political conventions and debates and all\nAnd he wrote a piece this week headline battleground house district remained close in New poll\nUm he he says that according to a new Washington post poll of the most contested districts in the country\nThe Democrats now hold a statistically insignificant lead\nOver Republicans again it's not supposed to happen that way this is this supposed to be occurring nude are or do we dare dream that the narrative that the Democrats are going to take the house but Republicans are going to control continue to control the Senate\nIs not going to happen and the Republicans have a chance of holding both chambers\nYeah I Know I think for anybody who tells you to know what's going to happen or just remember that two weeks out of everybody all she knew that Donald Trump will lose on election day uh five thirty eight the the New York\nTimes found the polling operation said there was a Seventy one percent likely that Italy would win 'em\nBut you know virtually no one you know I Will say it's been some crime that I said for a long time they thought he could win then but but I think this far out\nA dynamic developing we'll see how the dynamic continues but but for the last few each part of a sudden I've written about this in my newsletters again which productions um the uh\nThe Kavanaugh effect did three different things one\nIt galvanized the concert and she got really angry at the sort of sleepwalking and happy and lots of good things but now they're angry and that's a huge increase in energy on the right which I she personally\nBut I'm sure you see that the rallies you're going to do an amazing look much more energy than I can remember it anytime a in many many years a second\nI'm the mass came off a I take it but the nastiness ... the Spartacus moment but Booker uh the the the shouting over the chairman but by the Democratic senator from California Kamala Harris down the list Harris I mean\nPeople will be under you know the degree to which they are willing to exploit Dr Ford manipulate her keep her letter hidden in the spring of that the last minute maximize public relations um people get a sense that you know these people are really bad\nAnd I think that the Damascus continue to come off as they see more and more bad statements and more and more bad comments on the third thing that happened was all of a sudden particularly the center of racist\nPeople realized oh yeah this is a team sport and so somebody like bite us it would have been desperately trying to convince people in Tennessee that he was a moderate they looked up and they say wait a second you're going to vote for Schumer\nWell you want a moderate if you're going to look for sure what the latest polls that just came out this week show high camp for example down sixteen points\nNow nobody and she's a very very competent a political figures she was very good campaigner has a very long track record in North Dakota nobody would have guessed that she'd be down sixteen points\nAnd everywhere you turn now racist that the Democrats thought they were going to win a very very tight um you know early voting we're seeing the Republicans are doing very well know again I don't I don't want to draw any conclusions we still have almost two weeks\nAnd two weeks out I think Donald Trump would have lost\nBut he was gaining votes every single day right and we keep gaining boats every single day and frankly I'm the caravan is is a is a huge burden for the Democrats\nThat they just can't I think the answer to that and I think among suburban a woman who have been one of the real weaknesses for Trump because they think about him is Thirteen gangs and they think about cartels and they think about a lawlessness\nAnd seven thousand people determined to break the law I think they leave the Democrats and come back to the Republicans are in a much greater number then people would have guessed a month ago I was\nIs it just me or does it feel you you're talking about prominent Democrats and the missteps of the last month or so I mean and you could go to Elizabeth Warren and her bizarre\nA decision to release this DNA test and create a whole wave of of ridicule and scorn\nOr the mob violence we're seeing we're seeing a Heidi Heitkamp I mean for crying out loud she she tells the world she was ready to vote yes on Kavanaugh until she watched his testimony with the sound turned off\nAnd she didn't like his facial expressions doesn't it feel like the Democrats are a bit like the gang that couldn't shoot straight\nAnd I think they have a huge problem I think their their base so far less now and the energy of their base and hatred that there'll be says for Trump is so intense yeah but they're surrounded all day by people who are giving them signals uh that don't work in the normal world\nRight and so I mean you know comments like em I'm sure that that when the former attorney general said when the Republicans are down a little probably gonna go low we kick kick him I'm sure in that immediate crowd they liked it\nBut for the rest of the country it it was a little sobering to have somebody who's been chief law enforcement officer United States\nSuggesting that Republicans ought to get checked threat and it comes to comes in the middle of the whole way of these kind of fades right wrong and the other the other part of it is frankly a generation of left wing activist to get goofy things and said do the things who are now running for office\nAnd we live in an age where YouTube and others allow us to track you know things like that so it's not just what they were having a thirty six years ago right one and a lot of these candidates the last year the year before Rand it ain't\nPretty yeah anything really hurting the Democrats\nWe're going to see if it's going to be pretty the

villages started\nShowing owned by the most famous man on the planet\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly now\nThe relief factor dot com studio Mike yeah like\n[noise] we are\nIn the middle of an incredible time [noise] the president tweeted today\nAre very big part of the anger we see today as our society is caused by the purposely falls in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast well the mainstream media\nDoubles down and says this is all his fault these pipe bombs at least suspicious packages that have been sent to prominent Democrat critics of President Trump um we've had a voice of reason in this country lately\nUh last night you know in a group of about a thousand people in Irving, Texas\nOutside Dallas we had a an event on stage where Sean Spicer my colleagues Larry Elder Dennis Prager Mark Davis\nI were talking about\nAll of these important volatile issues and I mentioned the name Senator Lindsey Graham and a roar went up the lecture which I haven't heard in a long time I know he's feeling the love about everywhere he\nGoes because many of us believe that we're not for Lindsey Graham's passion and his heart felt anguish over the way the process of judge\nKavanaugh played out he wouldn't be justice justice Kavanaugh today what a what a joy is to bring back to the Mike Gallagher show Senator Lindsey Graham from the Palmetto State of South Carolina Senator Graham what a time to be alive ha\nAnd Mike I'm trying to make the guy that won the lottery I don't know who he is but I'm trying to find it\nBut he's in your state right I mean listen can I all I Need ten million if you if you meet him and you get five I'll take I could do five or seven and you know we'll be All right [laughter] you know if his\nTrial yet man and I get more and so that's\nA good no kidding I write he'd get fringe groups he get three groups and you get one of ice cream Senator Graham audition to slash last night I mean here we are in\nDallas texas and here's hundreds and hundreds of people roaring their approval for just for your name were so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham thirty five thousand feet view\nOf of what the of the time we're living in this investigation is intensifying these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump what is ... what a Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box to support your team or support trick causes appropriately I don't blame President Trump for this any more than I blame Bernie for the guy who shot states go is and tried to kill a bunch of congressman Rosa Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that\nOr this person is obviously sending bombs to critics at the press that that's not the way we do business in America hope they get caught I Hope they go to jail and I hope and about Thirteen Days republic when at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy parents on we cared flailing around and and point fingers of blame the wrong time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\nNo question about it I'm so Kevin I think what people were trying to say to you and to myself when I made them is it thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking in a in a fashion that if I were there I Would have said the same thing\nLess than what they were kind of data Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years as destroy his life to keep the seat open\nTo make sure that Democrat could say within twenty twenty they actually said that they play dirty and they lost I'm Glad I called them out I had all I could take a thirty percent of mind Kagan\nNow because Hubbard chose them because I thought they were qualified Thurmond voted against birds are ... to people from South Carolina the game's played differently now\nAnd what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh hope it I Hope there's a backlash at the ballot box and I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little person would you ... for a long time and I respect you at all on you know that all the years that that I've been on the radio I ever said Senator Lindsey Graham is good and decent man I met you in Washington DC early in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with me you said\nMike I came to Washington not to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line there's a belief and I and I hope it doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected admire you and I knew for a long time there's a bully that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were sort of restrained a little bit and with his passion is like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years is there any merit to that Senator Graham\nNow people are thinking way too hard ah here's the deal or\nIf you know anything about may have tried to be a supporter of an independent judiciary are aren't judiciary needs to be independent of politics John McCain was not dares friend he voted against soda Myron cake cameras heart asked when it came to judges [laughter] so the bottom line is I could have never done\nTo set of mind Kagan what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh they were misrepresenting his life they trade Dr Ford and there's no doubt in my mind something happened to that report but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it or they tried to ruin his family\nAnd they said if you're really innocent or not you asked for this charade continue and that's what I lost it is when Durbin asked Kevin out attorney Don McGahn to White House counsel if he really had nothing to hide wanted to ask for this to continue they present him guilty not innocent\nEverything that I Believe in as a lawyer I'm was was basically trampled on and I pushed back and it still more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your push back many believe I mean as it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\nWell here's what I Would say number one I Want to congratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's the great legal mind that this generation his resume of being a judge was unquestioned his integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened\nIs that I gave voice\nThose on our side who said\nEnough already rancid always are judges my clients that always Clarence Thomas and board and Alito and now cabinet why is it all of our people right and they wanna\nThey wanna went too badly over there pretty if the Republican a dentist a male democratic nominee will be crucified oh we'd be ... for these people\nCan you imagine if it's a democratic male nominee a lady from South Carolina dumps demand gives me a letter and I sit on it never shared it with the committee what they do to me a car recommended a conservative lawyer never told the lady from South Carolina oh by the way the Democrats will come here and meet you there be a\nRiot in the street a crowd of press so\nSo I just got mad I was pissed\nYeah I Know you were and more I make about it that get test to get so hopefully with [laughter] well\nWe hope he is he is justice Kevin I mean that battle was ... and and he's on the Supreme Court and maybe there'll be another conservative on the Supreme Court ah in in over the next few years Senator Lindsey Graham is with us let me ask you about the big burning issue that I think\nHe's the October surprise we've got thousands and thousands\nOf people in what's being described as a migrant caravan um a lot of people who are concerned as much as ... as the country is enamored in love with you right now there are a lot of us should have pushed back a little bit on on the issue of illegal immigration and and you have been at the you've been an interesting\nEvent it interesting voice in all of this where do you stand right now with these thousands of people who are marching towards the southern border uh and and and frankly I think\nFrom a political optics point of view something that is encouraging Republicans and independents and people to go to the go to the polls and say we can't have open borders we gotta have sovereignty we got an average secure border what's your take on the the migrant caravans Senator Lindsey Graham\nOr between Kevin on the care of and if it does it make you want to vote is Republican nothing ever will give you an independent voter our hope you will come on our side\nI'm going to be practical when it comes to solving the immigration problem within our country if you've been here for decades and you've got American citizen children\n\nSeven minutes past the hour it's great having you here on the Mike Gallagher show too busy day we're in Dallas today will be in
