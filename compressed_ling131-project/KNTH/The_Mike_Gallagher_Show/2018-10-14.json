HVAC problems either heating or cooling and and yet it does it get sex and its maintenance costs maintenance costs or maintenance call you're having to interrupt your life to deal with that\nThen you can get so upset they leave and you've got to release the property so\nOne of the things that we do as a mentor is is help the whole people on track\nYou started the show by talking about sitting down with real estate disasters and helping them create a map\nThat gets them from where they are right now 'cause I Can't start anywhere else right with us from where we are to where they want to go and then holding them on to that path just like a GPS right just turn right turn left right go straight merge onto the highway and get to your destination which is\nCreating wealth and passive income\nAnd what you're talking about is the difference between active income were real estate investors are running around or go into houses they're working on them themselves they're constantly taking calls are constantly looking for tenants are constantly having issues and the real estate investors like us who you know sitting on a boat with nine of your closest friends [laughter]\nIt in Greece and ... you know we may take a couple of calls a year usually over simple things that we can tell them how to fix on the phone and it it's\nIt's the difference between owning a model and making sure that all the numbers are there upfront so you can see it and if the deal doesn't works around what are they need to do\nWell but he like he's like I say in touch with us each step of the way and then\nBefore they make a decision that's going to be costly we can just during the west\nAnd medicine if they get all the numbers\nAll of them yeah and we do all those numbers and they don't work you have to have the discipline to not\nBuy but without us\nWork in the members that are correctly ... yesterday one of the member that hosts the road trip she joined in November last year she's on her for a house\nAnd she has plans to retire next year should give rise to replace for income or be able to be in the position to retire probably just about two years on the phone and that\nSo that if you come to us instead of going to the home and garden show you're going to get a much better price and you won't have to walk around and have sore feet\nAnd pay for that expensive food [laughter] why does food costs twice as much at home and garden shows\nAnd potentially you might have to pay for parking so we're gonna talk about\nInsulation today we're going to talk about a special special offer the lists reserved for later\nWe're going to talk about why should insulate now what the insulation is going to do for your home long term effects on your wallet as well as your home your great investment and how can you translate into higher home sales are better prices are less customer actually got\nTwenty thousand dollars more than they were asking on their home and we hit insulated their home less than a year ago\nSo not that the insulation alone was causing factor but it sure didn't hurt ... think about that and then we'll just talk about solar addict fans why this is a good time of year to do it we most think ... ... fans is there to remove heat from the attic and it certainly does a good job of debt\nHowever we're going to talk about how they're also removes moisture odors sometimes you have some funky odors and your attic whether you had a critter that died up there or you had a we went to a house that actually had um a fire and unfortunately\nAnd they had mitigation and they had all of the cleanup there's\nNatural with any kind of incident like this St got everyone in the home was okay but there was still and they're still was at a lingering smoke smell so wouldn't that be a great great cause suicidal addict fan\nSo we're gonna talk about all of these things and of course we're going to talk about battles and why we give them to you for free why do we flew to stop it so we can get air coming into the house and much more so we're going to talk during the show about all of those things\nGive you a great offered that you can not turn away from [noise]\nAnd then help you get scheduled for your free attic inspection and ultimately get your schedule so we can make your house great again this is the energy our my name is Dave brown and we're talking about energy efficiency in your home why does it matter at all [noise]\nWhere do you lose most of the energy in your house is it the walls is if the attic is it the ... we're going to talk about that I'll tell you I'll give you some facts we always talk from a factual based a knowledge database here I guess you when you do it so long you become\nA bit of a nerd which I have over this information\nBut ultimately when you're warming you're home during the winter insulation is the thing that's going to take care of keeping your heat in your house now when you went back to happen\nOr would you want to just do your heart of money out into the street so insulation is always going to be your first line of defense in terms of keeping your house to heat in the house [noise]\nAnd then when you want to keep that heat out of the house insulation again is the same exact answer\nI always try and toxic always at every show about what our value is now I don't mean oh you are not our values it's are like the letter our values\nAnd then you hear are value thrown around when when you're talking about insulation any type of insulation our value is always going to be discussed whether it be\nA blown in insulation batting insulation whether it'd be spray foam insulation each material has it's different set of our values so let me tell you what's the harm means our means resistance resistance to what days\nResistance to the transfer heat so what that means is if you have a higher our values you resist the entry of heat in the house during the summer months and you resist the accent of your heat or the leaving a heat from your house during the winter so our values key\nIn every area has its own code that says this is what we deem as the right amount of our value to have\nSo they get a house can be energy efficient\nSo if you're feeling that maybe your attic is not up to snuff this is a program for you to listen to keep listening it's gonna be great show and we're going to give you some special just for being the listener that only listening as of this show can take advantage of\nAnd we've also going to give us a very special offer if you plan on going any home and garden shows so stay tuned ah my name is David Brown dust is the energy our and I'm the owner of advice you can visit us at attic buddies dot com\nThat's addict buddies dot com where your friends in insulation business a whole motivation is to help you received the most you can for year dollars of course while giving you the maximum protection\nFrom the transfer of heat in and out of your house if we do that then we we really done a good job I always like to say that we don't want to do every single house we just want to insulate your house\nSo stay tuned we're going to take a quick break this is the energy our my name's Dave brown and you're listening to the energy our with adding buddies dot com\nYou are listening to the energy out with his aides rouse checkout they've rounded buddies that I'm for low rates on installations lady embarrassed so addicts as\nCIA\n... what would you do if you're a he was running all day long why that's easy I call adding buddies addict buddy George loves\nThem welcome back this is a round and this is the energy our what we talk about ... fans out against ... how we can save you money on your energy bills week after week after we\nSee [noise]\nWelcome welcome welcome energy what a word now energy it kind of ...\nIt really involves everything that we do on a daily basis\nNow heat energy is really the robber of our physical bodies right if we get to how we get tired and I know I I get tired when I'm sitting on the heat and when we're in our homes were we supposed to be really the most comfortable it's pretty annoying when our house won't cool down\nAnd it's certainly and knowing the other way around them we can't heat our house sufficiently enough [noise] now\nThis time of year what kind of in that zone where it begins to get cool and you may not need your air conditioning as much and you're not quite running the heat and would you be surprised to know that this is the best time to insulate your home [noise]\nWell we you could think number one the prices of insulation are actually more affordable during this time so this should be the ... term for insulation or for doing insulation job on your home this should be the time that you take advantage of the prices number one\nOf the fact that it's actually cooler so you can get more work done in the heck if you want to be kind to the people who are doing the work right but you also gearing your house up and getting it ready for the next heavy season\nSo if you do it in the middle of the season you really won't feel the full benefit truly important that you insulate during this time because you're preparing your home for when it's going to need and use more energy which brings us right back to the song that we heard coming into after the break which is\nEnergy [noise] now [noise] insulation\nThe properties of it is that it has our value each substance has all that you know the blown in insulation which is what we use primarily an addict\nHas our value of about a three per inch so you'll see that code is about Thirteen fourteen inches you multiply that Thirteen terms three that's going to give you a value of our\nThirty nine that's like putting on one of the most comfortable downer feathered blankets on a winter's day\nOh gosh I feel so comfortable or vice versa it's like putting a shade trees over you on a hot day it doesn't allow the sun to penetrate so when you slow down the penetration of the sun into your attic\nInto your house you're cool down your house now what happens\nWith your energy usage and this is where we want to talk about the benefits of how\nYour energy bills go down because it's not signing your AC unit or your age fax system is not fighting against this heat it's really a thermostat that is doing all of the [noise] the brain work\nTelling a ... it's getting hot we need to kick in because whoever set the temperature they said for Seventy two and it's starting to feel like Seventy five so they staged back go to work\nSo now if you have more insulation you can give Mr age back arrest and we're in we're all kind of\nSeen [noise]\nMoist damp addict can be a breeding ground for dust mites and mould\nDust mites feed off a mold and dead human skin and they are just horrible creatures to having your attic if you were to install too so addict than based on your square footage of course sometimes only one\nYou would see it drastically reduced chance of getting mold and your addict addict buddies eight three to four or five eight four zero three six for free estimate welcome\nBack this is a round and this is the energy our what we talk about ... ad against ... how we can save money on your energy bills week after week after week [noise]\nThank you please thank you\nThank you [noise] welcome welcome welcome\nBack this is Dave brown I Am the energy our host and he seems like they're applauding all of the special rates that we announced only for the listeners\nSurgery just tuning in we've been talking about a special rate on insulation I'm and we're going to give away some more free stuff but you got to listen to the program to get all of the benefits now the first thing we talked about was\nEnergy efficiency we tried to educate gee I always try to give you a nice framework on what different things to do and why you really need them\nAnd then I go into the details of how it really really works\nAfter that then I give you an opportunity to take advantage of some really great specials that's white chicks kind of an hour to really build up all this information and then allow you to take part of the things that you think will benefit you the most\nSo we talked about bone and insulation special rate of Ninety sent a square foot for 'em by the way we use John Mandel insulation it's hypo allergenic and anti asthmatic it's the best product on the market I've seen other products and it's just not as good as this John man but product so we use that\nBlown in product we also do some really value added things that really help you along the way with the free baffles and we clear yourself had been so that keeps breathing [noise] now once we've done all day and we insulated the attic and we have\nAir rated it and let let the air come in more now what we want to talk about is adding some active air flow at the Airflow what are you talking about Dave\nActive answer is the installation I'm a solar addict fan so why should I Do that Dave well I'll tell ya [noise]\n... just are not enough ... will allow air flow to come out at a very slow rate maybe fifty\nSixty cubic feet per minute\nAnd it just doesn't keep up with the pace of the heat builds up and yet even during the cold months so you want to introduce active air flow now if you have a really steep proof you probably won't need\nAn active and so as much because this deeper the roof or degraded the draw kind of like a woodstove when you have a longer um\nType you get more air coming through that which dove into the fire burn higher right so attic is the same way if you have a steeper roof you have a lot more drawn at coming through that addict so in that case if it's super steep\nYou probably won't need an active air flow but most homes in this region\nHave shallow roof pitches and if they have shallow roof pitches well then there's nowhere for the heat to go and that ridge vent that's pulling air at about fifty cubic feet isn't no match\nFor the Ames credibly powerful dirty wide Remington so addict fan that pulls at Fifteen hundred and fifty cubic be permitted oh my God\n[laughter] that's just so much that\nNight and day so you you've ever sat in front of a fan on a hot day and how good that feels but when you've been hot and you sit down and you get a nice breeze come across\nWell that's exactly what you'd be doing when you add a soul addict fan you're adding active Airflow so can you imagine how you age fax system is gonna really love it now\nYou know imagine what age back at the age back system could talk what would it say\nI have a feeling and have a deep voice and they'd probably be like hey you may believe me up and it had to go all the time I'm ... that's just my rendition of what what what age back good sound like [noise]\nAnd jokes aside anything that sits in hot environment and it breaks down much more quickly\nSo just just imagine if H back was human and how much it would love the idea of you adding one or two so addict fans\nJust to cool down environment it would feel exactly how you feel on a hot day and then you feel that nice cool breeze it would feel relief so many tell you exactly how this works\nThe sole addict fan takes energy from the sun converts it to electricity and turns of fan that sucks the air out of your attic it brings it in do the soft advance I remember when we talked about those free baffles that we were going to put into your attic\nWell that's where they come in handy they come into play I should say they allow that air to continue to flow all the way up to the soul addict fans which is sucking air do at Fifteen hundred and fifty cubic feet per minute and if you have to that's three thousand thirty one hundred cubic feet per minute pulling air through your attic\nCooling the air and take\nExtending even further the life of the age ... cooling down the interior of your attic therefore the heat transfer does not happen as much doing insulation and yeah and a layman of your roof doesn't get baked all day long\n[noise] it is God powered which I Love to using that term\nSo that you don't pay for the electricity every month like a wired band it's also lifetime warranted and it comes with a built in thirty percent federal tax credit so therefore\nThirty percent of the price of the fan is given back to you in the form of cash now that's not a good deal I don't know one\nBut I Want to make it a lot more clear and let's talk about the fan itself it's Eighteen by Eighteen all the way around Eighteen Inches by Eighteen Inches\nAnd it has a fourteen inch diameter hall so you have a four inches a flash and all the way around these are leaked proof they go under a layer a shingles and on top of the other layer so they really act as another layer of shingles to keep the water\nFrom coming into your attic and of course when the attic buddies screw installs them we do use a ... silicon so that we actually have another layer of protection so that you have to worry about that as possibly being a problem\nSo we talked about thirty watch all the fans Fifteen hundred fifty cubic feet committed an error getting sucked into yeah addict cooling down the attic\nI'm at the rate of Fifteen hundred square foot per hour so you're turning over that air right\nWhen you do that you reduce the chances of mold and moisture [noise] it has a beautiful censor that ... into the attic and reads the true temperature not the surface temperature because it's always going to be had at the surface\nBut it's going to be a nice little dangling sensors hanging in your attic so that it reads humidity and temperature so humid if the humidity or rises above Seventy five percent it kicks on the hand if the temperature rises above eighty five degrees which is\nAlmost every day the fan kicks on that's the kind of real\nProtection you went in your book now once you do that here's what we want to have to you just as an added value\nThis solar addict fan installed is to digitally and regularly nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars okay it's not going to be that much\nWe're going to take off I actually two hundred dollars so it's going to cost you seven hundred and Ninety nine dollars installed\nBut don't forget you're going to get to thirty percent federal tax credit so that's going to take on another additional two hundred and some odd dollars that haven't done the math so you're talking about is just a little bit about five hundred dollars per fan\nAnd that's a value that you really can't say no to and if that is not enough we have instituted in New service that we wanted to unveil right now we're\nGoing to blow your roof off of pine needles\nAnd lead\nIf we're already up they're installing solar fans why wouldn't we then turn on our blower\nAnd blow off all of the debris deck and first of all cause leaks in your roof\nDebris on your roof cause so much problems and this is the season where you can have more of it so the value of that is normally typically we charge ten cents per square foot so now you can just call us if you want roof blowing will\nBe happy to do it is ten cents per square foot in many of your roof area is going to be a lot larger than the addict so if you are an attic is Fifteen hundred square feet your roof to be about the thousand square\nFeet\nSo we build an offer free when you get to a more fans installed so how's that I mean that's a real good offer [noise]\nIt is the third punch in the one two three punch you ever watch a good boxer right they they usually do the right across the jab to write cross them up All right\nWe'll call just the opposite and then of course up a cat is not made for you it's meant for the sun right so we're not talking about one two three times we've done a knock out the sun and if we knocked out the sun we are really we're protecting our home thank you know this is like giving your home a big hug\n'em and if you really love yourself you tend to be home if you love the country and your family you tend to love your home it goes hand in hand I'm so these products are expressions of love\nFor your house insulation if you have your house properly insulated if you've got A L E D lights where they need to be you shall we love to your house or you've got your home air tight as much as it can possibly be you're showing love for your home\nYou're showing lots of HPV access to your show in love for yourself you're showing love for your investments\nAnd you know I work pretty hard for the things that I have accumulated over the years um they don't necessarily make my whole life but if I'm going to buy something and let him take care of it right [noise] so we're talking about another way to take care of beer with radiant\nFor you know some companies use the spray on radium barrier\nAddict but he says the green company so we stick with products that won't harm your house there no off gassing or any problems that might occur if you were to breathe in ah the material right so for that we don't abide by the spray on writing Barry we use attack on radio point\nThe radiant for Iran has a Ninety\nSeven percent effective rate versus the eighty five percent rate that you would get from a spray now here's the downfall of the spray the spray on is human dependent so if that person is in the attic and just as feeling lazy that day\nAnd they don't want to fully cover\nThe wall the decorating well\nThere\nYou're not going to have a fully covered addict will you the beauty of the radio for is that you cannot get away with ... or ...\nI'm I'm trying to think of a polite way to say it but doing it half a half behind jobs [laughter] right family show so we'll we'll talk in terms that everybody can listen\nYou can't get away with that with the radio for him so we're talking about a product that is going to be more effective and you can cheat in any single way and then it doesn't give off any gases or anything to super tough durable um radio ads for oil you know it looks like so before but it's not\nCheap like that it's really really durable I mean you can't rip it with your hands [noise]\nIt would take a you know act of Congress to poke a hole in the staying in and of course you'd have to have it has to be something super super sharp we have to use razor blades to to cut sheets and then we install them right on the um [noise]\nThe ceiling Joyce so that the whole entire interior of the addict is covered whereas when you see them spray those Joyce never get sprayed just in between the Joyce so with that being a a an issue\nYou're really not getting your money's worth with the spray on and you're getting a product that can harm you and your pet send your children\nSo that's why we chose the radiant foreign [noise] it's a lot harder on us ducking promise you we can move probably at the rate of about two hundred three hundred square foot per hour so could be a multi day job on\nSome addicts some addicts don't need it to be quite honest I'm not ... it's really\nAn assessment case by case thing right so not every addict needs so we only recommend it to people they need it and he was a little secret uh I'll tell you a secret if you're not going to live in your house forever [noise]\nMaybe you don't want to spend the money on the radio back a lot of people will tell you that if you say you need it they will do it I think that that is a not in your best interest and I think that's not good business so\n\nThat that in mind and with the whole goal of helping you increase the value of your home we have to do and bound to do what it in your best interests so\nIt doesn't mean no one should get it because we just recently did a job in a house that really couldn't get any other protection and this was there forever homes all the conditions were right and then we said hey why don't we radiant berry this particular area it'd be asked\nAnd then an addict we can take care of that with solar addict fans and\nThey did the job but it did the job they immediately the comfort level increased um the room that was hot it was now not hide anymore it was neighboring a side attic and we also put some um\nSome batting up on the wall\nAnd a whole entire house felt immediately better and we love it when we get those reports um so here's what we charge for the radiant barrier for\nAll right it is two dollars and fifty cent a square foot\n[noise] and it is a little bit more expensive than a spray on 'em\nAt the same time the value is much higher with the attack on and if you're going to do something you you probably want to do it right so it's two dollars and fifty cents square foot\nWas attack on us and more Debbie sent so if you add that to a proper insulated attic\nA solar addict fans\nRight and you have your roof thrown off so you have any potential fire or any leaks that can occur from needle pine needles or\nTo breathe so forth you really made your household again and this is a really important thing to do in the off season in the season when it's not burning up\nBecause the prices the labor\nAnd all of the benefits are going to be much more affordable right so let's go back and let's look at everything that we talked about so we started out learning about our values our value is the resistance to the transfer of heat we want to keep it out during the summer we want to keep it in during the winter\nWe talked about how ah we can add our values and what it does to the different devices that you have in your house how it extend the life that I liked the HPV back system how it extends the roof ... I've seen roof that looked like a you know\nLike a a a ripples or Russell's potato chip [noise]\nYou don't want to hammer ruffles potato chip roof\nOkay so we talked about that and then we talked about some of the great special that you get when we come out for free estimate with addict I number one you're going to get a free estimates which is the first whole idea of it all [noise] Ninety send a square foot rate on insulation\nOr you're going to get free baffles free software Cleary\nRight and then if you get\nTo solar fans installed you get in get free roof blowing up needles and pine needles thing everything else that can really damage your house right and then the radio barrier speaks for itself it's two fifty square foot\nWorth every penny\nWorks better than the spray on and it will do your addict some good it creates a barrier where the heat actually never enters into the attic\nA low in Mississippi the rate of this product so that means on one side all the heat would be behind it if you put your hand on the interior side you won't even be leaked that's called very low a Mississippi the rates trying to say that fast it doesn't even Mitch\nAre transmitted date through into the addicts or your cooling dang addict you're extending the life of all of the wonderful things that you say stuff in there\nOkay so we had last thing we talked about is the special home and garden shows\nRate [noise] number one if you come to us without going to their home and garden shows because unless you got other things to to look at I Would say go take a look if you go into a room and going to get in so they should\nDefinitely come to us first you don't have to walk anywhere you can just pick up the phone dollar number and get home and garden shows special bring us any
