and to submit your video seventies yeah sure you got [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe're back at the lifestyles unlimited real estate investor radio show this is Len morale and today we're working on your financial freedom with three helpful tips tenants screening we've talked about your tennis selection criteria and we mentioned your privacy policy as well and then we talked about\nYour application and they need to collect all the information you need make sure it's easy to access for your potential tenants and it's easy to fill out and we went through what you need to collect and how you're going to check on some of that information and so tip three is to always\nDo a nationwide credit and criminal background check\nAnd every one Eighteen years or older living in the home or apartment unit that you're renting and this is a step that\nIs believe it or not often\nHow I Would say overlooked but it's not overlook people intentionally don't do it and I learned to this several years ago when I was renting several properties at one time had a lot of advertisements out and I was emphasizing to potential tenants I Am going to do it credit and criminal background check\nIf you don't need the tent selection criteria don't give me your money because you won't get it back and you won't get to rent the property and if you know your something's going to come up on that talk to me about it now explain it now\nAnd they wouldn't do it they wouldn't do it\nSo they would give me I think it's thirty five dollars a person and maybe there would be you know to adults and and one or two children Eighteen years or older and the property so that's not an insignificant amount of money for a a renter\nAnd they would turn that over and I will come all of this stuff is Asians and criminal convictions have all these things on their their background\nAnd I was just calling back and say you know hey I told you that if you were going to meet my tenants such a criteria to not give me your money\nAnd the answer I got back from them as we didn't think you are going to do it and I found out\nThat I was actually emphasizing it's so much\nThat I was convincing them that I wasn't going to do that and I guess this is a pattern that landlords have and of course they know you're not doing the check because you're not coming back and asking them about these addictions asking them about the addresses that showed up on their credit report that don't show up on their application\nSo that's what you're looking for when you get this information back you're going to get their previous addresses does that match what you have on the application\nOr there's some that are missing typically that's how it works there's a couple that are missing from the application\nAnd those are the ones you want to call first because those are the ones that probably had the addictions or they cause damage on the way out or they had a lot of police action at the property that was a problem so that's the first thing you want to do is reach out to the perspective tenant say hey did you miss some things here\nAnd if so why and then that would be my first call\nThen the uh the other thing that you're looking for the horses that criminal history and we we talked about disparate impact earlier in the show and what you need to do and you're tenants such a criteria which would be very specific\nAbout what you're looking for in criminal history and why\nAnd that way you\nAre out there with it they know exactly what you're looking for and often times people who have had some some momentary issue in their life that maybe it's in the past you know maybe they got arrested they had a criminal conviction for you know possession of marijuana when they were Eighteen years old now fifty eight and they've had nothing said\nOkay they can tell you about that that was a long time ago for me I Would completely ignore that that would be an example of a criminal conviction are completely ignore for two reasons the nature of the conviction itself\nAnd also um just how long ago it was so as a landlord these are the types of things that you're you're looking for don't skip this stuff\nAnd I recommend that you do and nationwide\nCriminal background check\nIt's a little bit more expensive typically for from the screening services but not enough to be cost prohibitive and you were applicant is paying for that background check and I think people are so mobile these days that it that it's really helpful to to do that\nAnd I know that my mentor is always emphasized that that's how I learned it's what I've always done and and I really appreciate my mentors\nPerfect time to insulate your home\n[noise] now if you're interested and you're going to be listening to this program you are special individual because you're going to get a special rate so on top of the lower prices are doing due to the seasonal low prices you're going to get some special\nSo stay tuned in

inch\nNow the code in this area is Thirteen inches so if we added Thirteen inches at three are valuable and you're going to be at our thirty nine\nYou might say well Dave I already have insulation ... will I just need to add a little bit more on top\nDo we ... the old stuff out [noise] yeah most times you're just going to need to add a little bit on top so if you had lived in your house for a while you've never had your house insulated chances are you going to have some shrinkage especially it's if it's the older insulation\nThe product that we use is guaranteed not to shrink more than an inch

measure everything assessed sway your energy loss it and then we're going to recommend probably an eight inch ad\nNow you're going to get that special agent inch rate that we had only for listeners of

always talk about every show means resistance it means resistance to the transfer of heat so now you heat not going to leave your house\nAnd guess what's going to happen during the summer months the heat stuff going to come into your house\nSo added insulation during this time of year is the most important thing you can do\nTo get your home energy efficient more comfortable and haven't saving you money rather than spending your heart and money if you could say fifty dollars a month that it's at the end of the year six hundred dollars that you can use tort many other things\nSo most time you're going to get out of your investment in less than two years I'm Dave brown disadvantage era stay tuned [noise]\nYou are listening to the energy hour with David Brown checkout they've rounded buddies dot com for low rates on insulation slate embarrassed so it had a sad scene\n[noise] hey\nGeorge ... what would you do if you're a he was running all day long why that's easy identical adding buddy addict buddy George loves them [noise]\nWelcome back says this is a round and this is the energy our so we talked about re embarrass solo sans addict insulation how we can save money on your energy bills\nWe ... we have to we see [noise]\nYeah welcome welcome welcome my name is Dave round this is the energy our\nIt's called the energy our because it's an hour of informing people just like you on how you can reduce the energy usage\nIn your house and save money and keep yourself comfortable because ... really has a huge connection to energy [noise] if you are under insulated in your home you're certainly not going to be comfortable right\nSo we're talking about saving you energy\nNot let you lose your energy to the to the wild you don't want to heat up your house and inhabit just pass through your walls and do your attic\nSo quickly you rather stay there longer and now here's what happens when you have a properly insulated home the heat stays in your house longer and also then doesn't have to run the ... the uh the heater has long because hey\nIt's already warm so once your house heats up to a specific temperature that you set by the way\nAnd that he stays in the longer ... what happens to the heater it shuts off it just shuts right off so since that shuts off now what are you doing you're saving money and you feel more comfortable to his ... to a draftee house if you have a draftee how she know what I'm saying [noise]\nYou and a half heat without us so you turn on the heater in aid will\nRun and run and run and run\nBill is going to come back and you know holy cow what is going on with this bill you're going to hold it up like a piece of paper and you're going to say to yourself [noise]\nWhy am I doing right so we definitely want to reduce that with added insulation ad insulation ads are value our value as resistance to transfer beat we're not worried about the cold the cold is going to take care of itself we're concerned with keeping our heat in the house\nSo you do it now during this time of the year and then you can track your progress and see oh wow I save money this month oh look at my bill this month [noise]\nHoly cow I say fifty bucks\nYou do that long enough you out of beer investment most homes especially at our special radio rate of Ninety send a square foot and all of the specials that you get a free baffles um all of the things that help preserve your household right\nWhen you combine all of that now you're really saving money\nAnd and at that low price you can typically get out of that investment within about two years or less depending on how much energy you're wasting if you have no insulation in your ad insulation oh my gosh your bills are really going to reduce so\nLet's talk about our value again our stance for resistance to transfer heat degraded to arm value the better resistance to the heat\nDuring the summer you want to keep the heat out of the house during the winter you want to keep the heat in the house so this is why this is the perfect time to get it down now let's talk about our solar addict fans we have\nThirty watched Remington solar addict fans lifetime warranty by the way free replacement if there's any damage their hair resisted these also come with a thirty percent federal tax credit so anything that has a solar panel attached to it\nIs a available to take advantage of the I. T. C. credit which is an energy credit study percent of the price of the install now today what we're going to do is take off two hundred and fifty dollars for the radio listeners only so you have to call in doing the show if you call it after ... fortunately does especially will go away [noise]\nA moist damp addict can be a breeding ground for dust mites and mould\nDust mites feed off a mold and dead human skin and they're just horrible creatures to having your attic if you were to install\nToo so addict fans based on your square footage of course sometimes only one you would see it drastically reduced chance of getting mode and your attic call addict buddies eight three to four or five eight four zero three six for free estimate welcome\nBack this is a round and this is the energy our so we talked about re embarrass solo fans attic insulation\nHow we can save money on your energy bills we sat there all week after week [noise]\nThank you [noise] thank you very much [noise]\nHow would you ... you can hold it thank you\nThank you thank you very much [noise] welcome\nWelcome welcome this is Dave brown and if you're clapping you probably slapping because you know you're hearing some stuff that is making sense to you and\nYour no dummy you're very intelligent and most people that they have done studies and most people that listen to talk radio tend to be more intelligent people because they love to learn and talk radio is about information\nSo this information is probably the most important information you can apply towards your home to make it energy efficient I mean before you get a new stove or a new\nFlorian you really want to live and how much energy efficient um it it's going to\nReally set the tone and how you feel in your home in how you feel in your home is vital as we all know [noise]\nSo you'd be surprised exactly how much insulation changes the way you feel inside of your home and dealing in your room comfortable is everything right\nSo let's fix that lets six that with some some knowledge some information and some action and so the information is we already got that coverage we know that our value improves the\nUh in Mississippi or the transfer of heat it slows down the transfer of heat so that you keep your eating your house and then it keeps the heat out during the summer\nSo we know that the higher our value which is what insulation provides\nAnd again I'll let you know we use John's man full blown insulation and it is the best on the market the best on the market because we compared it against all the other products and do some of them are actually cheaper for us to buy\nJohn's Mandel cost us a little bit more but without transferring that cost you you were giving you the best product at the lowest price so John's man's bill\nA bone in ... gives you the highest are valuable age\nWhen you add in eight inches on top of your already five inches you can bring your installation up to our thirty nine are thirty nine by the way it's the code in this area so you'll be a new house level efficiency when it comes to the installation\nAnd so now we're talking about more comfort you're talking about being warmer after you get out of the shower because you're he hasn't left the building so fast we're talking about a lower energy bills because you're heaters not running\nIs starting to feel good I could hear the music playing and behind this [laughter] so [noise]\nOnce you do these things you're creating an environment\nIn which he created an environment that environment to sustain\nDo you and makes you more comfortable it makes you happy so that's the magic of insulation right\nAll of the other products that say the solar addict fan the radiant barrier that is the support product that goes into helping the overall health of the home radium barrier rejects uh the radiate heat\nAnd the solar fans sucks out the hot air and it also sucks up the moisture\n[noise] with our solar fan it's made by Remington so it's a brand that you can trust it is higher and or the solar addict fans at dirty watch not ten or twenty ... thirty what that means it has a strong demoted it's going to suck more air at higher rate [noise]\nFifteen hundred cubic feet per minute means that if you have a Fifteen hundred square foot addict every hour you can exchange completely off the air and yet it\nSo what are the chances of you now getting mold or any kind of Moshe build up\nShould go down shouldn't it\nSo that is what you're talking about when we're talking about the addict buddies program the the insulation the radiant buried so lack fan this is what we're talking about [noise]\nAnd there's a way you can easily take advantage of all these things including getting two hundred fifty dollars off the fan to free a estimate the free baffles the free software clearing\nA and that's just not giving us a call ... three to four six four seven one Seventy six we have professional center on staff waiting to take your call they will take a call doing this program only to get the ah the benefit a desk eight three to four six four seven one seven six\nNow want to talk to you a little bit about a product that we have called the buddy box the buddy back to the stair way insulated ... is our brand made by addict buddies it goes in the stairwell and it is your first opened in peels back\nHere's the reason why this is a vital tool for any home number one\nTypically what happens is you lose a lot of energy to the pool down the addict stairwell because there is no insulation over that if there were insulation over that every time you open it would fall on your head wouldn't it [noise] so the stairway insulator insulate the stairway it it does what it said\nWe call it the buddy box because it looks like a rectangle box that the first open and its metallic and reflective so it has our value and it has also radiant reflectivity [noise]\nAnd it has that low in Mississippi so if you stood under the stairwell on a hot day you would not feel the heat\nAlso if you stood under during a cold winters day you feel that you heat is staying in a house so back stairwell is probably a major you're losing probably three to four rooms of energy every single day do that stairwell where the buddy bucks we'll put a stop to that right\nNow we've got to value price for the radio listeners is normally two forty nine installed but which you're insulation install we're going to give it to you for Ninety nine dollars so that is a huge discount\nWe're going to save you quite a lot of money so\nTake advantage of that as you can get the buddy box for Ninety nine dollars than Ninety send a square foot rate of ... insulation or you will get the free baffles which are super important for keeping air flow otherwise if you didn't have battles and you're blue in insulation you could possibly stop the Airflow step up yourself a dense [noise]\nSo you get that and then you get the free software clearing along with that and you're going to have a nice beautiful energy efficient hack my name is Dave brown distant energy how are we talking about insulation I Want to talk about different forms of ... before I give you a chance to give us a call into the show\nI Want to talk about spray foam insulation\nOr we definitely have one of the most professional\nInsulation crews that install spray from we have the best crew a it is a highly skilled install job so you can have different levels of spray from a talent when it comes to installing this so if you don't have a pro crew\nYou could end up having to redo the work later on aids right from insulation it's very expensive and you don't want to play around with the debt to write\nSo which vary from you're going to have two types of a surprise for me to have the dance closed cell installation ah it's crazy and it dries cures I should say 'cause it's not\nThat it dries you but it sure is chemically and it cures dense you get about seven are valued ... and she'd get a really high our value out of that now the\nOpen south breeds and allows air to go through it and you get a lower our value but it still can be used in certain applications such as would in homes you want to use the open sell to let the the wouldn't home breed on a metal on metal building you want to use closed down because a metal building sweat\nSoon to keep down any transfer of moisture in most cases you definitely want to have a seat in the space so that you can demystify their air it keeps some of the humidity down so it doesn't get transferred into the spray from\nSpace on this kind of all the rave everybody's asking about it nowadays are we do the underbelly of buildings we do the walk cavities we do the addicts we do every part of a home or any building with spray phone that can make it energy efficient for you [noise]\nSo we have special rates for that as well are those are not going to be mentioned it during the show because they do change a little bit more frequently than the blown in insulation\nRight we'll call just the opposite and then of course the upper cat is not meant for you it's meant for the sun right so we're not talking about one two three punch we gonna knock out the sun and if we knock out the sun we are really we're protecting our home like you know this is like giving your home a big hug\n'em and if you really love yourself you tend to be home if you love your country and your family you tend to love your home it goes hand in hand I'm so these products are expressions of love\nFor your house insulation if you have your house properly insulated if you've got A L E D lights where they need to be you shall we love to your house or you've got your home air tight as much as it can possibly be you're you're showing love for your home\nYour show love three HPV access to your show in love for yourself you're showing love for your investments\nAnd you know I work pretty hard for the things that I have accumulated over the years um they don't necessarily make my whole life but if I'm going to buy something and let him take care of it right [noise]\nSo we're talking about another way to take care of your attic with radiant for you know some companies use to spray on radium barrier\nAddict but he says the green company so we stick with products that won't harm your health\nThere no off gassing or any problems that might occur if you were to breathe in uh the material right so for that we don't abide by the spray on ready to embarrass we use attack on radio for him the radiant for ... has a Ninety\nSeven percent effective rate versus the eighty five percent rate that you would get from a spray now here's the downfall of the spray the spray on is human dependent so if that person is in your attic and just as feeling lazy that day\nAnd they don't want to fully cover\nThe wall the decorating well then\nYou're not going to have a fully covered addict will you the beauty of the radio for is that you cannot get away with ... or\n... I'm I'm trying to think of a polite way to say but doing it half a half behind job [laughter] right family show so we'll we'll talk in terms that everybody can listen\nYou can't get away with that with the radio for him so we're talking about a product that is going to be more effective and you can't cheat in any single way and then it doesn't give off any gases or anything the super tough durable um radiant for oil you know it looks like so before but it's not\nCheap like that it's really really durable I mean you can't rip it with your hands [noise]\nIt would take a you know act of Congress to poke a hole in the staying in and of course you'd have to have it had to be something super super sharp we have to use razor blades to to cut sheets and then we install them right on the um\n[noise] the ceiling Joyce\nSo that whole entire interior the attic is covered whereas when you see them spray those Joyce never get sprayed just in between\nThe Joyce\nSo with that being a a an issue\nReally not getting your money's worth with this rare and you're getting a product that can harm you and your pet send your children so that's why we chose the radiant for\nIt's a lot harder on us ducking promise you that we can move probably at the rate of about two hundred three hundred square foot per hour so it'd be a multi day job on some addicts\nSome addicts don't need it to be quite honest I'm not ... it's really\nAn assessment case by case thing right so not every addict needs so we only recommend it to people they need it and he was a little secret uh I'll tell you a secret if you're not going to live in your house forever\nMaybe you don't want to spend the money on the radio barrier a lot of people will tell you that\nIf you say you need it they will do it I think that that is a not in your best interest and I think that's not good business\nSo\nThat that in mind and with the whole goal of\nHelping you increase the value of your home we have to do and bound to do what is your best interests so\nIt doesn't mean no one should get it because we are just recently did a job in a house that really couldn't get any other protection and this was there forever homes all the conditions were right and then we said hey why don't we radium berry this particular area it'd be ask\nAnd then to add if we can take care of that with solar addict fans and it did the job\nIt did the job they immediately the comfort level increased um the room that was hot it was now not hide anymore it was neighboring aside addict and we also put some um\nSome batting up on the wall\nAnd the whole entire house felt immediately better and we love it when we get those reports are so here's what we charge for the radiant barrier for\nAll right it is two dollars and fifty cent a square foot [noise] and it is a little bit more expensive than a spray on 'em at the same time\nValue is much higher with the attack on and if you're going to do something you probably want to do it right so it's two dollars and fifty cents a square foot was attack on us and worth every cent she if you add that to a proper insulated attic\nA similar addict fans right\nAnd you have your roof blown off so do you have any potential fire or any leaks that can occur from needle pine needles or\nThe breed so forth you really made your household again and this is really important thing to do in the off season in the season when it's not burning up because the prices the labor and all of their benefits are going to be much more affordable\nRight so let's go back and let's look at everything that we talked about so we started out learning about our values our value is the resistance to the transfer of heat we want to keep it out during the summer we want to keep it in during the winter\nWe talked about how are we can add our values and what it does to the different devices that you have in your house how it extend the life of life at the age back system how it extends the roof ... under ... I've seen roofs that looked like a you know\nLike a a a ripples or ruffles potato chip\nYou don't want to have a ruffles potato chip roof\nOkay so we talked about that now we talked about some of the great special that you get when we come out for free estimate with addict but he's number one you're going to get a free estimates which is the first whole idea of it all [noise] Ninety send a square foot rate on insulation\nAh you're going to get free baffles free software Cleary\nRight and then if you get to solar fans installed you gonna get free roof blowing of needles and pine needles and everything else that can really damage your house right and then the radio barrier speaks for itself is two fifty square foot worth every penny\nWorks better than the spray on\nAnd it will do your addict some good it creates a barrier where the heat actually never enters into the ... is a low in Mississippi the rate of this product so that means on one side all the heat would be behind it if you put\nOn the interior side you won't even be leaked that's called very low a Mississippi rates trying to say that fast it doesn't even Mitch\nOr transmit date through into the addicts or your cooling dang addict you're extending the life of all of the wonderful things that you say step in there okay so we're the last thing we talked about is the special home and garden show rate\nNumber one if you come to us without going to their home and garden shows because unless you've got other things to to look at I Would say go take a look but if you're going to home and garden so to get insulation definitely\nThey come to us first you don't have to walk anywhere you can just pick up the phone number and get the home and garden shows special bring us any literature if you do go and
