P. that they would\nHold they probably will they'll drag it out as far as I can yeah they are they will so that if I understood that correctly Murkowski voted no but the other three of the for\nSusan Collins Joe mansion\nAnd a Jeff Flake all voted yes yes I was reading this morning about the kind of pressure of it's being applied to Susan Collins of Maine they're just beating that woman up oh yeah yeah they are yeah so far is that you're willing to forty two you can see why she's riding the fence on this\nOh yeah there's a lot at stake for her on this\nMystery\nIt's about fifty one forty three but like you said it's already that that pretty much it takes care of the debate will be limited to thirty hours and hopefully budget on the on the moral where you can get a confirmation oh\nThis is a Van Hollen\nNo little heat up even more well we are going to give up the reminder del Valle rich or they'll try to\nSolly everything he does everything he thinks everything you show oh yeah\nYeah because I hate truck yeah Hirono states wall here though you know what's going to be a no from the senator from Hawaii or they hate anything Stewart Trump anything to do with Donald\nTrump and then there's guys for Kavanaugh has a judicial philosophy but strangely enough actually follows the written words of the constitution\nBlumenthal rather than the no\nDominant democratic view of how the constitution should be read as a living document that changes with the times yeah that's what they've always said about it I've\nNever been one to go for a living document things that you know is whether you're a strict constitutional as they're not and right of of people like Kevin on Ted Cruz and trade ... these people are strict cause ... bought love to see tray out to get in there that would have been great\n\nIn the next one would be Ruth gate or a beta Riggins would you say Ruth gator just gator she's a\nGuide her [laughter] gator sketchy granny Joe Joe with Tony Joe white action therefore you this morning so far fetched you want to forty seven but it it will be limited to thirty our debate but I'm sure they'll take a break\nAnd then they'll go back to it again sometime today you know that's how they do these things\nThey take their time on it they're reading over budget stuff or I've got to love it J. P. Mrs sheen no no\nThis should be the last one because now fifty one forty eight\nI'm watching it on C SPAN and were picking up the live feed from there this morning from CSPAN or television or radio Ashley CSPAN too\n\nThat should wrap it up you know one more I don't know why this part takes so long you know you got one shifts died you know pretty much\nEnded up beat will go on and the beating will go on there will continue to hammer hammer hammer\nJust doesn't work well try this that doesn't work we'll try this we're going to do anything they can to put up against\nAnybody that has anything to do with Donald Trump doesn't matter what they say you remember when Maxine Waters made the statement a couple of months back well after getting through in Donald Trump won't go after my pets\nHow can you find anything on my parents you talk about squeaky coil it again it's\nThe philosophy that right there after the guy is for a wife\nAnd you know where they stand on that I absolutely\nHarbor\n\nWas beside him one center is not recorded I don't know right now Harper now\n\nSo the three yes as flake mansion and Collins or this morning to vote\nFor the closure more than likely then they will vote ... although Murkowski\nRepublican from a Arkansas voted no no Murkowski is Alaska\nAlaska I'm Sorry Alaska that's right that's what the a K means my mind automatically goes to Arkansas that would have been a A R there any senators and the chamber who wish to change their vote [laughter] Fat Chance\nA reminder to our gas and the galleries expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate gallery in other words\nGotta do say anything don't share don't boot\nI'm surprised I didn't hear something from some of them under the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFive what are they going to do next year Jay paying well at some point I I don't know exactly what's going to happen moment by moment but they're going to get into a debate that's supposed to last no longer than thirty hours so if you take that to twenty four hours will be a basically ten o'clock tomorrow morning and another six after that\nTakes you to four o'clock in the afternoon so theoretically depending upon how much of a break take I don't know how that works and it has its own way of doing things\nRight and depending on when it starts we don't know when it's going to start a good start right\nOr what I was just trying to figure thirty hours from right now and whatever that means is if it's not stopped to think that would go nonstop I don't know truck sometimes they do just because they only have this amount of time and these guys want to get on the record for their\nThe people who are\nFor them like their base\nRight now there's a lot of walking around and talk to most of\nShoe or walk ...\nI didn't hear anybody say I'm for clumps talk amongst yourselves [laughter] I [laughter]\nWell they're doing it and they're talking about themselves and now we'll see what happens ... going to go through the way we want to judge Kavanaugh will become a member of the Supreme Court but like you say does it matter anything he rules on any time\nThey're going to change they went after this man tooth and nail yup and it hasn't had all fun and there are times I mean look even Brock Obama\nIs the number off you know where you live you know everyone has the girls and I was wondering you're\nYeah I I think I was a thug [noise] for a for a big part of my growing up I played a lot of basketball\nUh I uh didn't take school that seriously\nI a gun to fights I drank that are consumed a substances or weren't always legal\nBut of course he went on to say as you heard that a marked I said earlier there's an extended clip of that target about smoking a lottery for her and it is time and\nVarious drugs so you know\nHe's done these things but he's a Democrat and held to a different era or it's OK yeah for them it's OK\nYou can do it I we can do it but you can't do it and we always said\nYou know you Republicans take these moral stands on things and then when you get caught at it you don't like it when we pointed out I mean they they try to accuse Republicans of being hypocrites but\n[laughter] you know there there's no way them doesn't that moral compass there is no true north rubella crafts they just do whatever way they turn the cup us around so they can make a point where ever they want to at the moment\nOkay so the Senate has voted fifty one forty nine to limit the debate on the Supreme Court nominee leaving during thirty hours of debate between now and tomorrow and that's when the final vote as possible ... and that was that's what'll happen as well that should happen we'll just have to wait and see\nBreaking news breakneck pace this is Mike Gallagher show we got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... we're not going to make America great again there was\nGreat my got like ... voice of clarity for millions of America [laughter]\nShown owned by the most famous man on a plane\nEven grade Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studios mice yeah like [noise]\n\nI Am by nature are pretty optimistic person I Am cautiously optimistic\nRight now [noise] however I Want to warn you that\nDon't believe anybody who says they know how this drama this nightmare frankly over the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is going to end we don't know what we do know is that\nBrett Kavanaugh survived a crucial vote moments you go in the Senate and senators Jeff Flake Susan Collins\nAnd Joe Manchin from West Virginia Democrat cross the aisle and voted with his Republican colleagues as yes votes\nPerhaps the big shocker was the Republican from Alaska Lisa Murkowski who voted no in the cloture vote to advance the Kavanaugh's nomination the cloture vote past fifty one to forty nine\nNow the clocks sharks towards this weekend's confirmation if mansion flake and Collins strict with their yes votes and that's not a foregone conclusion\nIt's probable but it is not sure if they do that's the final vote on the confirmation and Brett Kavanaugh will start hearing cases from the bench of the United States Supreme court next week\nUm however both Joe mansion and Susan Collins have suggested that their first vote might not reflect their final vote\nSusan Collins it's being reported is going to confirm how she's voting tomorrow this afternoon at three PM eastern time\nSo as of\nNow there's also lots of speculation about Lisa Murkowski possibly voting yes in the end but it doesn't seem like it does not seem particularly likely that she will change your vote from today\nTill tomorrow wow what a day the president has tweeted moments ago he set out a tweet that says and I quote very proud of the U.S Senate for voting yes to advance the nomination of judge\nBrett Kavanaugh dishes up this is a battle royale um it's a bloodbath in the middle of all this drama\nComes some very fascinating statistics some data if your data driven you're going to you're going to like to hear some of this news first of all the daily presidential tracking poll\nHis kicked up from Rasmussen you just picked up again for the president right now the Rasmussen Reports daily presidential tracking poll for friday today shows that fifty one percent of likely us voters approve\nOf President Trump's job performance forty eight percent\nDisapprove last check this for me but I think this is the highest it's been Rasmussen says the president took office um it's you know you can say that the majority now for the first time perhaps of likely us voters approve of the job the President Trump is doing\nWhat's remarkable ... what's remarkable about that is to consider how much has been thrown at him for two years\nThe entire enormous machine the Republicans in the swamp the media the Democrats activists Hollywood\nNew York I mean they have tried desperately to slow this guy down and to stop him but you know what's not you know you you know what's hard for them to swallow\nIt's not work and there's incredible economic news that was ... revealed today this is extraordinary news and and and all kinds of good news optimism among us manufacturers continues to shore\nAccording to the national association of manufacturers nearly Ninety three percent of manufacturers are projecting further expansion for their businesses\nPositive sentiment among small companies is up to Ninety One point three percent unemployment is at the lowest was announced this morning the unemployment rate is down to three point seven percent\nYou know the last time America's unemployment rate was three point seven percent Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd of course you hear this stuff and you say ... wonder but the president's approval ratings continue to grow up he's doing what he said he was going to do\nAnd even the never Trump or his you're paying attention Brad Stevens from the New York times he is a fierce never Trump\nHe's the kind of conservative the New York times approves of he wrote a piece yesterday that frankly is is is sure to get him fired\nI I mean I'm I'm not saying that to be gloom and doom for him I I don't want to hear anybody getting fired but nonetheless rich Stevens who has written column after column efficient rating President Trump\nWrites yesterday for once I'm grateful for him he says for the first time since Trump entered the political fray I find myself grateful but he's in it I'm reluctant to admitted he wrote I'm astonished to say it\nI'm grateful because Trump hasn't backed down in the face of the slippery miss hypocrisy and dangerous standard shedding\nDeployed by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court I'm grateful he writes because ferocious and even crash opposite history\nHas it uses in life and never more so than in the face of sly moral bullied I'm grateful because he's a big fat\nHammer fending off a razor sharp\nDagger wow\nThat's big news that's big\nNews ... last night
