and there were two weeks away from the mid term election something we've all been focused on it seems day in and day out because it's so important\nThat show crucial do we get this right our country is headed in such a good direction and I see some stories that have come out or even from places like the Washington Post which is hardly a pro Trump publication Dan Balz who is the political reporter for the Washington Post it as often described\nAs the kind of the dean of political reporters\nHe writes a in kind of a a shocker that the battleground house district races are neck and neck and in fact he says that as a result of a new Washington post poll Democrats hold a statistically insignificant lead over Republicans\nThis this was supposed to happen Republican shouldn't be close\nBut there have been so many things that have happened over and over again where the Democrats resemble the gang that can't shoot straight member of the gang couldn't should strike\nThe latest survey shows about fifty percent currently supporting the Democratic candidate and various district forty seven percent back in the Republican Republicans have made incredible games over the last few weeks it probably started with the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing\nAnd ... debacle that that that absolute spectacle and um it looks right now like this show neck and neck and for the Washington Post to admit that this was a toss up in the house\nIt completely blows apart the narrative that we've heard over and over again\nAbout how the Democrats are going to take control of the house and maybe even the Senate doesn't look like that is going to happen now we've got to stay engaged we've got to stay involved we've got to stay motivated you got two weeks to go two weeks\nAnd things keep happening that just you know there are lots of October surprises I'd I'd argue that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing turned into an October surprise the what the Democrats\nTried to do and the way they handled it the way Dianne Feinstein shed on that information from Brett Kavanaugh's accuser for six weeks\nThe way the Democrats leaked her identity the way that whole thing was handled\nAnd yet still watching Brett Kavanaugh get confirmed and now ships on the Supreme Court hearing and ruling on cases that affect you and me our kids our grandkids\nWow\nI mean it just it had a a a kind of a Hollywood Ending the few people shock comedy\nAnd now we've got\nFourteen thousand migrants marching towards the southern border and I have no idea of the Democrats are involved in this\nI have no idea if there's any George Soros money in there I Wonder how these folks are getting making so much coverage so much territory without food or water I guess they're just strong people I don't know\n[laughter] they're motivated to get into the United states illegally I played for you yesterday the video of these thousands of migrants breaking down fences in Mexico to get into to get across the border and it's uh it's pretty frightening thing to watch\nBut the media is all in the media are media the American media is placing the interests of these illegals\nAhead of the United states citizenry it's a fact want you to she report if you buy a computer you might want to watch this reporter's name is bill we're from CNN\nAnd I I Want you to just listen to this report\nAnd the way the American media is responding there not reporting on the legitimate concerns that millions and millions of Americans have\nAbout a caravan of thousands of thousands of people many of them able bodied young men I mean I don't know about you you could take this the wrong way\nAnd\nUh I I don't want to ... I don't want to not have a hard I don't want to turn my back on somebody trying to flee an oppressive nation\nBut every video clip I see a reporter standing by the side of the road with all the migrants marching behind them I see a whole bunch of able bodied young men I feel awful lot of it I don't see a whole lot of little old ladies and women and children I see lots of young men\nAnd ... you know I'm not alone in that observation\nBut I Want you to hear this report bill we're CNN and gravy check this out\nOn the other day on the caravan road [noise]\nAnother twenty five mile\nUnder a merciless Mexican saw\nAnother meal out of the back of a Heinz strangers\nAnd for the lucky ones on other ride in a kind of strangers [noise]\nTires [noise]\nOn Monday another man fell to his death on a ride life is the second confirmed fatality but his pregnant women begin to will in the heat\nMany worry they won't be the last\nAnd yet as thousands of families try to keep the face all\nA full blown humanitarian crisis moves north\nThere came another round of insults and threats\nFrom the president of the United states\nThinks that you were an invading\nBand of criminals possibly terrorists and is threatening to use soldiers do to keep our separate families what would you say to him\nNow some of that we are an honorable people where workers what do you call a group of kids terrorists who are women who need hell we're asking for his support but of course we know he has no conscience he's crazy\n\nThis is CNN isn't that something bill we're I think the poor guy sounds like he's about to break out into tears any moment and I'm not\nAgain trying to to to have a lack of compassion for people who are trying to achieve a better life\nYou're gathering in I'm In a in a a throng of fourteen thousand people knocking down fences and marching towards our southern border with the intent of entering the United states illegally\nIs the answer is that really the solution wow\nWe're what we're witnessing an October surprise and politically guess what\nRepublicans are going to benefit Republicans going to bed of a big time I Love the quote from the guy that says Trump is crazy really Trump is crazy but he's not trying to walk you know hundreds of miles in the hot Mexican son to\nEnter the border illegally now Jennifer has been very concerned about all of this and and\nWe want we invite a gender back on the show where you've been very patient and I appreciate your joining us You're on the Mike Gallagher show tell me your take on the the story of these fourteen thousand illegal migrants you want to enter the country illegally\n[noise] well I thank you for having me first of all I don't really know who you are\nI I usually listen to Christian radio and I have not had the passenger in my car that changed it and I'm sure there you are in the morning when I got in and kind of piqued my interest\nGot it well I'm Glad I'm Glad you have such a high quality of passengers that means that gives me hope that gives a lot of inspiration you've got a good quality of passengers their Jennifer [laughter] I think I\nItalian damage range Republican and after that Kavanaugh saying and I'm so\nI'm so worried about a heart of the republic and and and and I think\nYou know the first that says they will now we are Christian fire lab and and I don't eat a lot of things right I see ... and I know you think it's in ... and in a good thing for winning elections ...
