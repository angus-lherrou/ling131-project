coms studio Mike yeah like\n[noise] by the media is\nBest efforts there has been a lot of victory for the Republicans over the last couple of weeks it's sort of started was the confirmation\nOf Brett Kavanaugh despite every effort to stop him to for him to derail his confirmation it happened it happened and people were just amazed and then of course there'd been a lot of economic\n... bits of news that keep coming out about the economy is we had a couple of we had a dip and the Dow for a couple of days it bounced back\nThe economy continues to search and shore and there'd been political victories um yesterday a judge\nThrew out Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against President Trump had to do with one of his tweets and more and more importantly the judge ordered Stormy Daniels\nYou know the porn lawyer represented by Michael ... to pay President Trump's legal fees which is a real slap in the face um and then came this weird revelation by Senator Elizabeth Warren\nThat she barely has any Native American ancestry in her heritage\nWhich of course has sent President Trump into this cascading you know euphoria of mocking and taunting her\nEven more than ever turns out she's got one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth Native American ancestry in her in her blood line and most Americans have more Native American ancestry than she does\nIt's been a ton it's been a scam and she has thoroughly embarrassed yourself and everybody's used to be having a field day with it well all of these things if you add them up\nIts you know all roads lead to November six we keep getting closer and closer to a midterm election with victory after victory after victory for Republicans now I don't know what's gonna happen I don't I don't I have absolutely no crystal ball\nWe should know not to try to make a prediction there are lots of toss ups in the house races\nAnd uh we we should have learned we should have learned from September from November of twenty sixteen not to believe the polls we should learn not to\nAnd and what I see these this binary choice that is before Americans\nAnd a party represented by people like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal I put them both together this is this is a a lie that they've perpetuated in order to impress people\nIn the ... warns case it was to get advancement at Harvard by calling herself a Native American and Richard Blumenthal case it was doing press people as as as if he was some kind of a war hero\nIt's called stolen valor when you lie about serving your country\nNow again this was represented by the Democratic party\nIt this is a party that is angry and violent I was reading about Tucker Carlson who ah we hope to have on the show next week I enjoy your show just about every night I don't know Tucker in fact all the years I've spent as a Fox News contributor my\nPast never I've never really cross paths with Tucker um he's got a new book the number one of the New York times best seller lists\nAnd he said in a in an interview he gave to the national review pod cash this week that show many people curse him out in public when he goes to dine in restaurants but he can't go out to eat anymore he doesn't go to restaurants\nHe told the national review podcast\nHaving someone scream F you at a restaurant it just ... rex your meal he says he can't go to restaurants anymore in Washington DC was he because he continually get yelled at by other diners who shout curse words at him now those are Democrats\nThat's the way Democrats drafty\nAnd when I look at a race like the one between Baitullah work in Texas actually Robert O'Rourke in Texas and Ted Cruz\nYou you gotta you gotta guy on a skateboard versus a grown up a constitutional conservative this cannot be a tough call protects\nAnd your story after story north south east west where the choice is so easy it's not even to the shouldn't even be a close call\nNow the dancers checked against the Republican Party because in off year elections the party in control usually suffers a defeat I don't think that's going to happen this year I just don't I think we're going to see some good good news and [laughter]\nIt'd be Elizabeth Warren thing cannot help I just I just want to be able to salute in a variety of ways it's a musical\n... real Native Americans like Chuck Chuck Chuck ... junior I Want you to hear what he said uh representing Cherokee Nation he was on CNN last night with Jake Tapper and ... you know\nPocahontas is now bragging about this weird revelation that she has one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American\nHeritage and Chuck ... junior pushback last night from Cherokee Nation in a big way here's a clip cut cut number three from CNN and our friends over at gravy and\nThe problem with the DNA testing that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person\nIs a citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA at best can give you some indicators of some markers that day indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived there in North and South America and they have been a native peoples of those continents\nUm if they relevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly ever tried to have that in common than we have some legal basis for our citizenship that\nWe determined consistent with federal trainees\nHis holy unhelpful or for any national later to a claim to DNA to determine ah or tennis tablets that their Native American in this country\nThis is this is all good news for Republicans because we are just a couple of weeks away from the mid term election the president wasted no time in responded in responding\nOr very forcefully here are some of his tweets he said poke a hunter I ... I mean the tweets are classic you know they call the limousine that the president rides in that big stretch Cadillac limousine the nickname for it as the beach\nThe nickname for Donald Trump ought to be the beach because these tweets\nMan is just he's an animal I mean it's just hysterical here is to reach today thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total fraud\nMany tweeted now that her claims are being of Indian heritage urban have turned out to be a scam an ally Elizabeth Warren's should apologize for ... for ... for perpetrating this fraud against the American people\nHarvard called her a person of color\nAmazing con he puts in parentheses and would not have taken her otherwise and then he tweeted Pocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren\nIs getting slam she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her\nQuote DNA test is useless even they don't want her [noise]\nWarren story\nGoing up in a ditch in in in a in a in a ... von Meyer of blaming lives and why she

Dallas Fort Worth audiences are seem to appreciate the exchange so I've got a I'll have a bone to pick with him tomorrow\nHe uh he sent out a tweet with all love those have you back on the movie first man as some global as a front to America without seeing it are profoundly misguided she it then tell me America is slighted\nOne of you will oh I Know plenty of people who feel America is slighted because of course as we know by now the movie does not\nFeature Neil Armstrong planting the American flag on the surface of the moon now mark loves this movie I knew he would ease a space guy\nAnd I and that's which is great I Love space and I love the idea of exploring you know the last frontier and NASA and all the things that that accompany space exploration so it's not a it's not a surprise that mark\nWould love this movie about Neil Armstrong and the first man on the moon what is surprising as she's OK\nWith ignoring an epic moment of of American patriotism and pride I don't want to see this movie I don't care how good the special effects are when they enter the re enter the atmosphere\nThe planting of the American flag on the moon is in many ways the whole story of the race to get to the moon\nThe whole\nPurpose was to say look at what America achieved that red white and blue flag on the surface of the moon is profound and is deeply moving and they left that\nWhere they show this word ... before I go to the show I mean the show the flag on the on the lunar module and there's some images of uh of America in their wait a minute\nHistorically this movie and I can't wait to talk about this with mark tomorrow morning so if you listen to his in Dallas Fort Worth heck I'm they'd bring him on the national shows should be one because he again he's a space guy he loves it he's a self proclaimed space geek he loves all things you know he's easy from that\nGreat era where we were rooting for you know space exploration and the space shuttle and all that\nI think that's probably tainted him a little bit in terms of objectively analyzing a movie that\nHas edited out or exercised or ignored what are the most profound moments in our entire country's history yes this is a country great enough to send a man to the moon\nAnd he proudly planted that American flag on the moon's surface and you left that out of the story\nReally\nNo I don't think so no I so we'll see I mean my love give them and this is what I Love mark loves to say this when we disagree\nHe always laughs in that in that chuckle he gets and he says so much for conservatives always march in lockstep and reading from the same playbook on everything and it is right I mean we don't always agree on everything and that's okay nothing wrong with that\nPeople of good faith and goodwill can disagree and I profoundly disagree about a movie\nOh Mike Gallagher some of the things he says may take you off but\nGive them a chance to win your\nCar and share your let me think about our sorry that I Do think
