I'm going to be shocked if they find it\nBut I and I expect the president be exonerated but I still think it would be banned from the bureau and the department if they leak that before the election it will ... will be just like totally coming to the to the microphone about Hillary during twenty sixteen they got to get these high profile investigations off the cycle of politics\nYeah here it would be bad you think maybe they had been compromised in the last couple of years I mean it's it was\nTerrible now I think Sessions' is is moving I'm not with regard to this country is recused himself but I think he is the director are trying to to clean up the top levels of the euro\nAnd the department to try and get politics out of there it's essential you're right this is a huge structural question and I don't mean by that downgraded I mean it's very for the people I have confidence in the integrity of the department and the bureau to operate non politically so you're right this would be this would be another huge problem along those lines\nI Do not expect um attorney general sessions last much after the election I'm hoping Michael ... replaces them uh we'll see if you have a comment on that but I Need your quick comment on my pond pale going to turkey and Saudi Arabia or big\nIt's his comments he said I don't want to talk about the facts trying to make them look bad what he says I Want to talk about the fact they want to talk about back because we don't know what the facts are yet that's what he said and that's exactly what he should have said Jim Talent\nYes and we don't know what the facts or you know you've been reading and I've been reading that Danny but it had a good article\nToday on the on the Web site actually run yesterday that we don't know I mean yes there was there was clearly Saudi involvement in this we don't know what factions in the Saudi Government were responsible or and\nWe we need to continue to be able to work with Saudi Arabia in the region and that's the things that the president and a A R R balancing and they certainly don't want to try to strike that balance till they know what so yeah we got to try and find out what happened then we got to try to do is sort of way where we stand up for what's right\nA um ten Seventy the answer [noise]\nThe hashtags corrupt media we\nGot a president that has already named journalists as being the enemy of the people so don't be surprised from other countries take on a journalist murderer chopping made the pieces and dispose of Donald Trump it was always been critical of the Washington Post always been critical of his ownership yes but not in a way to say it's okay\nTo the president breast cancer and that ... is a is a um as a reporter he's a columnist really are at a at a critical of the Saudi Government that stands in contrast with a message that the president has frequently sent to the American people and to his supporters that the media are the enemy of the people highest where those to wonder\nIf [noise] enemy of the people rhetoric\nHas anything to do with anything at all\nHis can't compare the two you say because this is the president's attacks on journalists because of an accurate and fake news reported that kind of the same excuse the Iranians use in Turkey and the Turks used the Chinese use and the Saudis you write their issue is that these people who we think of the journalists reporting inaccurate and fake news about those governments or you can see the connection I make it right\nIn the United states has retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for democratic values and including freedom of\nExpression I remember vividly at train trip by their salary when I talked to for international and international journalists who

how\nWe're doing really well I think we've talked about this a couple of times but uh I mean we've opened up doors about two years ago and we've had a lot of successes are\nJust like so many other historians we worked hard uh we've been blessed with our success and uh we're just appreciative of the opportunity that this great city of given up\nOh what you do an amazing job I mean the whole science of fusion bonding and powder coating is amazing whether it's applied to steel and aluminum or or it's a wrought iron fencing it's parts for the oil field business parts of football stadiums\nBut you also open up your doors and this is really cool folks\nA Stephen tell anybody about the initiative to uh introduced kids in students using to manufacturing to real all American manufacturing\nAbsolutely um that's kind of the key thing as a a lot of these industrial coating that were involved in or the tail end of the manufacturing wine and although that may not seem very a sexy or attractive to young people is we're wanting to introduce a little bit of world to [noise]\nTo the young minds have you done in ... and what you spend a in particular were wanting to support the young groups whether they be elementary middle high school or even college\nUh possibly help out with their academic or the philanthropic endeavors up there actually dealing with us of what we're trying to extend out as hey\nHey Houston let us know what young people's projects you have so we can help out with them coding or we can help out with some education um just for example were actually right now working with a University of Houston or engineering team that's trying to put a rover on Mars for a national competition\nAnd it's not just a matter of helping out with doing some uh\nEasy free work for their a protective coating that are going to be going on their part but ah we're wanting to go in there or help them out understand were some of these assembly issues come in so that the coating can actually work better so\nIt's not just a matter of saying hey here's some money and hey we're going to give you some free coating a it's also about trying to educate them so they understand the\nThe full scope of this ah this manufacturing segment\nAnd it's a lost art Stephen ... is Houston powder ... dot com part of the family here and uh I just love the fact that you reach out and bring the college students in because manufacturing ain't what it used to be Seventy eight years ago in America\nYou know you know we're having we're having a fewer\nPeople with knowing more and more about this and that that kind of goes into the next thing is we've also done some educational pieces within from a high school and middle schools um especially with the high schoolers they have some are welding classes and some smaller manufacturing ah left actually go in there I work with the young people let them know\nWhat the ... people seem to understand what a education within teaching how law and medicine and seemed to be a but when you talk about this world of business to kind of becomes a little bit of a blank look and when you're able to speak to these groups of a high schoolers that kind of start connecting the\nDots and thoughts are really fighting to see their eyes kind of pop up going oh that makes a lot more sense than oh my gosh I get to actually use my computer expertise or I get to use my mouth and all the stuff that I'm doing with geometry is actually a have a point\nSo they don't want to write all this all the oldest geometry like there's actually a real toner circumference of diamond recognize this isn't just a test and when it\nUsed to it it it it gets the gears move and like your facility ... by a hearty in a same Houston party toward is is amazing I mean you've got other show at forty five feet what's the link to the oven to bring in your stuff\nWell we've actually even doubled our capacity but our largest urban now extends over sixty linear feet so that's a lot of brownies so uh we're we're very much we're wrong about that but yeah going back\nTo the uh the high schoolers are last month I was dealing with this one group and they completely were born away when I picked up the trash can in fact we have to be able to figure out service area a within a couple of seconds to be able to accurately estimate of and know exactly how much powder we're going to be needing dollars for a for something as simple as a trash can\nAnd ah when they kind of fall that the stuff that\nThey were learning in uh in freshman geometry well those are applicable right away\nOr they got really really fun and so again it's it's something that we're wanting to push a we really want to be able to a kind of give back to the great city in the way that we know how and uh the easiest way to do with that is just to help out with a\nWith academia and as I said the uh the philanthropic the or the feel good projects that either Boy Scouts or the school projects for the volunteer groups or laugh\nAnybody of a sudden surprise us let me have your phone I Want to take your phone away from it but just a brief shining moment we don't want any
