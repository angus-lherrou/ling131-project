weekday afternoon just five right after Michael ... to ... am ten Seventy me in\nWas secretary of health and Human Services Alex as our joined me inside the beltway I'm In the early ... is our welcome\nBack I Want to talk to you about drug pricing and good morning to you but I had to visit the pharmacy this week for the Z pack and all the other stuff that goes when you get bronchitis a tell me and I was little sticker shock that I've got good insurance what were you when the president talking about yesterday about lowering drug prices\nWell he was great to be with you again ah yesterday morning here at ha chess we actually revealed data showing that in one of the most important parts of our drug program Medicare pays\nOne hundred and eighty percent of what Europeans and Japanese pay for the same medicines under deals that farm it gives them and the president came over here to ha jets and he said that's going to stop that for a free ride into the stock\nWe're ... we're going to be done without paying sticker price in that part of the Medicare program and we're going to get the benefit of these foreign prices here in America and it'll save Seventeen billion dollars over five years but the program and three and a half billion over five years for patients like you when you get your drugs\nNow six days are I Want people to know your very fine lawyer you are what we call a litigator having clerked for the right honorable Michael ... my correct about that\nIndeed I was his first Locklear\nOkay so I Want him to be our next attorney general but there's a litigator you all have concern for what the statute permits you to do and whether the regulations which will go through the nose would come in ... are going to be labeled an overreach and you know the big pharma spends a hundred and Seventy one million bucks a year lobbying so you're going to get\nA zillion comments during the notice income and face when do you think\nUh and without pre judging the outcome ha chance we'll be able to issue a regulation from the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation to implement this proposal\nOur plan is to have this up and running by the end of twenty Nineteen so the end of next year or the beginning of twenty twenty\nWe're gonna take input but let me be I Want to be really clear view we're going to be doing this\nWe're gonna get input to do it the right way but we're going to end of this foreign free riding that's not debatable it's gonna it's gonna happen but we'll do it the right way and we're doing it open and transparent process to ensure we're seeing around corners and doing everything right because we want to make sure this works for hospitals wouldn't make sure it works for\nFor our providers for our doctors and want to make sure absolutely works for patients and will do whatever it takes\nTo make it work for all of them so they save money they have access and we stopped us for free riding and and how far is taking advantage of us\nNow senator or is there I agree with all that but I go back to the fact I think by the time your regulars out into the courts Chevron doctrine will have been greatly limited so I expect the Supreme Court to look very very closely if the statute under which you are proceeding\nHave you already done that as a litigator and ... and persuaded yourself but you got the authority to do what essentially it looks like a referencing to me and mid point average and like the real clear politics average of drug prices and implement that as the will buy price preventive care\nThat that that's correct you know um I actually have through of what's called the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation\nBroad authority to test alternative methods of making payments and Medicare to improve patient quality access\nAnd affordability and efficiency of the program that's why this is a demonstration project that will take place in fifty percent of America it has very clear metrics to be studied through it\nI have not the least bit of concern about our legal authority to do this to do this project\nThat's very good to know which ... now what about the Americans are on the other fifty percent of the country they're not going to be happy [laughter]\nWell you know I'm using as you just said um you\nThat I've got I Do have to test a proposition I Can't just do it across the board for everyone now if Congress like this idea that can do it tomorrow across America I'm and I'm happy to work with them if they're interested in that\nUp but for the rest of Americans who are not in the fifty areas the fifty percent of the country that will be doing this they're still going to see a benefit because as we the way the system works as a week old down the reimbursements in this fifty percent of America\nThe silly way that we currently fixed prices in this program will also pulled down the reimbursements as a result in the other fifty percent of the country not as much but they will still get some of that benefit\nTo conclude secretaries or of health and Human Services you've got a new proposal it's going to notice and comment rule making you expect to have it in operation by twenty Nineteen what do you expect a health care premiums to look like in the year at\nTo change things can you do have you with us to find out\nThe intensive and the answer [noise]\nThere's much we can do

Seventy\nThis is Ben ... huge issue for the people from all over the government if\nI can tell you what I saw were very few women and children\nAnd an enormous amount of men there were about Fifteen hundred in the second way they believe there are about seven thousand in total that cross through here but member a lot of people began joining the very first way when they got in Mexico a lot of things a lot of court told members that were pushing their own people into the crowd\nTo join the crowd that we're moving all the way to reach the U.S border in any of that and why we organize wearing the same back\nThen they told me that he was an organized movement that they had contact them and why they were part of this movement going and\nSeeing it on the news as well so this is very important for people to understand but not a science ... who make very organized he\nLoses a similar show Ron ... radio used in mind dwell on Amjad in Seventy and one of the three three the answer\nEither with us thanks for joining us special watching listening was similar to actually see the program\nWas the opposite it's all there I don't get much older our three that was the voice of a silver Carter ... talking with Sean last night\nAbout this caravan rolling up towards our neck of the which which is Texas and attempt to break it sells and she answers love the questions that we posed\nAbout this event a matching backpacks with was or run sale someone who's supplying what we asked me to be the sixty five thousand bottles of water per day\nHe'd sanitary she's for women to aspirin socks to just meals she joined us on the show right now as we were looking over the interview Sarah welcome to our show Houston, Texas\nWell thank you so much for having me than I appreciate it\nMatching backpacks one of the odds of people like to know can we do some third world countries where they are just happens to be a north face or Columbia outlet store to provide backpacks\nOr that was my question I at the you know not all of them had the exact right after tax but a good portion of them had the matching backpack a brand new hat\nShirt when they came across the border from Honduras into water mall that's where I was at I was and she can move right along the border there and the men did not looking exhausted or D hydrated and I've been told me they had back then they were by standing up to the border I'm In Guatemala you know to the Guatemalan border from Honduras\nAnd ah you know I was wondering who paid for this ... they they appear to be all saying the exact same thing\nThis is not about politics is about poverty that the caravan of poverty and so it was just it was not an accident it reminded me of a Washington DC march at one point because I was thinking\nThey have the fly with you know they were carrying the hunter and flags at the front of the line it's like they expected something meaty I could be there and there was a lot of local media on our friend from Central America there what was interesting is that on a lot of this would really hyped up and played at\nUm at the caravan of poverty and some of the local media that governments have accused of being very left wing or socialists\nOn media wings and according to people that I spoke with in the intelligence world there in Guatemala\nUh they said that what they notice is that the former government of the ...\nA former presidents ally of Hi Doris was somehow involved in this they allege that you know he would working to create this situation create a divide between the United states ... and the current a conservative on during government uh as well as\nTime it with the U.S elections so it had a couple of fat tried and I don't I don't think it was jets presidents ally of there were other people involved in this other groups and organizations because obviously if you very well laid it out\nThere with water being supplied and I did see the red cross there there were there weren't a lot of women and the red cross was actually tree some of those women and children that were at the front of the line\nA recorded joined us Fox News if you'd be tore a firsthand reporting back on this quote unquote caravan or some calling it an invader force because when you have a flag up a foreign land syrup and we're very sensitive about that in Texas\nYou know y'all y'all be holding the flag I'm a foreign land ... step illegally on our soil\nAh you know it's it's it's an invasion it's it's you know settled each charity behind but you so accurately pointed out\nA whole lot of men there's a whole lot of men on there and yet the networks are very careful to just show will you know pregnant women holding babies when did you see\nThat that's right so ... in the second wave I can tell you that there was\nWhat we under I think two hundred women and children only because I couldn't count every single one of them and I think I'm over counting those that what we saw was\nOver and I mean I was there as well with an a judicial watch I Want to make a point that judicial watch was on the ground with me and gathering that creative team there were\nAt least Thirteen hundred and Fifteen hundred men I did not see one woman in the main march that was coming through my Doris\nInto autumn all except for the women that were already in the front and this appears to be a pattern so every time they have a large group\nOf people that were crossing from the first wave to the smaller ways in between and its final wave they put the women and children right up front and makes it very difficult remember even for Guatemalan authorities to deal with this\nBecause in Central America they do have kind of an open borders situation any ways\nVery similar to the European Union\nWhere if you have paperwork you can travel from Nicaragua you couldn't travel from Honduras and to Guatemala meal once you reach the Mexico border it's a little different and the situation there should not be an easy path\nBut what they did what they would think that women and children in the fight and that they would try to hold them back that men behind would start pushing the women and children were being kind of\nPushed into the front of the gates right at the\nBorder area and so they would open the gate they would they would clear their paperwork than women would walk all the way up and they had this like little makeshift can\nSet up and that's where they sat with their children yesterday they actually found on and I want to be accurate on these numbers because they sent me another set of numbers I
