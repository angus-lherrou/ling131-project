got\nTwo big questions for you and we have the ... nightmare and we have the fact that apparently China has weaponized commercial technology and the and I mean maybe there was an arms race we weren't even part of it that your choice where do you want to go first about either of these incredibly important stories\nOr we can do either one of just arbitrarily pick a shaggy\nAlright go ahead what do we what what are the stakes and what are we to be demanding and doing\n[noise] [noise] well the stakes are huge and I think you know where I went to with this you was the context okay and the context is that Trump has done a pretty good job to this point\nOf rebuilding the paradigm to the set of partnerships that we've always used I mean since Camp David accords and the Iranian Revolution in Seventy nine\nThat we used to protect our interests and that is a partnership with you know Egypt Jordan Israel several of the Gulf states and off and on Saudi Arabia so\nAh yes we need to put pressure on the Saudis to make very clear that we don't like this but this is one of these instances where we got to remember\nYou know we're the friends that liberty everywhere but the custodian only of our own and we have to tend to America's interests\nAnd I tell my friends who and I share this you know who who want human rights to be\nAn object of our policy I Believe in that but I'm the I'm the ... the prospering of human rights around the world that hands on the continued security and vitality of of the United states so\nYes we have to pressure them but I think we also have to understand that right now we're working with them and a lot of areas\nThat do you think that the market collapse some concern over this down down eight hundred and thirty one point yesterday atop another two hundred and twenty in the free market there there are some worry that there's a rupture a foot\nWell potentially although if you're going to ask about the market either get Kudlow or somebody like me I you know I don't know we'll see if this continues um actually I I mean I always do these things as kind of a correction until something you know something emerges just show different\nAll right let's move over to the fact of the Bloomberg report that the Chinese had been weaponized seeing the commercials say a commercial product stuff that everybody buys they had been weaponized thing that would be an arms race in which we were not participants 'cause we don't do that\nYeah and they do this and first of all\nThere's almost no civil military divide\nIn China all the companies all the efforts are are directed towards the end state or they're producing a lot of the components that are used in information technology communications infrastructure around the world and there's been a concern for a long time about what they may be planting those components and this is going to get\nThis is going to get bigger as five gee comes along and and and the number of those of those devices and the importance of them to every aspect of life you know multiplies geometric one it's a real challenge and I'm I'm Glad the administration is focused so much in this national competition is long overdue\nWho has the lead on this\nIt's an interagency thing you and that's part of the problem is\nThat's not good yeah\nWell I understand but we're not organized I mean Trump is Trump's people had to do a lot of things at once and one of them is to consider how we organize the government to deal with this you know it's like\nTrying like when we built the architecture of the Cold War national security policy that took a decade right so we got to do it quicker than that I Would say that the commerce trade representative DOD has a lot to say about it because of course they have a lot of these devices it's homeland\nUm there's a whole lot of different agencies in organizations involved\nNow a center of town in terms of of sanctions against China do we concerning ourselves with for example the fact that they are relocating eight million wires into concentration camps is that our business\nWell it's a it's a good pressure point it's a yes it is our business because uh on one level\nOf United States speaks for human rights around the world\nUm and and we should do it by the way with regard to the Saudis I met suggesting that we are seeing them I mean what we need to call him out on and we just have to be sensitive to the broader context here I think it's a tremendously good pressure point again she's not just the ...\nWhat they're doing in Hong Kong or what they're doing generally just social credit system they're developing the minute we control the lives of their people yeah they're sensitive to that and we should\nUse it as a pressure point that's one area I've not seen a lot out of the Trump Administration yet although the vice president's speech the other day and kudos to you for that interview a was a really good opening wedge him now\nI Hope it keeps it up Jim Talent always a pleasure by the way Claire McCaskill just wrote up to Boot Hill of of Missouri what kind of politics is that\nUh I don't think it's very good but I don't think the trend line the last couple of weeks in very good for Senator McCaskill\nSo it kind of like holding up a tent and going to St Louis and hoping for the best right\nNow we got to keep working on where nobody's fully up any pant leg trend line\nI Believe the overreaction of a laugh when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob how you're going to use the word totally a mock it is without a doubt that we're now\nNew put a stop what mom in what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August ago I'm not I think what we saw chasing me right what about the

living now let me let me plenty move past the N. word because I Do feel like that as part of the the weaponization of what's happening now on the right\n[noise] the president speaking at a rally tonight just on what is the latest way to undermine anyone who opposes\nHand to match us during\nTo an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\nSo uh we're hearing that time and time again

in the media that the the goddess all left\nHall bird that story is called fast and furious with strong purchasing to go against you or to go take on your gun rights as a second attack on the second amendment which led to the deaths of so many people on the Mexican side of the border and that is all from Eric Holder held in contempt of Congress for crying out loud a state LA happy Thursday saying we're\nSixty something degrees beautiful cool day\nDoes that predicted for the week uh football a lot going on a different John Malcolm Sandy by former deputy assistant attorney general out of D.C with heritage John it's actually been up to a TV studios before good friend of our show what's up Mr Malcolm\nSounds like Eric Holder running for president or a beautiful day for Republicans if that's the case [laughter] hey\nThey're making noises about it I'm not sure what state he's from he's also been talking about running for\nFor Senate but it would not at all surprised me if he is a running for president he and uh and and former President Obama or had been litigating redistricting cases all around the country to try to make the more favorable to democratic candidates a heated actually in Pennsylvania\nA buddy you're going to be on a lot more from a from Eric Holder and and boy hearing that statement about oh you know we kick them and and Hillary\nClinton's statement about all you know you you have to react and you can't react similarly uh two Republican civility if you're going to be restored until the Democrats are back in power you know like you know here's a coup by the civil or you're not civil whether you are in power out of power\nI you know it's it's actually it's rather frightening Rand Paul said after this cabin off a bruising confirmation fight\nI you know that the Democrats really to make an effort people responsible people tamped down about somebody's going to get killed and that's hardly an exaggeration I mean look at look at ... at least\nA who almost lost his life last year by a Bernie Sanders supporter or run a mockery man um it's a it's a scary time\nWell not only that John not going to be a you mentioned Kavanaugh which will get to a second but um there was a story was the senator from Colorado Cory Gardner his wife got ugly the Taliban now the real of a beheading right and then you had Susan Collins is staffers being threatened with rape\nOver the Kavanaugh situation it's it it's true that there in the ... the the Columbus the goblet salt left and that's what they become\nPushing violence rape beheadings violence a hate crime against a Hispanic senator a white mob a running about a restaurant like Nazis would run jeans at restaurants\nIt really is and not a single Democrat has stood up to say stop it\n[noise] it very few I and I must say although I I think she hurt herself with with this vote Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota voted against Brett Kavanaugh but she at least had the courage\nUh yesterday at the come out in response to Hillary Clinton's comment saying you know we can't be civil to the Republican Party and said that they kill us now stop it uh I haven't heard anybody else saying that but she did say it and you know she she she\nShe said it because you are one she's ... she's out the door and ... and she may have dumped she may well be she may well be she she was but he was headed\nTight ration have titled lead a but now her hopes are fading teams\n[noise] let me ask you this week spent many weeks talking about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh I kept saying measure the road\nFor weeks probably about actually maybe three months when we last said you said I don't know go easy I don't know\n[laughter] uh did you ever think it would go down to the wire like that last Saturday\nBut I knew if you look out for the all the Ford that Dr Ford allegations in that hearing I knew was going to be\nWe're going to be close and you know who would have expected Murkowski could flip over and and and in the in the face of all that pressure from mentioned just stick\nA with Kavanaugh so it was unusual alignment but he he got through a you know which I think is a is not a great for him but but from my perspective great for the country and for the rule of law\nA and he's been on the bench this past week hearing arguments and already asking questions and joking around with his colleagues and you know that's good for him\nA lot of uh a John knock on my good friend from heritage former deputy assistant attorney general uh no it's a heritage so they\nObviously there was no collaboration cooperation with any of the accusations right now I'm Single the FBI couldn't put it together but the GOP assault left to saying well he's recused himself\nIn any upcoming case if it involves a sexual assault or Democrats blah blah blah if you haven't been ... if it hasn't been proven you did something wrong why would you use yourself or what do you have to or would you advise him\nWell he certainly doesn't have to and I would advise him not to\nUh you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nDuring the presidential campaign said some very nasty things about the about President Trump a and you know when the travel ban case or any case coming along involving the administration over the last year you know nobody's moved to recuse a Ruth Bader Ginsburg and I don't think she gave any serious consideration\nTo recuse yourself at their best to ... and going on in your somehow the decision making process of an investigation you can consider recusing yourself that Jeff Sessions did with respect to the mall or a investigation but I I see absolutely no reason whatsoever like Brett Kavanaugh or would we choose himself from any\nUh you know any case involving Congress any more than I T Ruth Bader Ginsburg were queues yourself for many you know case involving the executive branch\nThey amended that um are so let me ask you this ah it was a\nBruising event for the Kavanaugh to Kavanaugh family the president lightly apologize to the Capitol family on behalf of the nation they were like the daughters and the wife are threatened with death imagine if you're Amy Barrett Comey writes she's next in line\nOr or claiming Coney Barrett she might be ... ... ... ... any coming back at the names on him economy beret um\nIf you are you hearing any rumblings that she might be gone you know what I don't need this I don't need this aggravation if Ruth Bader Ginsburg ...\nWhat are we better get for is not going to step down we better Ginsburg could pass on but there's no way she leaves fall entirely a ... I you know I mean this is bruising I but I don't think that it Amy Coney Barrett is the person who's\nNominated I think she would she would do it she's lead an exemplary life to a very distinguished academic mother of I think\nFive or six or seven children some of whom are adopted by off I sat next door once at a at a lunch and and I found her absolutely charming and you know everyone says how bright she is um so I assume she would she would consider it and and and go for it but that would be\nIn this these things are going to be brutal from now from now on I mean we keep lowering the standard\nUh and it's all about now is that you you're not going to get people to commit to how they're going to rule in the future on cases if you really want them out you have to attack their character you don't have to but that's what people now do it's dreadful uh but I think that unfortunately this is probably the new normal\nWhat are you hearing and I know we've got to go um [noise] the FBI investigation or not the FBI or\nWhatever they call their procedure that took place they have the best occasion that took place with a cabinet history right was never leak it was never leaked um it's always essential can do that the Democrats won a leak everything negative about the president they didn't leak this one\nAnd there was some words well it could have been witness tampering an accusation in that in that look see by the FBI into the cabinet ... with ... before you hear anything about that\nNow I mean and so they kept is very very tightly control is apparently forty nine pages worth material wasn't really a real court my guess is is it all you got was a series of FBI Rio twos those are memoranda than that number on the form\nAnd the wheels are missing in the quarter panels don't match show to show up the truck is held down by wire but you're still in\nThe wizard of Oz dollar stereo in there yeah no kidding around I\nGuess a rush fucking bond Joe on the front

here's the problem is the market's been breaking down for for a a about a week we talked about it are actually on Tuesday I said we we put a hedge on the market on your show it we sit down with a time precaution and what we noticed was staying in\nThe ... that that composite was breaking down it it it last week we shorted the composite for clients he heads position\nBecause what we saw as the market that that that that could going up all year and it was just kind of hugging these twin lines it what we think it was his one of those things started to break everywhere re start dumping there'd be no buyers which is pretty much exactly what's happened\nAnd yesterday one of the uh the U.S and the five hundred broke the fifty day moving average everybody up because they were all going to get out and there was no buyers and this is something we've been talking about Sam up on on the show is and it's really been liquidity there's just\nNot the liquidity when everyone cells are just no

weeks we don't know who's going to be running the the house or the Democrats are the Republicans a lot of uncertainty and you know\nTo be a little bit cynical but it's to the ah the Democrats and the Chinese best interest for this market to fall apart ahead of this election\nMan and I know what you're saying is analytically true because I think it ... what's the guy's a Bill Maher set it on HBO he says I Hope the economy crashes and millions lose their jobs so the Republicans lose power in the house\nThat's that's scary that's what they obviously is what they want and need but tennis really scared for the rest of us real Americans\nYeah it really is scary and it's very sad that these people would take this way but they are and and\nSo but but you have a very expensive stock markets Sam remember we've been talking a lot about were making a shift from a financial economy to the real economy and the financial economy is\nHash tag corrupt media\nTwenty thousand years ago to school here and I think the Democrats and get all of them to vote for them\nTo be in trouble in the district where with NBC News and I'm just trying to figure out anybody you're going to vote in election on

as\nAnd it can be a first election\nDecide whether or not the house representative and democratic or Republican control [noise] are you thinking about what\nAbout currently maybe if I have more time like informed about like what's going on out all day I assume that\nThe people voting have at least some idea of who they're voting for are you going to vote\nWhere like the most reliable Miller never I didn't like him [laughter] well that's what the Democrats won\nBut they can't hit on you got there I think\nThis is uh Sam alone show Ron ... radio used in and find twelve new media on AM ten Seventy and FM one of the three three the answer [noise]\nThat was gold is that a mark I don't know who is that I as that guy\nWas on um NBC's Today show yesterday I got a quick clip of it\nAnd he was he's obviously he's a Democrat and you can tell you at all these bump it from the Democrats and he went to a high school where there's twenty six hundred a eligible voters in high school and I think it was twenty six had or whatever you could see how their concern there about you know uh\nI got to get home grandma video games you know I\nThink so he says if all these kids vote they could sway the election right it was obviously pushing he's pushing a dirty ... agenda from the office all left and then the kids are like it's not interested right when it got us\nGrowth and you'll notice that the girls said you know the real life so it's a good look pulling them away from a bong and Fort Night [laughter]\nSo long the opening scene the opening scene he's walking all these kids are sitting down against fence out all those before school laughs girl look after waiting for the bus or something whatever it is\nSo they're all sitting there and that's when he says anybody anybody they look at him and we're back down to our phones and their androids ... back to what they're doing like oh cares about this guy\nAnd finally he gets that one oh I'm just thinking about school I was waiting for the Tom ... answer\nGirls that Mr Taylor I introduce you to this blue wave\nTaylor Valley\nRemember the other day forget the blue and we said what smaller that are ripple and we couldn't come up with a call like\nIt'd be a especially with the midterms especially with the voters you look at the demographics of the voters\nI'm ... and then they think oh well it'll be with the kids you know kids are Eighteen twenty year old had known her interested I remember I'm In radio an MTV started\nThis thing called rock the vote do you remember rocking the what was it like Chris Rock or a big part of that or was it I think it was a shock was for you baby yeah and all these like rappers and hip hoppers and the people whose music calls women bitches and whores and they're like wanna so we're going to go\nAnd they started with the T shirts\nAnd when they had like all this ... a product and they were going to change the election and we're going to get the ... vote and the youth vote turnout at Eighteen to twenty twos as you\nWas so ... it was it was like it was embarrassingly low wasn't that one and they were trying to start\n... maybe I mean right now we're talking inside baseball if anybody knows you sway is from MTV was river the rock the vote he was all over that would you know what I mean you're right yeah nothing happened and nothing happened and\nThat is the goblet salt leftist running out like well what do we ... the Democratic party is any systematic anti Jew anti Israel anti God anti protection of the unborn anti American exceptionalism they're against a energy independence from Muslim countries\nThey're against us or against veterans there whenever the whole nine yards\nSo this is falling so they're like well we're we're going to get votes who's going to promote in and help us with our dirty gutless agenda\nHigh school students is called ... dot com Fontaine ... eloquently\nPut the spotlight on you're going to pull them away from the bombings in Fort Night\nTo go stand in line [laughter]\nVoting but they wouldn't know what that was [laughter]\nThey're like yeah I voted woods uh Kim car Daschle who work better on us weekly yeah I voted for better
