he is you know that said happy to say let me get to a good friend of building a ... bill a successful businessman mayor of chemo ran for mayor of Houston a couple of years ago\nHe keeps just up to date on the fiscal strength of the city and weakness is like you you can't believe bill happy to see how you doing buddy\nBuddy how you doing I'm rocky rock and the free world hey before you to the numbers and stuff a story obviously gets giggle that we were talking about for the past two weeks is the robot sex shop that may or may not want to open up shop on the Richmond Strip 'em in the city's like to we don't have any rules to stop such a gross like\nJumping on this one what do you do if you're the mayor of a\nWell you're not a solid Turner came out today and said I don't endorse this business and you know I I was really quite relieved to hear that I was\nWe're what we're wondering where he's going to mean\nWe have we do have drag queens rating in libraries to little children so yes you know I was worried about where am I come down to spend a lot to do all this stuff is just this is all sides shows to the big issue you know I was out last night a spring branch the residents against flooding a grassroots organization you know\nOperating without any money just regular folks try and keep their houses and being flooded which happens a lot out there in spring rent had a meeting had a couple of hundred people show up\nAnd ah and listen to the mayor and dirt made for a while and they also listen to Anchorage Sean Todd Litton talk about how the federal government roe was a great great meeting out there and uh I can tell you one thing everybody that meetings voting against prop I can promise you that\nWell yeah I mean if you and my wife and I were just talking about this last night if ... if you relive that and you remember what had happened it was a couple of days after Harvey\nWhen all those homes are just destroyed I mean this is a huge fear of theirs from king would only down anywhere from the ... river authority down to the average reservoirs though\nThere's there's almost no place in Houston that's really shy promoting and and that's because you know if you live along the by you know people forget there's there there's there's two kinds of flooding there's by you may know overwhelming backing up in the neighborhood but\nBut also pockets being flooded because we can't get the water to the by you fast enough for example the Sam's\nBy you watershed a shift by has not been out of his bank since Nineteen Ninety four because a bunch of great work the county in the court did on that watershed but yet and Harvey we had sixty eight hundred houses flooded in the Sims by watershed because the city's\nInfrastructure show outdated and so poorly maintained it couldn't get the water out of the neighborhoods to that by fashion up even though we ache Pasadena by you that's a real tragedy\nIt is and and I I don't think there's any new plan like we're still in October right something could always roll our way out in October I mean heck Hurricane Sandy waffle new New Jersey in October ... at the end\nAnd allow their you know they're they're still down there taking over half the drainage and spending it on other things like hiking by coordinators um you know and I've I've talked to\nYou know I talked to these people that are supporting proposition I and I say well you know we have to have a lock box because we don't have a lot about that can just do anything with the money they're already doing anything with the money I mean the only thing worse\nThan not having any lock box is having a pretend lock box\nThat for and what we're protecting the money [laughter] 'cause you're the one young and an impromptu bilking for alerting us on the percentage of money spent on what was supposed to go to flooding right in charge incredible and\n... and by the way he think about this for a second you know we now have the numbers on what's been spent on after church going back for a back to two thousand seven and if you take\nThe years two thousand seven up to two thousand eleven before I'm rebuild was Institute you look at the average we spent on the streets and drained and you take the money after rebuild Houston we're spending less money on streets and drainage now\nThan before we added a hundred million dollars to the pot\nAnd how is that possible [laughter] and then we add a hundred million dollars a new revenue and we're spending less money I mean come on it's ridiculous\nNow how is the ... the response venue rotary I'm an editorial but one is about two or three days ago was Sunday's paper you I'm\nSorry for the chronicle and the headline was vote no on property and insist on a real lock box for flood control funding that that was like don't touch hot item is like common sense right and you know\nBut but you know you got the shame cabal of special interests that are down there supporting proposition I because they all make money off of it uh and it's a slush fund for the mayor to use every wants to and you've got you know let me tell you what we we need to spend the morning and talked about campaign contributions at the city of Houston something needs to be done to reform the system\nBecause special interests are absolutely running city hall for their benefit right now we've got to do something to step in and make sure the average voter the people in spring branch whose houses get flooded every time it comes or wind or an Meyer land you know we need to make sure the city's working for them and not a special interest that fund these campaigns\nWell there's no rise you do work with the city and you have a business or you want to keep that contract alive and well right semi\nPromise you they ... they look I used to I used to have a business had had government contracts all of the country and you get calls a day late from people twist the arm to hate why aren't you show up my birthday party of and by the way the brain or campaign contribution I sure would be nice got those calls all the time\nIt was amazing the shakedown oh and that's why the ... the cities in the shape as it is okay in terms of growth folks in terms of traffic the mess from the Galleria through the highways are these scandals and the city hall something's got to be done something's got to\n... to campaign contributions to the landowners along the coast of that we're promoting this ridiculous boast or this bustling project can post out\nWhat's going to do it real quick final question them at that\nI'm not in the amount of transportation business I'm not in the engineering business I'm just in the people's business or that is the worst thing you putting a bus line\nThrough the

minutes or whatever the hell the other shows are called where are they waiting on route\nThey don't exist listen when you ask questions in America today in your conservative so you're asking questions or conservative or the sixty three million people voted for Trump like say on the wane\nWhen you try to put yourself in that head all you do is get condemned by the world so as an example I never sit by the way that the biggest terror attack was an ISIS attack\nI should get either this is the ones who said here's a video the Vegas strip where we put blood tripping on it and we're promising we're gonna attack the Vegas strip and that was just months before the attack on notice it after the attack by Stephen Paddock it's the only known personally know and I've always said that\nAfter the attack ISIS to quit once twice three times four times I've interviewed on my show many experts on ISIS and Islamic terrorism every one of which it it\nSo in the liberal media I catch credit for everything they never in their history kicking credit for anything they getting hit in the media we for total information that I just constantly tips credit for going to suddenly nothing but they took credit for

any other than it's likely it's possible and likely but it could have had some terrorism aspect to it but just that I open for Donald Trump a week ago in Las Vegas it out again dates on his\nFree liberal publication the country for me and slander me including the Democratic party put out a press release\nTrump took the stage with coffee shop conspiracy theorists\nClean route that was that [laughter] you get for asking questions\nBut I think people you know the average person or the media person is a sheep for not asking questions about Obama's background about\nISIS about the biggest terror attack about Brett Kavanaugh's accuser you're allowed to ask any questions about Donald Trump is it made me get a caller conspiracy theorist but if you ask a question every conservative ads on
