shows and I are radio and of course you can find on the news\nOn am giants and the answer\nWelcome to the impacts used in the weekly public presentation of Salem Radio Houston focusing on people in issues affecting our community here's your host news and public affairs director Jay veep Richard\nPresident Donald Trump has said that it is a difficult thing scary time for young men in the U.S\nI think the truth of that statement became apparent Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle a man presumed guilty despite any corroborating evidence\nFortunately cooler heads prevail the Republican majority rejected allegations against judge Kavanaugh and he was confirmed\nBut he had some of the nation's most important people defending him\nBut what about other falsely accused men and especially falsely accused boys\nIt's a dangerous time for boys and men but it isn't just because of the threat of false accusations Dr Warren pharaoh is an expert on the plight of boys and young men in fact he's the chairman of the White House effort to create a White House counsel on boys and men and he's the author of the book the boy crisis why our boys are struggling and what we can do about it\nDr Warren Farrell is joining us here now on impacts used into elaborate and explain\nNocturnal thank you so much for joining us we're glad to have you with a show with a topic that I think is going to be very important in people's minds now that we've seen what's happened in the confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S Senate does any of this surprise you to see what took place in that event\nDidn't I'm saddened me though is the way we treated it it was it was\nEither she had to be totally raw and making a false accusation or alternatively that he had to have not done this and so that was it was it he said she said that is what is it what is\nPeople's reality I teach a couple of communication workshops all around the country and then\nWhen I finally get people to be able to listen to each other without becoming offensive\nThey feel show heard that uh their their partner finally understands what they're saying and then I have to reverse roles and share the ... the person who is listening who got it exactly the way they are the critical Senate finally speaks up and says his or her truth and his or her a truth\nI have to prepare them\nI have to prepare everybody in my in my workshop after the fact that his the the your partner's truth is going to be a very different picture a very different truths they have\nThe hundreds we all have thousands of pieces of our puzzle that as our history\nThat we that we see things through and we remember and ... with its ... and this is when only\nThree or four or five months separates a person talking about an event versus the event after thirty six years\nYou your memory select certain things that are that are traumatic for you and repressive other things that make you feel that would make you feel like a bad person um and so and other times for other people it magnifies the things that would make them feel ashamed\n'em and re presses the things that would make them feel good about themselves and so this this this belief said it had to be one person or the other that was telling the truth I think is it speaks\nTo a very um major flaw in our process of communication then of course reflects itself as well and Democrats sticking Republicans are all\nUm you know it all wrong and vice versa\nI think there's also exposes the way things are remembered by my I'm back in our family stories changed over time and nobody's trying\nYour man story or maybe they're just telling your story the way they remember a very different than the other people remember Mrs exactly\nThere there was a film that is that she's going to be coming out that I saw a preview for last night called boy you've raised\nAnd boy you raised a ... one of the ... the sisters have a fairly large family die\nAnd so they're all talking about their memories of their sisters which of course we've all heard it in a funeral that we've gone to a memory of a mother a father\nAnd you see you know like if they're ten family members talking about at UC ten pictures of that mother a father\nAnd um and this is even within the framework of a funeral where you're trying to say nice things about a person if you're really letting the whole gamut of of experiences with that person that you'll remember different experiences and so I think we really have to start\nLooking at the two things with a capital experience one is it let's work on\nUm acknowledging people's different ways of seeing any given ... incident\nAnd then secondly um\nThings that we have\nA very\nChallenging message when they did the um eleven years of research for the boy crisis book is really challenging and many see that you have boys are still experiencing in high school that that the pressure is on them to do the asking out if they're interested in a woman\nA women do have the option today of doing the asking and if a woman is\nThan the societal norms\nExactly in fact I'm you know I was on the board of directors of the national organization for women for a number of years and we began having our first conflict\nOr when I when when feminists who are members have now\nI Would write it and say I don't like the the quality stuff when it applies to a divorce because I I Know my children better than my husband does I should be the one being able to um be fully involved with their children if I Want and get him involved defect to the degree that I feel is right\nAnd I said wait a minute you're asking the wrong question here the question is the question is should be a what's best for the children and they said well wait a minute ... says but whether they should have the freedom to be able to raise their children children by themselves\nAnd I said well that freedom I I'm a hundred percent in support of women having the freedom to have children\nBut the freedom to have children implies at the moment you have them your child's life becomes more important to you you have the freedom to make that decision as to whether you're going to allow that to happen in your life or not just be single and not have children and so um and there is a bears where we broke\nBut I started to so they said okay you know this was back in the seventies and they said well you know there is a huge amount of research proving that children do better with both parents but um because at that point in time there weren't a larger number of divorces for a long enough period of time to have really good research that\nSo I went out doing the research but you know because you know I was making a very large amount of money from speaking on behalf of now a feminist issues my desire was to find research that did prove that they were right that the women were where were the best\nRaising children including boys and I found out that that was just plain wrong and so yeah that finding the research that found that the children get so much better with fathers\nWell as mothers involved and that what I call checks and balances parenting um it's really the best and most effective parenting understanding about ten differences between dad's style parenting and mom style parenting like the boundary enforcement around that I was mentioning and the and the pressure\nTo to have postponed gratification those are two examples of those differences um and when those differences are all in play that's when the children to the best while I was really hoping that I wouldn't find that because of that costs me many millions of\nDollars in speaking engagements fell and\nNot just general it seems to me that the previous time when these norms worry employees\nIt was basically a religions that enforce these norms what do we do today was the seating influence of religion in society how do we restore some semblance of a\nI don't know how do we find more value in a returning to these norms which\nClearly promoted a better crop of men\nYes absolutely first of all we really do have to understand that children need both moms and dads secondly dads have to start reading and finding out what they contribute why you know why is there propensity to lead a boy or girl climbing a tree\nI'm much higher than a mile would be comfortable letting that boy or girl climbed the tree out why is that good and then where does it become dangerous too dangerous to be worth the the fall or that might happen when they go too far and and the wrong place\nAnd so this balancing act is part of it but that that you know usually with a mom looks at a dad rough housing her only thought as\nWell my God I just have one more child to have to sort of a monitor here and then if they if they keep this up sooner or later there's gotta be somebody's head is going to be hit somebody could end up crying and he doesn't even realize that I don't know why don't why that's the case\nAnd then ... there is someone whose heads are head or they're somewhat is cry and that's just proves to her that she's right and she should've intervene\nSooner and she feels guilty about not intervening sit sit her dad stone say yes I returned to rough housing after they hit their heads and I returned to rough housing exactly the same way as I was doing it before because I warned them not to do when they had their first hit as heads\nThat was the signal that something went wrong and so I'm telling them not to do that again or what to do differently and then I'm going turning to rough house housing to give them the experience of that\nAnd what types of experiences where they're getting to each other the the the the the older brother and they may be middle aged brother and a younger sister\nOr they were being told by dad to I'm not push shove elbow or somebody out when they were having a rough housing event where the the goal is to pin down down and dad was supposed to pretend to pin all three of them down first\nUm and so and at that site and that excitement\nA which is which is what psychologists call emotional intelligence under fire and what in simple terms can be called teaching the children to be empathetic to their brother and sister but you don't teach the children to be sympathetic to the brother and sister by just lecturing them to be empathetic because\nThey agree with you at the moment you say that but then as they get excited and want to painting you down they forget about that and so it's only by letting them not forget it that it by knowing that they're going to lose their\nFunding time rough housing but by dad's saying okay I warrant you and not to ... about your sister and push or out of the way she's younger than you are and\nCetera um so now there's no more rough housing till tomorrow night and then they lose their rough housing and that that encourages them to start having empathy for somebody else's feelings and in a moment of excitement besides there's\nAnd so we find that rough housing for example is far more likely to get allow children to be empathetic\nTo allow them to understand the difference between the conservative and aggressive to have that emotional intelligence under fire and also built a much deeper bond with the father because of the physical connection and that deep bond is used unwittingly by the father\nTo enforce boundaries that that ... could not enforce without having resentment build up toward them and so dad's have to explain all of this\nUm and the and and explained the other nine different style of parenting and so ... and then moms and dads has to be able to listen to it without becoming defensive\nAnd I mentioned that couples communication workshops before they find that that that the Achilles' heel of all human beings as our inability to handle personal criticism without becoming defensive but that's especially true for my loved one who we love so much we feel fragile when they criticize us\nAnd so part of what we need to do a among families who are not religious and don't have that do tend to their to their psyche and system I'm is to to communication not legislation but communication skills training and then others and fathers have to think of their parenting is checks and balances parenting\nA assessing each situation their child gets involved with\nAnd and knowing what dad's had to contribute knowing what moms have to contribute and respecting that contribution and hearing each other is um the reason for killing the way they do\nWell you clearly done some extremely important work and you're very\nGood at communicating it so I Hope you have many chances to get this message out it's one that Americans I guess you could say based on your research that it's the men and women of every continent me here about how we return to the\nThe good parts of the norms of the past which produced healthy young men and women\nYes and and and what you're getting it and I didn't really quite acknowledge it up\nIf there is a wisdom and the accumulated history of ah the way we've brought up children and the way we are valued family\nAnd I'm afraid that my feminist trends that didn't never never understood the value of the family and never understood the value of fathers and the resistance to hearing that message to the important stuff that\nComes in grade conflict with their own focus on personal freedom\nAnd that is really a mistake or that they that the political left has made today\nDr Warren ... author of the boy crisis why our boys are struggling and what we can do about it is recommended reading especially errands anybody who might be on with their opinion leader in the world because it's a message people need to

Medicare plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket costs plans with zero dollar brand new and even plant that hey you back\nToday we have a word for wives and health for husbands and I want you\nTo read with me the first seven versus a first Peter chapter three\nLikewise she wives being objection to your own husband's that if any obey not the word that is the word of God they may without a word literally as what it says without a word and be won by the conversation or the wives now\nThe word conversation here is an old English word that means more than what we say it literally means vow or behavior that means reverence who's a\nDaunting let it not be that out with ... wedding the hair or a wearing a goal or of putting all of a powerful\nBut let it be the hidden man of hearken back which is not\nCorrupt the even the ornament of a meat and quiet spirit\nWhich is in the side of God oh great price raptor this matter and old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in objection to their own hospitals\nEven as say ... Obaid Abraham calling him lord whose daughter GR as long as you do well and are not afraid within the amazement likewise you husband\nWell with them according to knowledge giving on around to the white as onto the weaker vessel and is being airs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hinder\nNow in this first part of is a chapter\nPeter talks about uh how wives or they have in tough times and some wise or having a tough because they're married to a man who doesn't know the lord that was a wife to do when she finds herself married to an unsafe because\nYou're not leaving me not to lecturing you're not the lord over him you are to love him that Jesus Christ and how are you to do it well he tells us\nThree things that should be in the heart and why of every woman ever Christian Woman not just one that has an unsafe husband but every Christian Woman first of all there is to be an attitude a submission\nLook again in chapter three burst one likewise she wives being subjects into your own husband's that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the behavior\nOf the why an attitude of submissions\nAnd notice I said an attitude that summation because if you submit without the proper attitude you really haven't submitted it all you just say All right I'll do it\nYou really hadn't submitted I mean there has to be that bad attitude that that she Daniel ... attitude a submission you say but wait a minute why should I submit to him because Jesus Says so we're all equal work\nIn the side of God but you have a submissive spirit that is to be an attitude\nA submission all along with that there has to be added Dorn myth of serenity I Want you to continue to read hear and birth to while they be hold your chased conversation coupled with beer who's a daunting\nLet it not be that out with a daunting of planning of the hair and wearing a goal and putting all of apparel but let it be the hidden manner the hidden person of a heart and back which is not corrupt double\nEven the ... of a meat and quiet sphere which is in the side of got a great price now\nPeter tells you how to be\nPerpetually beautiful\nYou see no matter how beautiful you are if that's what keeps your eyes when you're paying yourself in a corner because there's a new baby and beauty is coming on every year\nAnd your beauty is fading why is it that will not corrupt what is it that is perpetuated beautiful as a matter of fact increasingly\nYou have talked to the autumn of on me and a quiet\nSphere that n word serenity that n word beauty that's going to make you more beautiful now there's to be an attitude up submission there is to be an a doormat of serenity and there is to be an activity of service not notice of or say\nThe Bible says that ah say recalled Abraham lord that doesn't mean God it\nMaster I mean she served there you're saying might have started my husband yes\nThe Bible says and the very beginning is not good that man should be alone I'll make and helped me for him and that word help meet meet someone to help me does me to serve him to fill up that\nPart of him that he was missing\nYou are you were to come by side in and help me\nDisney is physical me his sexual me his psychological need is a professional me he is to be a stronger person\nBecause of you there is to be this activity of service in your heart and in your life now are these things true about you\nKnow sometimes women say well brother are just you know my husband he's just so much against God and he's he's just so much against the church he didn't like me being a Christian and listen most\nOf the women were talking about their husband will not let them go to church on not living this kind of live now there may be a man\nWho show me that he rebels against pets but I Want to even that man he's going to rebel because he's on the conviction\nAnd as a Siamese on the conviction because here's on godly live for the first time has come in stark contrast with like God lately I have watched she lives as preaching a sermon amp that put him on a conviction that he's going to try to put her down\nTo make him feel better\nAnd so he may say you can't go or whatever the what's your reaction but you just keep on living for the Lord Jesus you keep on showing the beauty of Jesus\nAnd I'm telling you that is going to put such a tremendous pressure on him that Simon theater says after a while he's going to come to you and he's going to ask you\nWhere did you get that hope this and you know\nWhat makes you different and then\nYou're going to be able to give him the gas and helping to come to know Jesus Christ as his lord and as a savior now let's just\nLooking for seven now and let's look at the husbands I notice what\nThe Bible says about the husbands likewise you husband's well with them according to knowledge giving honor on to the Y. as onto the weaker vessel\nAnd is being airs together the grace of life which are prayers be not hinder now here Peter tells us three things that wives husbands will give to their wives and indeed over to their wives Christian husbands\nGodly husbands number one consideration consideration\nWell with them\nAre courting ...\nNow the word knowledge means understanding that is you are to have knowledge of her\nYou understand her\nYou'd live understanding your why\nNow most husbands do not understand there why\nThey do not live with their wives according to knowledge and therefore they are not consider it otherwise would you say how do I get knowledge well in order to get knowledge you have to be available\nAnd in order to be available you have to give time\nAnd in order to give time you must play in time and take time and my schedule this is perhaps the biggest point of stress is to find that proper time to be with my family and especially to be\nWith my wife but how can I Do well according to knowledge with someone but I don't know\nYou see men are conquest oriented and a man likes to achieve\nHe likes to buy something build something do something achieve\nSomething even getting married and that's the reason before\nMarriage oh he dates according to

to get new ... we just want to give you some good news\nThe good news is that Jesus Christ the ... the son of God regained you and me out of the slave market of send us our debt to God's men paid and we are now free from the penalty and the power of saying if we receive crisis our savior when in fact except the offering that he made an arm and a half [noise]\nThe free gift complements the grace of God the pages to it in and says for by grace you're safe through faith and then not have your sales just the gift of gun none of works us any mention boast about it so heck of a way to start a radio show saying all of that but here's the main bottom line\nAre you sick of living like you're living you're tired of being the person that you are or would you like to start your life all over again you can [noise]\nThe Bible says if any man's in crises in New creation old things are passed away and do things become you you can have a clean slate today than receiving Jesus Christ as your savior you can begin a new life a spiritual life\nA unique life that God has ordained view an eternity passed and a wonderful way to live that you can live without worry you can live without giving you can live without shame you can live without fear it's a wonderful life called the Christian life but it starts with face alone in Christ alone\nThat's why the tightest says and three chapter five chapter three versus five and seven not by works of righteousness which we did\nBut according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing the Holy Spirit which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ are lower than being justified by his grace freely buys grace\nWe wouldn't be made errors according to the confidence that we have of eternal life\nWhat a wonderful thing to know Christ the savior to begin a new life that happened to me when I was twenty two years old\nI was sick of myself I was sick of living the way that I was living I was sick of the spotlight in my hand that would show me all the goofy things done and try to go to bed at night and there was no peace I didn't really know gun I didn't think about John\nBut finally someone took me to a Bible study and heard about God\nAnd I heard that claim that Jesus Christ dying for me took my place in the cross was judged in my place\nAnd that if I Would trust him I could have eternal life I didn't know all the complications of the ramifications for everything that would take place but\nI did it I pray and I asked him to save me\nAnd I didn't feel weird I mean nothing funky happen no lights blink no angel showed up but it happened just as I was told to do what happened [noise] my life has never been the same sentence gives me\n[noise] so what happened is I became a personal representative of the Lord Jesus Christ and you can do that also\nYou can be a personal representative of the Lord Jesus Christ\nWould you like to do that would you like to be his representatives and the devils world recently while listening to my pastor teach a series on the life of Christ and it's been quite a series is well over a thousand hours she's been teaching them this right now\nI came to consider what it means to be a personal representative\nOf the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what I'd like to share with you today [noise] noticed some of the points that I read and I go through John Seventeen Henry to she\nVersus and this is where the Lord Jesus Christ is praying praying for his disciples and you're going to find out something else he prayed for you and this passage around here and John Seventeen beginning with diverse six he said this [noise]\nThis is as my pastor says a dynastic prayer or teaching prayer but did the cycles are learning as he's praying they're learning and he said I haven't revealed to you father [noise]\nThose same you gave me a bit of gave me out of this world they were yours you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word and this was the first key thing\nWe are Americans those of us that live here burst by birth proud to be an American this is not my home I'm passing through the Bible says I'm a soldier earner and passing through on my way to glory on my way to the promise place\nBut while I'm here I Am to tolerate others hold grudges have the spiritual strength to stay the course until God calls me home and second glance five twenty gives me my commission\nTherefore we are ambassadors for crisis mount royal commission yours too\nHas oh God we're making his appeal through a ... you and me we invite you on the other half of Christ be reconciled to God you and I are ministers of reconciliation that means we give the good news\nOf Jesus Christ to those who come into our periphery\nTo say that I witnessed through my lifestyle is a coward a witness to my life to huddle preached to people that's a coward if you're not willing to give the gospel straight up your coward\nIt doesn't mean you have to preach to everybody you made but you could at least give them a track or something we'll talk more about that later but every person you meet as an opportunity to escort them\nInto happen and the God's Grace so you're in ... ship is made up not only of how you live your life but what you say a in private you function under your preached to your bully reprise but in public\nYou function under your royal ambassador ship the personal representative of the Lord Jesus Christ if you say I'm a Christian\nYou are the personal representative of the Lord Jesus Christ\nChurch age believers like you and me are not only ambassadors to human creatures but I angels are keeping an eye on those things going on down here as well\nYou are a royal investor you're being watched right now I angels observed are lower than for some of the three sixteen\nThey observe and rejoice over the conversion of just one person and look Fifteen seven and ten and then found in angels who you know as demons or been asked to resist and oppose your ambassador ship\nAnd your growth in grace\nThis is saying and job one six and joke to one through three phase in six twelve\nWe're at war there's a spiritual war going on\nSo Christian service that's huge\nDoing something for God Christian service related to your royal priesthood which includes prayer giving the execution protocol plan of gone by learning thinking in solving problems that's the priesthood Christian service related to your previous to\nThat gene representing yourself before God\nYou are supposed to pray you're supposed to give your supposed to live the protocol plan a gun and the only way you can do is to learn it thinking and live it but then the other side of the coin your royal ambassador ship Christian service related to your royal ambassador ship includes evangelists\nIncludes witnessing it includes administration and the local church you functioning in your local church maybe as a deacon or administration on their mission field are some function in the Christian service organization\nThey Christian service related to the laws of divine establishment is a wonderful way as a bachelor for Jesus Christ if you serve in the military if you served in law enforcement piece serve in government\nThat's a wonderful way to represent Jesus Christ of God's anointed son that's awesome\nSo second grade at the ends five Nineteen to witness the fact that God was in Christ Jesus reconciling the world and to himself\nNot including their trench passes on to them and have committed undo us that word reconciliation\nHave you ever thought why people go to jail why they spend they turn it into like a fire is it because they're bad centers there drunks their immoral they're adulterers oil it's the reason\nNo one goes to hell because of their sins their sense of been paid for their sins or judges don't across all sand was poured out of Christ [noise]\nI've told you the Bible says he that and you know saying was made sense for us\nPeople go to hell and spend the eternity and like a fire because they reject Christ the savior\nHe believes in Hampshire not perish but have everlasting alive and he'd that believe that's not the wrath of God about its own him already if anyone goes to the lake of fire it's because their name as non recorded in the ... book of life not because they're centers\nBut because they rejected forgiveness they rejected the opportunity to be say they rejected Christ the savior\nI mean Jesus was clear this is the will of the one that sent me that you believe in may who may have sent and he said if I'm lifted up our ... you must lift him up you must proclaim his name\nNot obnoxious lay yeah must literally\nGives the word of God as an ambassador you stand for God you are personal representative of Jesus Christ you have been set here for a mission\nThat mission is to lead someone else to Christ to give them the information so they can have eternal life also not for you to sit on it and say well a witness with a lifestyle\nAgain that's a coward lesson anybody can be a good person anybody can have a moral lifestyle just because you live on moral lifestyle that as impress people\nYou know as well as I Do as soon as you open your mouth and begin to talk about\nChrist that you're going to be alienated by certain people and that's fine as a way it's supposed to have it Jesus said I didn't come to bring peace I came to bring a sword father\nWill turn against son son will turn against mom and daughter I mean it's all in the Bible\nSo oh why you think it's supposed to be really easy if you talk about the Lord Jesus Christ if you didn't define as a royal ambassador\nDo you not know what's gonna happen you kind of be ostracized you're going to be attacked you're going to be a target if you have a business card whether say John Doe professional services\nPulling the bottom of the car next time you reprinted bastard or of Jesus Christ put it on your card\nGive it to people don't be ashamed of it it's the most unique calling in the world you had been called to stand beside Christ you had been called can represent him\nAnd had been said end of the devils world where they royal commission go there for and proclaimed the good news of Jesus Christ [noise]\nUnfortunately many Christians are so self absorbed they never even come close to living the Christian\nLife they don't even get close to it than even know what it means they just go through the ritual of religion without no reality to it ritual that reality is totally meaningless has to be reality to what you do like communion\nSo many churches offer communion once a month once a quarter two or three times a year and it's just a ritual with no reality because people don't even understand what they're doing\nThey couldn't name any doctrine associated with the bread and they couldn't name any doctrine associated with a cup they just eat and drink it and say okay I'm remembering Jesus is a lot more than that is a lot it's a test is a test of what you can remember\nMany Christians are so self absorbed they never take the time to learn anything yeah I got my ticket\nTo heaven yes I'm saved someone to go to church every Sunday Morning I'm always they're always give them a tad I'm a good Christian I don't drink ban smoke to hang around with those that do yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda\nBut what about the plan of God what about growing the grace and the knowledge of your lord and savior Jesus Christ what about study to show that self approved under God at work but it needs to be a shame\nRight made about him to where the truth what about take my yoke and learn from me my yolk is easy my burden this light what about if you love me you will keep mandates and they're not gravy as first John five three\nSee each individual ... is an opportunity for you to extend the grace hand of God in fellowship he's waiting and you can invite them and\nIntroduced them to your savior the Lord Jesus Christ if you're not confident in what you're supposed to say than give them a track I mean my goodness I have a little small track called happiness we give them away by the hundreds\nPut it in their hands and said he would you if you take time to read this let me know if you have any questions would you please take a moment to read this\nThey may throw it away I mean that's okay we'll print some more but if one of them takes time to read it you have at least given him an invitation to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ without you saying anything if you're not confident in what to say\nIf you're not confident in what to say and sometimes just because you don't know how to say it so maybe one out of a hundred will eventually respond but at least you offered the good news persona witnessing as one category of Christian service\nThe show I'm your host Lynne Morrow as always we are working on your financial freedom today lifestyles unlimited single family mentor Surella Warren is my guest and we're going to spend the next hour\nWith you sharing some things we've seen real estate investors do that cost them time and money and the fact is time is money your time is the most valuable resource you have it cannot be replaced once it's gone and it's it's really important that you learn\nThe most common things that that people are doing out there that cost them time and money unnecessarily [noise]\nSo I Want to give you an opportunity do now is the best time during the show to call in and ask your question so you can ask questions about single family or apartment community real estate investments anything you want to talk about we're here to help you out\nLifestyles unlimited is eight nearly thirty year old real estate education and mentoring company we can help you out give us a call let us

I've been on the team for eight years as a mentor radio host and the executive vice president of the company and I have both single family and multi family apartment community investments my guest Surella Warren is also an active investor is a single family mentor\nAnd surround will you tell us a little bit about you and your story\n\n[noise] good morning I'm very much if I have been a member for five years I joined in twenty or thirty plus years working for a like a lot of those people out of the ups and downs though a\nLot of cultural styles was making good money some years a lot of money some years and that's a really great years or ... or ... years also during that time I didn't say well enough or with part of it and try to catch up when I was in my early teens are\nRunning it as a roadblock I actually ... years old I kind of fun to plan that I was going to work in a year ago as for money and have a very nice retirement point would be Seventy years old\nAnd each year I realized I of course brings I couldn't ... because I made to look over cover for ... come from the government I guess\nAnd then I was considered hardly ... oh my God this is limited and the laws that have a lot face and I was trying to catch up over ... happening and I heard um lifestyles radio show one day and I heard a little bit of ... like many of those\nExtra early those things so I was very tree and I went to a free workshop saying we heard the radio program joined us because remember started buying houses and two years later I can remember a multi probably in the\nWe'll go ahead and through the years I was able to make my uh my income corn and I was able to retire from my job\nIt was\nKnow so it just that that short little summary there of the journey that you've been on that was that was jam packed full of information for the first thing you experienced was what the majority\nOf people our age are experiencing right now and for those of you that are younger boy it's in your future if you don't do something to prevent it and that's that that concept of the four oh one K. the IRA being able to invest in those vehicles through the stock market\nAnd this idea that you can make up time with that and you're right there are significant restrictions on how much money you can put in and high income earners would maybe often choose to put in a lot more than they are allowed to each year because you're differing the taxes\nAnd the government really doesn't want you to do that they've they would like to have that tax money now and so they restrict how much you can put in there and for those of you you know Surella and I are in our fifties\nAnd you know for those of you that are younger you are still being pitched on the same broken retirement vehicle that ah that we experienced and lost money through the cycles\nOf the up and down market and if you come into your fifties not prepared for retirement you have to do something else and so you might as well get started early if you're younger if you're like ... then there's no better time than today rights are out in order to get started\nYou talked about coming to a free workshop and if you would like to do that if you already know that you'd like to just come and find out who we are right know commitment whatsoever we're just going to tell you who we are and what we do because we have a very specific investment model\nAnd a belief system about life and\nInvesting and real estate investing and preparing for retirement how to create wealth and passive income\nSo come find out what it is see if it matches it rings true for you ... ... and I and you can register for the free workshop at lifestyles unlimited dot com lifestyles unlimited dot com and go there you can\nLook around on our website you can look at radio podcast and you can also sign up for a free workshop\nAnd you mentioned that you went to the free workshop then you went to the two day seminar a that was in the middle there probably and our two day seminar it is I think the best deal in real estate investing where we spend sixteen hours telling you exactly how we do we do we have nearly Thirty years of experience thirty eight thousand members\nAt teaching them how to invest in real estate and then you chose to have some additional education and mentoring with our challenge program and before we went further with your stories for all I wanted to explain with that program is that the challenge program\nIs available for people who want more education mentoring when you come out of the financial freedom seminar the two day seminar\nYou have at least one year memberships sometimes to your membership at lifestyles you can go back to that seminar monthly if you like you can watch it on line you can go live across the country but absolutely in Houston Dallas San Antonio and Austin\nAnd you can attendant as many times as you want which is an unusual thing there's no additional costs for doing that because we know that people don't retain all that information and they need to go multiple times to build on what they learned last time and learn more and more\nBut typically when you come out of that first weekend you know more than most real estate investors to and you can go out and buy a single family rental or small multi family property five ten units\nAnd you can do what we teach coming out of that but if you want more help locating properties if you want more help with the hands on mentoring that we do stepping you through the process\nThan that challenge program is our single family program and of course that's your babies around right in Houston you are you are one of three mentors there and so why don't you tell us a little bit more about your story and what retirement it's been like for you and why why are mentoring and when you could just be sitting on a beach\nBut somewhere like you did recently and that that tell us a little bit about you know your experience with mentoring\n\nWhen I uh I uh I I work in the travel business for the last Thirteen Years I Love to travel olive oil and all kinds of you know product is the nation's are\nAll kinds of people are cultures I Love that that's just part of my life and that's what I was doing in my last job and then when I retired I was opposed are for about a year before I\nCame to watch the whole and I traveled a lot and that but the the ... the ... well before we are tired was the majority I knew nothing about real estate investing I and I the people who walked me through up to me\nGet to where I was able to retire during that period so when the opportunity came up I was happy to come back and get back to that woman should help other people do but\nBut you know does motto is not the money is watch the man I enjoy going to continue to live a lifestyle and what you just mentioned um what I was really good I I'm In the position now that I can talk a lot of my mind the train and helping people buy gold and by email\nAnd I can do that from anywhere recently took a trip to ...\nUh with my close friends charter so those little we've properly or some of the smaller group guy but I was able to respond to voice mail in the middle but he can take like coal and its members while I was a sailboat are sitting on the bottom of the group\nThat's so kind of combining both worlds I could help people get to them for their financial Cleveland go and I guess you could live a lifestyle while I'm doing that [noise]\nYou know and that's that's the interesting thing about people think about retirement and everybody's got a different picture in their head that most people that I talked to view retirement as not working\nKnow the major thing that's going to hold them forward and and we live at all out and then I talked to him a month later or two months later and they have done something you do\nAnd we have one of the benefits of membership also it was a road trip once a month or take members to
