{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KNTH", "content": "Immune system it's a really long list and I honestly it surprised me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bombs we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right in front of the first\nTwenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D were from the U.S navy okay\nSo I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were study and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to melanoma\nSo skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting from the harmful ... young raise\nAnd and they're developing skin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers and inside and I went oh my God it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream can you do three formula help with that\nYeah it's like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow\nDown for us it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bad role in from side to side you wake up\nWith your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three my formula so here's someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball and pain muscle pain fibromyalgia\nI Would say ... on my formula like immediately and start thinking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nSo of course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like feeling a little bit younger Chris\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results to be seen\nBut one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred\nFor seven six five six one three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid result\nIn by getting Dr ... vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offered this only available to your listeners today so when you do call please be sure to mentioned this program and you're going to get a risk free trial\nOf Dr ... says vitamin D three again this is only available to your listeners\nAnd only a few cold this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred\nFor seven six five six one three plus if you'd call right now you also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself first year was a family member or friend\nBut you must call right now because this special radio offer is not available in stores or on line so that number to call is one eight hundred for seven six five six one three\nAnd keep in mind folks you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective\nOr your money back and when you do call and order you're not going to be enrolled in one of those automatic monthly subscription programs this is a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor seven six five six one three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for seven six five six one three so\nHow 'bout folks me what it really comes down to here as we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin these three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof where should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short developments and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men the men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties\n[laughter] that's the way you know you start and more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active and\nWhen you're in your fifties you start telling her you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on\nFormula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done in a number of clarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pick is such that your fast melt the three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath all in the mirror in the morning and then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of the vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like this and\nThe sooner you can get on my formula better eyes you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high\nMobility life from here I Know\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and Dr ... what can someone expect when they start taking your ass melts the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that something is changing in your body because the\nKick start so many different cycles and your body that you'll start having less Shane having more energy and having better mental clarity better sleep your mood can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary to get these things running\nWell Dr biggest unfortunately we only have a few minutes left anything else you want to share with her audience here in our final minutes\nFor those of you listening covered a lot of ground Oregon let the body is tricky as you know and\nWe're talking to your listeners have your show you know there are all walks of life put all various conditions and so I'm trying to get some good health that vice chair for is the point is and get yourself to get yourself on its formula and see for yourself\nBut be easy explanation here is\nThe red Sox are just a juggernaut folks were true everything's settled their way and including some highly questionable I'm ... but you know how I feel about that kind of stuff do you got to play three band called you got to figure out a way to win anyway [noise]\nAnd that's exactly what the Astros are done for quite a while\nThere just didn't do it this time I guess what I'm trying to say here's the red Sox were simply the better team this was just there year\nLast year was the Astros here but this is their year like I said everything seemed to do their way like the way game for ended Wednesday and I think about this the bases\nLoaded the Astros are the hard line drive to left field and been intending made one of those women or lose it dives for the ball and they came up with it to get the third out\nNow just using that wasn't quite as an example you're willing to Indy had been one steps slower heat of missed the fly ball it would have gone all the way the wall and the Astros would have scored all three runners in one of the game\nTeam short we'd still be playing B. A. O. C. S. denied no matter what happened again part Thursday\nBy comparison George Springer and Tony camp both came really close to making the really big players on long for eyeballs that fell out of their gloves and they wound up being an extra ...\nMeanwhile ... bats married to a game changing fly balls in right field well one of them more family interference called don't even get me started on that but you get the idea here that baseball is a game of inches just like almost any team sport is a game of allergies\nAnd the measuring tape just favored the red Sox should not be Astros there were just so many different plays that could've gone either way but just didn't go cues to sway\nMost of those plays didn't grow the Astros way last year but this year they didn't you\nKnow I'm reminded of what Craig ... like to say these shape sometimes you just gotta keep your head to the other guy said nice black\nBoard as Susan surrendered said in the movie bull Durham and I'm One of the game [noise] you know actually that wasn't Susan ... who came up with that line that was really cute or he was a baseball player in the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds he was the one who said that originally he was only five foot four one hundred and forty pounds\nBut he's in the baseball hall of fame and that quote really says everything you need to know about the Astros for me I don't see as Houston just did you hear them wherever they aids and the red Sox were\nThey they are show lie so we'll get like some Crispin it's it's a lot of fire without\nYou know fall out the fire for the wings and and I enjoy that and just hit it with a barbecue sauce at the end\nUm I had a party or the other day that I actually I'm a house that was just a [noise] I made it worse could I made a a coffee crusted brisket\nFood yeah gotta why get breast could end this coffee crush too and I think I slept to sixteen hours and then I did a espresso barbecue sauce and nobody had just first can we make tacos are just grows up some ... and we just we all make tacos out of this so that was kind of a\nIt was just for taco so it was kind of a fun fun you know interactive 'cause I like you know a little place for cheese or however I Will allow their kitchen by the way\nI Love about this you know but\nI put I didn't you know people get their green egg and they'll put that in there I didn't really want my smokers set into the outdoor kitchen 'cause you never know which way the wind is going to go and you know he just\nHe can be spoken out poll park so but\nWhat I did do is put in a girl and a flat top and instead of the side bars identify top and I've had fun with that will make breakfast out there we you know when I grow up to him that day you just feel a whole thing up in your toss ears kind of tossed around but for birders you know\nA flat tire or is just the easiest thing in the world and you get allies crust on it and um\nIt's it's been a pretty specials are arguing that outdoor kitchen so we're we're\nRunning out of time in this segment but I have to ask you coffee crusted riskier what is that how do you do it\nYeah you know I'm I'm kind of the ... the super ... you're not leaving all the fat cap on your ear trauma that had a tire by it worth it\nAnd then I put a coffee crossed on it it's got it's got coffee of course it's got a red chili is salt and pepper and a little bit of brown sugar and it just makes a really lies cross deliberate skip\nAnd it's ... ... ... ... the flavor of the tree out east too brusque ...\nI'm a big salt pepper whereas the guy but I was making tacos with us so I think it any more flavor and so I did that and you know the the espresso barbecue sauce I just basically made my base barbecue sauce and an addict [noise] um you know for shots of espresso to it\nThey were cutting down actually cut the espresso down just\nA little bit and nobody went to sleep [laughter] nobody nobody ... have\nA home run over for another segment

shape than to show and watch it but then again who is\nA missile game I ... I was I didn't agree with what happened to the Sean well\nHe got beat up again bruised lung bruised darn him\nBut he just keeps going and going and he's the Energizer bunnies if the NFL the Texans I think are pretty inspiring what is the very real exception of the profits of lime coke\nOr but otherwise I think it's just one of those things where they just keep figuring out ways to win games they don't deserve to when\nYou were a number of years ago now a championship game Clemson in Alabama and I would watch that show up for the corps quarterback for Clemson and Alabama through everything Adam kept knocking down this guy's out Iraq because like I don't how many times can beat him close colleague here\nAnd that's how I became a real fan I didn't know we're going to grapple with this guy and they came back they want to you because of the drive of that land\nSo we need to keep it\nBut I'm not sure that we're going to be able to without offerings of why\nI haven't seen I I think I'm gonna I'm gonna watch it I've got to be a\nWell you'll enjoy the game or I don't want to ruin it for you but thank goodness to the defense I guess I should tell you how it in\nDo we have a ticket to they want to live for that's what I Want to know you know when you listen to sports talk shows they think just because you can they already know everything happened yeah I had to wait a minute find a score a theory\nTheory who won the Texas game they\nWere talking about this and that and nobody ever mentioned with the final\nScore was typical radio people you know\nWell I'll tell you right now Joe bailed us out with the ... off of that was definitely the highlight of the day so the details but there are a lot of the good things to put that off at that conference is just ... ... it's offensive uh we got to admit that Watson is becoming a turnover machine but\nIt's the lack of affected this on the old line that really creates a lot of those situations for now and O'Brian keep saying well we're going to get better but my question is when do we get better and what do we do to make things better bill\nWell here you know you look at football players they can be the same size same athletic ability but there's something that one has the other doesn't wear your way through their twenty pounds a hundred and eighty five there's some people have that that real talent you know ... and are offensive line or bad guys and they look like they do really well but they're just not they're not very good\nNo they're not but yet they're in first place and the AFC South\nOr the cowboys from just grown Jacksonville yup oh yeah I don't know whether you call them up against us realize\nThat came out because it's really pretty darn good\nBut protections are just the first story of course the rockets started the regular season during the Astros are deep into the post season so there's a lot of sports to watch this time of year that that brings up the topic of conversation for today's edition of the board seafood outdoor cooking show what is it\nSaid sports watching parties at your house now you've talked before about doing a hot dog bark and an ice cream bar where you just lay out all the ingredients\nAnd you let people build their own but let's talk about some other ways that you like to be the troops when they come over to watch the Texans or the rockets or the Astros or to see you know let's not talking about there\nAre other ways do you like to suggest well\nYou know there's we discuss chilly but fortunately is always on the host to my [noise] my wife to\nCome up with a huge part of the\nGreat tasting chili and they really are\nYou lay out everything they might want to put any but I've got a pay as you let people come in the early edition of people and they can address it\nThe way they want to and and that's fun to kind of making your own because people have a plate of food is already played it you know well I didn't want all that macaroni and all that kind of do it myself and then you always have to have plenty of second you know of course the greater cheese and a little cayenne pepper whenever anybody wants to add to it in\nA different kind of crackers or things like that we just keep it real simple for football party because he can't do it down 'cause everybody wants to watch the game\nWill you know we had that problem a Sunday night during family dinners my wife prepared her famous roast rice and gravy with a fresh green beans exceeds stamped\nAnd the whole nine yards and she wanted to serve this magnificent me in the form of dining room but the former dining room doesn't have a television and of course the Astros game was on and everybody wanted to watch the Astros\nSo we wound up sitting in the breakfast room because we could look at a TV [laughter]\nSo yeah sit down dinners for sports watching parties are problematic but you know you mentioned chili and now that I stop and think about it is there is another dish that we mentioned last week show that you could include\nAnd that's ...\nGumbo you have shrimp ready and do you have a crawfish has heated up\nTo the idea that one of our just said last week you could go buy some really good gumbo from a place like new raging Cajun or something like that and then just put it in this big gigantic cook to act like you did it yourself\nYour shirt could it's a lot cheaper if you make it\nYeah it is better it's a lot of work\nOr ... years ago I had occasion cookbook at it for whatever bottom chapter what it says for his latest number one most important by you or\nYour own really buyer ... easier to to make it more likely to want us there for like an hour or whatever\nWe'll see my wife to the back of course from Louisiana she cooks a lot of cage and stuff and when she

sudden and you're going to have a lot of a pressure and a lot of stress in your life because you have to do it at the last minute so\nI Would recommend you don't do that I Would recommend that you get with us you get with us it's like a tax resolution to wait one for six nine twenty four forty four and take care of that situation and then also you\nKnow right now after the situation after the taxes are filed a the auditing examinations stark and so you know that can happen as well and so you know when you get that kind of odd letter or you of course a lot of people say oh just handle it myself I Do it that\nLet's just face facts you're an amateur\nThe people at the IRS do this for a living every day they do this\nSeventy five days a week and all year long\nAnd you don't and so they know what they're doing most of the time sometimes I Do sometimes we educate them a little bit in there and protect your rights but they deal with taxpayers on a daily basis\nYou know deal with him at all so you don't know what you don't know you don't know how to handle your situation you may think you know how to handle your situation but you don't know how to hide your situation because you don't\nWith it every day and so you don't know what your rights are and so you don't know what you're supposed to do what you're supposed to say what you're supposed to provide you are supposed to answer all the questions but you're not going to go in there and just like a ... going in and somebody said to like going in a I think a sample I was at going in and uh the\n... for a used car it's not that\nKind of negotiation people so you know that's what you're gonna have to do is you're going to go in there and if you don't know what you don't know uh you're going to\nYou know\nBe bullied that's just what it's going to happen if you are arrested which you appear in court without a lawyer you know a income\nTax audit or civil investigations and you're being investigated and these are iris agents are trained and interrogation tactics and so they know how to get the information out of you and they're trained and that's what they do for a living\nAnd so you don't and so you need to say I need to get some professional help and the deal is is would you get the cheapest person you know if you were arrested a ... or ... would you want the best attorney\nAnd also uh iris representation is highly valued skill set and you want the best possible person for the job so not the cheapest\nAnd a lot of people say well you know ... uh well I don't want to pay you unless unless you get me out of this audit situation or how this virus situation well it'll be sort of like to go to the attorney and say well I'll pay you if I'm found not guilty\nYou know that's not going to work either so you need to get some representation if you get into the situation because if you don't you're dealing from a position of weakness\nAnd you don't know what you don't know and you're going to is the results are not going to be what you do desire and then I've we've had a lot of cases in Texas it's like a tax resolution where people have tried to handle the audits tried to do that\nAnd they don't get the results that they want at the end of it\nAnd so that happens to them and uh they they get in that situation so we can handle the situation we could discuss what your options are what your rights are and\nWhere you need to go from point a to point B to\nMove on through the examination to get a conclusion and get on with your life so if you haven't found your taxes first steps first she got filed

S.\nMark CPA dot com so go ahead and contact contact us and we'll be able to discuss any questions and to your personal tax situation if you need to be so\nGo ahead and get in contact with us All right let's talk about some individual changes of course we talked about the new tax forms is going to be radically different\nThe big change of course we've been talking about is that the standard deduction what is called the standard deduction is being increased\nFor married finally joint twenty four thousand dollars and twelve thousand for single\nAnd so that's going to be increased significantly over what the prior tax law was and plus if you're eight sixty five and over each spouse eight sixty five an hour over gets an additional twelve hundred and fifty dollars added to that figure so I can be up if you're over sixty five it can be up to twenty six thousand five hundred dollars\nSo you've got to exceed that amount now to itemize deductions so those of you who have itemized in the past using the schedule a form with all the medical and the taxes in the interest et cetera\nContributions if you don't see that you're sort of it's going to be a a you know just to exercise if utility because you're going to want to use that larger him out of the standard deduction\nCongress' intent was to get eighty eighty five percent people off of that schedule a farm and they're going to succeed that is what's gonna happen this year because you're going to want to take that larger number\nWhy why did you so you know you're going to be able to say well so keeping all the records on your medical and all these other things you're gonna have to go well it's not going to help me this year\nI'm going to want to take that senator ducks and so it's going to make the record keeping a little easier for me however if you have used in the past we've talked in the past shows about employee e business expenses\nThat's a big change for you as well if you have used that deduction in the past for working for a company and then writing off your expenses as an employee business expense for like meals and entertainment and mileage and things like that be aware\nEmployed business expenses\nAre no longer allowed that foreign Twenty one oh six in that section down there is gone on schedule a where the employee business expenses also\nYou know you pay your investment advisor investment expenses for his fees and also the tax preparation for the tax preparation of your tax return\nThat's gone to its gone\nNo longer allowed so be aware of that's not going to be there so all you're going to have\nContributions maybe some taxes and\nWe're talking about the taxes and because they're the limitation there to\nMedical expense mortgage interest\nYou know so you're gonna have to look at those particular item to see whether or not you're going to exceed the standard 'em out and so it might just be an exercise you know and coming up with a number and you'll say well I Do it can come up with Eighteen thousand dollars in my standard elections twenty four so obviously I Want to take the twenty four\nSo you look at that and see what's going on there so you're gonna have to look at that and make that determination\nAlso exemptions let's talk about that exemption is you know so much for each person for kids et cetera exemptions are gone\nThose deductions for exemptions are gone they're no longer there they're gone so don't be looking for that now alternatively they've increased or enhance the child tax credits and also they have and have\nNon ... will credit for people who are not children for example an aged parent that you know that lives with you or that you support a hundred percent or more than fifty percent you're going to be able to take some particular credits tax credits not deductions tax credits\nFor those particular people but you're going to have to meet the requirements and to take those credits and compete those credits properly so they have increased there are there but you're going to have to do some work on it and see whether you not to qualify for cars for example\nAnd tune in every Saturday at eight am on a um

formation retirement today Megan ... alongside Joseph Hopkins he's the friends and I guess the Hopkins in associates a state and retirement planning\nThirty nine years helping people retire successfully that is a long time and stuff and I want to make sure and folks are tuned in today listening if they have\nQuestions that they like to take advantage of your time in the business they can call today here's the phone number eight hundred Ninety five thirty one thirty sec stats that number at Johns Hopkins and associates an eat every day on the program\nWe answer your questions you can submit those mission retirement dot com\nAgain submit your questions or just in that mission retirement dot com he might answer one of your questions on an upcoming shell we've got a stack of question are you ready\nI'm ready to go to a game on today All right let's deal than our first question comes from Dan in great which he says I'm really enjoying my job right now as a professor but I Know I'm coming up on my Social Security benefits I make decent money and I would still like to pull my Social Security if that's possible\nAnd I am about six months I'm turning sixty sex what do you think should I start the paperwork now\nWell do you have this what I tell ya if first of all the window of time is three months prior to when you when a poll and have your benefit starch so if you're six months out I Would ask you would it make a dramatic difference financially to you if you waited three more months and then filed\nThat three months prior so in other words if you do now you're going to be you'd be six months prior to when you're for retirement ages and\nAnd that's when you would not have to incur a reduction I I just would think that if you could wait another six months but what I'm trying to say is how free months prior to when you what your benefits to start and I think you'd be spot on because then you wouldn't be\nIncurring I reduction which is going to last\nFor as long as you receive Social Security so I don't think I mean you you got that life in the tunnel you can see the finish line I Would say\nMy goodness unless it's just a a dramatic difference we're just not just so you know I'm ... I mean because you're talking about dollars just a few less than ten dollars a difference on waiting\nThe three months of what you're talking about for the six months so I Would say hang in there girl good job because you're doing a lot better job than most people do because there is a a dramatic difference between how many people file\nFor Social Security when they could first get benefits which is a sixty two versus your full retirement age which in this case for her and most people is a sixty six so hang in there Deb I think you're almost there but I Would definitely wait to your age sixty six in file three months prior to that\nAnd why are you filing three months prior\nBecause that's what the government recommends for them to get their paperwork together so that the benefits would start at that particular time\nOkay so that's a good rule of thumb for everyone then\nYeah that's that's that's whenever you know whenever you want your Social Security benefits to start\nThe foul three months prior now that also applies to I just if why I and inside bar on for Medicare to so a lot of people they may work past sixty five\nBut they may want to file for their Medicare benefits are the only reason why you wouldn't is if you have benefits at your work at your employer that would uh allow you not to have to file for Medicare but those are the two areas Medicare\nAnd Social Security where you'd wanna fall three much products when you went to benefit to start this way\nAnd if you want more information how Social Security plays a bigger role in the overall retirement strategy she's going to have when she steps away from her job as a professor is that something you walk your clients through you put it all together kind of like a puzzle\nYeah because we have software that does all the heavy lifting and just another side park thing is whenever you are going to\nPull Social Security benefits prior to your full retirement age\nYou can only make a certain amount of money or they're going to take either a dollar or a dollar for every two dollars or a dollar for every three dollars so it just depends on when you're going to be filing and where that land you into how far you are close you are to your full retirement so sturdy age so\nAgain yeah we have a lot of calls and for Social Security because it's so convoluted so in in my opinion went on to my workshop I tell people that I think the government has purposely made this confusing so that\nPeople make mistakes and when the stakes it costs them money so yeah we can help people with that we do it all the time and\nWe're on the subject we're dead we're talking about Social Security and what a Social Security you know it's just a privilege that you're able\nTo get your fair share but you contributing to the system as long as you've been working and that's a snapshot last thirty five years and that you've qualified for your ten years or four corners so it's about cash isn't it it's about it's about supplementing your lifestyle in ... retirement that's what it's all about\nIt's about cash flow because it serves as the lifeblood of yours in my retirement existence it's about the distribution\nOf your well back to you isn't it I mean let's call it what it is what will your retirement vision is my question to you will your retirement vision be retirement reality and we're prepared here ... Hopkins associates to help you with that vision right now that's of interest to you\nYou can give me call my name is Joseph ... who's thirty nine years experience you reach me up one eight hundred

over from my previous jobs for all and K and a few other retirement accounts because of taxes I wondered is it okay to keep them where they are or should I Try and move them what do you think I should do\nWe get this lot but Ron there's no there's nothing that says you can't move your money or not move your money and keep it where it's at a we have a little sane and industry and that is if you're no longer with your last job either should your money and frankly\nYou're just a an accounting burden to them they'd rather you move your money someplace else also I always tell people this in my work shops and also on the radio that you know you only have a certain amount of choices in a four one K. as far as where you can allocate your money in about a third of and we see\nAre in target funds and there's nothing wrong with target funds is just did a third of monopolized by target fun so you know\nIt's just a matter of what you want your money to do for you if you want a just an endless amount of choices than we were a command that you transition your four one K. for three before it was four fifty seven money into an IRA self directed and then you have\nEndless amounts of choices I mean hundreds of thousands if you would than just having a in this little box that you have choices which you're four one K. few it and then as far as your eye raiders ... certain you know it if it's a big brokerage house from\nIt it's it's no big deal the reason why a lot of people when they do transition into Texas from another state if you would is like the opportunity the convenience of being able to sit down with someone that's\nFairly close to them that this the privilege of having somebody that\nMaybe in your neighborhood that uh you don't have to call one eight hundred help or one eight hundred Joe or whoever your last broker advisor was\nSo that's the advantage but to consolidate maybe\nThat idea now that you have moved in your when you close your grandchildren you want to concentrate on them and you don't want to have like scarecrow um where you're like in the wizard of Oz where his strong strode all over the place you're straws everywhere bring it all in and we see that a lot of people like to do that as well but you know and there's nothing that says you can't keep your money where it's at\nThe only reason I tell anybody and I'll put to carry out on that is\nThe only reason I promote anybody not\nTo move their money from a four O. one K. into an irate\nIs if you need to borrow the money but then what we find Megan is a lot of companies if you're no longer with the company they don't even let you borrow from any way and just so you know you will pay the interest rate on that loan\nIf that would be the case 'cause it's by law that they have to do that but that would be the only reason I Hope that helps Ron as far as maybe an opportunity to consolidate but there is no reason why you can't keep your money where it's at if you want to do\nJust that I think that's terrific advice especially in today's environment where we see people job hopping a lot more than we used to do you remember friends and family who used to start at a company and then they retired they got the gold watch after Thirty years at that job that happened that much any more people new jobs a lot\nNo you're absolutely right you know when you're describing my dad to the to the tea\nOr he'll be gone I'm six years this November but he retired from General Electric after forty two years and he worked himself up out of the navy up through the warehouse and into sales and he was there for a zillion years is my son says and and he did retire with a gold watch matter of fact ah I Am the benefactor of that\nThat watched that still in my in my I'm sure at home but long story short yeah that's going to be in\nThe history books for for most of our youth during somebody's going to be able to stay around that long even the even the oil and gas which has been you know a great staple for so many people\nIt it's a lot of turnover in our industry or in in Houston area so we got plenty of clients that are in that exact position they were expecting stay for a long time but\nAnd it's a marathon not just a sprint in a long way you're gonna find there's countless forks in your road that can get you get you off track and I would ask you are you on track to reach your desired financial destiny and I can tell you right now most people are not\nAnd if you just take the time is this is what I tell people in the workshop last last word I say\nPlease don't let me care more about your financial future than you do and if you are that person if you do care I'd be more than happy to help you you can reach me right now my name's Joseph ... it's one eight hundred nine to

com while you're there submit the question he may answer it on an upcoming shell you can also learn a lot more about sex and the team when your parents mission retirement\nDot com Joshua right to you from Richmond here's this question\nHere's his question Joseph he says I currently work with an employer where I contribute to a four O. one K. while still working can I take my four oh one K. and transfer it to my life insurance\nNormally no and the reason was because a four O. one K. A. is qualified sons and that means you have\nNot paid any taxes on it because you were able to contribute those funds pre tax through your payroll now if you're over fifty nine and a half years young then you can roll it out you can transfer it\nTo a traditional i._r._a. with out encouraging the ten percent penalty by the Irish so I'm assuming that Joshua ... is over fifty nine\nAnd a half or it wouldn't make a zero sense for you to do anything with the money because remember that not only in hiring the ten percent penalty\nFrom the Irish but you're also happened to incur whatever tax bracket taxation that you're in that particular year so for example if someone is say in a twenty percent tax bracket\nAnd they were younger than fifty nine and a half and they're getting her thirty percent taxation our withdrawal of those funds or before you see Seventy percent of what you own and that is not good in print and buy in in anybody's book if I'm In my opinion so also\nInsurance it doesn't allow qualified money to go in and it come out tax rate the government is not going to let that much about a transition from a to Z to happen so\nMoney going into a life insurance product normally has to be non qualified funds meeting after tax dollars to come out\nTax free because any money comes out of a life insurance product is tax free so it's kinda like when we can use those products just F. Y. and we do this for some of our heart networks clients is we use life insurance as an asset class\nNow he's kind of scratch your head on that well what does he mean by that is because you can contribute a certain amount in a life insurance product\nIn it and if as long as you don't ... it is called modified endowment contract and that acronym is Mick if you don't create a Mac than anything you put into a life insurance product\nWhatever funds come out whether it be alone or a death benefit war means in in a lot of our cases a long term care features benefits come out and all that money comes out tax free but the government's not going to let you put a hundred percent\nTaxable money for it to come out tax free so hopefully that'll help\nOr Joshua but know normally it's not going to be the case where you can take now there are situations where you can slowly take money out of forum Kate pay the taxes on it and then put in a lot of product there's some people do that\nBut that's just you know then you're talking about a lot of extreme and in a lot of people are willing to go through that accounting nightmare so to speak you know\nIt it it's about planning that that is what Josh is trying to do is trying to plan maybe for a an advantage that he might have\nIn his favor in retirement planning you know it's the process\nOf identifying your long term income\nDetermining

the one that normally most people look at and they take because the difference between a gene a plan is basically the premium the difference of the two is basically what you'd be paying extra to get the plan so\nIt just kind of makes sense to just go with the G Plan and that's that's one that most people will do now if you're if you're short on on on your phone is there is a budget that you're
