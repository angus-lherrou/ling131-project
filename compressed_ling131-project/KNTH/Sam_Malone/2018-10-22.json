it and we said let's say ... getting assaulted that you\nWell this is this reminds me of the late Jimmy Roosevelt\nA came to the defense of Social Security Thirty years ago I started don't touch my Social Security and it took off and I think\nDon't touch my Medicare dot com it's going to take up the same way because most seniors ... they pay for this band wherever they've actually paid for this the idea of expanding it to every American is just nuts\nThey're going to take money away from seniors and give it to everybody else and the way they're going to do it is they're going to ration care just like in Canada just like in Great Britain\nAnd it is not a minority position there are Seventy Democrats who have put their name on Medicare for all bill a there is Bernie and I think he's got one third of the Democrats in the Senate I think he's going to run for president on this a Mac is kind of a head of this what's the response spin that don't touch my Medicare dot com\nAmazing we did a
