every little short balls glued to the old Sammy I'll say one time I follow it and come back to the most radio shows\nThe host is the big beautiful microphone boys and the guest is on the phone but today what's\nHashtags corrupt media the president and Republicans what they're saying is that democratic protesters quote an angry mob and wouldn't want to ask you that is you know it is one thing to protest at the same car to do it at the Capitol that isn't done for for generations and frankly some of that tree\nIt's another thing to run senator out of restaurants do their home is that going too far\nI think that it tests rules that there are a lot of people who have very very much a ... what is going on because what is what happened with just having a ton of ... this is not a ...\n... less than ... after that the foreign causing why why they tell us halfway ... before they don't want to hear from you too if we have to hear from you maintain hearing 'cause I don't know if I were having

really didn't answer the question not even close not even close to it and of course all the phone with us Sam alone\nYou know I ... I was at a hotel on you have to agree on what she was on there and watch us and Dana Bash\nI guess was probably said look you got to talk about but dirty people the goblet shot left a knock at like ... you get Spanish law maker which outstretched panic Senate was that was what she probably do the disaster at the\nKennedy Hawaii refused to answer and in that case gave the green light to attacking Hispanic people have started off when they're out in public\nIf she did not say oh my goodness I saw what happened to my coworker Ted Cruz and we don't agree on they he's pro life upper killing all the unborn doesn't matter\nHe's pro Israel I hate Israel but yeah you should respect people and they go out to she didn't answer\nAnd it's just that senator is probably the very small club history hundred and thirty million Americans like a hundred senators they all know each other [noise] she did not take a stand against a hate crime against a cruise\nAnd David that she has her again so this is truly the face of of the the left people who call for biology and rates because they didn't want quick Kavanaugh people who didn't death threats or whatever it's called the threat to the capital family killed his wife with my life\nAnd now they're just sitting there going on now what do we do now I always tell you when it comes to these goggles extremists that what they're doing it all there is a great idea I Know we'll go out and kill Kavanaugh's white yeah and then they look in the ... what the hell of leader ... will storm\nLift after the Supreme Court in thing on the door like not to and then they go home I Know they don't show where they go home if they have all of a park bench that live on or their mother's basement they played for my watch porn\nAnd then they go oh gosh what are we done because America views is the same thing with Hollywood\nThe horrible language and and you feel if you go to Breitbart the horrible language they use on the count against capital then they're like a a and a lot of them will delete it luckily to recapture ripe ripe for all of them will believe it [noise]\nBut look how extreme misbehave ...\nBand member there ... there was not going to be a blue wave before now to Jay peak what the opposite of a wave when they're you know what people says ... ... dollar dead called they called so that I use or even dead because the Democratic party is dead in the eyes\nOf the show ...

basketball coach for a little cautious [noise] um\nYour and the thing that's going on though I think Sam is I think that there are leaders who are probably saying just exactly what you're suggesting but there's a whole bunch of ground grassroots people who you cannot shut off now they are going to keep doing it I think\nLook good and I have a TV camera over because you know these women on their knees on the ground outside of the Supreme Court screaming crying right there was some gal we were watching yesterday and I'm like what can I give a strike\nUncorroborated you're crying and screaming

a corner and you're taping day they will be miserable and they are going to be worse now they're going to turn up their anger and the threats of rape towards that way but it worked for certain Republican senators but now the cameras are on them and it was it like this you know when\nIf you go back to our Clarence Thomas social media and all the TV and all the phone can cameras\nAll the website have daily or we'll emergency it\nYeah and especially since the news media can't seem to stay away from a demonstration even if it's only five people which is usually what it is when they're demonstrating in a place like you said you know they come in with a real tight shot and makes it look like there's a big demonstration going on so they can't stay away from a demonstration but it's going to be one [laughter]\nThat late demonstration on the GOP assault laugh as we saw with a restaurant in this restaurant where twelve\nWell Tampa yeah I don't know\nAbout and because we're televised we should get a shot and Durango and the TV stations were caught in this horrible scandal\nWhich ... people showed up for protests like covered it there of course they got nothing to do with it but if it's twelve pro lifers [laughter] people stand up for the unborn stand up for God will never be covered over this ever so true\nSo having all in all good I Know they're saying oh they'll

George Soros much of the left in this country can not alone in that it's also a Bloomberg now chimes in pretty heavily Tom's dire times in\nA but pretty much every major organization and a lot of them are media organizations are on the left\nAre funded by George Soros they're not funded exclude told me they get lots of money from different people but he pushes a liberal both agenda\nIs not anti Semitic just said that it's not anti Semitic to note that the Koch brothers who are curious about that a lot of the conservative movement which of the people with the money\nIt's important to note that important to note because church does has an agenda he added this open society agenda he'd been pushing for years and when you when you read about George Soros he he's very clear about uh if you take the open society idea to try to quote unquote Asian it's awful\nWho while you're promoting it oh well that's because the key it's ultimately a way of controlling the system where the left gets to sort of remake human society and much like brave new world which he writes about one of his books a woman remake things they're the ones in charge\nWell let me ask you this where's the CBS News so they've been ordered or NBC News said they'd been ordered to not bring up paid protesters in any of this I mean it's getting to be common common knowledge here\nWhich is common knowledge of them that doesn't mean all the protestors are paid a you know that a lot of them are ordinary people but they you have organizers and that was very clear what a liberal journalists telling you hey yeah the organizers ... they're not hiding\nThe organization that are out there putting off these protests and disruptions in you're going to see more and more disruption these are the vote organized groups that by and large get money from your Thoreau says as does a lot of the liberal media for this so called\nA specialized media that's organization ProPublica which if you're active on Twitter or ... or follow a lot of journalism group\nProPublica has gotten through us money Center for American Progress think progress has gotten through my nprcrowdsource my ...

tissue oh that's right we've got a million dollars for this guy\nIs just simply so journey if that's probably call a dirty money to God list take that dirty money and the and then it shows you they're not passionate who paid us okay well we'll go out and support that guy versus those who embrace God's word those who take a moment in prayer to support the Kavanaugh family against the death threats\nThat's that's true grassroots not dirty blood money\nWhy and also remember these important for people to understand George served gave a much of his fortune to his ... charities at the end of last year\nSo they have been estimated twenty three twenty four billion dollars they're gonna they're gonna outlive him there was some talk that he wanted to shut them down when he retired and just
