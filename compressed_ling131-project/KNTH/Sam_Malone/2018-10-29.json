actually believe it's further ahead than that Josh Hawley welcome back to the show my right you're farther ahead in most places in Port points\nWe feel uh we feel very good about it you but we also know that we've got eight days ago and we cannot take anything for granted that it's gonna be a tight race is going to be tied all the way home and we've got to get out there and a while we found that I said\nNo I haven't heard a lot of places in Missouri from St Louis we got a big flame thrower there to cross Jefferson City et cetera so tell people in Missouri specifically or they're still able to do early voting or is that closed\nWhere we are but this traditional absentee voting in Missouri we don't have a we don't have early voting like other states but the traditional as a voting\nAnd a

you know you're you pick a friend with you through the bowls and we're going to need every last vote because it's going to be tied\nDown Josh Hawley it seems to me though that the Democrats are basically folding their tent in Missouri in North Dakota to try and save a boat so there were a casket an awful debate performance she and her ads calling other Democrats crazy Democrats how did that play with their base\nWell you know I I think it does show that the ethical really has read\nThe desperation phase of her campaign I mean you could see that in our debate\nLast Thursday these very angry very frustrated but your ears of thank you her frustration is really it's not with me it's with the voters of this state I mean she has not done what the voters of this they told her to do is not done what he promised them she would do\nAnd they're not happy about it and and that's the problem is\nA role and Martin but it was of course a mental lapse but he's a friend of mine just tweeted out the Claire McCaskill not quote one of those crazy Democrats quote and was one of the dumbest ever recorded in political history she needed a strong energized space in twenty Eighteen her appeal to white rural voters\nWith that ad ticked off black voters if she loses that ad is the reason so you can see right there uh Josh Hawley that\nShe clearly is flailing\nWell I I think there's no doubt about that to me is the is flailing it's a good word or she is she's frustrated she desperate you see is you know let's remember what we saw from the Democrats\nAnd the cabin off we're just a few short weeks ago is that they are willing to stay and do anything in order to regain power and I'm afraid that are McCaskill who was with that mirror every step of the way that is no different than so uh this is really this election as a referendum\nOn what they want to do to our country on their behavior they're just the disgrace that they are carried out with regards to judge Kavanaugh their entire agenda that with this election is about\nNow let's talk a little bit about the the judge Kevin up the confirmation now justice cabinet or a successful confirmation\nClaire McCaskill was invisible uh she didn't she she voted against him and she was invisible because she couldn't figure out what to do what in Missouri and think about that because he's obviously a good man well qualified and he was me or what do they think about her writing from that debate\nOh I I think there appalled by it and I have people say that the all the time they just cannot believe the way that the Kavanaugh was treated they can't believe the way the Senate Democrats the coordinated smear campaign and your rights that are McCaskill\nUh well she went right along with it you should never raise your voice against it but she lets us forget she was in favor of the Democrats sham investigation she was in favor of delaying his confirmation votes so that the circus could go on I mean she's on record for all of those things that she was part and parcel\nOf the whole smear campaign and now she says it's actually said our debate all I didn't have anything to do with that\nThat's nonsense I see what they're every step of the way and I think voters are going to remember\nNow what to talk about the tragedy of this weekend a Josh Hawley when you get to the United States Senate you're going to be in a body that's very deeply divided in a country that is profoundly broken but I think part of the problem is that we're monetize ing hate on television where we've created little corners for
