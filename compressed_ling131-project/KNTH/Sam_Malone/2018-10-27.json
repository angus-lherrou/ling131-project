system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium in their body\nWell that's the thing is that the fish and these are not like I'm going to have a water main break in or you have written notice all things considered drips little leaks here and there and do what we have is that Kim lots of effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late [laughter]\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this comebacks formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I did a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk in my back in ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every join her body being hernia could be in her neck it could be\nIn her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was eighty four years old and a week later\nShe was she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use it with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up and their muscles in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that to such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of ... them in the system well very drugs that are training the conditions that your body and experience and because of the fish and in many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nBusiness and it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose\nMy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's\nOne eight hundred for

hundred for nine eight one two three four nine I remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free so that number to call is one\nEight hundred for nine eight one two three four nine I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for nine eight one two three four nine\nThey just tuned in we're talking with Dr Michael Pincus about stress and the negative effects that everyday stress has on your body whether it's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how your ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress\nAnd I guess this is something everyone should be aware of whether you're twenty four or Ninety four\nWell I used that for many many years as as a younger person and now that I'm aging as well I use the Senate definitely help me sleep better it helps control the stress of the working world and many people will just be amazed how this actually works\nBecause our formula has a chemical reaction occurred before you actually adjusted mhm count Mac is pre dissolve it doesn't get lodged in your system and so what happens is that when people drink the ...\nIt's like an infusion into your body it's like why like compress it and so people who are in pain they take the comments the calcium magnesium gets into the muscles and it starts to relax it\nDr biggest you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate\nA bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy levels\nGood question because energy like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS fibromyalgia like well I think people out and that's the key to low energy and a lot of it's caught by feeling all your joints don't move well it's kinda wife's you out\nIt drains your energy and then then you get tired and you go to sleep ... you don't\nKnow I'm telling you like counter scenarios total lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the ... in the first thing that happened it take twenty minutes before you go to bed and you get a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed energy comes back\nIs killing me safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\nAt any rate when you turned Seventy it gives you some perspective and life well mostly in the rearview mirror yeah but nonetheless perspective is almost always a valuable tool if used correctly [noise]\nAnd I wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on those lessons as part of the board seafood outdoor cooking show today [noise]\nFirst of all the yeah being an old DJ yard pollen from Vancouver strong mind way by Frank Sinatra written by Paul and can kick should you know and one of the line from ... regrets I've had a few but then again to future mention\nIn my case I picked out after all member learn a little bit and say regret so I've had a few but then again too many dimension in a one hour radio show [laughter]\nCome on man anybody who's lived Seventy years and claims that they don't have enough regrets even mentioned that person is either lying to you or wind to themselves or both\nI mean we all share a dump truck full of regrets in large numbers I couldn't possibly even remember them all much less a list of ...\nSuffice to say I just pray that my good deeds outweighed my mistakes in my family and somehow whole bedroom to present day I can reflect the love of God every day\nThen the second thing that occurs to me in hindsight on my show to be your birthday he's the value of faith and family and friends in life\nYou know we said those three things so much that they almost become a cliche after a while they'll pay but when I was a young man I most certainly took all of those things for granted and if I could offer just ... piece of advice to the younger generation\nIt would be this do not allow life to get in the way of the things that will matter most to you when you reach my age\nI mean I can lift off the number of clearly amazing accomplishment semi broadcasting career that candidly I never could have even imagine when I started in this business at the age of Fifteen\nBut at this point in my life the age of Seventy those achievements those awards they're not the most meaningful things I Want to be remembered for\nFor instance one of the most important people in my life as you well know Bible urban Graham's son Liam and I know my time with him is limited oh we don't get me wrong I don't expect that died in the next two days or two weeks or two months or even two years but our mind among the and the next two minutes\nAnd I must admit at the age of Seventy I spend a good deal of time thinking about how Liam will remember me for the rest of his life\nMy maternal grandfather made a huge impression on me as a child but he died when I was only twelve now I Hope I can live long enough to see what kind of band lead them becomes unlike my grandfather\nBut just in case I don't I Want to leave him with a solid memory of who I Am I I guess more importantly what I Am and I'm sure my kids will regalia him with the stories of my successes in broadcasting heck I even wrote a book about it so we could read all about two and of course I'm proud of those things\nBut what I really want Liam to recall about me is what I recall about my grandfather\nHow much he loved me what a high priority he placed on being a positive influence in my life\nNow I Hope my children feel the same way and I'm pretty sure they do but Liam opinion of me is even more vital to my since ... legacy if you will\nBecause my children are by short term connection to the future but Liam is long term connection to the future if that makes sense\nSo if all of them can say yeah ... was a good man he loved me like nobody else then I guess I'll feel like I achieved the ultimate goal in life out the architect\nWow I didn't mean to get all bought load on your here I'm not planning on shuffling off this mortal coil anytime soon as the bard would say but you never know and I just wanted to make sure there was an official record of how I feel [noise]\nLet's get on to more uplifting saying shall we like the topic for today's edition of the board seafood out or a cooking show more food for sports watching parties you know we just simply didn't have enough time to fully discuss the subject of just one hour last week so we're going to stretches out into two shows\nNow we talked to a lot about main dishes for sport tortured parties last week but we didn't spend much time on snacks or munchies\nIs there anything more all American and chips and dip into sports watching party you know if you lay out some really good corn tortilla chips and a lot of different kinds of depth you might get away with not having to do anything else at all run [laughter]\nI don't know about you but I've never been brave enough to try to make my own salsa but I Know some people who do and I did see a good recipe for guacamole this week obviously you want to start with fresh off the coast\nAnd don't just do support to mash them user potatoes mash or but leave him a little bit chunky first\nThen mixing your ingredients this recipe had lots of freshly squeezed lime juice one medium sized to yellow onion very finely chop one man's garlic close to serrano to he's also very finely chop cilantro do I need to say very finely chop again [laughter]\nSome extra virgin olive oil kosher salt and fresh playground pepper my wife's a stickler for that\nWhen you put all those things and then use the potato mash or again to really smooth that out there this part is really important you put some plastic wrap tight over the top so it doesn't get brown and refrigerate the whole thing for at least an hour before you serve it so that all those are greedy and skin kind of blend together\nAnd another really good they're put a lot of people in this part of the country lovers chili can case so so do you ever make your own from scratch yeah me neither [laughter]\nYou know I started to read an article about how to create homemade case from scratch but they were talking about things like I'm making a new evaporated milk corn flour cornstarch sour cream mayonnaise a whole bunch of other stuff it sounded way over my pay grade\nSo I think I'll just stick with the process cheese and the grocery store\nCan anybody say they'll be there\nBut I think the key is what you add to it to make it your own right so we like to use garlic white onions and tomatoes and jalapeno ... let's say if together very finely chop [laughter]\nBut I also like to throw in some Cuban garlic powder onion powder some fresh cilantro right at the last minute but again\nThe key is to refrigerate that there for at least an hour before you serve it you can really heated if you want to serve it warm but refrigerated allows all those ingredients to kind of joke together my mother used to serve a cold and I loved it that way now choosing your chips is also a very important step\nAnd here's a really good tip I heard this past week stick the chips in your warming drawer if you have one or if you don't just preacher of at a hundred and sixty degrees and put the chips in for about a half an hour it'll make a Mormon keep them crispy a lot longer\nAnd one of the reasons why we want to do another show on this topic is we've never really found time to talk about finger foods last week like devil the eggs [noise]\nMy mother speaking of my mother my mother always loved by Donald eggs I remember her scooping out the heart of the hard boiled egg making the yoke paced\nWith Mayo and vinegar and mustard and salt and pepper she talked with a little paprika and they're great with sliced do pickles on the side that kind of it the hamsters the flavor just a little bit and speaking of ... have you ever tried to do fried pickles yeah me neither [laughter]\nUh so if you got to get a recipe for that send it in a private message to our Facebook page the outdoor cooking show\nHow 'bout pot stickers oh\nThat sounds like brain surgery done this but I'd love to try and some day you know when I've got all day long to screw it up and I still have time to call for pizza delivery of the last minute\nSo today on the board seafood outdoor cooking show it's more food for sports watching parties\nAnd before we get to our guests and the rest of our show I also wanted to wish a happy birthday to buy a beautiful bright of forty five years Cindy who also celebrated her birthday this past week too [noise]\nYes I Know it's hard to believe but our birthdays\nActually do fall within three days of each other and I won't be telling you how old she is [noise] my my ideal but I'm not stupid stupid stupid least out more\n\nYour ...

plus fresh dead and shrimp Shannon squid\nPlus boys has tackled galore ice in ice chests and cold drinks and snacks\nI don't know I I think it's ... you know again come from a family where we've always when we prepare our smoked sauces we just boil it\nYou know it's kind of an old school way of doing it but she don't to me it doesn't take any extra flavor from the grill or anything like that you just get to taste the sausage that think being creatures of habit we just kind of a role that same style of cooking sausage into our hotdogs and that's how we did our house\nPretty simple quick and easy\nAnd you don't split open the skin\nAnd you don't split openness yeah where are you at least you can see it coming if you're getting close to it [laughter]\nWell let's talk about wings for a

I've got services I got a value it may be worth a thousand dollars would you look at the bitcoin and when you look at it how much is valued in the u._s. currency and the ... US Currency\nThat maybe a thousand dollars worth of income to you and then you got a thousand dollar\nCost in this bitcoin then I bought a ... whole bitcoin for ever I don't know\nWhat do I do with this okay I've got a transaction I either got traded I got to buy something else with it I've got to get it out of my hand some way shape or form\nSo then I got a trans acted out and so then so I've got to send that out\nYou know and uh I've got potentially a capital gain or loss all this holding period because unless I sell at the same day or or get rid of it the same day that are receiving\nA it's got to go up or down there by you and people are saying yeah these bitcoin you the values are are they jump around quite a bit and they do it's similar to like what happens if you were buying or got paid in Japanese yen or\nEuros or something like that when you trends acted back into dollars and get it back into the U.S fee odd then you're going to have a capital gain transaction you know short term less hell less than a year course and then more than one years long term capital gains so you have both ordinary income and then you have a capital gain\nOh my gosh you know this is getting complicated Marcus is really getting out of a wow you know stuff like that and you can see the problems that arise with it and then of course we talked about for services if you had services are independent contractor self employment income so\nYou know it's going to be informed to you so you just can't bury it or you know just oh I just got paid the bitcoin well\nNow are is definitely find me you know it's just like a cash transactions are just ... bitcoin you pay me so much in bitcoin and then I went off in and bought something on the Internet with bitcoin and you know who who's who's

forms that they have now be aware that those are just ... they have not come out and final form yet they will probably come out for about another month and final form so we're all in the drafting\nError uh but you can go look at the ... on the ten Irish dot com you know Irish dot Gov backslash grass and you could look at the ...\nAfter the forms that I've already looked at a bar looked at the at the draft and uh you know it's gonna be a radical change for a lot of people and so you need to look at it and so you can't pull it down but be aware that those are similar just drafts and they're subject to change in to\nUpdate so uh do do take 'em to town or anything like that until the fall of orange come out probably the final four and still come out until December and so that's when you'll get the actual final four\nAnd I have a ... or you have a I Believe that a whole ... kernels yeah quite straightforward overly complicated but I think like we are courting bon ... and all that kind of\nUm yeah so you know they should have some some of that is out there for a guy I don't think the the interest of the crude interest or in the bud premiums are really were a lot of changes in that area so that that's probably one that's probably been left alone\nThe compared to last year so it's going to be a whole lot of changes in that area so you could probably start looking at that right now and not looking at a whole lot of changes there\nThat you're okay\nAll right David thanks for the call appreciate it this is mark lego with taxing times we'll be right back we're

were in our final phase of the segments this morning\nBut if you have a tax question you can also always email us at ... at least the K. L. A. W. at S. M. A. R. K. C. P. A. dot com or\nEmail us your questions or cause it to a one for six nine twenty four forty four leave us your questions and we may be able to answer your questions on your show so give us a call or\nEmail us so we're talking about taxes but crypto currency\nCouple of more issues on there were going through there but we were talking about non taxable events and there's another time taxable event and it's called what is called the definition of part forks and you go mark what is hard for the cryptic crispy\nAnd all that is thinking of stock split is just one\nSingle cryptic grocery splits do to win a cryptic currencies existing when they they changed the code and they did a people disagree and they are the people who handle this or maintain this\nDisagree on the future code on this and has to be valued and it results in both an old and a new version\nAnd so you it's it's just like a stock split is all it is or what you hear a heart for just like oh stocks with okay that's what it is so that's what it is like for example\nBitcoin split into bitcoin cash okay\nTwo different ones so there's two different ones and so there's disagreement about developers and so they come up\nWith this and so you have this and you could have bitcoin and then you have been going in you have been caught in cash and you go oh my God what am I going to do value of this so the value of that new bitcoin cash could be zero or you could allocate your costume basis\nYou know just like you do have our socks split the to the old coin in the new point and so all the virtual currency and so that's how it could be tracked for you and so and then of course we got capital gains and losses when you sell the thing so you know there's a whole bunch of things you're going on within the you know we talked about business but the conclusion is well what\nIs the problem with all this and the the deal is is if you receive or by or transactions is that you're gonna have to have detailed and meticulous records keeping of each transaction to record ... problems gates audit\nAnd a ... report these transactions cameras ... noses and tax deficiencies on your tax return so anyway so you know information can now be obtained from third parties concerning your transactions\nIn this so no ... just going to say well it's below the radar nobody's going to know what I'm\nDoing with this and uh well not true so it's similar to the foreign bank account detectives over a few years ago so what'd you need to do is sort of\nBe aware of it out there if you're not involved with it and you're going what's the rage with all this I heard about it and every now and how's it going to impact me well one day you know if you're involved in business or anything like that you could be\nSubject to this and are receiving payments in this or I offered payment and this and so it could be something that you're all of a sudden thrust into and you're saying oh what what am I doing here and how is it impacting me so you know when you're knowing about that\nGetting some knowledge and knowing about it even\nThough you're not out there now there's some people that are actual ... getting into it and actually going out there by getting trends acting it then trading and\nAnd dealing with it will need to do due diligence as well go out to your people who are trading in this make sure you understand the transactions understand how the trading mechanism works just like trading with the stock or any other type of\nA investment that you're doing to your due diligence make sure that you understand how your uh getting involved with all this and then\nWhen you get older and you're comfortable and you start doing all the training or all the trans acting then you need to sit down with your federal tax attorney or a CPA or whoever's handling your taxes\nWeek if he's been helping people plan for retirement right here in the Houston metro for more than three decades he loved the chance to help you as well if you're inching closer to retirement you're feeling overwhelmed let just have Hopkins help you here's the phone number eight hundred nine to five\nThirty one thirty sects again eight hundred Ninety five\nThree one two three sex and you can always find him on line and go to Michigan retirement dot com does a great to be back\nWith you and you to make it how you been girl doing well each week you answered questions from our listeners and this week's no different we are going to get to it I have a stack of questions are you ready I'm ready to grow just go All right let's get him\nGoing our first question comes from Linda she writes to you from great ... and she said this she says Joseph is there a good rule of thumb for how much of my IRA should be invested in safe investments at age sixty or is it really just a matter of personal preference\nWell Linda I Would say it's personal preference but here's a a rule that we kind of go by sometimes it kinda brings it to the attention to the client in and then also has a bearing on how long do you think you're still gonna work\nSo Linda sixty she may be in the range of maybe I don't know maybe she wants to retire sixty two but if you're within that two years or even sixty five you're within that financial red zone but there's a thing called a rule when hunter what it means is you take your age and you see truck it by a hundred and that's how much you should have\nIn risk so in other words you your age is always going to be safety that amount of your person as your portfolio that shouldn't be safe so long story short if I'm sixty than the the ratio says sixty percent of my hundred percent portfolio should be in\nIn in in a entities that are safe meaning that they cannot lose now there's a there's a you know a host of things that would\nCategorize that safety but for example CDs or you have a bonds most likely that are going to be very very lightly and risk but that could be part of the eighty twenty\nSixty forty type of portfolio um percentage difference so\nThat's the ratio rule of one hundred so it depends on how long are you going to work because you can be a lot more aggressive\nWhen you're bringing her paycheck and you have money invested but when you retire in all the money you have\nLeft as what you've a mass you want to be a little more cautious of more prudent and how you invest it\nThat's really good advice oh tell me again that's called the rule of one hundred\nRule one hundred you can Google it\nThat's a good rule of thumb and I know you're not a huge rule of thumb guy because you're always telling me each person's different do you have a situation where\nThe real one hundred doesn't work and someone's risk tolerance is a lot different than that\nOh shoot far yeah I mean it it's it's the snowflake does some print you know everybody is different so you know I like I was talking to someone the other day and I said okay you know about the rule and hunters who knows what good would show it to him and he goes well that's interesting but that has nothing to do with me because I\nHave no intention of letting off the gas pedal so he was more like a more of a Seventy thirty or even a Seventy five twenty five\nEquities to bonds when you when you always hear about the first percentage by the way\nWhich is you know ... ... six sixty\nSixty forty to sixty is equities in the forty would be bond son fortunate part about the bonds story lately is they haven't been performing whatsoever so um that's a that's another scenario that you need to talk about how can you improve the the the lagging side of your bond portfolio but that's what we're talking about when talking about the percentage\nIt's the equities first and then the the uh alternatives that you would\nAnd this is great advice because I Know a lot of people wonder about that and my two at risk for my age and boy if people are listening out there and you haven't made any adjustment steer investment since you started investing twenty twenty five thirty years ago\nThere were overdue for over an adjustment aren't they just that\nThey are and this is what we're always stressing the show you know it's all about a plan in sometimes it takes a professional you know someone who knows what you need now how am I going to know what you need we're going to sit down and have a conversation we're going to situate your portfolio we're going to understand what is what is your intention what is your you\nKnow and your timeline on how long you're going to continue to work and then we'll put some numbers into a software program and that gives me the opportunity to bring you back some value and say okay look this is what the software program said that if this is the amount of money you need and this is how much money you're going to continue to make until you\nYou leave or retire and then we're going to stress test it and then we hit the magic button and it tells us if you were going to have any problem red line we it actually is a red line by the way\nIf you're going to run out of money and my point is there there is is if you stand a chance to run out of money when when when when would you want to know you want to know sooner or later obviously so to make sure you're not missing out on opportunities that you can have someone help you and possibly create you this\nThis customized plan that can guarantee you are pretty much assure you that you would not run out of money that's what we do for a living my name is Joseph ... almost have forty years experience in this one I'm here to help you you can reach me at one eight hundred\nNine to five three one three six again the number one eight hundred nine to five thirty one thirty six\nAnd he had a great website does that I Want to share that with our listeners its mission retirement dot com\nAgain mission retirement dot com and if you'd like to submit a question head over to that website and you'll find a place to submit your question just including your name and your town and we just might answer your question on an upcoming show oh just the speaking of questions I have another\nThis is from Dwayne in cinco ran she says just how wise is it to count on an inheritance as part of my retirement plan unless something goes horribly wrong I'll be getting a significant amount of money from my mother which would more than cover my income needs in my later years\nI don't want to rely too heavily on that money but I also don't want to save so much now that I Can't enjoy my present life\nAnd then end up with more than I Need when I'm Seventy five\nHow do you feel I should approach that\n[noise] well it's a broad stroke I I Can't really comment because I don't know how much he's a mass but you know what here's my thought process\nI'm always about you know if you have anything coming down the pike because when we do a risk assessment it has a question that says do you expect any inheritance so we can we can take that into consideration but you\nKnow I I don't like the fact that if you're letting off the gas or if you're over spending in your lifestyle right now with the understanding that you're going to have this you know windfall of money come down the pike for um\nKnow your hair inheritance um than that just it it's wrong and that and I say that that's just me because here's my point I\nHave kids I don't want them to be elected they can cause through life knowing that they're going to get this windfall money\nFrom their dad and mom whenever we passed away I Want them to be as successful as they possibly can to be as as as educated they need to be to get to the point where they are self sufficient and I surely don't want them to think that they can run through whatever they get\nBefore they get what they are going to get from their mother and I so I don't know I I I Would say be very cautious I Would say make sure that you're not living beyond their means is that we're really gets out of out of whack because if they're living beyond their means and then what a thing\nIt just didn't come down like they thought maybe their mother in this case his mother gets in a situation where she has all timers\nAnd see that's the killer Sheila most people today is their parents they're living longer and that what that means inevitably is they're shooting up their inheritance because if here's the problem Ninety five percent of seeing America as they they don't have any long term care\nRight the money going to come to come from your state I Would assume\nRight and that's why a lot of my clients they'll step in and they'll start\nPaying the expenses for their parents because inevitably debt is going to be their hair's ... so they can try to you know kind of stick some fingers and toes and the damn to keep it from exploding so that's why I say you know you know it'd be great for you to get inheritance and congratulations if you're going to get one\nBut be very cautious because until you really know the number I wouldn't be spending her money before you know if you can you know last on your own\nAnd that sets such good advice because the the future is unknown so plan for that rainy day\nIt is in the ... as I said my workshops what is our ultimate unknowable after folks what is it you know we can talk about all the subjects but what is one thing we don't\nKnow and that is how we live how long you get to have quality of life because there's so many people out there they're living but they're not living they don't have quality of life so\nIn the problem is most people don't have long term care so my attitude and there is I don't care if you have long term care or not but what's your plan B and please don't let it go live with your daughter in law that really can't stand you anyway you know [laughter]\nSo it's about it's about a plan and that's what we're always talking about on the show you know the most critical component\nOf any retirement game plan it's\nHaving an income plant because it's about transitioning the money that you said into\nSome kind of coverage is you're you're putting a lot of pressure on any level is and that's just not fair you know and when it comes to your financial future coming up short in any of these areas I'm Talking about\nIt it's it's it's just negligence and and I think it's because we are so busy with life you know that we let it get in a way but these are important things you got ... put your foot down and say by golly I'm going to do some ... right now and I'm going to give you that opportunity\nTo get sit down with a fishery someone's got over thirty nine years experience that would give you your best\nShot at what is going to solve your situation in the most prominent way you know you can do that but you may call right now just have Hawkins and one eight hundred nine to five three one three six again that's one eight hundred nine to five three one ...\nDon't forget that website it's mission retirement dot com and the mission retirement\nDot com that's the way you can submit your questions for just after it had on over kind of mission retirement that Tom\nHere's a question from Dinah she right then and says my husband is thinking about retiring from a major Houston area company in the fall\nShe did he take the lump sum option or the pension were not big risk takers with our money but we lie to last as long as we do so jealous of what's your advice\nWow this is kinda scary because I'm working with somebody right now for the ... and the major company they're returning from is Exxon which is a gigantic ... complex out there's beautiful but in any way maybe there were maybe it's the same company\nThey might be I mean 'cause it's a you know when you think of a major company in the ...\nAnd and there's a lot of oil money out there that you think of Exxon 'cause they just ... just finished this phenomenal facility but anyway\nI'm working with someone right now and they're going through this exact scenario but the difference is he says he's six and retire my client unfortunately is getting an offer from somebody so that being said\nI had to sit down with them and they brought in the the data the the offers if they are being given by the company in its pages and pages and pages of different scenarios I had to share with everybody you know I feel like in almost forty years I feel like the pension\nOpportunities out there their flaws and let me tell you why because\nIf you don't live long enough\nAnd you could surely choose spouse or a continuation in and I think you should\nIf you love your wife and you've been married for a long time and you want to make sure that their lifestyle or there's your spouse that matter is taking care of beyond your ... your life then you're going to choose spouse the continuation my point is is\nIf you or your wife don't live long enough to capture the amount that you could take in a lump sum\nThan you lift money on the table for other pensioners to appreciate because for example let's just say you're two or three years on your pension and God Forbid something happened to you in a drunk driver what she both out so then you just left\nI mean 'cause when we're talking about is one million one thousand dollars that's the one we're ... and if they didn't\nTake enough of their pensions through the years to equal or surpassed a million one thousand dollars then they left money in the pitchers pool for other pitch nurse and you know what that's great but you want to be able to have your money\nHanded down to your loved ones so the only way to build a to guarantee that is to take the lump sum however once you take the lump sum then it's a matter of recreating that\nOpportunity on the private side not on the company's side and we do that all the time we do it through your I raise a lot of times but the point is is your kitchen was a gift from God you know why because you contributed nothing to get it\nIt was a complete hundred percent contribution from the company so\nWithout being selfish in greedy you need to turn it around\nAnd put it in a place where would offer you that lifetime income stream the difference is that God Forbid if you did pass away both you or your spouse by the way\nPrematurely before your time you know whatever that time is would be how much you calculate that monthly pounds how many years to equal you're you're a lump sum if you\nHappen to pass away for that than the remaining money does go to your loved ones and that's the way you want to address it and that's the way you want to arrange it because when it comes to your retirement assets and how you may be able to increase the money you're gonna be able to go forward even down the road which is called inflation\nYou need a plan you need to income plant and you know what you don't know what you don't know and that's what we're here for\nSo give me call today my name's Joseph Hopkins you can reach me one eight hundred

about another question\nWas go All right this one from Dirk in New territory he says I have a financial conflict that I'm struggling with\nI'm fifty five years old and I tied to my church ten percent of my net pay I'm investing six percent of my gross pay into my four oh one K. because that's all my employer contributes do you think I should put more toward my four oh one K. and the last to charity\nI have only saved up two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars in my four oh one K. I'm getting worried that I have not saved enough\nIs did we find out what dirt age was yes the fifty five\nO fifty five okay I'm Sorry okay fifty five so\nDepending on how long he's going to work his full retirement Social Security agency fifty five now is going to be sixty seven so that being said if he was gonna work anywhere close to his four term it's still pretty age he's still got another eleven years\nI think you still have plenty Tom I personally this is my own religious beliefs that I Would never short my tithing um it's your money that um he's loans you so I wouldn't short got on that um and I'm also about if you can afford to contribute more to your\nFour one K. than I and in saving money on the taxes and and that's one thing you'd probably want to put pencil and paper or rented three re char if you increase your contribution to your four one K. than how much how much less is that going to bring home but how much is that going to save you in taxes\nAnd and that's because we have a new tax um law this year in two thousand Eighteen that's going to save you some money you have for example you have a twenty four thousand dollars the introduction as a\nMarried filing filing jointly\nOr where it was just twelve six before so you can make some more money and not pay taxes on those monies in what we're finding with our tax\nWorkshop that a lot of people are not aware of that there are actually surprising in their over shooting their\nTax bracket in other words they come in and they think they're in a twenty four percent tax bracket twenty two percent tax bracket and they're only sixteen so you know if you know that stuff up front\nHere's another thing I'm a no fly no we're like a crab but ... it with our workshop we have found a lot of people especially the ones that are prior to Seventy and a half that you have a phenomenal opportunity to start taking some of your money out of your four one K. senior I raise if you're over\nFifty nine and a half and and basically not pay any taxes on it now\nA it's a scenario where you're most likely not going to be competing with a salary but anyway you have an opportunity before you're forced to take money out which is a RMC Seventy and a half years young", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sam Malone", "city": "Houston", "day": "27"}
