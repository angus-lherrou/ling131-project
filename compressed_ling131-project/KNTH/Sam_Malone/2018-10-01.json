have dinner with them so we're talking about doing that I Am deeply deeply disappointed in that\nHe did not rise to the defense of judge Kavanaugh's anger\nBecause he's a dad like I Am and I

and the pressure oh Trump brought us through brink of a disaster and that was all went on blaster and he didn't really achieve anything and you know what is this all about him you read the CNN\nYou know a report this morning about it if it's clear that it's like there's nothing really big and you know in the end of the day it's a significantly different from NAFTA no knowledge not but it does it does ... more in America ...\nCalling us from Canada will now\nPay you know they'll buy more of our stuff that'd be good for American workers I'm I'm very pleased with the result here you know I think that's just positive for all three countries but especially the United states and I like the way you put it there was a reason they called us she yeah may because he left his first year\nThey are you going to use that on CNN when you go on\nA you know I'd probably do something you know I think the price of having a press conference and eleven eastern yeah we'd be all in a few hours and and ah well see you know it's a beautiful day here in Washington so have gotten the rose garden and I'm probably be out after that\nWell here's a here's this is CNN is is corrupt the news is I knew worker but this is my opinion a headline us and Canada reached dealer NAFTA after talks go down to the wire wait any straw to deport paragraph\nSome experts question whether the changes to NAFTA where were the strain put on her right were or where to put on relations with\nCanada no there was a stream put on Canada no who cares\nYeah exactly that's ... that's ... and you're going to see now from the media that says\nOh little we about nothing\nYou know there are a lot of very happy dairy farmers there are a lot of happy ranchers and so on that that are going to be able to shop more than ...\nBoth sides of the border that's a positive thing and and you know like the big thing now where does this has now\nI'm now ... and I'm very very strong position with respect to of course China China has always been the bad actor on the international scene they're the ones that\nYou know cheat and steal we've talked about this many times I think Trump has has got himself and I'm really good position right now to demand some very very substantial reforms\nIn terms of the abuse of trade practice with the camera as Chinese as and you know that and you're talking about you know tens tens hundreds and hundreds of billions of additional uh American out quite\nWell and and you know ... and I just want to see one reporter be in one form in Iowa because this is going to allow our farmers greater access to Kansas dairy market so I just want to see one now all out or they're not allowed\nNot on CNN MSNBC not on the network right I Want to see one reporter I Do that we were to be a big deal I mean\nWe have a we have we have the lowest we're the best dairy farmers in the world you know so we have for our dairy farmers more productive than Canada is there a farmer so that's why they have to protect them and you can't have a free as Trump's at what's the point of having a free trade deal if they impose two hundred and three percent terrorists you\nKnow it's it's a big win it's a big win for America and the dirty and people in the newsrooms will not go out to the farm like Steve Moore dairy farm in Des Moines Iowa and ... and say Steve\nYou eat the Canadian markets are even more open today than they were under Brock Hussein you're going to this is great um hire more people buy more tractors you know whatever\nAnd then having a you know that the reason that this is so Sam that that's just such an important thing is it's it's another\nDomino that has fallen for Trump and a positive direction so people have asked me you know what is it the tropics down that's created the flow shifts recovery and it's not any one thing it just puts in our first it's the tax cut his new deregulation at any rate you know it's it's all American energy I mean every little thing that he does that pushing America\nIn this positive direction we're going to get four percent of the third quarter that's two straight quarters of ... percent growth I mean you know the leftist running out of

I'm a buffalo\n[laughter]\nSo they're the Texans go one in three they don't pay the cowboys a Sunday night it was a Sunday night\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned the advise and consent process into a search and destroy a mission\nThese allegations are completely an supported by any of it as what evidence there is thirty six year old ... falls court judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh air argument of\nCourse was that doctor for an ass have is held in confidentiality and if they tried to do that and that's what it was what\nLet me let me let me know not not John let me talk to you about that let me talk to your listeners about your views about that there is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could show that letter Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI and could have discreetly conducted this inquiry in July and August without betraying misfortune confidence it and they have the White House\nThey pointed her lawyer assigned to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge those lawyers have to face a D.C bar investigation and missed their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff\nIs going to face an investigation for why they leak that\nThis is uh Sam alone show run to you by sealing radio Houston and science will new media on AM ten Seventy and asked them one of the three three the answer\nOur tuition and that's all people are both in about to the point where I literally unplugged on Friday after Jeff Flake did whatever you did who knows they made it got Polaroid of them\nWould image and riding boots and he was like oh the stall meanwhile the court starts today with eight justices so I literally unplug from friday I think at three o'clock\nTo before and then I came in this morning I was I was so frustrated let me get to our good friend congressman Ted Poe to see what he was doing while while this was all going on he represents the fighting second congressional district which is the Houston area and it curbs round up to like king what area judge happy Monday\nMorning seems like a a Jack Nicholson in one flew over the cuckoo's nest that's kind of the way I feel some things going on in Washington You're probably not young enough to our old enough to remember on who to over the cuckoo's nest\nNow is what movie I was born in Ninety eight so [laughter] I'm twenty I'm very very young for this job or whatever I probably am twenty but anyway judge what the heck happened up there were first of all where were you\nWhen ... came back and wrote a grenade into the Supreme Court nomination process where are you watching it or were you busy what we're doing\nA I Would not watching it I was in a course in Washington but uh um that was\nUm [noise] but you just never know what's gonna happen up their hit\nA ... and and this whole process uh people have gotten completely out of control and I think the system has Tom Cotton get said we've got to get back to following the rules of confirmation of Supreme Court\nNominees and this and it's not even follow in their own rules and and very quickly if something comes up about a nominee uh\nIn the\nSenate investigators on both sides Republicans and Democrats approach to nominate\nTalk to the nominee and then talk to the uh the Senate and all that studying confidentiality because of the the fact that some of these allegations are unfounded no kidding and that didn't happen in this process or the Democrats quickly hit the evidence evidence that we wouldn't put up with\nSomething like that in right in a criminal court I wouldn't have put up with it as a judge\nAnd the evidence to the very last minute and try to do a gotcha on having though they didn't follow their own rules\nAnd that should have had that the investigation all done by the time this uh the hearing came before the full Senate committee but they they didn't follow those rules so they throw a monkey wrench and everything and and then break with his\nUm [noise] I'll vote for him now but I may not vote for him later because we want more investigation I'm just trying to the light now when it's best to ... the north and the Democrats are going to say they're gonna say oh we need to investigate these new allegations\nThat binge drinking allegation that that may have come out over the weekend and so they don't want to follow the rules of procedure I think that what we what the Senate should do is I think what they're going to\nGo this week investigate these other allegations turn that information over to everybody in the in the Senate and then they have a boat and have the vote next week in or even the following Monday\nThe horse and ride it that's a boat\nAnd you know and here's the other thing to a congressman Ted Poe from the fighting second congressional district or good friend for many many many years I'm ... now the Supreme Court is in motion and they're up there with with eight justices right so if you come before the Supreme Court aren't you kinda like hey I paid for an item only get maybe\n[laughter] ... finally feel free to use that next radio interviewer [laughter] hey lie [laughter] well and and what that does is\nTo overrule a a a have a finding that that's been the Supreme Court then had their one short so if a if there's a four four decision on any lower case then the decision stand\nOr whatever the lower case would have been so there's a tie a the tide goes to the lower court or the\nThe winter in the lower court which would have been the circuit courts that's important that they have they have not of course the Democrats don't ... don't ever want a Republican conservative\nAnd as she has said they're going to do any writing\nAnything to keep Kavanaugh and really any other\nNominee of the president from being confirmed they have in barest shameful ie the system or that we have and confirmation of a candidate but they want to win you know they want to win at any price\nThe power is more important to them than justice and I think we are seeing that\nYes trainer congressman Ted Poe for from the fighting second congressional district in Houston but when you think about looking at other person can a real strong Christian man strong roof strong values wonderful family man\nOr who the heck wants to be up for this the next time like who would they would go a congressman bogus we'd like to nominate you hang up [laughter]\nWho wants to do who wants to put their family through this\nAnd that is the real tragedy of the whole situation is because we have\nA ... there are there are many many great qualified men and women who could serve as federal judges and but they you know there may hesitate to not me I'm not going up there before those people\nIn Washington DC or because they don't want to ... it's not worth it to them\nAnd and and remember the Supreme Court people and federal judges there are there are such good\nQualified attorneys many of them most of them could make and do make a whole lot more income or be in and out in private practice they might be a federal judge so you're right\nThere there are people won't hesitate that and I don't think I'll do that I think I Will do something else that got run for Congress you know they may what\nType of Congress you can get away with anything [laughter] are you are in it\nIf you were Fifteen or sixteen years old and you got drunk or I don't know what you did um automatic like something you'd in battle you shouldn't be like a a cut off like if you weren't old enough to buy cigarettes you shouldn't be held accountable for what you did\nWrite [laughter]\nEven out you know things that happen to have the juvenile uh [noise] they should uh you know there there's a there's a time limit on how that can be used against you people people know about it but rather let's make a decision okay let's just let's vote on this rather than keep\nContinuing to harp on a any attack that they can come up with whether it's true or not most of those we we will never know\nBut it's time to vote you know Kevin O's given his side\nOr the professor has told her side\nWe that's the basic evidence and Kevin Oh I think a a\n... has the the the right to have the Senate vote on his confirmation or not get it done could pull on it but it but I think the Democrats like I said Democrats are going to want to proceed polo prolonging even further edited the FBI comes up with this whatever they come up with anything\nAnd final question as those that to me like how do you disapprove an event that didn't happen how to disprove and you said on the bench as a judge judge judge judge how [laughter] how how how ... D O T H hopped off one disprove something that didn't take place\nYou can't you cannot prove a negative or it's impossible to prove a negative so you you have to listen to\nA what evidence do you do have you have to people here and there there's a there's other people involved but\nYou have basically the the testimony at the statements that two people and examine that quickly uh our academic carefully and decide who\nIs actually correct and I think ah ah ... probably to me that scenario is she a professor believe this happened to her believes these two guys are the ones that were involved in that\nAh let's see let me throw scroll down there are some girly man a Trump praised the agreement early this morning as a great deal but ready but some experts questioned some expert whether that changes to NAFTA are worth the strain put on relations with Canada\nOh no we put a strain on a relationship actually we just walked off the right [laughter] oh no you mean we won't get any more\nUh hockey [noise]\nThey find this pilots to give give us a quote but it's like put a strain on our relations with Kevin shut up quote we're really hurt relationships with our major ally for the sake of a few gallons of milk [laughter] oh my gosh pots\nAnd then the memory was brought to saying the man who sits when ... who won the weakest most humiliated man who never had a girlfriend come forward and say yeah I dated him\nFolks are trained for the job that are coming in now because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back\nAnd when somebody says\nWhy the person you just mentioned do I'm not going to advertise for\nBut that'd be Trump's stance when he peace go ahead Hussein Hussein or you balance the Saudis again to show some surveys are shipping billions to the Iranians destroy Israel let me know\nHe's going to bring all these jobs back\nWell how exactly they are going to do that what are you going to do\nThere is no answer to it\nHe just says well I'm ...
