level\nMembers of the all left uh we'll talk with a good friend from the FBI us especially Jimmy Conway retired with the ... and special so we had to say about eight Fifteen Eighteen also in the check in with a different John Michael C bore me [laughter]\nI Know we're busy busy organization these with heritage focuses on\nFederal criminal law and such and we always take a peak of the court and other things going on he's in for John Malcolm John Michael see we're happy Thursday's or walk with her a little show\nOh thank you very much for him you know\nWhat the heck is going on out there uh in terms of these packages going around how many laws are being broken the when you do something stupid like this job I go see we're\nI don't know like throw it out in the dark bored and you can hit one um\nYeah clearly illegal jumped to their credit I think for how he is handling this and I'm sure that our friends of the FBI and the OJ well a figure it out\nAnd Beijing real quick snapshot Supreme Court every time you and I chat it's usually about a Kavanaugh he's been in their houses the sailing has been going up the Supreme Court for the latest and greatest uh Brett Kavanaugh where when the blood\nSo last night we actually had a real privilege of postings Senator Orrin hatch heritage\nTo do what we call the story lecture about an hour long talk on the decline of authentic advice and consent function and how these judicial confirmation hearing this turned into a math but that's on CSPAN um it might be the first time that these and had to bleep out sections of the senator's speech or if it was very lively\nHe talked a lot about Kavanaugh but look at it for a few hearings and then very college or they're very warm he shook hands with Justice Kagan you eat that's next to an awful lot of questions so really it looks like business as usual for judge now just with Kevin\nHow's the Ruth Bader Ginsburg holding lavelle she has to do it and you will be okay\nShe looked at the end you know it's actually a that another sign of disability and the court though since the\nKevin her confirmation hearing is indeed a chief justice John Roberts is giving a talk quoting cabin all about how we need to build him or one nation and justice Gorsuch has spoken out about how we need to have the Supreme Court needs to be a civil on vacation and\nStill you know when all the justices get up at the end of argument they'll file out by the new already and Justice Ginsburg God Bless their she moved very slowly and so it is kind of sweet to see all the justices stand there and they want\nFor the minute that it takes for her to get from her feet to the curtain and it's just one of those signs that you know the court is going to continue to function the way it always has his toxicity uh doesn't go inside the court doors\nAnd real quick I remember I obviously the the horrible criminal behavior by the left against Brett Kavanaugh can you imagine being Amy Coney Barrett like she might be next in line should there be an opening any word if she's running for the hills and saying I don't need this aggravation I don't need these lies in this horrible slander that took place\nWell but I Hope that she's not but that is the concern you know Miguel Estrada is someone who's one of the best lawyers and the country and he said\nI won't do anything that choirs requires me to be civil to Chuck Schumer there are people who won't go through these hearings but I encourage you to go and look at Senator Hatch is speech he gave the heritage it talks about this kind of thing and what we can try and do to turn the theory around\nAnd and real quick or John Michael super with us from heritage specializing in the courts we did the ... left in the violence the banging on the doors of the Supreme Court the violence and the other horrible behavior trespassing as they all has it all going away or they completely out of the way and it's it's back to normal now are there so protestors out there\nWell the corner of unique so the court clerk you know there's a certain reference in that building and on the first day of the argument he was definitely more emphatic than usual when he told people to remain quiet and and respectful during argument but I think is just a matter of you know the local authorities\nControlling these kinds of protests letting people do the first amendment function but crack but you know controlling the criminal element\nAmazing amazing good job I I Know you're busy appreciate you taking time to stop by John Michael super from heritage a lock

criminal immigrants in this way they broke into Mexico and then they're waving foreign flags like invaders and they said even ABC's report it was they want jobs or just for jobs so they're going to
