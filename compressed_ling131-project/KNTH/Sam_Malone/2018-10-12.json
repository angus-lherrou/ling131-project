answer\nTo your job and then I sat down yesterday and the only record of office building our current or whether or not we ought to be doing business with China\nThey have a lot of business partners of the United states should Google should Facebook be helping the People's Republic of China to develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this as a nation that has admitted that a million like ours in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point\nAt his speech at the Hudson Institute last week and I think the biggest applause line he got was when he said that the information technology sector don't cooperate with the Chinese in in this effort I Would say the shareholders of these companies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future\nReally you want to make money off of repression I if I were a shareholder I'd I'd want to know what the answer of our corporate leadership was\nThe shareholders though we certainly would not have allowed in pre war Germany Americans to sell the crowd iron works the designed for new artillery are we is there a role for the government to step in the Silicon Valley and control technology transfer\nWell we were looking at the export control area look we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear chemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile\nDevelopment I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing that because we've abandoned free market principles but\nBecause we have to be realistic about the adversaries we face in the world today that use the fruits of American freedom against us and we shouldn't let that happen we want to do it in ways to protect our open economy but the NIH others the ability to take advantage of it\nOr return to the previous administration and Bob Woodward's book a lot was overlook one thing that was overlooked was a candidate mission that they had hit the scope of the north Korean nuclear problem\nRather the country so that they had to wear a further oh by the war and President Trump but that was his biggest problem ... conceal the extent of the problem and we're we prepared for a preemptive strike the Woodward describes\nWell that the Obama policy they described as strategic patience\nA that is a synonym for doing nothing about North Korea and it's another example of a ... bill coming due for President Trump a I think the combination of the\nPotential use of military force against North Korea and the the maximum pressure campaign that the president waged on the economic front is what has brought that Kim Jong onto the table Mike Pompeo has just returned from another trip there will see a meeting I think between a chairman Kim in President Trump's sometime in the next couple of months\nUh we'll see other efforts go forward the president has held the door open for North Korea he gave them a great little uh a movie in a in\nSingapore when he met with Kim Jong on the showed what North Korea's future could be so the doors open they need to denuclearize completely an irreversible way and if they do that and walk through the door of the future could be very different for the north Korean people\nYou know John Holdren has been known for Twenty years is the most skeptical of skeptics a feel good diplomacy are you feeling good about the diplomacy with North Korea\nBut I don't think we'd be in the place we are today if we continue to pursue a Brock Obama's policies I think four more years of that under Hillary Clinton would have guaranteed and North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons\nOr the the future remains uncertain on the president's diplomacy he's optimistic he pressed his heart he does not have stars in his eyes about this neither does my palm pale neither does Jim Mattis neither do I\nShould we be encouraging our allies to match what the Chinese are doing the creation of artificial a tolls I mean I remember in the Philippines and Japan can do it I think it'd be doing\nWell I think we've got to do more first to establish for the Chinese we do not acknowledge the legitimacy of any of this\nThe ship or near a collusion you mentioned a is an example of how dangerous Chinese behavior is\nWe have now got more participation by allies the British the Australians and others are sailing with us through the south China Sea we are going to do a lot more on that I think we could see more exploitation of mineral resources in the south China\nSea with or without Chinese cooperation they need to know they have not achieved the fed accompli here\nThis is not a Chinese province and will not be\nGetting the light up so I have to ask you to things Russia's in the rearview mirror and Christopher Wray said this yesterday they're worried about today's problem shot is worried about tomorrow's problem how much of that strategic thinking stuck in a rush of first as a problem and not focused on China as the major geopolitical strategic challenge of eccentric\nI think we do see China as the the major issue of the century I don't think we're stuck in the rearview mirror but what I Would say is in a world that's now post\nPost Cold War we are and I'm very complex environment the United states faces a range of challenges globally sound that the strategic nuclear level summit the level of terrorist threats\nWe've got to be prepared across the spectrum of threats in a way we've never had to be in our history and the nineteenth century we were much more isolated than we are today we are being global power and are threats are global\nAs well and what is the president's grasp of the geopolitical complexities of the war we get this question all the time you deal with them daily\nWell I think he's got a all the grasp of it you need that the one difference between a President Trump and other presidents is his economic background and he sees and emphasizes economic issues\nAgain never seen the president was one will survive but you need us more than ever to understand the real story ...
