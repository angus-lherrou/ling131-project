of that for ...\nFor Christ also happen once suffered for Sam's but just for the unjust that he might bring us to God maybe not a great verse Christ also having one suffered for sins but just\nFor the unjust\nThat he might bring us to go now are generally heading for this book has been timeless ruse were tough times and the proof today that we're dealing with is how does God forgive saying\nHow does God forgive saying first Peter three per se team tells us and they're there for things I Want you to notice about the sacrifice of calvary up on the cross the very first thing I Want you to notice is that it was a substitution airy sacrifice\nYeah but now a substitution sacrifice and I work at a worse for Christ have also want suffered for Sam's now notice this freeze\nBut just for the unjust and that word for means and the place out\nAs a substitute Christ actually took our place he was our substitution airy savior you see we're centers we're all the ones who morally have\nStruck God we're the ones who have tended oh my God\nWe are centers by nature\nAs soon as my choice we are as soon as my practice and soon as a moral\nThe front door almighty God not only are we centers but God is holy God is in front of the holy and God never has gotten never can God never we'll let one half of one see him go unpunished God must punish than and yet\nWe're centers we deserve punishment and yet at the same time God loves us\nSo we can speak um God is having a problem God has a problem how can they love and forgive the center and at the same time one is saying\nWell wait is with a substitution every\nSacrifice someone who takes that suffering someone who takes that\nPunishment on our back\nA person who is righteous enough holy enough\nGood enough to become our substitute someone himself who has known those same who can suffer in our state and the only one who could do that was the son of God\nBut we're preaching about today he is God's substitution airy savior he died as a substitute he died not merely for us but let's put it this way he died instead\nOf us now that's really what Passover is all about and what is the message of the parents of\nLamb that dog is a God who provides a substitute to atone for our sins remember that people were sinful in that state as well as in this\nAnd God told the people there through Moses he said I'm going to judge seeing my death angel is going to come through the land and my death angel\nIs going to slay the first born in every home as a judgment upon seeing but God said to his children to the Jewish people I Want you to take a lamb\nLamb or may first going up a flock without spot without limits\nI won't you take that lamb I Want you to kill it I Want you to take the blood bat lamb and I want you to sprinkle the blood\nUpon or be a muscle and the door closed all the house and they're as that blood was applied when the death angel came through the land of Egypt he saw the blood\nAnd he passed away inside that house was a center would apply to that house was a\nLot of an innocent lamb a substitute now down through the years people are Jewish friends have been keeping the Passover and we Christians look back to the Passover\nWith great admiration and rape almost a God for the lesson that he taught us be priests\nHad a system of sacrificial offerings of Passover lambs and back in Jesus' time there were special\nPassover shepherds with key special pass over land those lambs wouldn't be bred\nAnd fed and cared for and the feels a bowl as\nOutside of Bethlehem not without significance that Christ was born in Bethlehem and they're just near the city of Jerusalem just a few miles away\nIn the fields of Bethlehem bows lambs would be being taken care of as a matter of fact it was through the shepherd of those kinds of lambs I Believe that the angel of here and talk about the baby Jesus there but let me tell you this\nBad throw shepherds taking care of those lands on a particular day wouldn't bring those lambs into the city\nTo be sacrificed but you know the day that they were brought into the city\nIn Jesus' time was the day that we call home Sunday\nBut here Jesus comes into the city of Jerusalem\nAnd at that same time at that same time that price\nOn palm Sunday is entering into the city the Passover we have that same time these lamb or entering into the city these special land and they bring these lambs to the temple aerial mountain ...\nAnd then the priest come and they start to examine these lambs you know why they examine them to see if they were perfect\nBecause it had to be a perfect lamb lamb without spot\nWithout blaming they\nPick your loosely examined the lame they looked at its\nHooves they they examined\nThe skin they would open a smile\nThey even examined the ... leads to make certain there was not a small amount of blemish in those lambs those parents who were lambs\nNow have you ever wonder why the gospels deal so much with the last week of Jesus Christ Jesus had a ministry of over three years and yet one third of the gospels he's given over to the last week and most of it to the last three days of a life of Christ why\nI'll tell you why it was during that time that the son of God who is also being examined how carefully they we're examining Jesus he\nAppeared before the virus season they examined him he appeared before the side just see they examined him or her audience examined him the civil leaders examined him the religious leaders examined him like examined him saying that romance fake like this man them even punches pilots tend to say five find no fall\nIn him this perfect lamb was being examined not a blemish was in\nThe son of God and then the police started to sharpen\nTheir lethal knives\nBecause they were getting ready to cut the through civil pass over land on\nThat same day ladies and gentlemen pay attention\nOn that same day at the exact same time three in the afternoon\nWhen those free stupid ... land\nAnd cut throat and a lot of those innocent lamb spread it out to be called innovation at that same time guards lamb\nThe Lord Jesus about his head and said you need is finished\nBoth those lambs and Christ we're both sacrificed owned mountain Mariah\nWhere he got into labor am centuries before God\nWill provide himself a lamb\nAnd God didn't provide himself a lamp and Jesus about his head and senators\nFinish and Levi so you\nCan go home now priest we don't need you anymore\nI won't you know God has now provided himself all I Am and the Old Testament medical system is finished it is over with because God\nSlam has fulfilled at all and Jesus Christ of lamb of God but just for the unjust has become our Passover and now how long are we we can say when the blood is applied to our hearts by the\nGods they enjoy judgment passes over ... you say do you think Peter had that in mind I Want you to go to chapter one verse Eighteen and look at it\nMore as much as you know\nThat she will not redeemed with corrupt herbal planes a silver and gold from your vein conversation received by tradition\nFrom your father's book where the precious blood of Christ as the lamb without spot and without\nBlemish a man God's lamb\nBut blood of Christ as a lamb without spot and without blemish first\nPeter chapter one\nAdverse Eighteen now that makes first Peter chapter three versus eight teams all the more clear Christ also has one suffered for Sam's but just\nFor the unjust that he might bring us to God what I'm trying to tell you is this that he was our substitution our savior he was God's Plan who took upon him the scent of the world and suffered as an innocent substitute the just the unjust spending my brings to God and even in the end the gospel story\nPaid in full now for him that's what Christ in on the cross he bought his head and they said is paid in full force\nIt's finished you can add to it\nYou can't take from it without Christ you can do nothing with Christ you need do nothing\nPay and paid\nIn full wants him for all rather really but not only friend\nWas it a substitution or sacrifice not only was it a suffering sacrifice not only was it a subtle sacrifice but there for because of all of these other things it was a sufficient sacrifice now this worse goes on to say that he might bring us to God\nAnd that's the purpose of it as I said before San has offended God there's a chasm eroded virus in our rebellion better separate us from God now the Lord Jesus wants to bring us to go now this war and\nBring is an interesting word is a word that was used the ringer was a person who would introduce a person to a king are pumped into ... he\nWas called the bring or ...\nSomeone who brings up person into the presence of a king pay poked in Tate hey dignitaries not friend that's why Jesus Christ does Christ is the one who brings\nUs to God do you understand and I'm In Christ and he's in me he's my substitute he became my saying that I might

we're really going to pick up with that a pastor Mitchell was talking about the spiritual blessings and what happened in the Old Testament and some of the commentators nowadays saying that just the spiritual blessing today not a physical blessing that we can get and I know pastor Mitchell you\nPointed out to a Matthew twenty four Luke twelve X. twenty second Corinthians nine a lot of great teaching are really showing that in all this ties together because when we understand wealth and wealth creation from the Bible it really applies to us today and\nThat's one of the things that trade way does is helping you take control of those finances to build a better future for yourself for your children ... grandchildren and having that extra income creating that wells\nAre really then allows us to bless others uh our church our neighbors our family uh ministries that we may support so it's really a double blessing and not only blessing ourselves in her family but being able to use

Am too I always tell people I got the best material in the world because it's the word of God so you can't beat that [laughter] but you know lay uh we've been talking about the\nFact that a lot of the old time commentators seem to not think that God still blesses us with physical blessings today like you did in the Old Testament time\nBut I disagree with that now we talked about last time a little bit about why they thought that and I feel that they took a they'd be attitudes out of context in the sense that they don't realize\nThat Jesus was preaching to Jews under the old tests me calling me showing them what is going to be like if they choose law rather than grace if they choose their system rather than him and the cutting off of the hand if they still something that plucking out of the eyes they see something they shouldn't be looking at\nAnd ride in the middle of that context he says the the height of the ideal of what the Old Testament life under the law would be like for a perfect person who can be saved that way which we know it was impossible\nAnd um he was offering them graces exactly what he's doing so there's plenty of evidence on the contrary that God does last New Testament saints where he's our father we are his children he does bless us\nWith spiritual blessings especially when we keep the points that we're supposed to do I mean it's it's called a conditional cabinet and not the ... coming up but the covenant of God blessing his children with rich is all through the Bible it has\nUh some things we have to do it's conditional is not unconditional we have to be diligent we have to have skill sets in the business areas that were working in we have to have a closer walk with God and of course that's what we're talking about that part\nThe closer walk with the lord but let me get further evidence that this is also true in the New Testament\nSo I'm going to look at the license after three verse ate\nIt says and the scripture for seeing that God would justify the heat and through faith and that's the gym towels us through faith ... many of us\nAre preached before the gospel under Abraham saying in the shell all nations be blessed not just the Jew but all nations ... tiles or people of every kind of\nPeople of every race some people from every people group will be saved and that you didn't like to believe that the apostle Paul spend a lot of his time convincing the Jew yes Jesus died for all kinds of men\nAre inverse not it says so then they wish me a face are blessed with faithful Abraham now I Want you to think about that I'm In it\nThat is talking back about the Abraham at covenant and if you remember the covenant it had\nThe greatest spiritual blessing of all what your salvation and got the book of

seven eight seven to three or go to trade way dot com\nAnd are really helping you take that next step to take control of your finances well learning how to trade in the stock market so pastor Mitchell's been a a great lesson so far and really looking at the Old Testament the New Testament the blessings\nUh that are that we're still apply to us today in the age of grace and you've got more versus that they're going to show this that creating wealth is really biblical because we can use that will not only for our family but we really use that to bless others as the Bible says\nWell that's that's so true lay I mean I guess some of the old commentators I should say that said that God has blessed and the New Testament physically I didn't even think about this simple\nVersus Jesus said so many times in park quoted Jesus as saying it's more blasted the give and receive and\nPaul himself made it clear when he was going around uh collecting money for other churches he said I did not come to collect money to your hurt in other words he didn't want them to give money they didn't have he wanted them to take care of their families first and have extra\nIn light of that is a lady extra side to take up for poor churches that's clear and scripture [noise] a lot of people to eat fat wrong when they raise money for churches they say well just pledge what you don't have an in God will give you extra that's foolish\nNot biblical but let me give me a couple of other places in the New Testament where it does demonstrate that God wants to bless his children even in the church age\nWith physical blessings we've talked about many already including were under the ever Hamad covenant which included physical blessings along with the spiritual so it's both but here's one at first that alone is chapter four verse eleven\nAnd that you studied to be quiet\nAnd do your own business in other words you need to know how to work with your hands are great money for your family and to work with your own hands as weak demanded you\nThat you'd be ... that you may walk honestly toward them that are was out in other words have a good reputation for the last world they see that you work hard at your that you you you're good entrepreneur\nYou know your business well you'd have studied and you have the skill sets in your diligent and all these things show that to the world and that you may have lack of nothing well what does that mean lack of nothing\nDoes it does not picture the poverty\nThat Jesus said and the ... and they'd be attitudes blessed it as the porn spirit blesses make all this like you you're you're better off if you're poor\nThat as he was teaching that as we said in previous shows to given illustration of what it would be like to try to be saved by good works or try to be saved by the law to live to the highest level\nOf of Jesus himself how he was born in the major so to speak and\nHe's showing them look if you want to try to live that you're going to fail so you really need me you don't need to try to live by the law so that is not a good place to get your teaching forgot what God says about New Testament science in the church age\nThese other versus we looked at our so first that alone is for eleven and twelve show very clearly scripture says we're supposed to work diligently and that God will bless the work of our hands\nAnd we will lack nothing so that's better than just living hand to mouth I mean that's having extra for your children extra for your grandchildren extra to give than to others and be blast way more highly\nThan when things are given to us now\nBolivian chapter for is a great when I Love this is talk about the apostle Paul himself\nSo let's look at that Philippines for eleven not that I speak and respect of want Paul says for I have learned in whatsoever state I Am there with to be content\nThere's an awful lot to be taught about money when God gives it to this one is we can't love it they were ruin us we have to use it as a tool\nAs God actually uses it through us as a tool to get his work done in the world\nAnd secondly um we need to be content when we don't have money we need to be just as happy enjoy fall in the lord when we don't have money we can have cash flow problems a lot even when you're a successful business man or woman you have cash flow problems\nWe need to be content even then but ... says emerged twelve I Know both how to be a base that means he would be a hung on a dungeon wall and have absolutely nothing and he would still have the joy the lord\nBut look what he says here and I know how to abound\nNow that that word is very interesting because\nIn the Greek the Greek word is Perry's studio and it means to super abound\nWhen you put the little prefix Perry in front of me super so not just a ballot to super abound\nAnd the Greek word literally means to be an excess do have access to have wealth or riches as what the connotation is here so polished saying that he's had times when he hung on a wall in a dungeon and he was joyful but he also had time because of his tent business that he was wealthy\nAnd he was joyful when he had that too he didn't let it ruined his life because it was the Lord's and they knew it and he was just a steward of it so there were times when the apostle Paul was wealthy which would certainly contradict\nThe all time teaching that God doesn't less physically God will bless physically when we keep the conditions\nSo he goes on and says I Know how to be based but also know how to super bound to be abundantly wealthy and to have access I Know how to not let that ruin me because it's just a tool and everywhere and all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry I can be rich that can be poor\nBoth to bound and to suffer need I can be wealthy but I can also be needful and I'm Still happy I can do all things he says through Christ which strengthens me so that's a beautiful passage to that would\nTend to show God will bless us but it also shows will go through time to trial but that's for our growth in that happens I mean that's a fact we're fact the first thing God will do we've shown this and other places other times\nThe very first thing he will do when we try to begin to be entrepreneurial is he will bring a storm\nThere's exact example of that and scripture he'll bring a storm to test is he doesn't want us to quit he wants to make sure we're not quarters and he also teaches a string through hardship and then he'll open the windows of heaven and bring\nThe physical blessings as we walk with him so late those are the last New Testament ... among the hot back into some a hundred and twelve six you know pick up kind of World War I think we left off it burst for would it be All right with you by just summarize real quickly what the first four and then we'll start with birth six so work\nPlease do All right so\nIn some a hundred and twelve the first five versus basically teach these points number one the man who fears God and the lights in his word\nWill be blessed and that carries the Old Testament Jewish connotation of spiritual but also physical and frankly they looked at the physical first if I've got more camels more cattle than I Am more blast than you are by the lord that's just how they looked at it because they believed everything that they received was from him\nSecondly his children she'll be mighty thirties children will be blessed fourth wealth and Richard Shelby in his house\nFifth he she'll have in Deering righteousness\nAnd then a a good man show a favorite lend is\nHe will guide his affairs with discretion so he's going to be a person who can lend to others and that is exactly what we've been talking about in these New Testament versus if it's more blessed to give them receive you have to have extra and so God Bless\nWas spiritual blessings both in the Old Testament and the New Testament now let me pick it up with some one twelve six surely he shall not be moved forever this man who is blessed by God the righteous should be an everlasting remembrance\nAnd so he will not be afraid of evil things as hard as fixed trusting in the lord his

clear Christ also has one suffered for Sam's buggy just for the unjust\nThat he might bring us to God what I'm trying to tell you is this that he was our substitution our savior he was God's Plan who took upon him the scent of the world and suffered as an innocent substitute the just the unjust that in my brings to God and even in the end the gospel story\nPay them for not for him that's what Christ in on the cross he by his head and they said is paid in full folks\nIt's finished you can add to it\nYou can't take from it without price you can do nothing with Christ you need do nothing\nHay

friends and loved towards the brother and all of this is talk in the Bible love towards ... show love the larger got all your heart with all your so with all your story\nThat was an Old Testament passages but it's true in the New Testament as well we are mandated to love God\nAnd how can we love someone we don't know\nHow can we appreciate someone we'd never met how can we have confidence in someone we don't understand and so if we love God then we can begin to appreciate and understand what he does for us\nBut the only way you can never last God is to understand God to understand its

remember love has two sides to it has the personal side which is personal virtue and it has the and personal side\nAnd that's a different set motivational virtue in life is personal love forgot always

Fifteen stop loving the world [noise] anything related to the world if anyone keeps you loving the world the love of the father is not in him because all that's in the world that last of the flesh the lesser the eyes the Erica pattern of life it's not from the father but from the world\nHas called the cosmic system the devil rules cosmic system and your mandated by John don't love the costs must do

me\n[noise] and liquor lab and twenty seven twenty eight year happiness comes from hearing God's word and keeping it but if you're loving the world in other words what the world offers success prominence\nAttention approval if you're a loving the world this means that you're under some sort of Damon influence in your motivation\nOr in your thought pattern I didn't say demon possession said

disaster people often ask a silly question they say how can a loving God do this to me this sort of blasphemy often results from misunderstanding what God's love really is\nYou see divine knowledge

investor struggle with their tennis and we've all heard horror story or two or three\nAbout tennis not paying rent damaging the property being difficult to evict you know just generally not the experience that real estate investors had hoped for when they entered the business and yet those stories are few and far between among the members of lifestyles unlimited why is that\nHow come we have consistently better tenet experiences than other real estate investors\nAnd today I'm going to share three of the tips for tenants screening that I learned from my mentors\nThat have helped me have positive relationships with my tenants create a win win situation\nAnd avoid many of the pitfalls that we hear about in these tenant horror stories it is not a given that your property is going to be destroyed it is not a given that your attendance are not going to pay their rent it is not a given that you are going to have a constant struggle with tenants\nWhen you are real estate investor and this applies to single family properties as well as apartment communities it is a relationship with people\nAnd learning to navigate that relationship and learning to do it well\nWe'll help you be more successful as a real estate investor and have a heck of a lot more fun\nThan struggling with your tenants and spending your time and affection court and and that's the goal the goal from\nThe moment you say hello is to create a relationship with your attendance at perspective tenants\nSo that you can talk with them throughout their time and your property and as they're moving out you can work with them you can have an open communication where they understand your expectations and what they need to do and they are incentivized to meet them\nAnd that's really what what it is all about and it begins with just some simple consistent practices that if you do them over time will result in these positive relationships\nFirst I Want to give you the phone number in case you have a question call eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven happy to answer your questions on tenets screening or anything else related to single family an apartment community by and hold investing\nMy mentors especially the founder of lifestyles unlimited del ... spent a lot of time teaching me the discipline of tenants screening and the value of consistently enforcing the lease with kindness\nThe first thing I learned and my first time for you is create your own tenants selection criteria it should be specific to your property and the stock market\nDon't use standard forms without customizing them and tone use standard forms that you haven't read because you're tenets electric criteria is important for stabbed washing the expectations of who is going to apply\nTo rent your property and who is eventually going to be living in your rental property\nSo some key things that you need to think about when you're creating your attendance selection criteria\nIs some of the standards what's your credit minimum or you're going to have him then and then credit score and think about why part of this has to do with the economy and what cycle we're in right because when you choose to be a real estate investor you're choosing to be a real estate investor for life\nAnd a few of these things in your tennis selection criteria might change depending on what's going on in the economy and what's going on in the world\nWhat is an example of that I'm back in the crash\nI realized that screening tenants on credit score\nAnd requiring a credit score I think at the time my tenants lecture criteria required to six eighty credits for which is a pretty good credit score for the six eighty credit score you're able to buy property\nBut if people were losing their homes they were sliding into bankruptcy after losing their jobs that credit score became rare\nAnd I realized that we had incredible people out there who were unfortunate had lost their jobs due to downsizing they had then lost their home because they were ... living a little to hand to mouth in order to bridge that gap\nBut they were great people they were used to paying their bills that were used to maintaining a home they had you know leaf blowers and lawn mowers and educators and trash cans and clippers and everything I needed to maintain that home and they knew how to do it\nAnd I found that by lowering my requirement for minimum credit score I was able to get those terrific people in my ... and some of them are still in my rentals today\nAnd that is an important thing to be in touch with what is going on in the market because if you require for instance a seven fifty a credit score I talked with a a real estate investor the other day who was so worried about the quality of their tenets that they had done that\nAnd it had been several weeks at their property had been on the market and they still did not have a an F applications to choose a tenant that and that all of their tenant criteria\nThat is a critical piece to consider so your\nCredit minimum is probably going to be somewhere south of six eighty it's probably going to be though above five hundred and you have you may want to leave yourself the opportunity a by putting a little asterisk next to that that certain things can be considered\nNow we have a move to remove medical debts\nFrom credit scores and that will help an awful lot a lot of our rental pool are suffering low credit because of medical related bills that have gone on paid and have gone to collections that have destroyed their credit so we'll talk a little bit later in the show about\nSorting through credit reports and what you're looking for\nBut ... credit minimum have a criteria for it established a credit minimum if you want that in your tenant criteria\nAn important thing for you to have in every ten of criteria is income to rent minimum ratios\nYou want to make sure that your tenants are going to be able to either individually or as a family meet their rent every month\nAnd they're going to have to have a income that establishes that they are capable of doing that I've seen people use two times the rent I think fifty percent in rent in this market where we have\nHigh unemployment rates we have people who have moved into better jobs over the past several years I think in this market cycle that we are really should be looking at three times income\nUh rent for income so if you take your your desire rent multiply that by three that should be their minimum income that they can prove to you\nSo that would be my recommendation but again you're going to look at the market you're going to look at different different aspects of your ... market and you're going to come up with a rent to income ratio that works for you but it needs to be at least two times and I want you to consider three times rent as your minimum income requirements\nThan criminal history you've heard a lot about this recently and I'm going to talk a little bit about it because I think it's really important to understand as a landlord which you can and cannot do\nBased on what's called disparate impact and you may or may not have heard that term it's been in the news a lot of last year a little bit the beginning of this year haven't heard a whole lot about it recently\nAnd there is a lot of talk about refining these rules because they've had some unintended consequences\nBut the concept of disparate impact is that you can for instance have a blanket tennis selection criteria that says you will not accept any criminal convictions at all\nSet of matter how long ago it was no matter what they were convicted of you will not accept them in your property\nUnfortunately we're reaching a period of time for a variety of reasons which would be a whole show on all by itself of why more people today have criminal records than ever before a lot of it has to do with policing in schools and what is happening to our young people\nUh things that would have just simply been um handled that the school level and discipline there now become\nA legal issues for courts\nAnd is resulting in people coming out of high school with criminal records at an alarming rate\nSo disparate impact says that there are certain segments of our society that are impacted more\nBy these blanket criteria than others and as a result is having an unfair impact on some protected classes\nThat needs to be addressed and needs to be addressed by landlords and also by the governing bodies that are are legislating our landlord tenant law\nSo what do we do with landlords well this doesn't mean that you cannot screen for criminal convictions and it doesn't mean that you can't have something in your criteria\nBut it needs to be specific so rather than what we've traditionally had is a blanket criminal convictions or out don't bother to apply if you have them we're going to name some specific things\nThat we have reason to believe a would impact the neighborhood and our property\nThan this isn't going to be a good rental for them because they're not going to be able to stay in compliance with the H away uh some H. always do not allow work trucks to be parked out in front of the property so these are the types of things to having your attendance selection criteria\nThat last tip I Want to tell you about tennis lecture criteria is that if you're asking for Social Security number you need to have a privacy policy as well that you give them at the same time if they're logging into a service you're going to use them that\nWill have the privacy policy right there with it this is Len Merlin the lifestyles unlimited real estate investor radio show in just a few minutes we'll move on to tip chew on tenth screening which gives you the information you need to know about your perspective tennis\nDo you have a question get on the line now\nBut I'm

of a long term when when relationship\nWe've covered the first tip create your own tenets selection criteria and now we're moving on to the second test your rental application should give you the information you need\nAnd be easy to complete you think yeah that sounds basic right but what didn't notice landlords do they go find some standard form and if they're printing it out it's way too small for anybody to write any significant information in there they can hardly even get their name in the space\nAnd you end up with a handwritten application that's a difficult to read and often doesn't have all of the information on it that you really need in order to make your decision of\nTennis for your property you also have some choices to make here whether you're going to take applications online\nOr whether you're going to do than the traditional way which is meeting people out at the property and providing them with a paper copies to fill out on site and ... years ago that was our preferred method you meet them out on the property you schedule a group time for people to come you would have clip boards\nPencils and paper and pencil and paper and that you would have them come prepared you tell them to bring a copy of their their driver's license and social Social Security card or to have all the information that they needed to fill that out\nNow most landlords that I talked to are either bringing up their own online website or using an online portal where that application is filled out on line obviously that provides\nAn opportunity for ah getting all of the information that you need that you still want to make sure you take a look at those forms and that they are comprehensive\nBecause it is time consuming to go back out and you're tempted to just operate without the information if you don't collect it in the initial application so what kinds of things are we looking for you know uh\nYou want to separate out for the first thing is you must have a separate application for all perspective residents that are Eighteen years old and above\nYou are we're going to get to tip number three and just a little bit where we're going to talk about background checks\nBut you want to have the information anybody Eighteen years and older you also want to make sure that there's a place for them to put residents that are under the age of Eighteen and list out their full name and birthday\nSo that you have a record of everyone who would be living in the property\nYou want to make sure that you're not asking questions that could lead to charges of discrimination ah so ah\nYou know you want to make sure that you're not whether it's in your application or in your conversations with them that you're not asking about the race you are not asking them their religion you're not asking them their sexual orientation or their family status and as a landlord none of that really matters\nSo you need to stick to the things that you really need to know and what are those\nGetting full information on their previous addresses is critical\nWhatever form you're using should allow them to put multiple addresses in there it should allow them to add additional ones at the end or has some way of online forms are great because typically you can just say out of new address out and you address Adam you address some of these people have moved around and you want to know everywhere they list\nThe other thing that you want to get is full information on their employer how long have they been there what is their job title who is their supervisor where's their company headquartered and what is the address and phone number there\nWhere do they actually work and what is the address and phone number there who is the name and phone number and contact title for the person who will verify their employment linked to the employment and how much they make\nThe critical information for you to decide whether they meet your tenet selection criteria\nNight and then you want to make sure that you're getting back information that's legible and completely filled out for using online forums\nThat in my opinion the the best thing you can use
