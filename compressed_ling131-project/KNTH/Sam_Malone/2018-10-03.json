out here I'm not I I don't know I don't know that that is going to be determinative hum look I I think you have an incredibly\nFavorable dynamic with the Senate map for Republicans to to hold onto the majority and potentially expand on their majority and and obviously on the house side of things are very different a republic to play defense and I think are still pretty likely lose the house so I I don't know that\nYou know everybody had hair on fire about cabinet right now for understandable reasons um but ... but I just don't know that that it's going to ultimately move the needle electorally the way that folks are beginning to talk about it could but but\nI I think that we should just pump the brakes because as we've seen in the era of Trump or these days tend to burn hot and burn really fast\nTurnout burden now a low listen to me carefully on this because I bought the audience to to confirmed for you you can talk to them later I spent the first hour today like I did all of Monday talking only two women who were first time caller and we're pretty good at identifying scam artist and all that kind of it's definitely been doing this\nIn two thousand Cathy in Scranton, Pennsylvania and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa and Detroit's got a teenage son normal also in Michigan Alexandria Newport Beach Elaine in Louisville Jeannie in Oregon Shelly in Columbus and in San Diego I can only take calls an hour that's\nThe max nine out of ten of them are very happy the president went after Dr Ford's testimony last night Ken out of ten of them one of them said no just we should allow that to

coming to her the ex boyfriend letter the second front\nDoor investigation the Rachel Mitchell Report she has a solid yes on cabinet unless the FBI corroborate doctor for that is very different from yielding to Jerry ... you know blackmail about impeachment she just saying I'm a yes is that what you're hearing\nThat for you is what what I'm hearing\nRepublicans Republicans are standing strong everyone I ever talked to they are saying ... percent corroborating evidence of Dr Ford in this report they're staying strong with cabin on\nYou know look I think that's the assumption I think that um you know Senate Republican leadership\nBelieves that that absent corroborating evidence that that that that he is going to be confirmed it they're going to have the votes um but I I think that there is sort of a a a an unspoken built in caviar in everyone's mind here that that um\nYou know corroborating evidence is\nPotentially in the eye of the beholder gear and and I know that that sounds strange but we're living in a really strange time and this is a very strange situation and I do think that there is a potential for\nSome finding that is not corroborating in a legal sense but that is a you know a significant in undermining portions of of judge Kavanaugh's a sworn testimony and that that could change things for for\nSome senators for some Republicans I'm not saying that's going to happen but I I certainly don't take that anybody is closing off that possibility if they're being honest about\nYou know the audio and transcript ... she'll be posted pretty soon but I'll tell you what struck me ten\nShe is not going for that little margin you tried to go there shooting which is you know drinking or throwing ice in a bar that just irrelevant to her she wants corroborating evidence of the assault\nWhich launched all of this everything else is post facto to her and doesn't matter\nAnd I actually believe Republicans will be wiped out if they do not confirm Kavanaugh within ... in the absence of an explanation corroborating Dr Ford story I really think they will be wiped out in a way the revolt will be selling massive because\nBut I hear and pick up is is just passion like I haven't seen in two years you know Trump is shattered the Republican Party it's altogether that is what Lindsey said last night\nYeah look I I I Would certainly agree with you there I I think that the Republican base has probably even more unified at this moment that it has been in a in the Twenty one months of the Trump presidency does far I I don't think there's any question and I and I do think that just as they\nShould do it as a matter of of sort of delivering and as a matter of motivating and and mobilizing 'em yet politically yeah there's there's no question uh that that they are now in a position where and I think some folks on the hill even some folks on the Republican side who sort of whisper like geez I you know\nThe hash tag ... media\nTalking about this yesterday and he said regardless of what the FBI sign here we're going to go now I have not because you disagree with him on them and you had the beginning\nThat does not find anything conclusive or

end up voting yes after all there and they're really red states that are facing competitive ...\nI Would understand their views and they're both\nIn any event I Would continue to urge them\nThat they

that are on a donated or not [laughter] not even it's not even coming when you do is okay um\nSo what we started talking about uh we're up to a virtual Joe Joe pain he's already held psychotherapist she visits us on Wednesdays as we became America's first show\nWith a psychotherapist here ... weekly I forget why but now it's become a state [laughter] right I forget the story that got you here but uh we met through friends that each for you and whatever the first topic was but and we and I remember you need help with a website and that's where we we build websites here type twelve [noise]\nWith all that aside I don't remember the exact but now it's like everybody's like what is you'll say what is Jill say already held psychotherapist remember the American secretary associate [laughter] um the uh the lady a lazy Ford who was up there last Thursday whether\nThat's falling apart for quicker than a than a cheap suit in a rainstorm right um\nTo me it's real sad than as a psychotherapist because I truly believe cabin off and her I ... them\nI I truly do because of that falls on memory something really did happen to her right right right with she was so passionate about it something happened\nAnd uh and people maybe unintentionally or intentionally uh implanted memory into her mind and that there is there's been so many studies that you can literally implant a tire false memory into someone like you and I\nSo I so I'm I'm doing bad PR for both of them and uh and then in a sense I think it was good that they did this investigation to find out that it's really a was not true\nWhile it's appearing that way right\nI mean and how do you write allegedly I should say not a lawyer well I'm not a lawyer that and I wasn't\nThere but right and I I I was telling a story earlier um I I was in a bank robbery the first time a gun was pointed out obviously Philadelphia bank robbery march seven Nineteen eighty eleven Fifteen am forty seven seat I'd have you I mean I I can tell you everything about it\nRight or but I guess there's other people when they have a traumatic incidents don't remember a darn thing or one thing right like I remember the guy was when I remember the gun the kind of gone the robber pointed at me right but other people like us lazy Ford only remember she had a beer\nHim and so again I'm going to say that everybody at passionately believes including you that you remember everything about what happened I it's very rare that someone can remember everything\nThey did studies many years ago thinking that oh if it were really traumatic he would remember everything now they're finding out that\nUh because it's so traumatic and painful you block out some things because it's so so painful\nSo it's a memory is very interesting they're finding out that you know just like we said it's like a wicked media and the problem is\nYou're not lying we are not lying when we say we remember something that's our perception that's our the way our mind work we we believe we believe okay and because of that it comes across as\nAs true unreal when in actuality there's going to be bits and pieces everybody is going to have a different I Witness picture they\nSaid yeah I yeah and I remember it real quick on the bank robbery okay FBI came in and\nUh they interviewed me ... and and my my boys were all their Saint Paul and the the the the FBI they were nice guys\nAnd they said look we lose them separate just 'cause you're all everyone will remember something different there and and you might and I I remember it was a green army jacket [laughter] right and I remember my buddies is like I don't think it was green I'm like no army jacket now think the government ... you know\nSo I could see that now is almost nothing jibes
