it functions and So Peter here\nTalks about the cornerstone of a chair and any talks about the construction of a church and then he talks about the character of bitter when it talks about the cornerstone of a church he tells us something\nTo believe him when\nHe talks about the construction of a church\nHe's really talking about someone to love and to be loved by\nAnd then when it talks about the character of a church he's talking about something to do let's see if that's not true now that cornerstone the cornerstone of a church is Jesus Christ our churches built this church any church any Christian Church is built upon the Lord Jesus Christ\nJesus Christ is that very special\nThat very see like\nStone none like him among the sons of man he is precious to the father Jesus would hear the father said to him this is my beloved son and whom I'm well please brand Jesus Christ is the object of the father's love\nJesus Christ is a precious stone\nChosen um God I pay attention there is no way\nThat you can know God the father without knowing God the sun\nBarriers no way that you can ignore God the sun without ignoring got the ball there is no way that you can't worship the father except through the sun for Jesus said I Am the way the truth the light\nAnd no man come down to the father but by me he is that she lacked stone none other like the Lord Jesus Christ\nSome people stumble on the cornerstone now you see this\nEvery man every woman every boy every girl\nSomehow some way comes in contact with Jesus Christ\nSome way somehow and their friend Jesus Christ will be for you\nEither a stepping stone into heaven\nOr a stumbling stone in jail\nNow you can't be neutral about Jesus Christ\nEither you rise only\nAre you following\nEasier said by him\nOr you're judged by an\nAdded Jesus Christ is not for you a cornerstone Jesus Christ is for you a stumbling stone\nSo I say you will either stand on him or fall by him but you will not walk around him you will\nBe with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Suzanne is capable of Jesus Christ is an avid double Jesus Christ is\nOn a ... you cannot be neutral of Jesus Christ and what you do with Jesus Christ determines what Jesus Christ will be with you to many he is a stumbling stone\nJesus Christ\nIs a wrong\nWhere do you believe in Jesus Christ\nYou're not walking around on egg shells and jello\nJesus Christ is solid therefore the Bible says that ah whenever\nA person believes in him he will not be disappointed he will not be ashamed he will not be confounded\nNow let's change the figure not only do we see Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of the church but we see ourselves as individual building blocks in that church and so let's think about the construction of the church looking for a spy ... also\nAs living stones at says lively stones that means living stones\nAre built up a spiritual house so now knows what he's saying he also that is the things that are true of Jesus Christ in a sense so true about us\nBecause he's living stone he's in us in we're in him therefore we buried his nature therefore we also have supernatural lie\nWe also are living stones way to be like him have you ever heard somebody say of\nA of a boy who's a lot like his dad he's a chip off your block chip off the will block what does that mean shares the nature of his pop [laughter]\nAnd bread I Want to tell you there's no sense in which every child of God is a chip off that block we are living stones\nWe our life our dear lord a part of Jesus Christ\nNow because this is true because this is true I Want you to notice three things with me first of all we are built together noticed this amber spot\nYou also as living stones are built up a spiritual house not notice he's talking about a spiritual has not a material house\nNever confused and building with a church don't be like that man when they asked him in a form to fill out what is your church preference he said red brick no\nListen we have a church the people\nBut he speaks of us and a figure of speech as being blocks bricks stones in that building\nBuilt upon Jesus Christ the cheap cornerstone now the very first thing is that we are built to gather\nYou see what is the significance\nOf a stone out on the ground not much not much to see you step over to pay no attention to it\nBut you take that stone and put it with a lot of other stones and it becomes a beautiful temple as the master architect assembles these stones together now for it and that's what Jesus Christ is doing with us by ourselves we're not all so much you\nKnow some people say well I Believe in Jesus but I just don't believe in the church [laughter] how many one brick buildings have you seen I mean you know I just say one stone\nAntibiotics they just rolling around and moving around\nBut take a lot of them together and this train\nThat's what our lord is doing to us he isn't billing us together and I am beginning strength from you and you are to gain strength from me and it's amazing what we can do as we're\nBuilt together but not only are we built together because we're built together we are bound together bound together\nWe're on one end up by law and border that holds us together\nIs allowed but we are committed one to another rear end it together\nWe're bound together\nSuppose the stones in the basement of this building said well is none of their business what I Do so I'm going out this afternoon and then comes the route\nI mean we're together when it\nTogether I Am standing all Latinos they're standing on me I'm standing with some standing with me and we have friends are together and we bonded together\nMany of you have never made that kind of a commitment you're trying to be a Lone Ranger\nChristian\nYou can't say Jesus yes in the church you know if you love\nJesus you love what Jesus loves I said if you love God you love Jesus and if you love Jesus you love what Jesus laws and Jesus loves the church and Jesus Christ gave himself for the church you say what can be a Christian\nWithout being a member of church\nGonna be be without a high as\nKen said would be a sailor without a ship\nThat person be apparent without a family\nI suppose you might figure it out some way somehow for a little while that might be so it's not normal it's not natural\nWe need one another you know let's say by being a member of a church I'm not preaching church auntie I'm preaching Christianity\nWhen Jesus ever found this lockout bill might tell you and say I'll build your church or you know my church I Will be on my church\nIs made up of people have been born again and I have a deep suspicion\nOf those so called Christianity if anybody says I Believe in Jesus Christ is the\nCornerstone but I don't want to be built together with other brothers and sisters\nInto a beautiful building you see their friend we're bound together and it is to gather that we have significant any individual blocker brick is not all that handsome that beautiful that's not the point is to gather that we have our significant\n\nBut first church building that I had the privilege of leading a church the bill was right after I got out of seminary\nWe build a church in Fort Pierce Florida at least in addition to the church\nThere was an elderly architect who was over our job and he said something to me I think I Will never forget\nAs we were looking at the plans I said miss dry it can be expensive because we don't have much money he said my boy and I want you to listen to this he said my boy good architecture is not an arrangement of beautiful materials\nIt is a beautiful arrangement of materials and that good good architecture is a beautiful arrangement of materials you see the lord can take us in folks we ain't so\nHot but by\nTaking these kind of breaks these kind of stone quarry from the same shape by his Grayson buyers word lie to gather together\nHow wonderfully beautiful as the temple of truth and God says about

P. so I really believe that he's memories and it's very scary because they're they're doing studies and they've been doing studies since the seventies about how these memories are these eyewitnesses you can't really count on eyewitness testimony\n[noise] no I think that's especially true or when it's a cross racial divide witness testimony I saw this prime Rob the bank a lotta times people don't do very well with people of different range from ... just the way we're wired I think it's\nThe it's the way we're wired it also has to do with our upbringing and has to do with uh our our culture and it has to do with our our beliefs\nAnd so everybody's perception and it was just talking this morning about that so if I saw something happened\nMy memory is going to be different than your memory J. P. when you're a guy [laughter] you know men think different than women and your your background my background is going to be different the way my parents raised me my moral characters going to be different all that it's going to affect\nHow I perceive something and then to remember it\nIs just going to depend on how my brain as compared to yours and miss memories\nThe longer that you have had something happen ... right I mean if I asked you\nHey J. P. do you remember when you were in first grade and you had a teacher a and I could I your first grade teacher do you remember what her name was still remember the classes that you took your going to probably say no\nOh although you might remember her name\nWhen you know I look back at your my past just exactly as you're saying\nAnd I remember something in my wife who sometimes those are very clear memory you know that is what it all wrong and you know we pursued a little bit more ... you know my memory one's wrong you're right I think that happens [laughter] I mean you know go back to the or maybe it was in the eighties and nineties when\nI think the Jewish people have a good idea in ... bought the idea being turn off all electronics you're not even supposed to answer the phone if you're a Jewish person nothing electric because you need a break from it and I I think this is\nWhether you believe in it as a religious tradition or you believe in it as a practical way of improving your wife I think a lot to be said for\nExactly I'm like I had the day of rest which was than that you know there used to be those laws and matter of fact in send a little ... they still have the blue lots you remember that\nOh sure oh you know on the\n... the interesting thing is is that some industries have them and watch them for instance the car business likes the fact that in Texas they get a day off because at the\nSame time you know at it and I think it would be great but because of money and that's the way it is\nPeople don't want to go back to just having this Sunday to be with your family teaches a with a environment that you live in your you know your your close friends not these other people that you really don't see every day and we need to get back to that\nSo that's something that we can do ourselves and I think I mean teachers and parents I think we just need to get back to family and some of the old morals that we used to have your worst sort of sort of swaying away from\nTurn the computer off put down the phone and talk to people\nIt's really you know what I think I said if you would put down your town your purse they may be standing right beside you start

next Salem Radio Houston morning show host Sam alone let me do a good friend of bilking a bill a successful businessman\nMirror of a team a ... a couple of years ago he keeps just up to date on the fiscal strength of the city and weakness is like you you can't believe bill happy to see how you doing buddy buddy how you doing\nI'm rocky rocking the free world he before you to the numbers and stuff a story obviously gets giggle that we were talking about for the past two weeks is the robot sex shop that may or may not want to open up shop on the Richmond Strip\n'em in the city is like to know any rules to substitute gross they jumping on this one what do you do if you're the mayor of a solid\nTurner came out today and said I don't endorse this business and you know I I was really quite relieved to hear\nThat I was reading or we're what we're wondering where he's I mean when\nWe had we had a drag queens reading in libraries a little children so you know I was worried about what might come down and it's been like to hear all this stuff is just this is all sides shows to the the big issue you know I was out last night a spring branch the residents against flooding a grass roots organization you know\nOperating without any money just regular folks try and keep their houses and being flooded which happens a lot out there in spring rent has mating had a couple of hundred people show up\nAnd ah and listen to the mayor and dirt made for a while and they also listen to Anchorage Sean Todd let and talked about how the federal government roe was a great great meeting out there and uh I can tell you one thing everybody that meetings voting against prop I I can promise you that\nGo out yeah I mean if you in ways that were just talking about this last night he was he relived it and you remember what had happened it was a couple of days after Harvey when all those homes are just destroyed I mean this is a huge fear of theirs from king would only down anywhere from the ... river authority down to the X. reservoir stuff\nThat there's there's almost no place in Houston Shirley safe from flooding and and that's because you know if you live along the ... you know they're people forget there's there there's there's two kinds of flooding there's the by you being overwhelming backing up into the neighborhoods but then there's also pockets being flooded because we can't get the water\nTo them by fast enough for example the Sam's by watershed a singer by has not been out of its banks since Nineteen Ninety four because a bunch of great work the county and the corps did on that watershed but yet and Harvey we had sixty eight hundred houses flooded in the\nSense of by watershed because the city's infrastructure so outdated\nAnd so poorly maintained it couldn't get the water out of the neighborhoods to that by fast enough even though we had passed by that's a real tragedy\nIs in I don't think there's any new plan like we're still in October right something could always roll our way out in October of it I mean heck Hurricane Sandy waffle new New Jersey in October noodle at the end of the law there\nYou know they're they're still down there taking over half of the drainage and spending it on other things like hiking by coordinators [noise] um you know and I talk to\nYou know I talked to these people that are supporting proposition I and I said well you know we have to have a lock box because we don't have a lock box that can just do anything with the money they're already doing anything with the money I mean the only thing worse\nThan not having any lock box is having a pretend locked box\nThat for ... for protecting the money [laughter]\n'cause you're the one you have an improv you bilking for alerting us under the percentage of money spent on what was supposed to go to flooding right in charge and credible\nAnd although I think about this for a second you know we now have the numbers on what has been spent on infrastructure going back for a fact of two thousand seven and if you take the years from two thousand seven up to two thousand eleven before\nI'm rebuild was Institute and you look at the average we spent all straightened drainage and you take the money after rebuild Houston we're spending less money on streets in drainage now\nThan before we added a hundred million dollars to the pot how is that possible and then we add a hundred million dollars in New revenue and we're spending less money I mean come on it's ridiculous\nNow is to be the response venue rotary I'm an editorial ... uh two or three days ago was Sunday's paper you I'm\nSorry for the chronicle um headline was vote no on property and insist on a real lock boxer flood control funding for that that is like don't touch hot items like common sense right and you know\nBut but you know you've got the same cabal of special interests that are down there supported proposition I because they all make money off of it\nAnd it's a slush fund for the mayor to use every wants to and you've got you know let me tell you what we we need to spend the morning and talked about campaign contributions at the city of Houston something needs to be done to reform the system because special interests are absolutely running city hall for their benefit right now we've got to do something to step in and make sure the average\nVoter the people in spring branch whose houses get flooded every time it comes to rain or in Milan where we need to make sure the city's working for them and not a special interest that fund these campaigns\nWell there's no right to work with the city and you have a business uh you want to keep that contract alive and well right semi\nPromise you they ... like I used to I used to have a business had had government contracts over the country and you'll get calls a day late from people pushing the arm to hate one wants to show up my birthday party and by the way to bring all campaign contribution I sure would be nice got those calls all the time\nIt's amazing shakedown oh and that's why the ... the cities and see presidents okay in terms of growth folks in terms of traffic the mess from the Galleria through the highways are these scandals at city hall something's got to be done something's got to\nBe all your to see the campaign contributions to the landowners along the coast of that we're promoting this ridiculous boast or this bustling project can post out\nWhat's going to have a real quick final question on that that\nI'm not in among the transportation business I'm not an engineer in business I'm just in the business\nOr that is the worst thing that you're putting a bus line\nTo do the Galleria expecting people to write that when they find the numbers crash right when they find the numbers of writers nobody who shopping together is going to stand outside from may to October waiting for a bus okay\nThrough the summer with arranging the humidity women are

and\nCornerstone Jesus Christ and today I'm love worth fighting Adrian Rogers shows us the significance of living our lives on the rock thanks for joining us for another exciting message from our series in first Peter timeless truce for tough times\nNo matter what you're going through today's message will help you learn about your role as a believer\nIn Christ turned to first Peter chapter two in getting ready for some surprising details as we hear Adrian Rogers message life on the rock\nPeter here's talking about the church and how it's built and how it functions and So Peter here talks about the cornerstone of a chair\nAnd any talks about the construction of at your age and then he talks about the character of which are when it talks about the cornerstone of a church he tells us something to believe him when he talks about the construction of a church\nHe's really talking about someone to love and to be loved by\nAnd then when it talks about the character of the church he's talking about something to do let's see if that's not true now that cornerstone\nA cornerstone of the church is Jesus Christ our churches built this church any church any Christian Church is built upon the Lord Jesus Christ\nJesus Christ is that very special that various elect stone none like him among the sons of man he is precious to the\nFather Jesus would hear the father said to him this is my beloved son and whom I'm well please brand Jesus Christ is the object of the father's love Jesus Christ is a precious stone shows and I've got a pay attention\nThere is no way that you can know God the father without knowing God the sun\nBarriers no way that you can't ignore God the sun without ignoring got the ball there is no way that you can't worship the father except through the sun for Jesus said I Am the way the truth and the light and no man come down to the father but by me he is that she lacked stone none other like\nThe Lord Jesus Christ some people stumble on the cornerstone\nNow you see less\nEvery man every woman every boy every girl\nSomehow some way comes in contact with Jesus Christ\nSome way somehow and their friend Jesus Christ will be for you\nEither a stepping stone into heaven\nOr a stumbling stone into hell\nNow you can't be neutral about Jesus Christ\nEither you rise only are you following easier said by him\nOr you're judged by an\nAdded Jesus Christ is not for you a cornerstone Jesus Christ is for you a stumbling stones\nSo I say you will either stand on hammer fall by him but you will not walk around him you will be with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Suzanne is capable Jesus Christ is an avid all Jesus Christ\nIs on a ... you cannot be neutral of Jesus Christ and what you do with Jesus Christ determines what Jesus Christ will do with you to many he is a stumbling stone\nJesus Christ is a wrong\nWhen you believe in Jesus Christ\nYou're not walking around on egg shells and jello\nJesus\nChrist is solid therefore the Bible says that whenever a person\nBelieves in him he will not be disappointed he will not be ashamed he will not be confounded\nLet's change the figure not only that we see Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of a jerk but we see ourselves as individual building blocks in that church and so let's think about the construction of the church looking for a spy ... also\nAs living stones at says lively stones that means leaving stones are built up a spiritual house so now knows what he's saying he also that is the things that are true Jesus Christ\nIn a sense so true about us\nBecause he's living stone he's in Austin where and ham therefore we barriers nature therefore we also have supernatural lie\nWe also are living stones way to be like him have you ever heard somebody say of a of a boy who is a lot like his dad he's a chip off the block a chip off the one block what does that mean shares the nature of his pop\nAnd bread I Want to tell you the sense of what you were a child of God is a chip off that block we are letting stones we are like our dear lord\nHey part of Jesus Christ now\nBecause this is true\nBecause this is true I Want you to notice three things with me first of all we are built together noticed this embraced by\nYou also as living stones are built up a spiritual house not notice she's talking about a spiritual has not a material house\nMember confused a building with a church going to be like that man when they asked him in a form to fill out what is your church preference he said red brick no\nListen we have a church the people\nBut he speaks of us and a figure of speech as being\nBlocks bricks stones in that building built upon Jesus Christ the cheap cornerstone now the very first thing is that we are built to gather\nYou see what is the significance of a stone out on the ground not much not much to see you step forward you pay no attention to it but you take that stone and put it with a lot of other stones and it becomes a beautiful temple as the master architect assembles these stones together\nNow for it and that's what Jesus Christ is doing with us by ourselves we're not all so much you know some people out there well I Believe in Jesus but I just don't believe in the church [laughter] how many one brick buildings have you seen\nI mean you know I just take one stone\nAntibiotic cages rolling around and moving around\nBut take a lot of them together and the train\nThat's what our lord is doing to us he is building us together and I am beginning strength from you and you are to gain strength from me and it's amazing what we can do as we're built together but not only are we built together because we built together we are bound together\nBound together we're on one end up by law and monitor that holds us together is the law but we are committed one to another rear end it together we're bound together\nSuppose the stones in the basement of this building said well is none of their business what I Do so I'm going out this afternoon and then comes the roof\nI mean we're together\nWhen it together I Am standing all Latinos they're standing on me I'm standing with some standing with me and we near Fran are together and we\nBonded together many of you have never made that kind of a commitment you're trying to be a Lone Ranger\nChristian\nYou can't say Jesus yes in the church you know if you love Jesus you love what Jesus loves I said if you love God you love Jesus and if you love Jesus you love what Jesus loves and Jesus loves the church and Jesus Christ gave himself for the church\nYou say what can be a Christian without being a member of church\nGonna be be be without a hive\nTennis sailor be assailant without a ship\nThat a person to be a parent without a family\nI suppose you might figured out some way somehow for a little while that might be so but it's not normal it's not natural\nWe want to know\nYou're not saying by being a member of a church I'm not preaching church auntie I'm preaching Christianity\nWhen Jesus ever found this lockout bill my church here and say I'll build your church or you know my church I Will be on my\nChurch is made up of people have been born again and I have a deep suspicion\nOf the so called Christianity it anybody who says I Believe in Jesus Christ is the cornerstone\nBut I don't want to be built together with other brothers and sisters into a beautiful building you see their friend were bound together and that is to gather that we have significant any individual blocker brick is not all that handsome that beautiful that's not the point is to death or we have our significant\nBut first church building that I had the privilege of leading a church the bill was right after I got out a seminary we build a church in Fort Pierce Florida at least in addition to the church there was an elderly architect who was over our job and he said something to me I think I Will never forget\nAs we were looking at the plans I said most dry it can be expensive because we don't have much money he said my boy and I want you to listen to this he said my boy\nGood architecture is not an arrangement of beautiful materials it is a beautiful arrangement of materials and that good good architecture is a beautiful arrangement of materials\nThat makes him a hypocrite\nBut what I can see why he believes that makes him a Christian\nThat about ... believe aligned heart that Jesus is law and about ... that's what I'm Out the Lord Jesus and shout believe in my heart that got it raised him from the dead now Shelby said now France as a believer priest therefore you're in a ring those bell and if you are not owning your dad\n\nSaid Jesus said if you are ashamed of me and my word before they send falling adulterous generation I'll be ashamed of you when I come in the ... the father with all the angels\nThe Bible says here we are to show for his brain why when I pray I say come finally publicly confessed\nThat caused the Bible teaches at my dear friend you as a believer priests have a bell to rain but not only are we to ring the bells and tell the people\nWe're aware the fruit and show the people a man\nNot only the bells but the fruit now what about a man who's always confessing Christ but there's no fruit in his life\nHe's not say\nYou're not say by bearing fruit but you're saying to bear fruit and so there's a beautiful thing here are bailing a pomegranate bell and a pomegranate Bello pomegranate ballot pomegranate\nBarriers that profession and possession how beautiful it is and all my hammock my garment today hire those golden bell and I won't last just from the front of a fan\nOf Jesus Christ showing my life because he has made me hey hey wait for Easter he had my probably just going to the throne room\nMy friend my practice just offer spiritual sacrifices at my passion is to show his praises hey let those golden ring a bell ring the bells and tell people had for some people but Jesus Christ\nIs a little more [noise] we're priest of

something God has given us an open door to do or not here to manipulate anybody or to try to convince anybody that you're wrong and on right we're just here to give you some information casually it's always interesting to run into people who wanted to convince you how wrong you are even though you don't ask them [laughter]\nSo there's always a few people floating around out there that want to square you away and you have to be careful with those sort of people and they were not that sort of person [noise] we're not trying to square you away we're just trying to offer you some information and if you don't agree with information turn the radio off and listen to something else it's just that simple\nBecause it's your free will your volition your choice to listen and I appreciate it if you listen and I appreciate it if I'm able to give you some scripture from the word of God that would encourage you to help you direct you in your life\nToday we want to talk about something that uh I think is key for our times is called political bitterness political bitterness\nCan having a flat lined last time we talked about the necessity of having a fly Lennon here so we showed you that from the Bible and first bigger ... Be Sober and alert and your enemy the devil goes around like Aurora in line prowling about looking for someone to devour\nAnd so we showed you the reasons why you should have a flat line in your solar powered line of troops that fellow tea and mainland resistance so you can stop the outside sources of adversity\nBefore they ever become the inside source of stress and that's why we always say a ... habitable stresses optional so having a flat lined in your so keeps you even from becoming bitter\nBitter and antagonistic towards those who appear to be demanding a different way of life\nA politician who doesn't think like you know or act like using one who appears to be totally contrary to anything God's word says about civility or establishment concepts\nIt's very easy to get aggravated that these people very easy to get angry with these people especially when you see how unrealistic some of their demands are you don't know their intentions you don't know their desires but it's pretty obvious\nThey want to take this country in a different direction than what maybe you want it to go so let me give you some principals considering some brushes that we want to try to think about and live by these days of contention in politics\nAnd the first principle number one is no believer in the Lord Jesus Christ is charged by God to change the politics of any country it's not our job to convince people to be Republicans are to be libertarians are to be Democrats it's not our job\nTo our job is to represent Jesus Christ as citizens of a foreign country\nAnd not to try to change the political system we don't belong here we are just Sojourners the Bible says we are just passing through\nYes I'm an American and yes you are an American citizen and we have a citizenship in this country but we actually have a dual citizenship we have an earthly citizenship which is here and we have a heavenly citizenship the word heaven who run us and that's in heaven that's gone\nAnd so three has a royal ambassador door of Jesus Christ we are not citizens of this country we have a heavenly citizenship but we serve in the devils world\nWe've been left here we are still here we are not in the oven and so there's a real reason why we're here there's something that our master wants us to do as a bachelor's\nWe represent him just like any ambassador would represent the president of the foreign to a foreign government\nWe represent Jesus Christ Paul wrote in Libyans three versus twenty and Twenty one hour citizenship is in heaven and we eagerly awaited savior from there\nThe Lord Jesus Christ the first Twenty one who by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control\nOr transform our lowly body so that they may be like his glorious body that's a reference to the exit resurrection you may know it as are the rapture of the church when the Lord Jesus Christ she'll appear in the air force that's phony and for and we which are alive and remain together she'll be caught up with them and their and social with the with the lord\nWell enrollment is Thirteen one through five the Bible says let everyone be subject to the governing authority is for there is no authority accept that which God had established\nSo here's the first principle anyone in authority over you God put them there\nThat's right God put them there and you said well that's the biggest jerk intent you know what he believes God put him there the Bible says this here it is there is no authority except that which God has established\nIf God allowed it to happen remembered Jesus Christ controls history\nThe Supreme Court of happened is open twenty four hours a day nobody gets away with anything God is well aware of what's going on and sometimes got allows a nation to go on a divine discipline because we reject the concepts of divine institutions and sometimes he may even allow people to be put over you\nThat hey shoes in order to discipline you in order to bring you back to where you need to be and so the authorities Romans Thirteen one through five the authorities that exists had been established by God I'm quoting now the Bible\nConsequently whoever rebels against the authorities rebelling against what God has instituted and those who do show will bring judgment on themselves God does not authorize a revolution are that he authorizes you to love your enemy\nHe authorizes you to replicate the life of Jesus Christ he authorizes you to give the gospel not to bring a revolution\nFor rulers verse three whole no terror for those who do right\nBut for those who do wrong [laughter] yeah you bet that's my words there so do you want to be free from the fear of wanting authority the Bible ask than do what's right\nAnd you will be committed for the one in authority is God's serve it for your good but if you do wrong be afraid for retailers do not bear the sword for no reason they're gods servants agents of are asked to bring punishment on the wrong newer\nVersus five therefore it's necessary to submit to the authorities not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience not away Rome was in charge when he wrote this\nIn Rome wasn't exactly giving Christians front row seat and praising them they were burning 'em at stake throwing them in the lines than watching them be executed\nYou understand what I'm saying you must be in submitting to government authority\nNot allowed to run your mouth and run them down and curse him and slander them and and try to convince everybody that would be better off with a different president or we'd be better off with a different government that's not good job with a believer in Jesus Christ God can divine intervene in history\nGone can intervene in history lesson to probably Twenty one virtue won the kings heart is in the hands of the lord as the reverse of water he turns it whereas there so ever he wishes\nSo God is perfectly capable of turning any government it'll authorities mind in a different direction let me quote what am I passed you're taught me a long time ago I'm quoting from his notes that I took my tour believers and I hope that you and the two of the labor\nMature believers have an invisible impact in history\nThat's invisible most people won't even know you're out there matured believers have blessing by association to those in their periphery those who come around you my cup run a silver surely goodness in ... following me all the days of my life and when you when when if you're around material believe are you going to be having blessing by association\nThree often histories the story of how we control the strong especially in politics\nBecause a weak insecure thoughtless arrogant people often controlled a policy or the procedures and people and social life people in culture business marriage government as well as local churches that is true so\nSort of Arabs it's self centered this preoccupation with self the weekends society controlled and manipulate the strong often\nThis is why irrational self righteous crusaders often dominate in politics\nAnd in government administration and this is how a power mad irresponsible press can dominate and destroy great leaders are potentially great leaders so there are two choices here\nThere is power politics are there's the pivot [noise] two approaches to problem solving the pivot or power politics power politics is a human satanic solution to the problems with life problems in America oh we\nNeed a new leader we need a new government we need a new way of thinking we we need to have this we need to be that we need this we need that and they want to change change change will listen if you took everybody in the United states and moved on to Mars\nHe would still have the same problems because of the problem is the nature\nThere are sin nature it doesn't make any difference who you elect who he put in office everybody has a sin nature and in spite of where they are they're still going to be the same way\nSo power politics is the human solution the satanic solution just let me run the show and I'll take care of you I'll give you free this and free that now make sure you never have to worry about anything again oh that sounds so good let's vote for that one\nBut then the pivot is the other side of the coin pivot politics that you if you're a material reliever includes people that know Christ the savior who advancing the plan of God through their perception and the application of the word of God and reach spiritual maturity\nThose people become part of the downed that holds back divine discipline on arrogant nation\nThe ... without a peasant and the United states of America is done for we wouldn't be a hundred event discipline and we'd be destroyed without a pivot so with renovating thinking\nWe are able to function with the mindset of Christ are to acquire defined viewpoint [noise]\nWe have to change the way we've saying demand viewpoint has to be learned is not inherited\nAs a second Timothy to Fifteen seconds Peter three Eighteen Matthew eleven twenty eight and thirty all talk about study grow and learn steady grow and learn you can't know the mind of Christ unless you were oh bless you learn it you had somebody has to teach it to you\nSo why do you need the thinking of Christ and you're so who because Jesus said and Matthew ten twenty two you're going to be hated by all of these for my namesake\nAnd Matthew ten twenty eight don't be afraid of those who killed the body but cannot kill the so and Matthew ten thirty four I didn't come to bring peace but as sort the very fact that you're a believer in Jesus Christ\nAnd the very fact that you believe the Bible is true the very fact that you're not into the diversity and all of this stuff you're not trying to make everything that used to be evil good\nThis is going to cause you to be hated called wicked in evils names because you believe what the Bible says they have all the power politics is amazing because those who seek to control will say anything and do anything to gain control\nAnd they will often use unsuspecting young people who believe the public law I call it drink the Kool Aid if you tell it often enough loud enough and long enough it's going to be believed\nAnd that's the power of the press repeat repeat repeat repeat the ...\nThis is the devils world and he certainly does not won't you or anyone like you messing up his world system called evil in the Bible\nAnd we can now see what used to be good is turned evil that diversity thinking and inclusion in what used to be evil has been transformed into good\nHas an alternative lifestyle\nIt's illegal but our mission is to stay out of politics to stay out of condemnation and criticism and to lift up the Lord Jesus Christ in Haiti will draw men to himself\nWe are allied of the world light attracts you know you can be a ... for the Lord Jesus Christ light attracts\nAnd you can attract the bugs who need the truth so ... I mean let me tell you how this goes\nWe are told to equip ourselves for the battle but we're going to face according to a phase in six eleven through Eighteen do we do it by building a flat lining are so that's how we do it All right and so we do it by crying a spiritual life\nAnd submitting to God's rained away got trains us okay if agents for Seventeen so I tell you this and insist on it\nIn the lord that's the proposition of phrase is just not pause opinion this is from the lord and the lord that you do not live like ... live in the futility of their thinking and they don't have the mountains of Christ you do their minds are empty\nTheir dark and in their understanding the just for Seventeen to thirty two and separated from the life of God because of their ... and they ... their hearts are hard\nTo your personal financial freedom to be able to retire and our\nGovernment for probably two or three generations now has convinced us that retirement is an age and they keep bumping that age I write so at one point it was sixty\nAnd then it was sixty five now they're recommending you wait tell what sixty seven sixty eight\nAnd they've done a great job of marketing this so when you ask somebody when are you going to retire the answer is typically well I think I can retire at and they're going to nail one of the ages that they have heard that typically is associated when they can begin to take Social Security\nOr when they're financial planner has recommended they take Social Security 'cause the big thing now is hey everybody wait\nWait to take your Social Security so yesterday I posted on Facebook that I was going to be doing the radio show today and I got a bunch of articles that different friends on Facebook sent to me\nAnd let my flying [laughter] started doing some research because it's been a long time since I've looked into your retirement plans and what financial planners are saying and I have to tell you folks that\nThe biggest scam at least one of the biggest scams perpetrated on the American people is the four oh one K. and the IRA and I'm going to take that on today it might be painful for you but stay with me through the entire show because I Do have a solution for you\nBut before I roll off the solution I'm going to roll out what this really looks like\nAnd I think this is going to be one of those experiences for you that as soon as someone says it you realize it's true but up until that point you haven't thought much about it as a matter of fact we're trained not to think about it\nYou know what else are we trained not to think about were trained not to think about the taxes we pay why\nHow did the IRS accomplished that but the IRS and four one K. plants accomplish it exactly the same way they take this money out before it reaches your pocket you feel very differently about both your taxes and your contributions to your four one K.\nIf you had to write a check every month\nTo fund both of those you'd be very aware of what your pay every month you would be asking yourself does this make sense should I be doing this where is this money going what is happening to what is my return on it\nFrom attacking his point of view our return on it as the\nPublic services that we receipt yeah how are those potholes and your community\nAnd they're getting better and my community and far north Dallas but uh boy still you wonder where is all this money going right and all the other myriad of services that are provided\nFor our taxes but you'd be much more critical about the efficiencies of government if you were writing that check every month instead of it being taken out of your pay before you get a hold of what's left [noise] same with the four one K. if you had to write a check\nOr do an electronic deposit to your four O. one K. every month you'd be looking at those returns much closer you'd be much more aware that the games on your four one K. or the money you're putting in every month not necessarily what you're earning\nSo if you have a four O. one K. if you have an IRA if you know someone who does and you care about them or you're anticipating starting to contribute to a four one\nK. or an IRA the show is for you so before I really get rolling this was the best time to give me a call and ask the question the number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven\nSo I read one article that just let my fire and a out of all of them that I I looked at I think this is the one that\nReally highlights what the problem is\nAnd the lack of critical thinking\nAnd folks if we don't bring critical thinking back to her everyday decisions we're all going to have a future that we're not prepared for and it isn't going to be the one we're hoping for\nSo this article was published by the Motley Fool and it's by a writer named Selina Meyer and John\nAnd I'm just going to reach a little bit about what she says it give\nYou my color commentary as we go through this she says that a whopping forty six percent of Americans say they will not have enough money in retirement I'd argue with you that that's actually hire these are the people who are aware they won't have enough money uh doesn't really count for the people who\nSee rainbows and unicorns and think somehow they will have enough money and that one in five Americans older than sixty five are still working because they can't afford to retire\nOne in five again I think that number might be a little higher\nAnd she goes on to give some tips about preparing for retirement and her first tip\nI actually agree with it is to make a plant\nJust have hair he's different opinion about what an effective plan for retirement is but Salinas suggest\nThat you start by estimating how much income you'll need each year in retirement while I Do agree with that\nBut we talked about lifestyle planning the first thing to do is to figure out what kind of lifestyle you want to live what are all the components what do you want to do where do you want to live do you want to stay in your current home do you have a mortgage on that home how much is that how much is your property taxes how much is upkeep and maintenance\nYou got a plan to replace HVAC systems and water heaters and all kinds of things over time in your home\nSo what are those expenses look like over the span of your retirement do you want to vacation\nDo you want us to take the grandkids bond fund trips what kind of cars do you want to drive how often are you going to replace them right on and on and on you design that lifestyle so she doesn't go into that here but we'll give her credit for uh having the insight that if she was actually working with you she would go into that lifestyle design and you come up with a number\nHow much do you need on a monthly yearly basis in order to enjoy your retirement to have the retirement of your dreams\nHay and she goes on to encourage you to be conservative in case you encounter some unexpected expenses or your estimates turn out to be a little too rosy hey good advice\nAnd then she says to tally up your various income sources such as Social Security any pension income well how many people have pensions at this point\nNot very many usually public workers government workers they still have pensions but they're chopping away at those and and see how much income you'll need to generate on your own\nArt so again her vision is that most of America and she's probably right are dependent upon Social Security\nAnd then a small handful folks comparatively of some sort of pension coming the rest you got to figure out [noise] so the average annual Social Security she says is Seventeen thousand dollars a year\nThat's fourteen hundred dollars a month and I\nI think everyone is aware at this point that if you're going to try and live off Social Security you're going to have a lifestyle vastly reduced from what you're used to living\nSo she goes on to say that if you think you'll need a total of fifty thousand dollars a year to get by and retirement and you expect to get twenty\nA person from Social Security so already\nShe warns us to be conservative and then she's bumped up that average is Seventeen to twenty thousand that's an Eighteen percent increase\nSo she's already using a number from Social Security that's Eighteen percent higher than the average Social Security benefits but we'll just go with her numbers for the sake of of this analogy\nThen you need to figure out where the other thirty thousand is coming from\n\nAll
