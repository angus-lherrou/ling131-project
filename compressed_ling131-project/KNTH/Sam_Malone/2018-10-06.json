it's one eight hundred for nine eight one two three four nine\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium in their body\nWell that's the thing is that the fish and these are not like I'm a water main break in or you have written notice all things considered on trips little leaks here and there and do what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late [laughter]\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this ... formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I did a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk in my back in ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula and I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour\nI was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over a ten day period it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body\nBeing hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I ... for the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula and um\nShe said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends and that's amazing\nAnd when I use it with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up and their mothers were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that to such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last Fifteen Years they American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system well those are very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body and experience and because of the fishing and many of them is also blocking further absorption\nThough it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose\nFolks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call each one eight hundred for nine eight one two three four nine ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium\nThat gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd want to let you know the Dr ... says arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free

body is telling you is lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress\nYou know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis if you want to improve your heart health your digestive health and human reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to kill max formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred for nine eight one tree for nine\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks this book is packed with vital information about why your calcium needs change with age\nCount seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression fatigue it's all in this very informative book\nAnd Chris are you going to give away after my comments off color so\nIt's really important for your listeners to pick up the phone and take advantage of that\nWill thank you for doing that Dr pain 'cause I really appreciate it folks and this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred for nine eight one two three four nine I remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred\nFor nine eight one two three four nine I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for nine eight one two three four nine\nThey just tuned in we're talking with Dr Michael Pincus about stress and the negative effects that everyday stress has on your body whether it's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how you're killing ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress\nAnd I guess this is something everyone should be aware of whether you're\nTwenty four or Ninety four\nWell I used that for many many years as as a younger person and now I'm ... [laughter] well I use it then it definitely helps me sleep better it helps control the stress of the working world and many people will just be amazed how this actually works\nBecause our formula has a chemical reaction occurred before you actually adjusted mhm count Mac is pre dissolve it doesn't get lost in your system\nAnd so what happens is that when people drink the ... it's like an infusion into your body is like why was like ... and so people who are in pain they take the comments the calcium magnesium get into the muscles and it starts to relax it\nDr biggest you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate a little bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy levels\nGood question because energy is like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS and fibromyalgia like wiping people out and that's the key to low energy is a lot of it's caught by pain\nFeeling old your joints don't move well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then then you get tired and you go to sleep guess what you don't sleep\nNow I'm telling you like common scenarios due to lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the ... in the first thing that happened you'd take twenty minutes before you go to bed ... get a good night's sleep\nYou wake up feeling refreshed energy comes back\nIt's comics safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\n... never ever been shown to interact with any medication okay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know it doesn't sugar which isn't a lot of calcium product\nWheat gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid doesn't have any of that\nBut you see the point that if you're a person or the diabetic your high blood pressure you had a bypass surgery\nGuess what you are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\nDown get through it that the same way I work through it on the air hundreds of times before about fifty plus years of broadcasting and after all it's not like I'm operating a jak came on a construction site or something like oh I'm doing ... member nice air conditioned studio talking on a microphone\nSo there's lots of you out there who have the same symptoms are hair your job is a lot more physically demanding the modern Europe were today show who am I the ... second brand new you've still got the greatest job in the world enjoy it\nI Am determined to have some fun today on the board seafood outdoor cooking show so I Hope you will to end of around\n... start off by reporting I did receive a number of really nice comments about last week's show you remember when we featured nothing but amateurs chefs one was mind mechanic of sorry automotive technician mark McIlroy whose name he told me that\nAnd the market and here's an junior own and operate hope automotive in Missouri city but mark loves to cook out in the back yard he owns about three different cookers you are beginning to understand that really dedicated at home or back yard Jeff almost always on more than one cooker\nBut I must confess that I don't\nI just got one gas grill out on the patio I I guess that means I have been born an average urban people are smart Diane crowds who was our other amateur at home share on last week's show Diane was the editor for my book Houston's morning show the true story approach with inherited\nAre dying game is a drop dead good recipe for ... with Jimmy juries sauce we've been published the tire recipe on our Facebook page check it out\nThere before you're pointing dinner tonight it is absolutely mouth watering oh and the mention of our Facebook page reminds me we need to be older you marry bag which of course who's actually nothing more than a private mess\nIt's on our Facebook page ... listeners seems to feel the same way about last week showed that many of your did listen\nI Love the show on an amateur chefs and I especially enjoy when you ask people about their backgrounds and what else they do besides cooking at home I thought it was fascinating to hear them talk about how the auto repair business in the book publishing business have changed over the years\nBut you didn't tell us how the radio business has changed please take time to do that okay that's actually a fair point you know a lot of times I overlook the obvious that's why I Love to hear your criticisms of the way I host the board seafood outdoor cooking show [noise]\nYes I should have spent some time setting up the question was about how marks business and how Diane's industry have changed over the years\nAnd I could have easily done that by showing how the broadcasting industry has changed too but I just kinda dropped the ball and put it out to do that so I'll do that right now I guess it goes without saying\nThat the technical side of broadcasting has changed a great deal since I started a business as a teenager back in the sixties I mean I Can't even remember black and white TV\nBut there are a lot of other elements more human elements that have changed too and one of the biggest things is ownership of radio and TV stations\nWhen I got my first job at the age of Fifteen I knew the owners of the stations I worked for on a first name basis well I didn't actually called them by their first names I called them Mr Mays and Mr molten\nBut I did know them personally I saw him at the station on a fairly regular basis I even knew where they live I can call them at home if I needed to\nAim short the owners of most radio and TV stations back in those days actually lived in the cities where the stations were located it's a matter of fact local ownership of broadcasting out that she was encouraged by the FCC back in those days\nBecause defense thought if the owner lived in the same area he or she would be more responsive to the needs of the community as a matter of fact that's where that old phrase broadcasting in the public interest comes from\nThese days of course almost all broadcasting properties are owned by big huge corporations in New York City so all the people on the local level like may\nHave absolutely no idea who the owner is and in fact the owner is most likely aboard a stock holders somewhere and none of those people are actually broadcasters\nVery certainly don't think like broadcasters\nNow the people who own this radio station are the exception to that rule this company is owned and operated by people who are interested in more than just the bottom line and clicks a wide chairs on our website somewhere\nThey actually try to create compelling radio and they maintained that local connection with shows like this one hand to say I'm Alone show Monday through friday where you can actually hear someone from Houston talking about what's going on in Houston\nAnd that's another thing that's drastically changed about the broadcasting industry over the years\nMost of the programming you hear is not live anymore when I first started that one of my home town radio stations in Fort Worth we were live on the air twenty four hours a day seven days a week three hundred sixty five days a year\nBut that's rarely the case now again this radio station ease the outlier not only is this am alone show live every morning Monday through friday but so are almost all the other shows you hear hear get it\nAnd you may not be able to discern but when you're listening to music radio station you know like the stations that I used to be on an Sam used to be on to\nWhen you're listening to music radio station it's almost always a pre recorded show not wise now it may be locally produced but it's not live\nAnd the fact of the matter is those are just two of the many ways that radio is changed since I first got in the business back when I was a teenager but you know one thing that doesn't change is that the boy in seafood outdoor cooking show always comes back around to food\nYou know cooking food the best part eating food\nOctober is national pasta month and today Saturday is national noodle day you know now that I stop and think about it I have always wondered are pasta and noodles the same\nThing is that just me am I the only one who think\nYeah I'm probably the only one who thinks that bus Illinois answer so I'm going to ask our guests chef about that today and there's another question I Want answered I'm going to ask my own radio program Fred Olson about his earliest memory of pasta as a child now I Know that sounds a little random\nBut when I was planning out this show or childhood memory came to mind was actually one of those manufactured memories you know where people have told the story about you as a kid so many times that you think you can remember when in fact you were actually way too young to remember anything at All right [noise]\nAnd proof of that fact is that I was just learning to talk when this happened my mother had cooked macaroni and cheese says a side dish for dinner one night apparently I loved it all kids love macaroni\nAnd cheese right so when I had to eat and all of the macaroni and cheese I reportedly held up my plate and said more Mackey\nD's please\nMy parents thought that was so adorable they told a story for years had told it for the rest of their lives really and the U.S was born by love affair with carbs oh here's a good idea maybe you have a story like that you know about food any food\nSend us appeared on our Facebook page the outdoor cooking show and who knows I might rabid on the air\nSo let's celebrate national pasta month than national noodle day today on the boys seafood outdoor cooking show and I'll just try to ignore\nFeeling a little simply because\nThis to show pasta that's a ... year old boy I say I'm pasta Marion Jones old cut piece of slack whether you're not feeling good okay\n\nYou're accused gone up in smoke and you're cooking reputation is at stake tinker around\nThe old rules are two we'll

have that created element and showcase what we can do and reach a few more people so it's really worked out very well for us because there is that market for that out here to private than it has worked out really well\nBut that's only the beginning ... also offers cooking classes so fill us in on all the details from cooking classes\nMaybe that's the thing is you know we have we done a couple of demonstrations already because we're in the country or a little lower so it gets it gets boring pretty easily [laughter]\nA lot of great things to see it's a beautiful sight to see but you know if you want to find something to do on a weeknight or you know we can lead to kind of tough so we offer classes and we think to get out of there for people to kind of get out and do something different

another advantage at college do you are a joy in Germany should there near how it's real it's the close proximity to farms and ranches where you require fresh vegetables fresh fruits fresh meats to prepare for your customers talk about that for a minute why is that so important\nFinding local farms ranches it's incredibly important to us just because it's one of those things that when he worked in Austin\nWe're fortunate to have you know big budget tour quit so we can get really good at high quality ingredients work with local farms as a lot of problems and often that we were able to go out to the day of look at a product say yes we like to bring it back to the restaurant\nComing out here it's a little different because you know there's a lot longer drive [laughter] yeah we have to go out and find these farms and they're all out there because a lot of fun to go to\nAustin to the farmer's markets that participate in those that were just had the luxury of being a little closer to them out here\nIt's just a different set of farms and it's really important to us because working it off and we got used to that high quality angry and knowing are farmers knowing who came from and

that much but all thumbs your fingers or\nA ...\nA ... a lot of positives news but anything that are out of work really well\nMost of us don't even more room pasta and I've had several professional chefs and cooking instructors assure me that it's not as daunting as you surrounds would you concur with that opinion\nUh well no having having learned who basically by myself and I didn't go to\nCome in in school so he had to teach myself and with the with the guidance from a few people I'm off the can be difficult it's very very hard\nBut once you get your recipe that you liked it can get easier but the first time you make it you know it's a tough it can be a there is definitely a learning curve there you know grandmothers and it'll even working on it for decades and still mess up some time so don't feel bad if you mess it up herself the first twenty times like I probably did\nSo tell us how to make pasta from scratch right there at home in our own kitchen\nBut some of the great thing about a ... is it in its purest form and his flour and water um it can you know somebody of flowers justify finder and wheat flour you can buy it at a lot of stories that I actually even out here where we're at you can find it pretty much anywhere so\nCertainly the flour and water and I don't you have the right ratio and recipe but just for the same way that it becomes more important to the feel of it how you touch it how you need it how you're comfortable with it so there's no right or wrong way they do it there's ways to do it in a kitchen aid mixer there's the food processor method he can do it by hand\nAnd it really is just about fighting the best way about what's comfortable for you to do so\nJak showed was forty five and Louis or recall nine three states three or four six one by

of get the real simple let's go back to the hotel and get dressed stuff that we can go out to dinner and we didn't do that with this kind of kept her clothes from I could have just ended up where we ended up and I think we had a lot more fun to be a spontaneous that way\nWill send me an hour only been to Jacksonville one time and were that time we went up to Yellowstone one song straight so that was pretty cool but the thing that stuck with me about that trip was burned out Kimber yeah from some forest fires that had been going on in Yellowstone extremely expensive at that time but that was\nOver a decade ago I guess all of that's going back now huh\n... years ago I took a ... one of the big fires and we were taking a tour and to this guy we had driving through there and he was a local his name is Robert Louis Stevenson runaway wow\nA true story anyway and I\nAnd I was looking at a hillside goes look that way for those trees to grow as they have to reach a certain temperature in the ground all over the years for them to open up and crack at it and to reach you in it for us\nSo it's a good thing and I found my grandkids will have a whole new Yellowstone and we can see over the years the last ten years or so since this happened a lot of the areas that are going back even the last couple of years we went on for two years ago I had been to the fire and it was kind of sad but now some of these trees or you know they took a couple of the tea or\nSome of these trees are meant to use a four feet tall wire already wow this is where the fire was so they can tell you know late for work\nSo you got back Sunday night I guess that means you didn't have to see him do are ugly when the protections got Mandy wants to do while\nWe had to lay over in Denver and I I was looking

tax situation\nBut we're taking phone calls today live seven what three three three Nineteen Seventy seven what three three three nine ten Seventy is the phone number so if you have any questions when we're talking about the changes to the changes we'll be happy to discuss it with you All right so you're saying All right bark whether the changes to the changes here\nAnd the big change this week is that the IRS came out and said\nThat previously in the law that meals\nThe fifty percent meal to duck session\nWas no longer allowed for business entertainment because meals entertainment in the law we're lumped together\nIn one particular section section two Seventy four for those who like to know about what section code is but for you is just that it was lumped together as meals that entertainment\nAnd so we're going to go through what happened with the sort of the history of what happened to them where we are to day or what happened last Wednesday to change things so we are going to be talking about that today on the show\nAll right what happened was last December the biggest change which we've been saying other show in prior shows in Thirty years since Nineteen eighty six\nThere were a lot of changes over five hundred pages of changes\nThe tax law and it wasn't just the tax rates there were a lot of other changes in there and what we've been saying well you have to pass the bill to find out what's in it I really don't know of anyone in Congress read all five hundred pages they usually give it to their staffers\nMan the Stafford over there or you know bleary eyed looking through all this stuff try to go through it and tried to see what's in here and what's in this law\nGo through it and try to tell the Congress man or came congresswoman what is in there\nSo what happened is is last December\nThere was a tax law big tax law changed past and what we alerted to people what happens after that is that tax professionals we have to take that five hundred page document and go through there and say OK Now let's see what they actually did hear what did they actually change here\nAnd what provisions are different now it is because people\nWant to know they said well bar ... what is the tax rules going to be for next year how can I plan my business or plan\nWhat I'm doing with my taxes unless you tell me what the new law says so that's what the professionals do we actually sit\nDown and go through a ... page by page very very mundane people don't want to do it but that's what we that's our job that's what we do and so we go through there and we actually say okay here's what the new\nLaw says All right one of the big deals was is that came in there that meals and entertain but they used to be fifty percent the\nThe ball like you take your client out to lunch or you go to a ball game and you take your client out to a ball game you take him to the Texas game and then you buy 'em hotdogs in a beer or you buy something a little bit more of a larger than that used to be fifty percent deductible\nUnder the old tax law well under the changes meals and entertainment said\nNo more no more fifty percent\nGod is so we're saying okay that's what Congress wrote that is what the I guess it tended to do and so therefore that's what they did\nAnd so therefore you know they that was the law and we said okay this is where it is and this is the new provision and you need to plan accordingly\nAll right there was a lot of ... there was a lot of people to the restaurant business there's a lot of people in the business industries that are used a lot of effort entertainment going oh my gosh you can't be serious that's what they did\nAnd so therefore we're saying yeah that's what they did and that's how they wrote it and so that's what happened and so we're going in there okay this is the rule that it is and so\nUh there are a lot I Know I got a lot of phone calls that people were calling their congressmen or congresswoman and saying how could you do this to us you need to fix this you need to take care of this and so\nYou know and they're going well the house we could try to pass it through the house ways and means but the Senate's dealing with Supreme Court nominees and all this other stuff they're not going to be have any apt to fix this go revisit this deal\nAnd so right now we're sort of stuck and so that was where was\nUntil last Wednesday and that's what we're going to ... through after the break we're going to tell you\nHow the iris there was a new interpretation and it just came out last Wednesday and it's going to be in here and we're going to talk to you after the break concerning this and it's got to be about what they did and how they got meals\nMeals only not entertainment meals to now be fifty percent deductible\nAnd so we're going to go through how did this and you go by mark how do they do that well it's going to be very very interesting and sort of how the how they did it and so uh we're going to talk about what is called an iris notice that came out when states notice two oh one a day seven eight\n\nTo a one eight seven six ... me too oh what a day seven six and we're going to talk to you about what the notice says go through it in particular with you so that you know how to apply to your particular situation and I would say you have to apply to your particular situation\nAnd there are very strict guidelines on it so you've got to have to follow the guidelines and we're going to go through some examples\nSo we're going to discuss that but if you have any questions seven when three three three Nineteen Seventy seven won three three three nine ten Seventy we're going to come back after the break and talk to you about notice to oh what a day Seventy six\nMeals and entertain meals meals to Dr ... under the do\nNotice so we'll be right back with taxing times after this short break on AM ten Seventy the answer [noise]\nGot a question from my phone lines are open now seven one three three three Nineteen Seventy seven one three three three nine seven oh\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOh [noise] [noise]\n\nAre you receiving Livio garnishment notions from the Irish do you owe more than ten thousand dollars have on file tax returns or worse yet are you being audited or do you owe payroll taxes you can't do this alone you'll get creamed\nI'm Mark like a like a tax resolution and if you need someone you can trust call me now to eight one for six nine twenty four forty four we may be able to help so you're taxed at for up to eighty five percent off the

usually generally done the expenses not lavish or extravagant\nSo therefore you can't say that the cost of the golf is a real small amount or the cost of the basketball tickets as a real small I'm Out in the cost of the food and beverage is a real big 'em out\nAnd so therefore you know you're putting in there that so you could try to I guess circumvent this particular split between what his meals in what is entertainment so you're gonna have to look at that of course the tax payer or an employer the taxpayers president when a food beverages are furnished\nYou know so you have to be there or if you're an employee of the company the end the company's paying for it you know the the you know that you're there and so the ah food and beverage is providing to a current or potential business customer clack consultant or similar business clients or contact\nAnd for food and beverage is they purchased during an entertainment activity there purchased separately from the entertainment or the cost of the food and beverage estate separately from the cost of their payment or one of more bills invoices overseas for example if you\nGo take your client to the theater and the cost of the theater tickets are acts and then afterwards you take client to eat\nSteak you go to a state dinner row you know go to a restaurant by alright cost of the actual theater tickets is entertainment\nNot allowed for the fifty percent to ... take him to go to the restaurant and continue the entertainment into business discussion after this theater\nWith it separately have a separate bill for it All right that is the real deduction that is still allowed fifty percent so you're looking get entertainment versus meals that's how you have to\nThink about it so you have to think in those terms when applying this

question\nAnd want us to talk about your particular tax issue Seventy one three three three nine ten Seventy so seven went three three three Nineteen Seventy is the phone number [noise] All right we're going to a big news of the week was the change in the meals versus entertainment deduction\nAnd so that's what we've been discussing this morning and so therefore you have meals and you have entertainment meals under the new notice from the IRS\nRetain the fifty percent the ducks and however the entertainment the entertainment portion is disallowed so you have to split between the two and you can't have an unreasonable split between the two and a half to make sense the\nEntertainment has to make sense and the meals after makes sense so you just can't out ...\nTried to get around it by allocating a whole bunch of it to me ... and a very small amount of entertainment that's not going to work uh ours is on top of that and also are asking for more\nComments so this is maybe something else they might be more changes coming down the pike because they say up until December second there may be more changes in this area so you need to keep tuning in every Saturday morning to taxing times to see how this might be impacting you\nSo you need to do that as well All right now you need to sit there and go the changes between companies versus employees is still the same as under the old the laws that was previously discussed\nAnd so you say OK houses work or if you're a business owner I have a company you know your company does the particular meal and the entertainment whether the meals for that particular company will be allowed as a fifty percent doctrine is business owner\nOr you're self employed person say you're a self employed business owner you have your own company you're doing your meals Andrea entertainment okay no problem I\nHave to split so keep it separate you have to have a separate amount for your meal separate about for your entertainment to get the meal deducted you can't co mingling into one number\nAnd ride it off which we went over if you're going to take your plan out to the Astros game\nThe astro cost of the tickets not allowed at the because as entertainment the meals during the game if you split the out separately split out separately and you have a separate provable invoices for the hot dogs and the drink for example\nA that is meal\nAllowed this to present if it's co mingled in and the cost of the ticket and include the food and beverage you went to the luxury suite and you have the luxury suite and you buy a ticket for the lecture sweet and includes costs of the food uh and it's not split out\nThere's no doctrine so you've got to split it out and so therefore\nHowever now you're saying okay I I work for\nXYZ company and\nI Am an employee of X Y Z company and I have to take my client out\nTo do this and my employer gives me four hundred dollars a month\nThe for you know taking class out or for business expenses\nSet of circumstances in facts and so therefore there\nWas a couple that owned a junk yard\nOr I they owned a junk yard and they had\nCats and they said they're cats and they've\nBad these bunch of stray cats because the junk yard use these cats and they fed these cats because the cats would stay around and they would also eat the rats in the snakes and the other\nRodents that were in their junkyard and so therefore the cat's existed and were fed to control the snakes and the rodents in their junkyard\nAnd so therefore they are is it oh no no no you can't write off that cat food that's not an ordinary necessary business expands because uh\nThat's you can't duck the cat food [noise] well\nThe court came back and said no the court agreed with the taxpayers dating that it was a necessary expense\nBecause it controlled the rodents and the snakes into junkyard and it was a maintenance for the junkyard and so therefore feeding the cats beating the stray cats\nWas a deductible business expense for the junk yard because it controlled the wrote an issue and maintain the junk yard\nSo you can see that in this particular very very narrow situation if you had to fit into a very small box\nBut it could be allowed as a ... for business purposes to feed the cats so the cat food in this particular facts and circumstances ... situation was allowed as a business deduction against taxes so\nIn this particular case they could write off their cat food but for most of you not going to be allowed us to the doctor because you don't use it as an ordinary necessary business expense for your business to feed the cats\nSo you can see how this sort of fit into the situation so you have to look at the situation\nYou're each particular facts and circumstances hat or there is no bright line\nYou know in most cases are black and white test yes though can can't you have to look at your particular facts and circumstances to see whether or not it fits into a particular exception to the rules\nAnd so that's why you have to craft these things you have to document these things as to why they are deductible and so like we're talking about meals in entertainment or this new provision under the IRS notice this week\nWhat he's meals what is entertainment meals yes entertainment no so you've got this plan this and split this out and have documented and show why not\nThe meals are not labs are traveling in and how they are reasonable under the new ruling from the IRS so you're going to have\nTo look at that take a gander at it look at it the situation if you're looking at it this past year and you go on you're going to have to go back and probably if you've been entertaining entertaining for nine ten months\nAnd you look at this and say OK how we're going to split out our meals versus our entertainment and how we're going to deduct this on our business or as a business owner or as a self employed person so you're gonna have to go back and look at this\nAnd see how this is going to apply to you because this is all changed this week under the new ruling from the IRS and that's how they got around\nSort of the mistake that the Congress made\nBy going into this and say OK meals are meals entertainment or entertainment and there's a new watts or split between the two and so meals or payment entertainment is not meals so you're going to have to show how that's going to be split out so that's how they sort of\nGot around the mistake that Congress made when they made this tax laws change and so that's how a lot of this happens or we use a Congress comes in and passes laws and they don't read that you have to\nPass the bill to find out what's in it and there are no no that's not what we met that what we just decided that we really wanted to do and so then we're gonna have to come back behind him and sort of clean up the mess\nAnd say okay this is what you really mad and so we're going to sort of fixes for you so they sort of the Irish came through with this notice and said okay this is how we're going to determine\nWhat is the meal what is their payments and decide and draw the distinction between the two so that's what you're gonna have to look at when you're doing this under this new provision\nAnd then there's going to be more changes perhaps they have until December second to say well we may have some more changes coming down the pike and so you have until December second to determine what other changes may be needed and comment on so\nThat could happen to show you're going to have to keep tuned to taxing times and we'll go through this every Saturday morning with you if there's anything else that comes through as far as changes last minute changes\nWe'll be bringing those to you so you don't need to tune in and we'll talk about those but we've been talking about the new tax law and the changes are going to be impacting your next year going to be a lot of changes in the schedules there's now the the postcard with six ... six supplemental schedules\nYou're going to have to look at that so you're going to try to compare to last year and you're going to go this does not compared last year or the new tax forms they haven't been formally released yet we've seen some drafts\nAnd we're going oh my gosh you know people are going to be really confused about all this and so there's got to be a lot of confusion a lot of questions\nGoing into this going into the next taxis and so you have an it's October now we have about three months left until the end of the year to play in your tax affairs and so we've been going through a lot of the business law changes the individual law changes whether they're going to be\nChanging all in this for next year\nAnd so you're going to have to look at this and see how it's going to impact you so that's what we're going to be doing every Saturday morning during the fall here on a empty as embodied the answer with taxing times and so you

set up an installment land some other type of plan to take care of this situation\nAnd we can talk of teacher shows at which we have in teacher shows we will talk about okay how are we going to pay

ready to get started I got a stack of questions for yeah your radical girl [laughter] okay [laughter]\nThat first question comes from ray you're writing from Katie and ... says can you explain the pros and cons of having an annuity I hear lots of arguments from both sides for and against\nSure [noise] I you know and I get a lot of people because let's be honest annuities have a lot of negative image for a better word negative connotations so to speak if you would because unfortunately sometimes some advisors out there have tried to put a square\nHole or square peg in a round hole and that's forcing something into something and that's not where the presidency of of the product comes into play and just like you know what is an annuity annuity is basically an income producing machine\nJust like let's correlate it okay if you have a pension\nGuess what that say annuity if you have a um\n[noise] four one K. this turned into a a a annuity\nWhich is a lifetime payout a pinch and Social Security is is a a new to you if you didn't know that so basically has taken a a a bulk of money and then sparse in and out into smaller increments which in this case his income so that's what a news report so hey are you in need of income additional income what I mean by that as okay so you have Social Security\nWas was talking about the the ... of the um husband and wife that retired there over sixty five\nAnd they need supplementary income in addition to their Social Security and they not comfortable with having their money in the market or if they're not getting squat at their bank then maybe considering an annuity might be a good thing for them but where I get\nMad is where these brokers out there they put these people in these variable annuities and that's where you hear the the the negative connotation of knew what he says they're expensive well they're talking about bearable that he's there because they can be north of three to six percent\nAnd it's and I'm not exaggerating and all you're doing is you're buying mutual funds within an annuity chassis so my point is\nIf you want to go buy some some mutual funds go buy some each of us but don't let somebody insults you a charging you three per plus percent to own them inside of a new to Jesse so that's the last point I'll make is within annuity chassis your money grows tax deferred so if it's not an irate money\nNot qualified money than it would be able to grow within it\nIn in inside of his account without a villain out on your tax return every year so some some advisors use that as tax deferred vehicles but\nUnderstand you have to be a good candidate in my humble opinion to be\nAble to put money into annuity and that's where I find there's a lot of people out there that are being forced into something that they don't even know what they have in my point cases I asked somebody how do you think this thing work fucking about availability and they'll look at each other like um did you understand it last time we talked to the guy and it's like the deer in headlights so\nI think they're great vehicle that can be a great foundation for someone that's trying to build on a strong a retirement plan but\nIf you already have enough income than you probably are not a good candidate so just make sure you're working with somebody that's prudent and the ... that's not going to be doing it for their own selfish gang that would be my my recommendation for re\nBoy it's hard isn't it when you're trying to navigate this on your own I think just listening to you\nExplain all the ins and outs the different types of annuities how one can really help and in another case one can really hurt it really goes to show you you've got to be working with someone who understands that you use the word\nFiduciary and I want to talk a little bit more about that we've been hearing that weren't a lot and the news lately\nWhat is a fiduciary exactly ... and why should you make absolutely certain that your advisor is if it is Sherry\nAnd I get to a lot Megan in Glenwood do or or workshop at the college and I start out by letting everybody know you know there is that there's a word out there called Fisher can anybody and I have your daily chocolates there I mean piled up on the table ready to worry wart kind of like a dog biscuits if the dog does it you know I bark start\nRolls over I I Want to reward my my ten days for\nParticipation in I Want to know what their images of what I'm trying to get across and so I say how many people know that ... what the word is and tell me where you know a profession out there this associated with it and a lot of times they'll ... they'll say maybe a doctor or are some real estate some type say attorney but\nNine times out of ten they leave out the financial world\nAnd I think that's unique and interesting but yes you have certain securities licenses out there that certain advisors\nHave us in my farm I have what's called us a series sixty five which means that we are required to be a fishery now I think everybody in our industry Megan should be up in history but they're they're not held her that same standard some of them are only held what's called a suitable standard and that's it that's a light years different from a suitable\nVersus a fishery standard\nOkay so you want to make sure you're dealing with somebody like that\nThat has your best interest in my head to prioritize you your best interest over anybody else's they can't sell their their company Kool Aid 'cause that's not benefit issue is suitable but it's not the districts who want to make sure if you're going to deal with somebody in the near future in especially in the financial arena\nYou want to ask are you with a dish ... and then by the way because they're always going to say well they do you have integrity of course you're going to say they have a keg ready but do you have the license that backs that suit a belly up and you know whether they're a fishery or not we are additional here my farm but\nYou know we're all financial professional who liked at least categorize I'm cells like that so we all like to thrive on helping people make you

have we have more questions for you today I went ahead\nOut to new territory where we find Larry he writes in and he says I'm the guy who never opened his investment account statements because I'm scared to luck and because I don't really know what I'm looking at anyway how do you help a guy like me boy I think there's a lot of people like Larry\nWell I thought it was going with a when you first that's the question I thought it was because you know he he doesn't know what's going on in the what you said but I didn't know he was ... when he said I'm scared to look\nAt it okay so that's a that's a different scenario if you're scared then that tells me you may have questions on how your aligned\nMeaning how your allocate it and that would be something that would be concerned to me if you're if you were talking at a dinner party and you told me that I say you know what how would you like to not have to worry about open and that\nThat envelope how would you like to have confidence that you care right into that sucker in or not going to have to worry about what you're gonna find on the other side that's what I Would kill areas you know maybe you need to be you know another assessment find out how you were aligned presently in what is your uncle point\nAnd what I mean by that I don't mean to talking flying but remember the old guy on the um the on the school yard that you know you wanted to I'm just\nJust get back at him but he Everytime he got to you 'cause he was pushing orange says I'm not gonna let it go until you say uncle well that's where you got to say OK ... real stuff pressure\nOkay so let's get let's find out what your uncle poignant and then that's where you can approach\nFinances in this case is his financial um brokerage account with

having a retail account and you know to be honest a hundred thousand dollars in the in the in the scheme of the financial world today is a very small account and I'm not trying to discount a hundred thousand dollars not worth respecting amount of money but in the scheme of things hundred thousand not a lot so you you and you surely can't qualify for issue shall we count\nWith a hundred thousand but that's what we're talking about is those those days and it normally there right up front load\nAnd so my point is for anybody is less than if you're going to buy some mutual funds from your advisor make sure they're not up front loaded I'm just so you general experienced things that D D did\nThat's really good advice and boy if you're not prepared for and that can be a kind of a shock right\nIs in you know what it will be you're going to hear a repeating theme okay so when we\nIt's about we talked about re\nA earlier he was talking about new ways okay annuities the
