recent poll showed that the uh lower than a ever in a long time or are supporting the administration's agenda uh and uh you know that that disturbs the Democrats do they they rely on block voting though of groups\nOf people so I think since the uh the events of the catalog Harry and\nThe American public got to see\nThe dishes are still at the end ate that came from oh those Senate hearing about some of our senators and the people who came up here\nIn America that's my opinion they don't want to live with that kind of America in both people to be in charge\nOf America or because it
