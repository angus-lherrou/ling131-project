P. said from the Boston Globe straight got big deems is to make up for the quote Doris which is the absence of Native American DNA that you've samples from Mexico Peru in Colombia to stand in for\nStand in for Native Americans but what does stand in for me it means that hey we've got a movie Burt Reynolds but part of a hit in the face of the two by fours we've got to got to stand in for him\nWas that I have it means from the fact that looked like Burt but right before\nHired and fired as far as Lucia its national interests [laughter]\nIt's sick so [laughter] very unique and this is why the dirty people in the newsroom have no respect\nYou just have darkness in their souls to deal with the devil because\nIf you don't have enough ...

word when he news director to be Richard ... what's going to be you must be like Boston I got over there with all this funny hilarious uh Indian Elizabeth Warren news pretty amazing\nMay bring this all to uh I I had a lot of speculation and more about what may actually happened we don't know yet you know there are some questions about who this show good guy may really have bad you know you had a an affiliation apparently with the Muslim Brotherhood and some other folks that are\nMost of us here in the west or a little concerned about so uh we'll have to see where this actually ends up and does it interfere with an arms deal with Saudi Arabia that could actually keep Russian influence in that part of the world a little less important than it is now a\nHorse or is this story big because he worked for a newspaper\nAnd while that doesn't that has to play into what they are 'cause Washington, Missouri in particular so\n[noise] um I don't know we'll have to just wait and see there's no way to predict how this one comes out because there are so many different interests involved\nUm we've got a a a a horde of people coming this way from Central America\n... come on in yeah sixteen hundred to two thousand people apparently this crowd is expected to grow as it goes along apparently still in Guatemala\nAre coming from Honduras and I'm having to get in Mexico and then to the United states so they got they got a bit of a walk I don't know whether it'll take three weeks or not but it's certainly a comes at a bad time for the American election the two interests uh of course the left one and a lot of men\nAnd the right to wanting to keep them all out and the issue of separating children from their parents and all those things that we've seen before over and over again\nAre going to come up again when this bunch gets up\nTo the border and ah this will be another interesting situation to watch and the timing of when they arrive is exceedingly important in this particular case\n... it'll ... it'll backfire because at a time when the Democrats as we saw under Brock Hussein about the Saudis he turned his back on veterans\nAnd those scandals at the VA was in Arizona two sets of books all those veterans who died right yeah and for Democrats to sit there and go well illegals criminals are more important than our veterans is a bad\nVisual or a bad issue for election or for the Democrats in in many ways as you're educating and because of Americans are overwhelmingly against open borders there just don't want that poll after poll indicates that even Democrats don't want it\nSo uh but uh this this goes on\nThis the radical yeah but the the gutless radical wing of the Democratic party they're pushing it and there were other Dems are being real silent which is where okay yeah yeah yeah right\nRight so uh the cleanup effort is actually just sort of getting started now in Florida you know it started by scraping off off the roads so they could get\nOther vehicles then and now they're looking for are still washed people who haven't shown up there's a a few dozen I guess you are considered missing at this point which is always an issue in the aftermath

Clinton sat down for an interview to talk about sexism in politics I guess what she was asked about she was asked about her husband former President Bill Clinton and his affair with a twenty two year old intern or at the time named Monica Lewinsky take a listen to that backs\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal ... not it wasn't an abuse of power now for a while there are people who look at\nThe incidents in the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an internal power imbalance sweating it out\nShe was an adult so is this I'm Sorry because the last year of me too has has changed a lot of rules I thought that we had moved to a place where president of the United states for a company\nFor a fast food franchise fast food ranch I cannot have an extramarital relationship with a twenty two year old I entered because of the power imbalance am I wrong\nWatch ... I think I don't think they will live and what has happened because people always say a blind eye because they knew that the power just France and one thing I\nTurn ... although that was a big part of that\nInto a hotel in ...\nFair fair that in rural here at this point guard that Nate\nLoses as Sam alone show route to you by selling radios used in ... new media on AM ten Seventy FM one of the three three the answer\nThat's an excellent sound club I might ask you to play that again so I can comment I Want to bring up a story that we both of our Facebook page similar show about that exact uh incident but I I get to our good guest every Tuesday we have a visit from my friend bill king\nBill you are you very much for years for mayor of chemo ran for mayor of Houston, Texas joined us on the program what is up Mr King\nWell the um I I'm spending most of my time right now for trying to defeat prop a which is the reauthorization of rebuild ... speaking to community groups a lot of misinformation coming out of asked her about this I'm On my job pure on a Fox twenty six talk show on\nSunday mornings and I issued a challenge to semester to date this issue with me anytime anyplace and not surprisingly they have not taken up a challenge you know he was anxious to go out and debate or the the fire fighter you president about property but he didn't seem to want to debate ... at least not with me\nI guess are beginning 'cause walk us through a an over new listeners because you gotta understand build there is no coverage of the story when you when I talk to you\nGive me a content for a week uh were very critical of the news comes as a huge story so before we get too close to lock box on ... what would prompt they supposedly delivered to the taxpayers have used in\n... as a reauthorization of the rebuild Houston program that was voted in and two thousand tan this for the program that was a added a hundred million dollars in a new drainage and rain tax if you will that money was supposed to be putting a lot box and spent on\nIncreasing infrastructure spending and paying down our debt that is what we were promised back in two thousand jam with is just barely past fifty one forty nine or ...\nDid a great story last week you know you're not complain about the local media are not getting on stuff that kid did a great story he went in and got the documents the records from the city to see how much they actually spent on streets and drainage for five years before rebuild and for the seven years of rebuild\nAnd streets and drainage spending was down down\nBy about a five percent this\nIs after we added a hundred million dollars of new revenue they're not spending as much on streets drainage\nAnd and when can I ask a semester about this so that was because we've been paying down dead and should we get that debt pay down we're going to start spending the money on on building streets and drainage well we went and looked in the annual shady ... we have exactly\nThe same debt today as we had been rebuilt started no debts been tied down\nWe're spending less money but we're paying an additional hundred million dollars in tax but that is ridiculous\nWell I I Would you call the ridiculous bilking joining us I it's fraudulent as a taxpayer okay if you you got a bond you got\nYou do this rebuilding the drainage streets you had this massive whether issue and when you look back and there's even less money spent on drainage and your paint on the debt when the debt hasn't moved the debt needle hasn't moved you know usually people get locked up\nFor this kind of follow the route now there's a new ... and it's pretty much what he called the second verse of the same song right\nThey it's it's it's exactly the same program the only difference in what we did in two thousand ten minutes a day\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the ballot language that they used back in two thousand ten was misleading and so we had to read about it on\nThe ballot language has changed the program is exactly the same not one comment not one period nothing is being changed on the fundamental program is ended up with is paying more money\nHaving less money for infrastructure and not paying down the debt for voting on continuing that insane per year I understand payments they said that the definition of insanity we're doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result or this is the quintessential example of his saying right here\nYeah but I could see some you know bilking joins us from business leaders euro Kennedy I could see someone putting out a video\nWhere it says wait you're against prop ... say well you must not hear about this city why if you are against prop it you don't care about streets and flooding and try to own the narrative that way right because if you're in Ghana that's something that's not right now is your what\nAnd that's ... that's exactly what they're doing because you know this program or you know all of these ad campaigns that you're seeing on TV on property in probably or finance by the special interests that you know for which city hall\n... is run for their benefit and so they end up paying up whenever the mayor wants to go out\nAnd do an ad campaign and he will go out and ask all the people that are doing business with the city to contribute and he goes to spend some money to get on TV and you know the rest of us have to rely on you know social media and reintegrate programs like yours and going out to the community but\nI think I think the Jake is up I think people are beginning to understand what this program is all about the ... to ... I've been going to him and overwhelmingly opposed to it so\nI'm hoping it's going to work out how there's somebody you know here's the here's a moral outrage to me saying\nYou know show we collected a hundred million dollars a drainage fees since two thousand twelve when this implemented the city's own records show that only about three hundred and thirty million dollars of that was spent on drainage\nHere's the question I think every Houston or ask yourself how many houses would not have flooded\nIn Harvey had we actually spent that half billion dollars that was collected on drainage on flood control instead of hiking by coordinators and three eighty agreements reimbursing developers and all the other nonsense\nBut he spent it on how many families in Houston would not have flooded if we had spent that money\nThe way the voters were promised it would be ... it's an\nOutbreak ... it is um\nWhat are you going to do a mere Turner's or is very weak guy so he he's not up for confrontation any way shape or form which\nWill be playing 'cause he's he's not going to want to sit and talk about look he's got his former press secretary now with new charges are right what's her name daring ward I saw this is the woman who's running business out of the city hall and he was okay with it you just well I'll just suspend or pretend that\nHe's got a huge number of scandals what's your plan to the east coast for not he's not gonna want a debate you but what's the plane\nWell look we're going to continue to take the message out a pub in court and I are going to do some uh some robocalls on this next week we can um and look we're gonna try to do the grass roots you got to get the word out um you know look we got to the problem with for a long time\nThose of us that are more conservative on the physical side have tried to tie the city's hands with property tax caps and spending caps and all sorts of things and and this locked box which was you know supposed to keep this money isolated and the problem is that\nYou know unless you're prepared to go down there and shoot somebody every day at the city which you know normal people\nDon't have the time or money today than they just ignore this thing at some point in time we got to talk about leadership you know how about electing somebody who actually felt like there was a moral imperative to spend drainage fee on drainage you know how crazy is that you know\nYep let me know that works out because it's been an absolute disaster or keep up the good fight are good for bilking a former mayor your all Kennedy and a business leader former mayor of other wonderful town of chemo slugging it out buddy let me know if and when the mayor should ever go okay let's talk about it\nI Want to be only be their front row
