about where we stand a week out\nAnd I sure if you were in Bob Menendez says shoes and your numbers were falling like Iraq as an incumbent senator I Would be worried that they're not catching the following night back or they find was Bob Menendez\nNow Tom let me ask you about the very serious charges leveled today and the Washington Post by Katherine ramble\nTrump is to blame his entire party has this represents the left actually the White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights Trump isn't to blame she writes his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nI think she accurately represent the left and the media is point of view and that that is a Republican to most Americans what do you think senator\nHere that that kind of rhetoric is more than most Americans I don't know who described her as a but the only person to blame for that kind of horrific shooting we saw\nIn Pittsburgh on Saturday it if you're a drainage anti Semite um who should be locked up for the rest of his life not put a ... uh the person that sent those suspicious packages last week or the blame there just as hard for them for her Bernie Sanders volunteers person the blame\nFor all the killings Elise and who knows how many other Republican congressman he would've killed if it hadn't been for two you're brave Capitol Hill police officers\n... let me play for you the height of Trump's arrangements syndrome is Julia Ioffe off last night with Jake Tapper on CNN cut number six\nTo ... I think you know that's pack and at one of the things that hole where they launched his presidential right on attacking Islam a crowd of radicalization and\nPack and it has radicalized Sal many more people than I did\nFind is that right there she would later come back and apologize for that remark I Want to be fair to wear because they got hammered on the air when she said that but Tom Cotton that anyone could even give voice to that without stopping to show immediately in and said dismissing someone from the set is amazing to me\nThat he remember this is the ... same woman who accused Donald Trump of sleeping with his daughter a couple of years ago\nUm I Can't imagine that in a respectable journalistic outlet wants to be associated with someone like that uh people are these authors you met you I think sometimes they view themselves as heroes and there are internal morality play\n'em they're so deep inside the beltway New York buffalo like stuff like that and understand that a lot of Americans uh for the president's agenda\nThey believe the economy is growing stronger cause we reform our tax code and we're on our regulatory system that are ... perspective again in the world I understand that may not very well in the Upper East side of Manhattan or in the airline but there are millions and millions of Americans across the country in places like Arkansas\nThat's what they believe that or the president's or the Republican Party and it's fine to oppose it was like the campaign against us got ... uh but that kind of rhetoric is really a cult\nOr and and I wonder how do we fix the me I think media is poisoning America and I I Try and bring on left right and center and trying to be civil with everybody and you're always civil and all the Republicans are any John Kerry civil and people are civil but\nI watch cable and I think it's just pumping poison from both ends into the mainstream your thoughts last minute center of cotton\nOr walk by ... don't watch those cable news networks that you um you know unfortunately baseball season's over over at my like baseball that were to have much of it you know no college basketball season and the ice age and it was all ... I guess what Christmas they started out the hallmark channel on friday night you\nResponded swiftly and bravely in the wake of the attacks have witnessed Americans in every faith tradition\nComing together to mourn with our fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America's Jewish community\nThe president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country kid doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family the president as the grandfather uh several Jewish grandchildren [noise]\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent of Holocaust survivors why is the author\nFirst thing that the president and deadly condemned the attack something Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media didn't blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous you can't start putting the responsibility of individual anybody but the individuals who carries out the crime\nThis is a similar show run to you by sailing radio used in five twelve new media on AM ten Seventy and asked them one of the three three the answer\nA man Sarah ... a man and you look at the dirty filthy God most people in the media\nWho I knew somebody was the CNN was trying to blame it on the president against Sarah Huckabee Sanders aside from us here are the first to say this is the first president United States American history with orthodox Jewish children and grandchildren to never happened before\nAnd then she says it all the dirty people on the news rooms like hook damage that kills her story\nThat's the that's what I called the dirty people he is the most pro Israel president most pro Jew look at the guy before him who bowed to the Saudis the shows\n... who shipped off money to Muslim terrorists who valor exterminate the Jews and and look at the dirty people on the news in pure dirty it's all they are worried that it's really describes as well as Trump's fault you obviously don't want Trump to come to Pittsburgh you Jewish guy on TV that I'm interviewing obviously you know what Trump here chop it why\nIf anyone has been more is pro Israel approach shoe\nIs the current occupant certainly even as liberal Jews whisper certainly wasn't the last document the White House he was a disgrace brought banning the Jewish prime minister from the White House and all the ... other horrible things he did I wouldn't say I would venture to say that Israel is never had a better friend in the White House than Donald J Trump\nAmen to that while I'm walking back to a big thank you how Pepe Tuesday savior I was a great audio clip that many more ... it's that dirty people I think oh stand business strong but I got stronger words [laughter] that's just there\nAnd and and these disgusting dirt bags try to say well you don't want the president of Pittsburgh do why wouldn't you Jewish children Jewish grandchildren a great friend who's a who move the embassy from Tel Aviv disaster writes who's been Israel's greatest framing and getting Saudi Arabia to talk with Israel to come up with a plan to protect themselves\nAnd the dirty people on the news or whether they're order bride threatened maybe got pictures with major to Nazi boots I don't know there'd be but they won't ever tell you the truth when I say this I go to speak of groups was you know ... ... yeah I Know he had orthodox Jewish grandchildren yeah I I Know I'm like Jesus ...\nDoing you know I get to my speech that well we don't hear that on channel eleven a channel Thirteen course CNN and ABC or

selling live today is maybe have tell people maybe doing that [noise]\nWhat light the match hey\nI think you're raising one of those great questions that people far smarter than I can answer\nIf we look in the Bible after the story of the flood and Noah got regret police says to Noah I of learning that man from his use is prone to evil which is you would think a horrific thing forgot to tell us\nThe message I get from that is yes there is the possibility of hate and all people but there's also the possibility of good and good will always win out over hey if we let it in each of us we are a tree of life you can cut up some branches\nFrom our tree to tree of life has been in his ... for a hundred and fifty four years we're not going anywhere we will rebuild and we will be back stronger and better than ever probably will not let hate closed down my building\nPresident Trump has talked about coming in the aftermath of the teams on him to\nThe president of the United states is always welcome a citizen he's by president is certainly welcome\nThis is a similar show relative you buy Salem Radio used in science of new media on AM ten Seventy and asked them one of the three three the answer\nThose that horrible person baiting a man of the clause with hate against\nAllison camaraderie or she should be fired by the rabbi Jeffrey Myers and uh she tried to get him to say something that he wouldn't do it and that's just because there's a few uh Jews that are in that area put out a paper yesterday condemning Donald Trump you're an outlaw\nThere's no doubt you know there's always going to be some some lifted a liberal Jews\nHate Trump more than they love Israel that that's a fact that I speak about that a lot but for her to try to be a rabbi after such a tragedy with Trump is embarrassing to the whole the whole network there that's a good goodbye lady I keep getting to the other stuff that you make sure you do that in there about the show\nTo see what the real base of darkness as our two here I have ten Seventy to answer\nA as we are thirty a day of rock to Rob similar every Tuesday we go to visit from a good friend bill king bill ran for mayor um I guess just four years ago now former mayor of chemo brain successful businessman he's when it comes on the helps to keep track of the finances of the city and\nHow bad things are bill happy to see how you doing buddy\nBuddy how you doing this whether I'm doing great\nIsn't it though I tell you this is the best six months he says is wonderful between October what April ... some guy I think\nWe got off the cob sketchy start this month I mean you know it was very bad there for two days of October yeah norm is our best mom\nNow and when you ran for mayor you lost by a little bit um whatever in contrast sir this turnouts in this midterm election do Harris County has been through the roof my goodness this huge\nRight ah yeah it's hard to know how you know we've got so many new people running it's hard to know how it's going to turn out to the pollsters have the\nBiggest the biggest problem ... posts are trying to pick out people that don't typically are having a long time will vote and that that's why the polls missed or the Trump support back into them sixteenth 'cause there were a bunch of older white voters are the kind of just checked out of a you know out of a\nA process that came back and voted for the first time in a long time and they were they messed up\nAnd show bought a new people voting will have to see how they you know why they're coming out the vote now it'd be interesting to say\nWell it'd be possible to kinda harness this energy when the when there's a mayor's race in November of twenty Nineteen will be possible to get this is a doozy as many excitement back for our city and the election\nYou know uh the ... electorate is much different than the state and federal\nUh it's it's mostly homeowners that vote in the city election because you know it's an off year election you gotta\nYou gotta remember to go vote and it's mostly people that are that own home so that made it so much older electorate than the average or in a state and federal wouldn't be because you know when you you know when you buy a house and start raising kids and worry about\nYour your garbage picked up on the quality of your kid's school and all that kind of show that's when people really short voting electorate young people don't tend to pay too much attention to it um but I Will tell you the there seems to be a real alarm\nOr even rage in some communities around the city about just how terrible a job out of the city is doing a mere one thing that a lot of people don't realize is we have a ramp it illegal dumping\nGoing on in certain neighborhoods in the city and the city has this idiotic\nPolicy where if somebody comes out and say you've got a vacant lot Sam and somebody comes out and dumped a bunch of garbage are construction debris or something\nOn your watch or or on the street in front of your lot for the city does goes by and the issue the the the owner of the property a warning shot and you've got to get this cleaned up\nThey come back and thirty days if you haven't cleaned it up\nThen they issue a ticket now you know here's a person as a victim of a crime that we're issuing a ticket to [noise] and then if it's not picked up then about two to three months later they finally go by and solve which picks it up and carry it off and of course by them the tickets been dismissed because\nNine times out of town to vacant lot is you know there's nobody to the United states or something that's been lost to the family or they're delinquent taxes and it's just it's an abandoned piece of property\nThat's why these uh these crews are dumping Mr picket in the first place and so you know we got this idiotic\nDeal of them of this trash will shut down the street and some neighborhoods for three months I'm sure that we can issue a ticket to the victim of a crime which won't be prosecuted because actually\nNine times out of ten there's nobody there to take care of the first place in the meantime if you're trying to live in that neighborhood you've got to sit there were rational you're straight for three months now you know what this doesn't happen among river oaks boulevard\nIt doesn't happen on Tanglewood boulevard a but it happens in ... in neighborhoods in this city that are you know where the people or don't have the resources to go down and higher lobbyist and and you know and and make campaign contribution to city hall and it's just wrong Seamus just absolutely wrong\nLet me ask you a building or use some business leader a run for mayor lifestyle I guess was for four years ago when times one uh one of the thing on those Alex almost don't want to do something else for a few stony inches about this parity where firefighters in Houston a chip to get the same as police right\nSo there's a campaign a pack where they raise money to run TV commercials and stuff against parity called protects used impact the race almost a million dollars to be against by ... against parity for firefighters\nA third of that comes from the mayor of Houston who gave him all the three ... three hundred fifty thousand dollars in radio and TV ads work with you miss one first of all where the hell do a million dollars against terrorism and our mayors is on most of your three hundred and fifty thousand dollars guy what's what's up with like\n... here's here's here's the thing that people really notion [noise]\nWe have a completely corrupt campaign finance system at the city of Houston uh for all of these elections and for the special propositions like this Seventy eighty percent of the money comes from people that do business with the city\n[noise] um I notice that there's a a one of the big contributors to this particular pack of somebody that\nProvides a certain kinds of materials to the city or you know let's say you got a ten million dollar contract you're providing a shape grab or whatever the city of Houston and America calls up and said you know uh we got this campaign and we really need some money for\nA and we said that you know the city's pay me ten million dollars I Know you hate to lose that contract and you're the business got what are you going to do you say\n... or what have you NATO or how much you need you know and um and it's ... and we got to do something about this the politicians are never going to do anything about it because of their all benefiting from the money being paid in\nBut um I mean there's millions of dollars sham\nThat are paid by contractors and vendors that are then getting paid hundreds of millions of dollars from the city\nThat's crazy I mean just that if they're throwing around money like changing my pocket\nOr government buildings stopping by rather we can just look at our human aggravating anytime you're ready I'm ready buddy might get a get out there I
