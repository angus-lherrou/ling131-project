I Know it's so it's an easy target but less and less so I just I feel I feel cleanse\nIt was great and it also by the way all this crap aside in is a magnificent film shows ... does an unbelievable job putting you inside the sole inside the helmet inside the spacecraft is a remarkable movie\nYeah I I I thought it was quite good I mean and there are reasons to criticize the film I've read a plenty of negative reviews that that had in a intelligent accurate things to say about the film but if you the reason you're avoiding the movie is because you think uh that an eighth\nAmerica but you are you're you're doing it wrong as hard as we as we can say\nI Know we've got at least one or two new ones but give me thirty seconds is star is born as good as thirty people I Know say it is\nI mean

big breakout role a for as an actor I'm Bradley Cooper is great\nI think rather or is the best the best thing about the movie um it's fine it's I it's not really my cup of tea but it's very undoubtedly well made and it is a the the songs are you know they're good pop\nDarn good or a mountain in works by speaking of things that here's something that's not my cup of tea but I'm prepared to respect that did America need a Halloween remake\n[noise] well what does\nAmerica need all of that is a good thirty seconds to say they're not good\nIt's it's good I thought I thought last night

[noise]\nWe're powerless in the face of the Congress couldn't fix it but Congress refuses to fix the system is broken by design\nVoters notice of course that's one of the main reasons they voted for Donald Trump two years ago they don't have immigrant obviously\nBut they do believe America has a right to decide which immigration to hit all countries have that right don't they that would be an interesting debate the Democratic party and they're lacking immediate don't want to have that debate because they know they would lose so instead they try to bully the population into silence\nThey deal with the argument on immigration is one that's optimism base here this is a scare tactic but this is the president this immigration is a scare tactic is using to revoke his supporters\nWhen you talk about ... you're talking about white anxiety you're talking about old white man hey so when they were determined to bring up the pictures of children being separated from their family\nIn other

there in your buddy tight shirt and I'm\nLike Cuomo\nChristie hey listen I went outside and found a nobody's watching your show but anyway go to the white anxiety and this is why I remember I came up with a golf assault left they just\nUh have such darkness in ... in their hearts in Houston, Texas we have five police officers murdered in light of duty by illegals like the last five right friday were black\nThey were Hispanic and fact real Americans like us to see it as blue as police officers\nBut you see how the gods assault left is as people like that poor girl that college students are looking for out in Iowa murder you know rape whatever by a legal the police officers sheer capes dialing in San Francisco\nAnd everyone they're like well let's just weddings Heidi what would you say to the signing the family\nWhen the illegals the these criminals break in and they rape and Rob and murder and they do and are the Amish Thirteen gang members ... hit rate ...\nThey they want to look the other that's our combat God will assault left because the truth and maybe you shouldn't be lying and the top ten as Moses brought down from outside I shot the lion you're lying when you go it's white things either something the Rodney Johnson police officer murdered by legal was a black man here in Houston police officer\nAnd I remember his wife coming out was horrible it was such a sad tragic event in a legal who shouldn't have been here broke in this disgusting filthy person murder murdered a\nCop murdered a top and nobody in that picture was white\nRight so what where's the way the anxiety now obviously I'm not allowed to go on whatever the CNN or something like that especially with Christie or Don Lemon they can't stand us\nI'm hoping that you but you're not going to tell
