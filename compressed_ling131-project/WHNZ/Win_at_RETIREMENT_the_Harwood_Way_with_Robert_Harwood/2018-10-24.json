Todd I got to tell you something to two thousand eight was ten years ago more than ten years ago man it was a Tuesday that was a big one\nAnd it pretty much scared everybody ah we don't want to forget that we want to learn from that I mean ten years ago sometimes we kind of block that stuff out but we really need to be thinking about that in our finances because you're exactly right you know markets are high\nAnd frankly is getting more volatile than it's been in a long time and so we really have\nAsk ourselves is their trouble ahead I mean what should we be doing different than we're doing now ... and you're right at our company ... at\nA higher with financial group I've always taken a cautious dance with things you know I I was a military pilot I was in the military almost ten years uh then I went to the airlines\nAnd and our thing was is look you've got a mission to do you got to get it done\nBut you want to do it a safe way as possible so that the right way to look at it you know ... and I I look at our retirement the same way and this is how Kevin and I advise people is we got to get to our destination your end the market to make money you want to do well\nBut let's not get derailed by the next correction let's make sure you're doing the right thing we're smart about what we're doing\nAnd let's try to get it to our destination is safe ways possible that doesn't mean sitting in cash doesn't mean always being conservative or right time to go for growth and there's a right time to be more careful and I will tell you that\nUh the last ten years since the ... uh oh wait the recovery has been phenomenal\nAnd all of our listeners have should have done very very well over the last ten years I've you haven't uh you you need to come see us because there's something wrong\nBut there's also a time maybe to down to that risk don't be irrational about risk let's be smart about what we're doing and what we're seeing well Kevin I are seeing all the time is people coming in and their portfolios are a mess they're they're a train wreck they're invested in the wrong areas the wrong things\nYou know look Europe is not doing well right now to be investing in Europe the U.S is leading the charge\nBut also be careful as you invest in the U.S is not the time to to put the gas pedal down and go pedal to the metal\nAnd about going back to some of the the rocky points in the last ten years I Know you've told us on the show that the cost of your cautious management that your portfolio is I mean you give us some stats over the years where\nI you know all the markets in some cases were down or people's portfolios were down forty percent or more\nYeah we were knocked down to you know where we're always going to be careful here's what I boy for us as is really important if you want to make money don't lose it in the first place so that makes sense ah ah you know the the will Rogers a more worried about the return of my money then return on my money\nHere's the thing there are ways to invest so that you can feel comfortable\nSo that as we go through this volatility you can sleep at night you don't have to worry about it you don't have to just take all your money and put in the wall street casino and hope for the best they're smart ways to invest when we sit with our clients\nWhat we want to do is the first thing understand what it is are looking for\nWe're going to invest in a way that makes you successful and your success is our doing it in a way that you're comfortable not taking too much risk\nBut we still want to make money listen you're investing to make money if you have not made money this recovery or you're not doing well there's something wrong with your portfolio and you need to get it looked at\n[noise] well above I Know you for many many years from a personal relationship you know our wives or friends our kids are friends we've been doing this radio show for years and years I just know how you handle your personal life\nAnd it's far a phenomenal and then you carry this forward with the firm that you built the hardwood financial world and the people\nThat you built into your infrastructure of the company and you know if our listeners to this radio show\nIf you are currently using a different broker a different financial planner\nA and also the understand the difference between a broker and and a\nCertified financial planner who is a fiduciary I you know a lot of people don't understand these definitions Bob and that's where\nThe heart with financial group is a different than than many biggest you built this from years ago from the beginning as a fiduciary from which means that legally you must act in the best interests of your clients\nYeah well I may say something is about to dash you have the commercial it's about the data that nice Paul it's about your wife and you've been able to enjoy the fruits of your labor you're working hard for us about your family and invested in the right way and doing the right thing and you got to be really careful right now because\nThere's been a lot of stimulus in the market and and think about it this way you know a miracle grow you know your grow your guard and you're going to add a little fertilizer all miracle grow to get the garden to grow faster\nAnd that's great that's wonderful ah this stimulus has been the miracle grow the fertilizer for the stock market has got the recovery going well what happens if you put too much miracle grow on the plant\nYou kill the plant don't show I Need this cannot go on forever it is time for people to sit down and really think about what your goals are how you want to invest what should you be doing in a market like this\nAnd maybe it's time for change maybe it's time to rethink your strategy is a little bit and come on and let's do a little planning and let's get your financial house in order well things are good because\nI don't know when they're crushes coming we're going to talk about that and Kevin is going to help us our cat and the next ... a section of our show we don't know when this great time and the market's gonna and I'm pretty optimistic about these but I Will say something\nWe are also very cautious we're going to be very careful because we are the stewards were for do Sherry's were the stewards of our clients financials at we need to take a you know do well with a do a good job for him to take care of our clients needs is very very important\nAnd suddenly I once put too much miracle grow on tomato plants and I ended up with a tomato the size of a walrus\nYeah that was a movie right ... ... you know or something\n[laughter] I remember Joe the volcano on the show that it\nCan be the same thing here is that they there's a lot of stimulus out in the stimulus is working great but the minute that stimulus stops working\nWe're probably going to see some sort of pick up a correction or volatility\nAnd you need to prepare yourself hopefully you've made a lot of money was down to the risk you know one of the things we talked about every show taught as we have a program called CPR complete planning review\nOr our our listeners communists it with me with Kevin our cat one of our advisors and just get a really thorough review and just see how you're doing and I tell you something\nPeople come in and they're doing great and I'll say to them man you're doing great don't change anything\nOther people come in and the comment is you really need to fix this and you need to fix it now fix it while the markets are high\nAnd things are good because once a market corrects it's too late for most people so there's a little time factor that you need to get this done so we offer this program CPR to come in sit with us get a nice review there is no obligation\nAnd we were actually help you with your finances and we don't charge anybody for this is just to review\nThe simple understanding here is that the heart with financial group Robert Harlan

whenever we end this segment eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number to get a hold of\nThe Robert Harwood teen Harwood financial folks the quiz rolls on Bob here's the Bob Barker a little ...\nThe a car and had a microphone take it away out\nThere you go where we're talking about financial planning is really important to have a plan a plan is how you know you're on track\nIs how you know you're going to be okay and that's how you keep your advisor accountable\nTo make sure they're really doing the right thing for you and not just earning a bunch of commissions off of you so it's really really important to have a good plan a city or a Kevin Kevin arquette is one of the advisors with our forearm and he's a great guy but beyond that just been a good guy and a good dad and all the good stuff\nAh he's also a CSP use of produce Sherry everyone in our office are produced cherries and and the concept of produce is\nThey are here to protect you to watch over you so you are the focus of all of our ... our needs we don't have stockholders shareholders that are demanding profits and all that stuff off of commission soul to you\nAnd it's a really important concept and before we want to break I made a comment and Kevin is going to talk about this I said do people with a lot of money when you're very wealthy let's say of a million bucks to a million bucks whatever that is\nFeel a lot better about finance advancing the person may be what two hundred three hundred thousand dollars what do you think ...\nI got to tell you people with a lot of money they feel perhaps if they're on track but most of the time that's not the case so what are you saying how can you say that's not the case I say that's not the case most people just have investments and some savings but they haven't taken the time to put together a plan\nBut well here's the issue is not just how much money you have is how much you're spending right as having the right balance between and wife and so sometimes we see people with a great savings\nBut frankly there way overspending they'll never be able to retire with what they're doing they're just not on track\nWhere whereas we have people that are more modest and they're right on track you know that they're spending is balance with their savings and everything's perfect you know\nThe the thing you need to do this why plan is so important is it will tell you if you're on track or not doing the right thing and it doesn't matter if you have millions or thousands or hundreds of thousands it doesn't make a difference we're all created equal\nUh we all need to have a good plan and we all have the right to enjoy our time in retirement\n[noise] so it doesn't matter whether you are comfortable whether you're absolutely loaded into whether you pull into Robert Harward is parking lot and you open the door and cash actually falls out of it [laughter] you know ... and why let me tell you a true story I think it's All right yeah yeah\nAnd and this is all the time I mean not just one time we talked about this on the radio I sat with a couple recently and I mean this is many times I've had this and they've come in and and they kind of feel bad about things they feel like they're not on track their work and I actually retire someday and we're going to be okay\nAnd yet they have everything they need they have more than enough money saved the right on track\nBut because they're working with stockbrokers they're not getting the advice they need and they don't feel comfortable you know the plan is going to help you get centered is going to help you know you're OK and I'll tell you something to we will build a plan for you for free I mean they were not selling plants here\nYou're one of our listeners and if you feel like you may or may not be on track wherever you are and you just want to come in for a meeting and get things reviewed and just say Robert Kevin can you help me build a plan we will build your plan for you for free without obligation\nAnd we build these great plans I mean we have some tools that are unbelievable to help you get and stay on track\nWell the resources and you know how you tell me about the the formulas and the programs and and what you do as far as in Dallas is it really is and it's like rocket science over there with with what you deal with portfolio management ad you know I I just want to impress upon the audience that\n... and you're just a sexually said this Bob you're not selling anything this is not a radio show about by this try this ... this is a radio show about you can get a free analysis\nAnd you'd probably say well why would they do it for free well because folks there is a a good number of people that come for free analysis and they like what they hear and see so much from the hardwood financial group that they ended up working with Robert Harward and the team at Harwood financial\nYou don't want to hear all the time Todd man I heard this today I Wish I had done this sooner I write so much better about what I'm doing I Wish I Would have come and sooner\nAnd we've been talking about that for years they have and you hear it every single day you heard it today so you know why is this radio show on wide as Robert Harward and the team offer this program again\nOr some people come in they get the second opinion they leave and that's it and they're happy to do the analysis but there are a large number of people over the years that love with the Harwood team is about they love the presentation they love the ideas they love the analysis",
