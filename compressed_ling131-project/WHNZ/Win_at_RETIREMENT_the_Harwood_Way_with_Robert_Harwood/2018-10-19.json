I just had a review what the gentleman and he said I've been putting money in Iraq but I'm not sure why and so that brought to mind was talked about that today why we're also important\nRoss when you put money in a raw becoming more and more popular all the time because they allow you to generate tax income I mean who wouldn't want tax for income now today with this new tax plan we might say yeah Robert but taxes are really low and I agree with that\nBut this is for your future and we're a tax rates going to be ten years Twenty years down the road I mean they do have a massive deficit and we don't know\nWell also let me interject here with Trump is president and the Republicans controlling the house of representatives and the Senate and obviously the tax plan going through and the changes which are get going to be implemented this year what we don't know Bob\nIs what's gonna happen with Congress going forward presidents incumbent presidents presidents in the White House\nTypically loses seats or lose complete control of the house\nIt's happened you know you look at it it uh you you had that George W. Bush lost seats you at Clinton lost seats Obama lost ... it's kind of a given that in the midterms and of course we have the midterms coming up and twenty Eighteen that it is not\nOut of the question you know you have a lot of Republican highlands you have a lot of the current Republicans that are not running again I mean some of the numbers is that it was like thirty one seats I mean I I\nI so I'll I'll say something this about this election is going to affect the markets absolutely be prepared for that I Know that there is no doubt in this tax plan was approved the simple majority just a simple majority ... which means that can be unraveled\nExactly so ... the point is what if the house goes Democrat I I I don't want that to happen but what if it happens and what if the Senate ah ends up going a democratic it's simple I mean what Trump is instituted the tax but could be reversed in you know in a couple of years\nValid I mean that's valid and and not just out here I'm going to put a little common sense what let's say that this doesn't get reverse I mean this tax plan is going to help everybody in my opinion I don't care of your Democrats or Republicans or neither a this tax sponsored help a lot of people so I'm very positive about the tax plan\nAnd that's not being political that's for everybody but here's what I Do know there's a lot of talk about adding more money to our current deficit we owe as a country as people we owe a lot of money\nAnd they need to manage that deficit to and the only way to manage the deficit is either to spend less money\nRight or pay down the debt to pay down the debt they have to raise your taxes so when we talk about a raw fire ray and we look at taxes today that's not how you look at her off because we're all our future investments that money and he's just sitting there for at least five years before he can use it tax free but there's some great things about it number one is\nAll the growth in your account all of it you're not being taxed on and when you take it\nOh you're not being tax and you know what else was great no required minimum distributions you when you turned seven and a half you don't have to take money out of a raw fiery\nThey're wonderful an IRA just a regular retirement account we all know is pre tax write I'm getting a tax deduction today they're going to limit what they put in there I get a tax reduction today but that money does grow\nTax deferred not tax free tax suffered because you pay taxes when you take it out so what do we want to I Want my money on a Roth IRA or regular IRA well I'll tell you that the raw fire is going to pay big dividends for those that have the foresight to use them you know what the problem is with a raw fiery\nWhere the issue becomes a tell me\nIncome limits you know if you make too much money your CPA is going to tell you they're going to say you look you make too much money you write not contribute to a rough\nYou know I was it was I'm not going to tell you exactly what I make a but I was in that predicament where I couldn't do a rough but a few years back maybe what six seven years ago ... thousand ten was there was some kind of a you know exactly

you can convert to a runoff this is like a one time deal where whereas in the past I did not qualify but then suddenly I qualified and that door has that door been closed again or what what role I'm\nGoing to well it's different this time but I'm going to tell you something there's a loophole today that everyone can be using to fund the raw\nEvery body and and we're at the end of the segment so you're gonna have to stay tuned to the next segment because there's so much I Want to teach you on TALK about but the bottom line is I don't care what your income is you can find the raw don't want
