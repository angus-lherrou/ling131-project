[noise] download it now\nThese CBS News on the hour sponsored by zoom video conferencing\nI'm Jim jailer he is on his way home American pastor Andrew Brunson freed from the Turkish prison CBS is Holly William\nSo Bob I Know that you are constantly inundated when you know we've had conversations among the top questions that you are asked it's about four one case it's about Iowa arrays and should people be using one how do they manage their their ...\nIf ... can you shed some light let's dive in\nYour ears what I see all the time taught as I see people they have their work based plan and remember ... here's a difference you know what to say four one K. that's a retirement plan\nThat most people have that's what a for profit company would use you know a General Mills Proctor Gamble Delta Airlines whoever it is they're going to run for one case\nIf you work for a nonprofit they called for all three days at the same thing that they're no different you know you as the employee would use these things the same way and government employees are called thrift savings plans and teachers are are I'm Sorry teachers or through our savings governments are ts peas\nIt's all the same thing and what these plans are and why they're so important\nIs to pieces the money you put in there as pre tax you don't pay any taxes on that money that you put in there until you withdraw later\nSo that's a really important piece so if I'm frustrated with all the taxes I have to pay even though we're going to have lower rates\nOr we can ... further by using these plants so you want to put money in there and the other pieces typically you get a match so whoever it is you work for is going to match you three four five percent it depends on you know where you're working so every dollar you put and they put a matching dollar up to a woman\nSo if I were to put money in my retirement plan my four one K. for three be two things are happening I'm lowering my taxes and I'm getting a match on my money I think that's wonderful\nBut here's what I've been hearing lately I've been hearing financial advisors say oh don't put your money in your retirement plan at work put it with me and an IRA and I can invest it for you much better than they can\nNow I got to tell you that's horrible advice this terrible advice because that four one K. allows you to put more money than there are a cost less than the IRA and typically are not going to roll it over into retirement\nSo there's a little controversy you know we're going to talk about all that stuff but you want to be using these plants and you want to use these plans to the maximum extent possible not the minimum so the mistake I see people doing is they put enough money to get the company match\nBut more so three or four or five percent of their salaries right that's not good\nLike say you're not maximizing ... if the government is going to give you a benefit\nUse that or try your best to use it the government doesn't give you a much so try to use a hat and what ever whatever little a little bonus they're going to give you use it I mean just take every bit if you kept\nThinking about this for a minute if you're in a twenty percent tax bracket a lot of our ... our twenty percent or higher twenty percent tax bracket\nThat means you're saving twenty percent on every dollar that you put your four one K. that's a twenty percent match from the government you know we're worried about a three and four percent match for a company\nThe government is giving you twenty cents on every dollar going into your four one K. so you really want to maximize that and the amount you can put in a four one K. changes with age so younger people are Eighteen thousand but when you hit fifty you gotta catch up\nSo he could go up to twenty four thousand dollars or catch up so the idea was four one K. is one of the things I say wrong is people are minimizing just to get their match in there they should be maximizing the four oh one K. the first place you should be saving is in your four one K. first\nAnd outside your for when case or returning POWs later\nRight so the tax the ferment is clearly an advantage and putting as much as you can in and then having the right investment over the years the compounding of that it's it's just going to grow and grow\nOh yeah but what does a financial advisor going to tell you they're going to say oh don't put your four one K. because they can't earn a commission their\nHealth as self centered if I'm wrong I stopped stopped stopped stopped ... let me folks let me just let me stop the presses right here let me tell you why because listen to what Bob Harward adjusted listen to what Robert Harward the president of the harlot finance ripped just did he essentially\nI just took money out of his pocket he well but what I'm saying is though is I mean that's neat that's what you mean you get when when you deal with with your company you get straight forward advice you're telling people maximize your four O. one K. when in fact that as a disadvantage\nTo financial advisors because they might not have as much money on under management or make a commission you're giving people honest advice\nWhere ... worked for this year and visors we're going to do what's in your best interests you know our industry has bias everyone wants to make a commission off of you what they really should do is do the right thing and if they do the right thing they're going to have a good relationship and and you're going to stay with your advisor\nUnfortunately the bias with so get the bias out use your four one K. is now I got to say something there's a little secret of four one K. is I Want a teacher that's pretty cool so when I say use your four one K. is absolutely fund them that's where your money should go not to your advisor in your four one K.\nAnd we help people with us all the time but there's two things number one is coming up on retirement\nOnce you retire you're going to want to roll this over and take control of that account because you may want to invest differently than what you're four one K. allows you to do that isn't always the case but it's usually the case so when you come sit with me I'm going to teach you these things but the other thing is a little secret for one case is\nTypically a let's say you have a four one K. and you're not using it because they don't like investments in it\nYou should still use that four one K. put your money in there it allows you that great tax deduction\nBut then what you can do is this thing called an in service distribution most people don't even know about this I put my money into four one K. and then I get a movie where I have better investment choices so you're not necessarily stuck with those mutual funds and your four one K. you can open that thing up\nWith what's called an in service distribution so I Want you to use your plans for through these are four one K. is don't let your advisors steer you off from that there's a great advantage but you're not stuck in the plan if you don't like the\nInvestments in there if you feel like the fees are too high or we can show you how to fix up that the secret with all this as as if you're coming up on retirement or you're not sure you're using your your plans writer you want to lower your taxes\nJust give me a call come sit with me we can do a CPR or planning review together and just bringing a bunch of questions and I'm happy to sit with you and I'll answer any questions you have we talked about in our book or we'll get your copy of the book\nAnd just come on let's sit together and get a great review and I'm going to teach you how to use these things properly because your advisor may not be giving you the real deal\nWell the

the beauty of CPR again eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine Bob Let's move into health care writers and it's amazing how many people don't know what a health care right or is\nIt you know why maybe because they're working with brokers you use the broker or a U.S if your financial advisor as a stockbroker\nI change if you don't 'cause broker sell your stuff and they're not really helping in these healthcare writers are so important they really are important so in my book taught you know you've read the book numerous times and we talk about on the radio quite a bit chapter five\nIs the rising cost of health care and what you can do about it and there's a whole section in the book that talks about\nHealth care writers and these are so important you know the chapters in the book talk about the invasion of the money's Snatchers understanding your investment options how to know your advisor really works for our advisors paid it covers all this stuff and and this chapter is about health care and the rising costs of reality is is that um\nWe all should have insurance so I Hope everyone has some form of insurance right when you're working through work or or if you're on your company you have a plan of group plan\nAnd when you retire we're Medicare but the flaw that whole system has to do with something called long term care what happens if you down the road you're now older and you need a nursing home\nOr home health care or something like that you know that this event the rails so many financial plans people say they've done everything right\nExcept they never addressed the cost of healthcare long term care and all of a sudden boom they're in trouble because it's a vent happened this is so important to talk about time\nAnd so the the the the thing we have available to us is you can go buy an insurance policy there's people out there that want to sell you a long term care insurance all day long and I'm sure it pays them a big commission yeah and you pay a ton of money every month for your policy\nBut they don't talk to you about this other often called a health care writer so if you're one of the people\nThat are concerned that says I Want a really good plan and my advisor has never told me about the health care writers ... let me teach you real quick because\nThat's a really good point\nWhat do you say if somebody says to you my advisor has never told me about a health care writer never brought it up ... what do you say to somebody that that has a current advisor broker that ... that has never brought up the possibility or at least educating them on a health care writer\nYeah I'll tell you need to find out for yourself because frankly if you get sick it doesn't hurt them or hurts you and your family and so sometimes if you're not working with the right kind of advisor\nOr you're not going to get the right kind of advice I mean it's really that simple so these these health care writers I'd say about health care I just you know if you ever needed long term care home health care we don't really want to think about this but\nThere's actually a very high probability more than fifty percent of us will be using those services one day\nAnd they're really expensive and they're going to be even more expensive down the road\nAnd so you really need to address this but sometimes buying a long term care insurance policy doesn't work sometimes are too expensive I don't really like him personally that much um you know if you've got one nothing wrong with that but I'm not here to tell you to go buy a long term care policy\nWhat I Am telling you is you need to address it and sometimes there's better ways to do it like health care writers\nAnd so", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT the Harwood Way with Robert
