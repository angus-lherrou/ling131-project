you\nThat I mean the stock market is very inflated right now the economy's in in phenomenal shape right now but I think it's important also as some of these indicators are catching people's attention to look back\nAt that big crash back in two thousand seven in two thousand eight and Bob you've repeatedly told us on the show how your portfolios did during one of the rough at times in us investing history\nTaught taught I got to tell you something to two thousand eight was ten years ago more than ten years ago a man it was a to Z that was a big one and it pretty much scared everybody\nOr we don't want to forget that we want to learn from that I mean ten years ago sometimes we kind of block that stuff out but we really need to be thinking about that and our finances because you're exactly right you know markets are high\nAnd and frankly is getting more volatile than it's been in a long time and so we really have to\nAsk ourselves is there a trouble ahead I mean what should we be doing different than we're doing now and you're right at our company at\nA higher with financial group I've always taken a cautious dance with things you know I I was a military pilot I was in the military I was ten years\nUh then I went to the airlines and and our thing was is look you've got a mission to do you got to get it done\nBut you want to do it a safe way as possible so that the right way to

years since the ... uh oh wait the recovery has been phenomenal\nAnd all of our listeners have should have done very very well over the last ten years I've you haven't\nUh you you need to come see us because there's something wrong\nBut there's also a time maybe to down to that risk don't be irrational about risk let's be smart about what we're doing and what we're seeing well Kevin I are seeing all the time is people coming in and their portfolios are a mess they're they're a train wreck they're invested in the wrong areas are wrong things\nYou know look Europe is not doing well right now to be investing in Europe the U.S is leading the charge\nBut also be careful as you've asked in the U.S is not the time to to put the gas pedal down and go pedal to the metal\nAnd about going back to some of the the rocky points in the last ten years I Know you've told us on the show that because of your cautious management\nThat your portfolio is I mean you give us some stats over the years where I you know all the markets in some cases were down or people's portfolios were down forty percent or more\nYeah we were knocked down to you know where we're always going to be careful here's what I boy for us has this really important if you want to make money don't lose it in the first place so that makes sense as a you know the the the will Rogers a more worried about the return of my money

infrastructure of the company and you know if our listeners to this radio show\nIf you are currently using a different broker a different financial planner\nA and also the understand the difference between a broker and and a\nCertified financial planner who is a fiduciary I you know a lot of people don't understand these definitions Bob and that's where\nThe heart would financial group is a

to take a you know do\nBut what did they say they say knowledge is power and financial knowledge is power over your portfolio and your strategy\nAnd also what you hold your advisor accountable is in a lot of advisors or they're selling their stuff they aren't really accountable for what they're doing you know produce Sherrie is going to give you a plan they're going to hold themselves accountable to your plan so I think that's very very important um the other thing is\nSome people say the more money you have the more secure your field right the richer I Am the better I feel about things and I\nDon't know that that's true when we come back from our break because we're coming up on break again I Want to talk to Kevin our cat about that you know do richer people the more money you have do

Barker a little skinny a car and had a microphone take it away out\nThere you go where we're talking about financial planning is really important to have a plan a plan is how you know you're on track\nAs how you know you're going to be okay and that's how you keep your advisor accountable\nTo make sure they're really doing the right thing for you and not just earning a bunch of commissions off of you so it's really really important to have a good plan a city or a Kevin Kevin our cat is one of the advisors with are from he's a great guy\nBut beyond that just been a good guy and a good dad and all the good stuff ah he's also a sea of peas are produced Sherry everyone in our office are for Jewish areas and and the concept of produce is\nThey are here to protect you to watch over you so you are the focus of all of our ... our needs we don't have stock holders of shareholders that are demanding profits and all that stuff off of commission soul to you\nAnd it's a really important concept and before we went to a break\nI made a comment and Kevin is going to talk about this I said do people with a lot of money when you're very wealthy you know let's have a million bucks to a million bucks whatever that is\nFeel a lot better about financial investment person maybe with two hundred three hundred thousand dollars what do you think ...\nI got to tell you people with a lot of money they heal\nPerhaps that they're on track but most of the time that's not the case so what are you saying how can you say that's not the case I say that's not the case most people just have investments and some savings but they haven't taken the time to put together a plan\nBut well here's the issue is is not just how much money you have is how much you're spending right as having the right balance between in life and so sometimes we see people with a great savings\nBut frankly there way overspending they'll never be able to retire with what they're doing they're just not on track\nWhere it was we have people that are more modest and they're right on track you know that they're spending is balance with their savings and everything's perfect you know\nThe the thing you need to do with his wife plan is so important it is it will tell you if you're on track or not doing the right thing and it doesn't matter if you have millions or thousands or hundreds of thousands it doesn't make a difference we're all created equal\nUh we all need to have a good plan and we all have the right to enjoy our time in retirement\n[noise] so it doesn't matter I mean whether you are comfortable whether you're absolutely loaded into whether you pulling to Robert Harward is parking lot and you open the door and\nCash actually falls out of you know old rings and why let me tell you a true story and tell us your it yeah yeah and\nAnd this is all the time I mean not just one time we talked about this on the radio I sat with a couple recently and I mean this this many times I've had this and they've come in and and they kind of feel bad about things they feel like they're not on track their work and I actually retire someday I'm going to be okay\nAnd yet they have everything they need that more than enough money saved the right on track\nBut because they're working with stockbrokers they're not getting the advice they need and they don't feel comfortable you know the plan is going to help you get centered it's going to help you know you're OK and I'll tell you something to we will build a plan for you for free I mean they were not selling plants here\nYou're one of our
