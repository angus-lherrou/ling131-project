Bush lost seats you at Clinton lost seats Obama lost ... it's kind of a given that in the midterms and of course we have the ... coming up and twenty Eighteen that it is not\nOut of the question you know you have a lot of Republican higher image you have a lot of the current Republicans that are not running again I mean some of the numbers is that it was like thirty one seat I mean I I\nI so I'll I'll say something this out this election is going to affect the markets absolutely be prepared for that I Know that there is no doubt and then this tax plan was approved a simple majority just a simple majority ... which means that can be unraveled\nExactly so ... the point is what if the house goes Democrat I I don't want that to happen but what if it happens and what if the Senate ah ends up going a democratic it's simple I mean what Trump is Institute of attacks but could be reversed in you know in a couple of years\nValid I mean that's valid and and not just out here I'm going to put a little common sense what let's say that this doesn't get reverse I mean this tax plan is going to help everybody in my opinion I don't care of your Democrats or Republicans or neither a this tax sponsored help a lot of people so I'm very positive about the tax plan\nAnd that's not being political that's for everybody but here's what I Do know there's a lot of talk about adding more money to our current deficit we owe as a country as people we are a lot of money and they need to manage that deficit to and the only way to manage the deficit is either to spend less money\nRight or pay down the debt to pay down the debt they have to raise your taxes so when we talk about a raw fiery and we will get taxes today that's not how you look at her off because we're all our future investments that money needs to sit in there for at least five years before he can use a tax free but there's some great things about it number one is\nAll the growth in your account all of it you're not being taxed on and when you take it out you're not being tax and you know what else was great no required minimum distributions you when you turn seven and a half you don't have to take money out of a Roth IRA\nThey're wonderful an IRA just a regular retirement account we all know is pre tax write I'm getting a tax deduction today they're going to limit what they put in there I get a tax reduction today but that money does grow\nTax deferred not tax free tax suffered because you\nPay taxes when you take it out so what do we want to I Want my money on a Roth IRA or regular IRA well I'll tell you that the raw fire is going to pay big dividends for those that have the foresight to use them you know what the problem is with a raw fiery where the issue becomes\nA tele\nIncome limits you know if you make too much money your CPA is going to tell you they're going to say do you look you make too much money you write not contribute to a rough\nYou know I was ...

higher taxes down the road so let's take advantage of things now and West Point for the future both of them and one of the things we discussed earlier if you're just joining us\nWhen we discussed earlier is that a Roth IRA is wonderful they're great but if you make too much money you're probably being told you can't have one\nWhich is absolutely not\nTrue anyone if you can contribute to an IRA meaning you have earned income or you can contribute to a four one K. or for three big or your four fifty seven plan if you can do that you can also do are often it doesn't matter on the income\nLimits you can do this if you make fifty thousand a year a hundred thousand a year a million dollars a year\nDon't let anyone tell you that you make too much money to contribute to her office
