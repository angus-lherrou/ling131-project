offer I ... down\nThe CBS News all the our presented by CBS his MCI yes\nAs a secretary as his secretary which ... that is so it's such a bogus argument\nBecause first of all you're dealing with a Warren Buffet trying to compare apples and oranges because the employee the secretary is obviously a W to employ that's having taxes taken out and it seems a certain tax bracket I'm sure Warren Buffett's secretaries making decent coin decent bucks whereas Warren Buffet\nI if I'm not mistaken he takes like a dollar a year in salary corrupt the bulk of his income is derived through capital games of which\nHe would be paying what twenty percent than that I'm sure he qualifies for the Obamacare a hat on and I could get subsidized healthcare probably has a show like twenty three point something percent then yeah yeah so it was secretary might be but that is such a bogus argument anyway I I'd like to take\nA giant lasagna noodles wet and just getting going over the face [laughter] that's all I Want to pay more taxes\nI got an idea so if you're listening to our show your success while you're doing really well or come in and let me teach you how to pay less taxes than your reception is I don't show you what to do that\nWell you know also when you hear some of the celebrities or whomever say oh\nI'll gladly pay more taxes I Want to pay more taxes do you know that you are able to write a check to the U.S treasury you you can make a donation so I'll tell you what all your folks that want higher taxes just write an additional check to the United states treasury\nNow I got a question though would that be a charitable donation [laughter] well that the charity to the government I think that the doctors but knocked out with a new tax plan yeah yeah yeah yeah so you got to be careful with that one just make sure you can the doctor the ducks and hey so here's the thing you know Ross we're going to talk about Roth IRAs first because that's really important\nAnd what's important about a Roth IRA I just had a review what the gentleman and he said I've been putting money in Iraq but I'm not sure why and so that brought to mind was talked about that today why we're also important\nRoss when you put money in a Roth and becoming more and more popular all the time\nBecause they allow you to generate tax for income I mean who wouldn't want tax for income now today with this new tax plan we might say yeah Robert but taxes are really low and I agree with that\nBut this is for your future and we're a tax rates going to be ten years Twenty years down the road I mean they do have a massive deficit and we don't know\nWell also let me interject here with Trump is president and the Republicans controlling the house of representatives and the Senate and obviously the tax plan going through and the changes which are going to be implemented this year what we don't know Bob\nIs what's gonna happen with Congress going forward presidents incumbent presidents presidents in the White House\nTypically loses seats or lose complete control of the house\nIt's happened you know you look at it it uh you you had that George W. Bush lost seats you had Clinton lost seats Obama lost ... it's kind of a given that in the midterms and of course we have the midterms coming up and twenty Eighteen that it is not\nOut of the question you know you have a lot of Republican highlands you have a lot of the current Republicans that are not running again I mean some of the numbers is that it was like thirty one seats I mean I I\nI so I'll I'll say something this out this election is going to affect the markets absolutely be prepared for that I Know that there is no doubt in this tax plan was approved the simple majority just a simple majority ... which means that can be unraveled\nExactly so ... the point is what if the house goes Democrat I I I don't want that to happen but what if it happens and what if the Senate or ends up going a democratic it's simple I mean what Trump has instituted the tax but couldn't be reverse in a in a couple of years\nValid I mean that's valid and and not just out here I'm going to put a little common sense what what say that this doesn't get reverse I mean this tax plan is going to help everybody in my opinion I don't care of your Democrats or Republicans or neither a this tax sponsored help a lot of people so I'm very positive about the tax plan\nAnd that's not being political that's for everybody but here's what I Do know there's a lot of talk about adding more money to our current deficit we owe as a country as people we are a lot of money and they need to manage that deficit to and the only way to manage the deficit is either to spend less money\nRight or pay down the debt to pay down debt they have to raise your taxes so when we talk about a raw fire ray and we look at taxes today that's not how you look at Iraq because we're all our future investments that money and he's just sitting there for at least five years before he can use it tax free but there's some great things about it number one is\nAll the growth in your account all of it you're not being taxed on and when you take it out you're not being tax and you know what else was great no required minimum distributions you when you turned seven and a half you don't have to take money out of a Roth IRA they're wonderful\nAn IRA just a regular retirement account we all know is pre tax write I'm getting a tax deduction today they're going to limit what they put in there I get a tax reduction today but that money does grow tax deferred not tax free tax suffered because\nYou pay taxes when you take it out so what do we want to I Want my money on a Roth IRA\nOr regular IRA well I'll tell you that the raw fire is going to pay big dividends\nFor those that have the foresight to use them you know what the problem is with a raw fiery where the issue becomes a Celtic income limits you know if you make too much money your CPA is going to tell you they're going to say you look you make too much money you write not contribute to a rough\nYou know I was ... was I'm not going to tell you exactly what I make a but I was in that predicament where I couldn't do a rough but\nA few years back maybe what six seven years ago ... thousand ten was there was some kind of a you know exactly what I'm saying that's why I Love working with Bob Harward he knows exactly what I'm Talking about my accountant\nCame to me and said you're not gonna believe this but there is a loophole this year you can convert to a rural office is like a one time deal where whereas in the past I did not qualify but then suddenly I qualified and that door has that door been closed again or what what role I'm\nGoing to well it's different this time but I'm going to tell you something there's a loophole today that everyone can be using to fund the rough everybody and and we're at the end of the segment so you're gonna have to stay tuned to the next segment because there's so much I Want to teach you on TALK about but the bottom line is\nI don't care what your income is you can find the raw don't want your CPAs tell you otherwise or anybody else your friends at work\nAnd we're going to talk about how to do that we're gonna have to do next segment because we're out of time but what I Do want to tell you

and one of the things we discussed earlier if you're just joining us\nWhen we discussed earlier is that a Roth IRA is wonderful they're great but if you make too much money you're probably being told you can't have one\nWhich is absolutely not\nTrue anyone if you can contribute to an IRA meaning you have earned income or you can contribute to a four one K. or for three big or your four fifty seven point if you can do that you can also do are often it doesn't matter\nOn the income limits you can do this if you make fifty thousand a year a hundred thousand a year a million dollars a year don't
