Eighteen fifty one storm that's been talked about\n[noise] uh and then you know pressure's pressures as well Labor Day was the lowest pressure ever Camille was second Michael ... third or so they want to talk about oh a like like these ... these severe hurricanes only started now with a man made climate change when you look back decades and decades and decades\nEven Nineteen thirty five Eighteen

Bush lost seats you at Clinton lost seats Obama lost ... it's kind of a given that in the midterms and of course we have the midterms coming up and twenty eight team that it is not\nOut of the question you know you have a lot of Republican highlands you have a lot of the current Republicans that are not running again I mean some of the numbers is that it was like thirty one seat I mean I I I so I'll\nI'll say something this out this election is going to affect the markets absolutely be prepared for that well I Know that there is no doubt and then this tax plan was approved the simple majority just a simple majority ... which means that can be unraveled\nExactly so ... the point is what if the house goes Democrat I I don't want that to happen but what if it happens and what if the Senate ah ends up going a democratic it's simple I mean what Trump is instituted the tax but couldn't be reversed in you know in a couple of years\nValid I mean that's valid and and not just out here I'm going to put a little common sense what what say that this doesn't get reverse I mean this tax plan is going to help everybody in my opinion I don't care of your Democrats or Republicans or neither a this tax sponsored help a lot of people so I'm very positive about the tax plan\nAnd that's not being political that's for everybody but here's what I Do know there's a lot of talk about adding more money to our current deficit we owe as a country as people we are a lot of money and they need to manage that deficit to and the only way to manage the deficit is either to spend less money\nRight or pay down the debt to pay down the debt they have to raise your taxes so when we talk about a Roth IRA and we will get taxes today that's not how you look at her off because we're all our future investments that money needs to sit in there for at least five years before he can use a tax free but there's some great things about it number one is\nAll the growth in your account all of it you're not being taxed on and when you take it out you're not being tax and you know what else was great no required minimum distributions you when you turn seven and a half you don't have to take money\nOut of a Roth IRA they're wonderful an IRA just a regular retirement account we all know is pre tax write I'm getting a tax deduction today they're going to limit what they put in there I get a tax reduction today but that money does grow tax deferred not tax free tax suffered because\nPay taxes when you take it out so what do we want to I Want my money on a Roth IRA or regular IRA well I'll
