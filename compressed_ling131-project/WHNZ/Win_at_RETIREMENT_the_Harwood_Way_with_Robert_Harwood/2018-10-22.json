military order and but this is equipment and various things harder from Saudi Arabia [noise]\nFour hundred and fifty million dollars I think it's over a million jobs [noise]\nThat's not helpful for us to cancel it order like that [noise]\nUm you know the number and also it went from a hundred and fifty billion the foreigner fifty billion the job numbers again\nAre all over the road a Trump originally claimed that the Saudi or the military or it could be tied to forty thousand jobs then it jumped to like half a million jobs now he just said a million jobs so that's kind of all over the road as well\nAnd I'm I Can't sit there and say that oh man that's that's that's great [laughter]\nGet just get the right numbers and stick with the numbers [laughter] or just just say just say

management\nMy story began with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nYou're in depth and you need help coal trinity one eight hundred three six three five one three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let\nOther people have written this thing up and and that's wonderful but eventually eventually this growth is going to stop right we're going to take the stimulus out of the marketplace is going to be more volatile and\nThat's what we're seeing right now you know it has been a long time since two thousand a correction that was a big one that one was a doozy but it was a long time ago and and people for kind of forget what it felt like two two I've lost thirty forty fifty percent of their life savings I mean down\nAnd and thank God has recovered\nAnd things are going well right now but those threats are still out there those problems are still out there and and it was in the back of our mind so uh what we're seeing right now is\nUh the stimulated the market they printed a lot of money we talked about this on radio shows right they they want to get this market going after two thousand eight they want it to prevent the next Great Depression\nAnd to do that they had two major tools they lowered\nInterest rates so that people and companies can borrow money cheaply right and keep everyone employed that worked pretty good but they also printed money they printed money like crazy and everyone was getting nervous and concern back then\nAs they should be today because the fed was printing trillions of trillions of dollars are putting an end to the markets to make money available so the market can recover\nAnd are the United states that the money that we owe as a nation goes out of control trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars are being laid on to this country\nAnd they have to service that debt they've got to pay the interest on that debt as well as the military mil you know government pension is all this stuff Social Security Medicare Medicaid they've all these things they have to pay for\nAlong with this giant norm is that they created so this is what has happened as a result of the stimulus program getting out of two thousand eight and and you've got to remember how bad it fell back then that was miserable\nAnd also with interest rates are starting to pick up now yeah there is positive and negative there but I didn't really you don't want your interest rates sitting\nAt a next to zero because the number one complaint that you heard as well as advisors all over the country and what really was weighing on people's minds that if you had a C. D. or if you had some money in cash\nThat you weren't making any interest on that many money that's that's number one a and also in a healthy economy\nYou should have a a viable decent interest rate it's just it it's a sign that the economy is in good shape what I'm Talking about some of those crazy hyper interest rates that occurred back during the Carter administration for instance and I remember I was a kid back then\nI bought I was during the Carter administration I was eleven twelve Thirteen Years old\nAnd I ... I remember the news stories I remember my parents who are trying to get a mortgage and some of the interest rates back to if I'm not mistaken they were knocking on twenty percent I mean whoa yeah it was an addict control so you don't want a reasonable interest great it's a sign of a good economy but also what's important\nIs if there is another economic kick up if there was another catastrophic event you know the fed\nNeeds room to then lower interest rates if in fact you need to try to economically recover and it's tough to lower interest rates you know when you're essentially at at bumped is zero that's why with a good economy they're starting to raise rates\nI mean you bring up a good point here here's the thing to two thousand eight was horrible there wasn't anybody I think that didn't get hurt and two thousand eight and and it's hard to remember that 'cause it's a long time ago but we will have more of those two thousand eight there's no doubt about it the market goes up in the market goes down\nRight now right now the market has been stimulated into a recovery right lowering interest rates printing money cheap monies available and and the market recovers well\nYou just hit on it you know here's the good news is the good news is the market is good enough has done well enough that if they can raise rates you got to look at that as a positive thing\nAnd the other part of the thing that's wonderful at the market crashed again by raising race they can lower it right there I got ammunition to to address the issues but think about this for a minute if lowering interest rates helped the market recover\nWhat those raising interest rates do it adds to volatility it adds to problems so here's what I Believe we're going to talk about what you need to do uh to to get through this kind of market but here's what I Believe\nThe days of stimulus are over okay they are not stimulating the market they are I don't think this is a word but they are on stimulating or these stimulating the bark and they're taking the stimulus out so what are they doing\nThey're raising interest rates that's a good thing it's a good thing for two reasons are children would not have a future that we just kept doing what we were doing we need a future for our children\nThey also couldn't be doing this the market wasn't doing well but here's the bad thing as they take this stimulus out of the market the market is going to react very poorly if it's like I think of it like sugar you ... you give sugar to your children\nAnd they get all hyperactive you take the sugar away and they go through withdrawals and they act poorly will the stock market is acting out\nHere's the other than they are doing this really important they printed a lot of money and they put trillions of dollars into the market to make money available so that people can pay their bills and businesses have access to funds cheap money\nWhile they're actually taking that money out with a lot of people aren't talking about right now as of the trillions they put in\nThey've already taken one half of the trillion dollars out so this is kind of interesting they actually physically removed money is called tightening\nAnd they literally if you look it up and the Web you'll see that they burn it you know we have to take money out of the market I mean there are bags of money on their armed guards and the incinerator now I'd like to be the guy working at the center writer but not really about the answer is if they're burning money they're taking money out of the market and the market is struggling\nBecause of the lack of stimulus has been used to stimulus now says two thousand eight the stimulus has gone and what that means to us and we're talking about this is you got to tighten your seatbelt right now it is not that market we're in before where you throw a dark and everything goes up\nIt's a different market and frankly if they don't do a good job and they're tightening taking this them is out there are going to cost\nThe next crash if they do something wrong they could cause the next sock market crash so there's a lot of things you need to do I want to teach you what to do\nWell and that's what your clients expect from you and it's not just you know the coal lions as your your uh your customers or your client you got a relationship and you know you your your\nYour people that you advise ... they're not just numbers they're not just an account number on the body comes down to you have relationships with all of\nThe people that you advise that I think

or even new clients and they just they love you know they say\nThey they uh they ... you hear about a doctor's good bedside manner and just what what people say about you and your advisory team at Harwood financial I've experienced it firsthand is truly commendable by the way\nThank you know we have a great team around the sun and we're talking about his ... in the program but we offer this program called CPR where people could come in and meet with me and get a good review I'm going to tell you that this is the time if you haven't been in yet a lot of people with a it's a time to come

together what me show you the things I'm teaching you on the radio and let me show you how to apply to your portfolio because frankly the market is changing is a harder time to invest right now\nAnd
