[noise]\n\nYou can listen on our first heart radio as\nEasy as news on the hour presented by God friend to me\nBut Warren Buffett when you please shut up about this I Want to pay more taxes you know what does so deceptive and I know we've talked about this in the past\nUh Bob you and I personally ... it might have come up on the show is that Warren Buffett what he's done ... remember the old story about Warren Buffett doesn't pay as much into ...\nAs a secretary has his secretary which ... that is so it's such a bogus argument because first of all you're dealing with Warren Buffet trying to compare apples and oranges because\nThe employee the secretary is obviously a W to employ that's having taxes taken out and it seems a certain tax bracket I'm sure Warren Buffett's secretaries making decent coin decent bucks whereas Warren Buffett\nIf I'm not mistaken he takes like a dollar a year in salary for adults the bulk of his income is derived through capital gains of which\nHe would be paying what twenty percent than that I'm sure he qualifies for the Obamacare a head on and I can get subsidized healthcare probably has a somewhat like twenty three point something percent and secretary might be but that is such a bogus argument anyway I I'd like to take\nA giant lasagna noodles wet and just flat or any of the face [laughter] that's all I Want to pay more taxes\nI got an idea so if you're listening to our show and your success while you're doing really well or come in and let me teach you how to pay less taxes than your reception is I don't show you what to do that\nWell you know also when you hear some of the celebrities or whomever say oh I'll gladly pay more taxes I Want to pay more taxes do you know that you are able to write a check to the U.S treasury you you can make a donation so I'll tell you what all your folks want higher taxes\nJust write an additional check to the United states treasury\nNow I got an I'd a question though would that be a charitable donation [laughter] well not giving to charity to the government\nI think that the ducks has been knocked out with a new tax plan yeah yeah\nYeah yeah so you got to be careful with that one just make sure you conducted the ducks and hey so here's the thing you know Ross we're going to talk about Roth IRAs first because that's really important\nAnd what's important about a Roth IRA I just had a a review what the gentleman and he said I've been putting money on Iraq but I'm not sure why and so that brought to mind was talking about that today why we're also important\nRoss when you put money in a raw becoming more and more popular all the time because they allow you to generate tax for income I mean who wouldn't want tax for income now today with this new tax plan we might say yeah Robert but taxes are really low\nAnd I agree with that but this is for your future and we're a tax rates going to be ten years Twenty years down the road I mean they do have a massive deficit and we don't know\nWell also let me interject here with Trump is president and the Republicans controlling the house of representatives and the Senate and obviously the tax plan going through and the changes which are get going to be implemented this year what we don't know Bob\nIs what's gonna happen with Congress going forward presidents incumbent presidents presidents in the White House\nTypically loses seats or lose complete control of the house\nIt's happened you know you look at it it uh you you had that George W. Bush lost seats you at Clinton lost seats Obama lost ... it's kind of a given that in the midterms and of course we have the midterms coming up and twenty Eighteen that it is not\nOut of the question you know you have a lot of Republican higher image you have a lot of the current Republicans that are not running again I mean some of the numbers is that it was like thirty one seats I mean I I I so I'll\nI'll say something this out this election is going to affect the markets absolutely be prepared for that well I Know that there is no doubt and then this tax plan was approved a simple majority just a simple majority ... which means that can be unraveled\nExactly so ... the point is what if the house goes Democrat I I don't want that to happen but what if it happens and what if the Senate or ends up going a democratic it's simple I mean what Trump is Institute of attacks but could be reversed in you know in a couple of years\nValid I mean that's valid and and not just out here I'm going to put a little common sense what let's say that this doesn't get reverse I mean this tax plan is going to help everybody in my opinion I don't care of your Democrats or Republicans or neither a this tax sponsored help a lot of people so I'm very positive about the tax plan\nAnd that's not being political that's for everybody but here's what I Do know there's a lot of talk about adding more money to our current deficit we owe as a country as people were your lot of money and they need to manage that deficit to and the only way to manage the deficit is either to spend less money\nRight or pay down the debt to pay down the debt they have to raise your taxes so when we talk about a raw fiery and we will get taxes today that's not how you look at her off because we're all our future investments that money needs to sit in there for at least five years before he can use a tax free but there's some great things about it number one is\nAll the growth in your account all of it you're not being taxed on and when you take it out you're not being tax and you know what else was great no required minimum distributions you when you turned seven and a half you don't have to take money out of a Roth IRA\nThey're wonderful an IRA just a regular retirement account we all know is pre tax write I'm getting a tax deduction today they're going to women want to put in there I get a tax reduction today but that money does grow\nTax deferred not tax free tech suffered because you pay taxes when you take it out so what do we want to I Want my money on a Roth IRA\nOr regular IRA well I'll tell you that the Roth IRA is going to pay big dividends for those that have the foresight to use them you know what the problem is with a raw fiery where the issue becomes\nA tell me\nIncome limits you know if you make too much money your CPA is going to tell you they're going to say that you will you make too much money you might not contribute to her off\nYou know I was ...
