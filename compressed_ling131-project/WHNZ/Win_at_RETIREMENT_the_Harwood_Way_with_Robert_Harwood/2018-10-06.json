civilization the biggest thing ever this this technological revolution that's going on and and this guy is just really a smart guy and\nThe ... when he talks you've got to us you know it's just it's just that smart and this is a trend with technology that's going on right now that we as investors can take advantage of I mean this is a great opportunity there's a lot of things going on right now you know the tax plan and all that\nBut inside here are opportunities that you can take advantage of it as an investor\nAnd technology is one of those trends so I don't know if your advisors feel this way or you feel this way but I got to tell you something uh this technology is going to evolve the world who we are you know I remember you probably remember this George Jetsons you remember the Jetsons were that were that old you know\nGet it all was said that the flying cars that noise ... or you know that and\nThat technology well listen I don't know that we're going to live in a pot up in the air or anything but a lot of that stuff is actually happening and we as investors or me as your investment manager\nShould be taking advantage of some of these things this is where a lot of the growth and the market has been over the last few years this technology\nNow above that you just say that you don't know if we're going to live in a pond up in the air out I just guessing that might have been a stretch of the joy you know I'm just saying if you don't manage their finances right\nIf you don't plan well for retirement you might be living in a pot in your front yard I'm Talking about one of those were those moving boxes so [laughter]\nYou know that you know there are only like a hundred and sixty five bucks a month at the air conditioning but you can do that yeah pretty cost effective actually you know you remember the show we did about the guy that said he could live on like four or five dollars a day and they have it I ... back yard yeah they don't want to be the person that had the ... are\nYou mention the genius you mention the astrophysicist Stephen Hawking and\nThere was a story maybe a year or two ago you know there's the kids just just a little sidebar here you know there's a conspiracy theory that's been floating around for a couple of years that Stephen Hawking actually had passed away a while ago and he was replaced with a body double\nA or knowing how 'bout an alien that's in his body I [laughter] crazy stuff Ida ... let's let's dive into the nuts and bolts let's talk financial gut check\n... well before I get there I Want to tell you something funny though I don't want to go there yet I Want to talk about something else okay so we have these opportunities\nIn the market because of this evolution make sure you're taking advantage of it if you want to learn how to invest in these things I'll teach you but they're smart ways to do this now I'll tell you there's another side so here's this genius that says that this is going to change the world and what a great opportunity this for people\nAnd there's another genius out there his name is Iran must remember two thousand one space odyssey\nI'd have to yeah how are they right when the computer how how how how two thousand right yeah how takes intro so what does Iran must say he says don't worry about North Korea North Korea is a big threat the big threat\nOur robotics these robotics we're going to have two thousand one space odyssey these robots her to take over the world\n... it'll be kind of like planet of the apes most of the apes there'll be robots I guess\nYou know by the way I Apologize how nine thousand I said how two thousand and I I shorted how by seven grand\nYeah well I got to come back and get you for these will be carrying vehicle so so he's saying boy this technology here's what I Do here's what I Know we're in a World War cars are going to be self driving manufacturing is done by robots right medicine advances a lot of it has to do with this technology\nAnd as investors man what a what what a great day to take advantage of now I'm not saying that you throw your money in this\nBut don't ignore it either you know investing is about opportunities about being able to make money but maybe minimizing the risk as best you can as you're making money\nAnd so my job is help guide through these things stay abreast with things and show you how to do well I mean we've got this\nEvolution our world and there's two sided I mean it was on one side here's a bad side I don't think he won mosque by us smarter than I Am but I don't think we're in a World War three with robots but here's what I Do know a robot takes the place of a person\nAnd that person used to pay taxes and feed their family with that money and the robot doesn't and so we are going to lose the tax revenues and things like that I'm sure of that you know as this robot has come in and it's going to cost us jobs\nWell you know it it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me and I've discussed this on my nationally syndicated Schmidt show on numerous occasions all this chatter about AI artificial intelligence and robots and replacing people if your place all the people\nAnd you know ... what what people do and I know that all all there'll be other jobs in ... you know I I don't know if that in a case that that concerns me if you can create all the robots you want but\nIf you don't have people that perform work that earn an income I mean that can be a huge corruption to the economy\nWell I can tell you there's a committee that's been formed and in Congress to research just because their concern is social unrest people don't have jobs and the other one is tax revenues and one of the proposals is to start taxing robot so let's say you have the car Ford Motor company with a robot painting a car\nWhile he replaced the individual that used to pay taxes on his income and they're saying well why can't we taxis robots I mean this is going to change a lot of things it's monumental in our world but here's what I Want to say to our listeners is\nAs this evolution occur as\nWe're talking about investing we're talking about smart places to invest your money to make a little money I Would never put all my money into this stuff\nBut should you not have some exposure to it when you like to see your portfolio grow as the world changes and we take advantage of these things so these are opportunities that you have when people come in and sit with me at where the program called CPR complete planning review\nI I get to see how you're investing I get to see what your advisors are doing and and frankly there's typically a lot of room for improvement you can do a lot better than you're doing right now and some of these things are common sense you know where we invest what we do how much risk we take my job is to help you balance that stuff out\n[noise] well it's a simple process or the harlot financial group has a grown in reputation over the years\nYou have a wonderful client base you know the best thing about your client base is they recommend due to their friends their relatives their associates their colleagues that is the sincere as former flattering that's the highest form when when you're recommended by your clients\nAre taught absolutely you know we have a good relationship we we I was ... but we care where do share as we do ah the best we can all the time for our clients that the thing that I Want to kind of expressed of our listeners because you are listening to learn and grow and do better with their finances\nIs there are certain opportunities that are available for you and those opportunities are only here for a short time so if you want to take advantage of them than than you need to do that you need to take action with that stuff and we can help you do that you're visor can help you do that you can do it on your own\nBut what's take advantage of these things are certain areas of our market that is just going gangbusters\nAnd there's other areas that are doing very poorly and so don't let your advisor put you in everything let's put ourselves in the good stuff it was not invest in the bad stuff\nIn in the end you're going to do a lot better it's how you make money in markets like this um I Want to talk about we'll get to the gut check when we come back in the next segment Todd but what I Want to do is suggests that if you would like to sit with me and and you want to get a review just come on and let's look at what you're doing\nAnd let's see if I can help you in any way and I

I can be part of your team I mean you need to tell you what you don't need\nIs someone selling you a bunch of financial products and they don't worry about it here's a great mutual fondness these twelve stocks are amazing\nThat's why it's kind of drives me nuts I mean in your space in the financial planning space you have there are less than I was going to say you got a whole bunch of herb ... like from WNPR pay\nYou have you know used car salesman types all they care about is the commission that's got to drive you nuts when you see that that's\nJust not right taught it isn't right so how do you hit a target if you don't even know what the target is I mean I just recently sat with a couple um came in from for CPR came in from the radio show\nAnd they already had made the decision before they came in to see me that they're retiring in three years and uh they had spoken to their advisor about it he didn't seem to have any concern but he didn't even voice anything you know basically we want to retire and three years and the guy says yeah OK no big deal\nWell well here's the deal okay um this this gentleman already told a supervisor that he was leaving the ongoing in three years I work on my replacements so I think that was nice as a whole lot better than two weeks notice\nRight but neither one of them had ever ever taken the time to think about their finances saying okay I'm going to retire but am I really going to have what I Need and retirement\nAnd what's the best way to protect that money while woman retirement you gotta be careful once you in a retirement how you invest\nThat money in these last a long time so they never even took the time to think about these days they just said I'm ready to retire as time I think I have enough money we're outta here in three years that is so dangerous because guess what if he gets derailed in retirement\nMaybe too much risk not enough money spending too much whatever that is\nHe's already given up a good job you you're not going to walk back to that job they are going to have replaced you\nAnd what you don't want to be is having to do some job to make a living that you don't enjoy\nSo the gut checks really really important that came in they sat with me that the CPR\nAnd we sat down and you know what they're going to be fine they're going to do great they needed some adjustments I showed them how to improve few things we set some savings targets\nAre we created what I call cheerful on your retirement is the funniest thing in the world will do that together and CPR\nBut we had to put together a few things to make this work for them but they're on track to tame and they they they said look I Need some help with this I listen to all the time I I ... for years I never came in I I'm Glad I finally called I finally made that decision but in the end\nWe were able to catch now if you want to be doing this stuff as early as possible and I'll tell you this if you're already retired you still need to know this stuff you still need to know your\nNumber and my job just like with this gentleman this couple I sat down and then our first meeting I was able to build them the roadmap I was able to show them the things they need to change\nI we determine what their number is how much money they need to retire comfortably how much can they spend every month and never run out and we put all this together and it was great now what if they were off you know he's three years prior to retirement what if they didn't have enough money what if they were spending too much water things weren't right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT the Harwood Way with Robert Harwood", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
