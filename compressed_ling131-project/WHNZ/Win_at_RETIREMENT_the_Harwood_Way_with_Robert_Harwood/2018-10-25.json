did they make ... or this woman sweating like\n\nWell let's see where this investigation goes um [noise] let's see if there were any charges filed I Can't wait to find out exactly as we have an idea we know the false statements regarding Kevin but what exactly what we get some some leakage on that we have a Campbell's Soup conspiracy problem\nTalking about we're ... we got a problem we're in\nThe soap got another ... a a Campbell's Soup vice president in a hot soup\nOver a George Soros conspiracy tweet ... he's a man I dislike George Soros as much as maybe your view I don't want to see him blown up in a pipe bomb placed that his mailbox and one of his helpers or one of his help\nHelp whatever we have a Campbell Soup vice president and the interim a chief executive apologizing for the tweet\nFrom one of their senior company employees so the interim the interim and then have to deal with junk like this so the the temporary the interim CEO for Campbell Soup had to apologize for the VP because\nHe tweeted out of conspiracy theory regarding the illegal alien migrant caravan which is heading toward the U.S\n[noise] turns out Kelly Johnston\nIs Campbell is vice president of government affairs and tweeted earlier this week that billionaire George Soros was deploying rail cars to transport a caravan of immigrants trying to enter the U.S illegally\nWill yeah so this guy's going to leave the company or next month and this was a previously\nPlanned exit but uh we have the apology so he's he's tweeting and stuff like that just concerned that you know as people of all walks of life he Campbell Soup although if you're following business news the sales of Campbell's Soup\nAnd they have frozen food divisions and all kinds of other products that are owned by by Campbell a but\nThe traditional soups\nThose sales have been taken it on the gym they've ... they've gone steadily down and they're trying to you know recover or the the\nThe volume of soup sales

the typical soup and in the typical well no not Andy Warhol artwork Campbell Soup can in the traditional condense soup I'm\nWith old gold the circle and king and the variety those sales have been

they don't know how to put the pieces together so you can see the pictures of puzzle right yeah so so you know they're they're puzzles told jumbled and so what's really really important is not just having all the pieces you need but how those pieces fit together so you can get the right view of what you're trying to create\nAnd so this is one of the biggest problems I say when people come in and sit with us is that they don't really have a path they don't have a plan or the puzzle is built for them but most people have savings or maybe a little pension coming in or whatever that is a once you're in retirement\nYour strategies become so important on how you withdraw\nOr how much you withdraw where I come from taxes because you need your nest egg to last as long as you do right you you don't want to I think my mom used the terminology I don't want to live too long well my mom is eighty seven and going strong\nAnd she's living in a long time but I think what she meant by I don't want to live to along as well she really meant was I don't want to outlive my money\n... it's a problem it's a problem well that's a fear that many have and that is I think something that keeps people up at night the fear\nOf not having enough money if you lived too long right so you have questions for me I've got the buses and the Danes writing so Bob give me a [noise]\nIf I get it wrong and give me a [noise]\nRight so these are easy because you're going to have a fifty fifty choice that there are they're true or false guy okay true or false most people claim Social Security security benefits prior to reaching for retirement age for taking their benefits early true or false\nThat is correct I Believe that a lot of people take their benefits too early and I don't think they get to maximize the benefits that are coming at them give yourself a clap go to\nHere's the thing or you can take Social Security or as long as you have your working credits as early as sixty two years old\nOr you can take it as the latest Seventy years old and you can take it anywhere in between it isn't sixty two or your retirement age or Seventy or you can pick it anywhere in between and if you're married your spouse can either have their own Social Security or claim against your so you really have a lot of options on how you take Social Security\nFull retirement age that's what the actuarial is those people to figure it out that the curves and this sure ah the forward tournament is sixty six to sixty seven years old it depends on where you were born\nAll right so if somebody takes their benefits as early as possible how much are they leaving on the table let's say every month percentage wise or so ... if if they wake\nThat's a great question look every one if you can afford to do so I Would say most of the time for the way to take Social Security 'cause it's growing at seven or eight percent every year you're going to get a lot more money but some people need to take it early uh sixty two because maybe you don't have that much is savings or you need the income then you take it early\nBut every or your weight you get bigger and bigger and bigger now here's the problem Seventy five percent of retirees take it prior to their normal retirement age and I can tell you that they shouldn't be doing that not Seventy five percent maybe a few people knew to take it early\nBut they should be waiting you are leaving thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars on the table by picking your Social Security wrong\nSo you want to make sure you have a good strategy a it is often desk to to take the highest earner and wait the longest and the lower earner and take it early and there's all these strategies you can do\nThe key is don't just take it early you know the the people take it early for two reasons\nThe number one reason I hear all the time is they think Social Security is going to go broke and they want to get their money but are gone right\nWell that's an emotional decision but probably not the best decision to make and the second one was uh my parents died early I might to you know with and uh we're healthier we live longer and they have already figured out on the Social Security that\nOr it's going to be pretty equal if you live a normal life expectancy so those of us that are healthier should take it later\nIf you have a serious health issue taken earlier but the key is don't just take it or don't arbitrarily take it early because your friends did or or because something inside of you says it's so scary is gonna go broke and won't be there are none of those are good reasons the good thing to do is wait and take it at the right time\nRight so according to the according to the Social Security administration a full retirement age right now is what sixty six\nThat depends on the year you were born so people in their fifties or sixties under are going to be sixty seven years old sixty seven okay yeah and some of the people if you're in your sixties but not quite sixty six yet is sixty six and maybe one month or four months we've got so between sixty six sixty seven and it grows\nIt will grow seven or eight percent every year you wait so you got to make at least seven or eight percent your investments every single year to make it smart to\nTake it early um here's the thing with us we use a program so we actually uh have a program that's available that I can put in your age is your age your spouse's age how much money you make your tax rates very sophisticated\nAnd then it will come out and show you may be five different options\nAnd then we can pick from the options the smartest one for you\nSo we can run our program and we can get you real data on one to take your Social Security\nAnd often times one will take it early on one takes it later and that's usually a great strategy so you know if you want us to run the program you want us to look at your Social Security I just give us a call and we can help you with that we might be able to do it over the phone are you coming for a meeting\nOr whatever you want to do but but let's make sure you're not making a mistake so the answer is most people take their Social Security early\nAh and probably most of the time they shouldn't be doing that so that's a true statement\nAlright ready for the next question\nNext one true or false to support your lifestyle in retirement you'll need a hundred percent of your pre retirement income in other words if you're a person that that make Seventy five thousand dollars a year ... Seventy five in retirement true or false\nUh I Would say to support your lifestyle and retirement you need a hundred percent of your pre retirement income I'm going to say that is true okay I'll give yourself a\nBad grade on that one the answer is it's really fall\nAnd the reason being and we're going to get into this a little more detail we're talking about how to calculate what you need to know your number\nBut inside your paycheck oftentimes you're saving for your for one case or you're lucky from it\nYou're paying into Social Security or paying into Medicare you're paying a insurances that might be different in retirement and so in retirement actually you know your taxes go down and hopefully a little bit of your ... and you'll need a little less money we'll talk about how to do that\nBut by God I was I think I think I'm right because I was planning on the retiring going to the RV place and buying a hundred thousand dollar or golf or or you ...\nKnow the Gulf War so here's the thing we're going to come back and talk about this next segment I'm ... that the most important thing is that you have a plan that when I Want you to learn from what we're talking about today and uh if there's any way we can help you with your retirement plan and putting your plan together and your investment management I Want you to feel costs\nLook cause and just ask us questions will help you Social Security strategies how much you do for retirement we can talk about all these things when we have a meeting together\nThat folks are we are doing the little quiz here now you can tell it's

and meet me or one of my advisors and just get a look over just get a second opinion what you're doing\nYou know Bob let me put this into a regular Schmidt show Taj knit a layperson talk in the sense that\nIf you're in again your thirties forties fifties sixties [noise]\nIf you don't have a retirement plan again the earlier you start the better to have that track that trajectory to follow it is never too early to make a plan and if you don't have a plan or if you have been with the same advisor for a long time\nAnd you'd like to get a second opinion\nI don't get too late in the game and say

away some more free books than by [noise]\nCourse as love thousand dollars to exit nationwide keyword brought the two hundred two hundred you'll get a text confirming entry plus ... radio info Sanders data message rates apply in his nationwide contest that walk tissue under two hundred [noise] as it should be [noise]\nHarwood way with Robert Harward anti Schmidt couple of seconds ago we gave away

take twelve corps so twelve listeners right now Robert ... book investing for retirement the ultimate guide to not outliving your money is yours absolutely for folks this book is like Eighteen Ninety five Nineteen bucks on Amazon\nAnd incidentally when the book does sell on Amazon this this spectacular I Know Bob uh blush as when I bring this up but all of the profits from the book\nWhen it's sold go to military charities\nOr even the year plus the Bob uh spent writing this book that was all technically donated really because all of the profits from this book go to military charities of course Bob a veteran of the United States Air force was\nActually a deployed and and then flew during the first Desert Storm\nAnd uh it it it makes Bob feel good to give back to the military folks the book\nWhile it's sold on Amazon and does very well because it's become an Amazon top one hundred best seller the book as yours fully right now first twelve callers eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine let me tell you what I like about the book I just did a quick nutshell here\nBut I find the book is written in extremely approachable early I find it to be written in just commonsense everyday language you're not talking over the listener or the investors had\nA I find myself when I got questions about certain areas or for investing and retiring and how to say I I refer to the book on multiple occasions I keep a copy in the studio I've got a copy at home for instance\nAnd you know one of the the greatest things about the book\nYou have a chapter\nIn putting a guard rails in place and that's these are protective investment guard rails and the best way to look at this folks is that when you're on a bridge yeah let's let's take the the sunshine skyway or the Howard Franklin bridge or\nOr their railings on the side so if you accidentally veer off to the left or the right that you don't go into Tampa Bay uh yes so imagine having an investment strategy without guard rails\nSo if you don't have the guard rails your investment strategy could drive off into Tampa Bay\nSo there's a great chapter in this book on making sure your guard rails are in place\nAnd the equivalent of driving your car off a bridge into the bay a would be if you're a investment strategy is wrong and you're not protected\nIf in fact that the market goes left the market goes right the market goes up the market goes down so that that's just one of the chapters in the book that really stands out Bob and I again first twelve callers right now the book is yours absolutely free and\nIt'll be mailed to you for free as well eight hundred three nine five\nFour to seven night grab a copy of the book right now like a Bible give out the more information on how our listeners can also come in and meet you and your team personally to get a ... a CPR that's a complete a planning review and we'll get into that in just a bit but let's continue with the quiz that we have going on\nWe're taking our retirement and investment I. Q. test right this is a very very important test if you're approaching retirement already retired somewhere in that zone\nAnd I wanted to review just for a second the first question we had true or false was most people claim Social Security benefits before for retirement age and and that's true most people are taking it too early that's right for some\nBut not right for everyone so you want to really claim it the right time otherwise you're leaving money on the table you want to get the most back you paid into Social Security and whether you like it or not you have to pay into it\nGet back as much as you can the second question true or false to support your lifestyle in retirement you'll need a hundred percent of your pre retirement income that's false\nOr what you need is a hundred percent of your pre retirement spending if you're spending five thousand a month or six thousand dollars a month you got to make sure you're going to have that and retirement or something close to that\nThat's very very important typically it takes about eight times your last year's salary so if you make by fifty thousand dollars a year you these four hundred thousand dollars a savings\nMaybe five hundred thousand savings that just depends on your lifestyle but that's an easy one to figure out what can we help everyone so last one I asked you that we didn't answer true or false is that once you file for Social Security you cannot change your mind is that true or false\nUh yet you tease me with the question once you file for Social Security you can't reverse your decision or changed your mind", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT the Harwood Way with Robert Harwood", "city": "Tampa", "day": "25"}
