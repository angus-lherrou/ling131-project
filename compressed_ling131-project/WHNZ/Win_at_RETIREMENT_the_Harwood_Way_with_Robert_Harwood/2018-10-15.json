{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "The guys and again they pull out these these anecdotal stories on both sides and\nThat's the gospel know when you're a scientist your scientists that no I Am not invested disagree with that you know I I was thinking what if he said now I've seen the hurricane situations and change my mind that really is climate change and I thought okay\nSo we address this last week the hurricane situation there really is climate change when some are trying to point to hurricane Michael last week that smashed the Florida Panhandle\nAnd it is the fourth strongest storm by women at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour landfall but it's it's number for the strongest is Labor Day Nineteen thirty five\nAnd then as far as low as barometric pressure levels\nLabor Day Nineteen thirty five was number one Camille in Nineteen sixty nine was number two and Michael is two thousand Eighteen it's not like from the year Nineteen Ninety nine or two thousand two thousand for up until now that we've got these devastating hurricane to every single year that are getting worse and worse and this place the stats from those hurricanes back\nIn Eighteen fifty one Nineteen thirty five Nineteen sixty nine\nI you know again there's this she's she's disapproving or self feeder\nAnd what an impact what an ... I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about on that really I it is they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than\nWhat we just had with that is true cycle says that they say when they say that India but what about scientists and say it's worse than ever\nIt's worse than ever I mean that's just incorrect Leslie stall it's wrong I then what else oh uh I didn't like this is Forrest falling in love with Kim zone\nIf we were going to war\nWith North Korea now you don't hear that you don't have any talk of it and\nHe doesn't want to go to war and we don't want to go to war [noise]\nAnd she understands the nuclear ... he's agreed to it and you see that he's going to you than I Do trust him yeah I trust them that doesn't mean I Can't be proven lie trust as well first of all if I didn't trust him I wouldn't say that you\nWould not be foolish to tell you right here on sixty minutes what I mean what Reagan said trust but verify or I Know I ... it's very true for\nThe fact is I Do trust but we'll see what happens but is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single ...\nThat is true and again uh I'll tell you right now I don't think Trump should trust them because the north Koreans have shown that they're completely on trustworthy and they haven't they haven't dismantled one of their bombs estimated at like sixty now according to some sources or their long range missiles to deliver the payload so I you know again\nUh they're known for running us in circles robot doping the world and not doing anything\nSo how much longer before Trump says or shut up or a\nPut up or shut up as well what I Do I should say and then\nWhat else you owe on James Mattis interesting\nWith growing and I want to say come on now I don't want to say that but I have some people that I'm not thrilled with other people that I'm beyond thrilled with butter about general matter is he going to leave well I don't know he hasn't told me that I Want to return relationship with him it could be that he is I think it's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the truth [laughter]\nBut that's the awkward All right that you sort of them is the writing on the wall Madison's done Madison's Dunn\nGeneral Mattis has a good guy we get along very well may leave I mean at some point everybody last\nA little ... anyway over all Trump did a really good job I thought Trump absolutely guide to the interview and he's the you're the bus\nOn this thing without a doubt I Need a I don't I Can't give up the phone number I got more to cover and then

moral Schmidt shows on time on Twitter at ... we'll see them off of [noise]\nYou know Fifteen when they fail\nWarren Buffett when you please shut up about this I Want to pay more taxes you know what is so deceptive and I I Know we've talked about this in the past a bomb you and I personally it might have come up on the show is that Warren Buffett what he's talking about the old story about Warren Buffett doesn't pay as much in the acts\nAs a secretary as his secretary which that is so it's such a bogus argument because first of all you're dealing with a Warren Buffett trying to compare apples and oranges because the employee the secretary is obviously a W to employ that's having taxes taken out\nAnd it seems a certain tax bracket I'm sure Warren Buffett's secretaries making decent coin decent bucks whereas Warren Buffett if I'm not mistaken he takes like a dollar a year and salary correct the bulk of his income is derived through capital gains of which\nHe would be paying what twenty percent and then I'm sure he qualifies for the Obamacare a hat on it I can get subsidized healthcare probably has a somewhat like twenty three point something percent and yeah yeah so is secretary might be but that is such a bogus argument anyway I I'd like to take\nA giant lasagna noodles wet and just one of the face [laughter] that's all I Want to pay more taxes\nI got an idea so if you're listening to our show and your success while you're doing really well or come in and let me teach you how to pay less taxes than your reception is I don't show you've ways to do that\nWell you know also when you hear some of the celebrities or whomever say oh I'll gladly pay more taxes I Want to pay more taxes do you know that you are able to write a check to the U.S treasury you you can make a donation saute on all your folks want higher taxes\nJust write an additional check to the United states treasury\nNow I got a question though would that be a charitable donation [laughter] well not giving to charity to the government\nI think that the doctors but knocked out with a new tax plan yeah yeah yeah yeah\nSo you got to be careful with that one just make sure you get to the doctor the ducks and hey so here's the thing you know Ross we're going to talk about Roth IRAs first because that's really important\nAnd what's important about a raw fiery I just had a review what the gentleman and he said I've been putting money in Iraq but I'm not sure why and so that brought to mind was talked about that today why we're also important\nRoss when you put money in a Roth and becoming more and more popular all the time\nBecause they allow you to generate tax for income I mean who wouldn't want tax for income\nNow today with this new tax plan we might say yeah Robert but taxes are really low and I agree with that but this is for your future and we're a tax rates going to be ten years Twenty years down the road I mean they do have a massive deficit and we don't know\nWell also let me interject here with Trump is president and the Republicans controlling the house of representatives and the Senate and obviously the tax plan going through and the changes which are get going to be implemented this year what we don't know Bob\nIs what's gonna happen with Congress going forward presidents incoming presidents presidents in the White House\nTypically loses seats or lose complete control of the house\nIt's happened you know you look at it it uh you you had that George W. Bush lost seats you had Clinton lost seats Obama lost ... it's kind of a given that in the midterms and of course we have the midterms coming up and twenty Eighteen that it is not\nOut of the question you know you have a lot of Republican retirements you have a lot of the current Republicans that are not running again I mean some of the numbers are staggering thirty one seats I mean I I\nI so I'll I'll say something this out this election is going to affect the markets absolutely be prepared for that well I Know that there is no doubt in this tax plan was approved the simple majority just a simple majority ... which means that can be unraveled\nExactly so ... the point is what if the house goes Democrat I I I don't want that to happen but what if it happens and what if the Senate ah ends up going a democratic it's simple I mean what Trump is instituted the tax but could be reversed in a in a couple of years\nValid I mean that's valid and and not just out here I'm going to put a little common sense what what say that this doesn't get reverse I mean this tax plan is going to help everybody in my opinion I don't care of your Democrats or Republicans or neither a this tax sponsored help a lot of people so I'm very positive about the tax plan\nAnd that's not being political that's for everybody but here's what I Do know there's a lot of talk about adding more money to our current deficit we owe as a country as people we are a lot of money\nAnd they need to manage that deficit to and the only way to manage the deficit is either to spend less money\nRight or pay down the debt to pay down the debt they have to raise your taxes so when we talk about a ... and we look at taxes today that's not how you look at her off because we're all our future investments that money and he's just sitting there for at least five years before he can use a tax free but there's some great things about it number one is\nAll the growth in your account all of it you're not being taxed on and when you take it out you're not being tax and you know what else was great no required minimum distributions you when you turned seven and a half you don't have to take money out of a Roth IRA they're wonderful\nAn IRA just a regular retirement account we all know is pre tax write I'm getting a tax deduction today\nThey're going to limit what they put in there I get a tax reduction today but that money does grow tax deferred not tax free tax suffered because you pay taxes when you take it out so what do we want to I Want my money on a Roth IRA\nOr regular IRA well I'll tell you that the raw fire is going to pay big dividends for those that have the foresight to use them you know what the problem is with a raw fiery where the issue becomes\nA tele\nIncome limits you know if you make too much money your CPA is going to tell you they're going to say do you look you make too much money you write not contribute to a rough\nYou know I was ... was I'm not going to tell you exactly what I make a but I was in that predicament where I couldn't do a rough but\nA few years back maybe what six seven years ago ... thousand ten was there was some kind of a you know exactly what I'm that's why I Love working with Bob Harward he knows exactly what I'm Talking about my accountant\nCame to me and said uh you know I can believe this but there is a loophole this year you can convert to a runoff is like a one time deal where whereas in the past I did not qualify but then suddenly I qualified and that door has that door been closed the ghetto what role I'm\nGoing to well it's different this time but I'm going to tell you something there's a loophole today that everyone can be using to fund the raw\nEverybody and and we're at the end of the segment so you're gonna have to stay tuned to the next segment because there's so much I Want to teach you on TALK about but the bottom line is I don't care what your income is you can find the raw don't want your CPAs tell you otherwise or
