the future a little bit it'd make things a hell of a lot easier while I was talking about the Houston Texans\nAs they took care of business on Thursday night and everybody is focusing on the five game winning streak instead of looking at all the things that had to happen in those games for them to get a win so many things had to go their way\nBut as much as I'm doubting the Houston Texans as much as I don't buy into Houston is a legitimate team in the AFC\nI going to be honest with you All right and and I'm saying this from a place to where I picked Houston to win the division\nI I I took Houston to win the AFC South\nSo they're approaching a couple of games up in the division on the rest of the AFC South and it looks like Houston\nHas got a pretty easy path moving forward to try and win the division there in the AFC South and I pick them to win the division and and I'm doubting the Houston Texans but you know like just look at their schedule moving forward\nThe Houston Texans schedule moving forward they go on the road against the Broncos they've got a road game against the Redskins they get three consecutive home games against the ... against the titans\nAgainst the browns and the colds there road games include one out of Philadelphia but one of the jets and then they finish up with the Jacksonville Jaguars who have been a disappointment this season the Texans are five and three right now\nThey're probably going to win ten games\nFor ... for all the the criticism I get the Houston Texans they're probably going to win ten games and ten games when the AFC

services\nI don't think this is a way I don't think always even around the corner another one for us that's not what I'm saying but it's really important to talk about this show that we really focus on what's important and what's really important is the ability for you to retire with grace\nTo be comfortable in retirement have what you need or while you're working to be able to pay the bills and get things done and you need to get done\nHappiness really does live in a steady paycheck and sometimes we just got to take our eye off the stock market and and not be forgotten days us up and depressed on his days as down and have kind of ruined everything going on in our lives you just got to turn off the noise once in a while\nAnd move on so so let's talk about the market for second let's talk about what's going on what's driving this madness out there because it's it's really kind of crazy or what's going on right now in the markets\nAnd when you think about it just in general sense\nOur markets were stimulated to keep us from going into another Great Depression back in two thousand eight writer ones like the systemic failure the world's ending and we don't do something extreme\nOr we're going to end up in another Great Depression worldwide and the U.S lead and everyone out of this just this terrible position with Iran I mean it was really horrible back then through stimulating the market\nAnd remember how they stimulated the market what they did Todd\nOh we cut interest rates dramatically we had all kinds of a governmental spending with all of those programs that were there were a number of things we did\nYeah yeah ... exactly right they cut interest rates to zero essentially zero and wanted to even talk it talked about going negative you and I talked about that on shows you know how easy that was\nTo stimulate the market and the other thing they did is they had a lot of programs and the pay for those programs they printed money the printing presses were running twenty four hours a day printing money that they were putting into the system through programs and things like that and eventually\nThe market recovers and frankly takes off like a rocket ship I mean listen to market fully recovered twenty Thirteen and they kept stimulating after twenty Thirteen and the market gets over stimulated\nYou know they probably should have done something sooner maybe so it wouldn't be so drastic right now but they didn't they didn't do anything they allowed the market to get over stimulated\nAnd what's happening now is the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and remember when they lowered rates the market went up so what do we expect to do when they raise rates\nThe opposite right exactly yep it's logical the market goes down and the other thing they did is they quit printing money right they're young they're printing money they're actually taking money out of the system they're making money harder to get for businesses\nThat it's called tightening the monetary policy I don't want to be too technical but they're just making money harder to get so it's harder for companies to borrow money right now to invest in their future growth\nAnd the stock market is reacting to these two items and we're getting this what I Want to call very massive kind of volatility really good really bad all over the place\nYou know it's a catch twenty two or it's a weird position than many might have been following the news and as interest rates have picked up the president President Trump\nHas been very critical and President Trump has made some very overt statements toward the fed and what are they doing this insanity you know it's important to keep it keep track of a couple of things in that\nThe president picks the fed chief so the press has their person technically installed a guy understand that when you raise raise it does cause this volatility but\nThe goal is to ultimately get out of that very low interest rate zone and get to a normal thing to get a normal interest so it's it's a tough position to be and I understand the president frustration but\nYou got us it is healthy to have interest rates added normal level but it's also one of the complaints that that you hear in your business Bob as a financial advisor is that people with cash or seen these they've been making nothing and it's only I recommend you know whether you have a portfolio with bonds\nAnd stocks and other vehicles you know ... ... cash a cast component has usually been part of a portfolio that cash historically is typically made some money but\nFor since oh wait the cash has made butkus\nYeah so so you brought up a good point you know we need the fed to raise rates they I mean we can't live in a zero interest rate arch listen we got to get the stimulus out and back to normal market but there's a right way and wrong way to do and I'm going to say they're both right and they're both wrong I mean\nThe fed is right we need to raise rates and get back to normalcy you use a great word there but three percent three percent of the treasury and here's the big one that people weren't thinking about\nBut the thirty year mortgage on homes is now at five percent\nThat's a big number we're not used to that and that's probably getting pretty normal to rice or getting back to normal interest rates but the housing market drives the job market think about it for a minute you know if we're not building houses\nBecause interest rates are getting higher and it does affordable for people\nHow many jobs does that affect not just the people building the house but how about the plumbing supply and electrical supplier electrician they're they're real tours every one involved in the housing market the housing market has always been a driving force in our economy and so what's happening is because of rising interest rates\nThat people are seeing you know these big pension funds and everything are seeing a building starts slowing down and interest rates going up there going oh my God this is bad the markets topping out and it becomes a volatile\nAnd that's what's going on right now raising interest rates higher mortgage rates\nThe fed is no longer stimulating but taking money back and all this comes together to kind of like remember the perfect storm we went through well this is the opposite of that is is the perfect storm of taken all of it out and I want to say something this is really important for listeners\nWhat they're doing we need to get back to normalcy but if they make a mistake\nThey can cause another correction right there's a little balancing act going on and that's what I Want our listeners to know\nI don't think it crashes tomorrow you got all the talking heads on TV that after the crash will tell you I told you so but that they don't know no one knows what's gonna happen here's what I Do know\nThe market has changed a word changing the way we're managing investments were building more cash or being more conservative with our\nOur our clients right now because uh my opinion this is a different stock market than it was last year\nHey we're using tools like healthcare writers I mean I don't want people to go out and run out and buy a long term care insurance I mean it might be the right thing to do for you I'm not a big believer in long term care insurance\nBut I'm a very big believer in health care right as we have a whole chapter on health care writers in our books about how to alleviate that cost how to help with that costs of health care\nAnd retirement but allow you to keep all your money working for you and so if you're not familiar with healthcare writers get\nA copy of my book will send you one free or get it from Amazon I donate all the proceeds to charity I'm not here sewing books I Want to help you in any dollar you spend on my book will go to military charities there's a whole chapter on health care right is what you should do\nWhat you shouldn't do is just ignore the potential cost\nOf a home health care assisting care long term care of this stuff happens\nIs bankrupt at a lot of families that were very successful so make sure you have a really good plan in place\nWell all of this makes sense and again with market volatility I mean there are so many bits and pieces and if you're trying to do this yourself\nAll year are you missing so many angles that professionals like the Harwood team they digest they eat and sleep and breathe that every single day and then if you're currently with advisor\nWho maybe ah you've been with them a long time maybe you've been with a current advisor for years or decades don't you think\nYou know you take a Korean for it to end up in you you maintain your home\nYou don't you think you ought to maintain your portfolio and at least get a second opinion just to\nHave someone take a look to see if you're in good shape I folks the number to call for the Hollywood team is eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine they really would love to sit down with you and just review no obligation no charge and just hear what they have to say at the Harvard team\nEight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number if you want to copy of Roberts book that is yours for years well\nEight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine while we continue had to protect your portfolio from the stock market madness and rising rates and that meant [noise]\nWay we'll continue\nTo lead [noise]\nHarwood way with Robert are would anti ... you know Robert I hear it all the time when I meet people at some of your events I've been to some of your uh seminars or some of your ah gatherings with your clients\nAnd they speak so highly about your for 'em they speak so highly by you and your people are they also love your book\nAnd again I I Want to again pointed out to our listeners right now that you can really get an insight to Robert Harward and the whole Hollywood team by reading Robert ... book is a great reference it is a a great book on investing for retirement\nWow that's the name of the book it's a investing for retirement the ultimate guide to not outliving your money\nAnd it is a great read again it's a great reference and gives you great guidelines and it's a super easy and it's a comfortable read but the knowledge that it uh it divulge is that\nThe the knowledge is really strong and the book again is yours totally free\nWhoever wants to the book if you are listening right now and you want the book\nYou just call up his office and say I like this

the heart what team they're like neighbors the ... the the offices are in in in South Tampa\nOffices or enlarge go above ... how many officers the have them\nAnd we have four four locations in Tampa Bay so we we pretty much are all around town Tampa Bay right\nSo the folks that get get the book I get your portfolio looked at especially with the volatility\nAnd see if anything missing or what they would advise you to do in order for you to reach the goals that you have simple as that\nAgain the number for both sitting down with our with team getting the free book one or the other pick and choose take the combo platter eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine\nEight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine Bob Let's talk about how to protect your portfolio from the stock market madness and the rising interest rates that we're seeing right now\nI got to tell you that it's so important right now because we talked about this or the earlier segments um\nThe stimulus has gone the market is fairly volatile it doesn't mean that we can't make money this market I'm not saying that goes to the cash that's not my financial advice why am saying is you've got to really be smart and wise about what you're doing right now this isn't that stock market where you can just buy anything\nAnd it's going to rocket up through the roof I'm also not saying go put all your money in cash or an annuity or something like that either\nBecause that's not the answer you got to have a really good plan that you've got to think about all the problems out there that can affect you personally it needs to be crafted just for you so you have a really good plan one of the issues is it's a really challenging market right now I'm just going to tell you that\nUh I don't think it crashes around the corner I keep saying that 'cause I don't want people to\nTo run and worry and say Robert Harward said the world is ending I don't believe it for one second\nWhat I Do believe is a market has changed the stimulus has over and now you got to get really good advice on your portfolio and your investments and you need a very professional team backing you up it's just going to get harder than it used to be so make sure you're doing that\nThe things I'm worried about for you that you need to address that we address for all our clients\nA number one number one is that there was a poll recently and as Paul was done by Boston College Center for Retirement Research is is a very reputable academic organization they do a lot of ah polls and papers on white papers\nAnd their study just came out said that fifty four percent of middle income families just the people next door people making between fifty a hundred thousand dollars per year\nDo not have enough money saved to get through a decent retirement to live well to have a\nGood quality of life I mean that's a terrible statistic fifty four percent of middle income families that's off that's our neighbors asked our listeners are not be a good position to retire\nHard scary that that is that that is a dark things scary statistic in fact worthy of a [noise]\nOffensive [noise] probably [laughter] they'll scare what else is ...\nAn endless and it doesn't have to be this way what frustrates me is that does not have to be this way and here's something interesting to study size right in the opening paragraph\nThat's the exact same it was in two thousand ten right after the crash I mean people have not advanced or move forward on their retirement\nFifty four percent of people do not have what they need not to live a great retirement just in retirement that's horrible and so a lot of people are just kind of missed out on the stock market rally other people have followed porn investment advice and number one thing they cite\nIs investment mistakes people not investing properly there was this wonderful recovery and frankly they just", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT the Harwood Way with Robert Harwood",
