Warren Buffett when you please shut up about this I Want to pay more taxes you know what is so deceptive and I I Know we've talked about this in the past or Bob you and I personally it might have come up on the show is that Warren Buffett what is the old story about Warren Buffett doesn't pay as much as ...\nAs a secretary as his secretary which that is so it's such a bogus argument\nBecause first of all you're dealing with a Warren Buffett try to compare apples and oranges because the employee the secretary is obviously a W to employ that's having taxes taken out and it seems that certain tax bracket I'm sure Warren Buffett's secretaries making decent coin decent bucks whereas Warren Buffet\nI if I'm not mistaken he takes like a dollar a year in salary corrupt the bulk of his income is derived through capital gains of which\nHe would be paying what twenty percent than that I'm sure he qualifies for the Obamacare a hat on it I can get subsidized healthcare probably has a somewhat like twenty three point something percent and secretary might be but that is such a bogus argument anyway I I'd like to take\nA giant lasagna noodles wet and just any one of the face [laughter] that's all I Want to pay more taxes\nI got an idea so if you're listening to our show and your success while you're doing really well or come in and let me teach you how to pay less taxes than your reception is I don't show you ways to do that\nWell you know also when you hear some of the celebrities or whomever say oh I'll gladly pay more taxes I Want to pay more taxes do you know that you are able to write a check to the U.S treasury you you can make a donation so I'll tell you what all your folks want higher taxes\nJust write an additional check to the United states treasury\nNow I got an eye or a question though would that be a charitable donation [laughter] well that's not always giving to charity to the government I think that the ducks has been knocked out with a new tax plan yeah yeah yeah yeah so you got to be careful with that one just make sure you conduct of the ducks and hey so here's the thing you know Ross we're going to talk about Roth IRAs first because that's really important\nAnd what's important about a Roth IRA I just had a review what the gentleman and he said I've been putting money on Iraq but I'm not sure why and so that brought to mind was talking about that today why we're also important\nRoss when you put money in a Roth and becoming more and more popular all the time\nBecause they allow you to generate tax for income I mean who wouldn't want tax for income now today with this new tax plan we might say yeah Robert but taxes are really low\nAnd I agree with that but this is for your future and we're a tax rates going to be ten years Twenty years down the road I mean they do have a massive deficit and we don't know\nWell also let me interject here with Trump is president and the Republicans controlling the house of representatives and the Senate and obviously the tax plan going through and the changes which are get going to be implemented this year what we don't know Bob\nIs what's gonna happen with Congress going forward presidents incumbent presidents presidents in the White House\nTypically loses seats or lose complete control of the house\nIt's happened you know you look at it it uh you you had that George W. Bush lost seats you had Clinton lost seats Obama lost ... it's kind of a given that in the midterms and of course we have the midterms coming up and twenty Eighteen that it is not\nOut of the question you know you have a lot of Republican highlands you have a lot of the current Republicans that are not running again I mean some of the numbers is that it was like thirty one seats I mean I I\nI so I'll I'll say something this out this election is going to affect the markets absolutely be prepared for that I Know that there is no doubt and then this tax plan was approved the simple majority just a simple majority ... which means that can be unraveled\nExactly so ... the point is what if the house goes Democrat I I I don't want that to happen but what if it happens and what if the Senate or ends up going a democratic it's simple I mean what Trump is Institute of attacks but could be reversed in you know in a couple of years\nValid I mean that's valid and and not just out here I'm going to put a little common sense what let's say that this doesn't get reverse I mean this tax plan is going to help everybody in my opinion I don't care of your Democrats or Republicans or neither a this tax sponsored help a lot of people so I'm very positive about the tax plan\nAnd that's not being political that's for everybody but here's what I Do know there's a lot of talk about adding more money to our current deficit we owe as a country as people we are a lot of money and they need to manage that deficit to and the only way to manage the deficit is either to spend less money\nRight or pay down the debt to pay down the debt they have to raise your taxes so when we talk about a ... and we look at taxes today that's not how you look at her off because we're all our future investments that money needs to sit in there for at least five years before he can use a tax free but there's some great things about it number one is\nAll the growth in your account all of it you're not being taxed on and when you take it out you're not being tax and you know what else was great no required minimum distributions you when you turn seven and a half you don't have to take money\nOut of the raw fiery they're wonderful an IRA just a regular retirement account we all know is pre tax write I'm getting a tax deduction today they're going to women want to put in there I get a tax reduction today but that money does grow tax deferred not tax free tax suffered because\nYou pay taxes when you take it out so what do we want to I Want my money on a Roth IRA\nOr regular IRA well I'll tell you that the Roth IRA is going to pay big dividends\nFor those that have the foresight to use them you know what the problem is with a Roth IRA where the issue becomes a tell the income limits you know if you make too much money your CPA is going to tell you they're going to say that you will you make too much money you write not contribute to her off\nYou know I was it was I'm not going to tell you exactly what I make a but I was in that predicament where I couldn't do a rough but a few years back maybe what six seven years ago who thousand Ken was there was some kind of a you know exactly what I'm seeing that that's why I Love working with Bob Harward he knows exactly what I'm Talking about my accountant\nCame to me and said uh you know I could believe this but there is a loophole this year you can convert to a runoff this is like a one time deal where whereas in the past I did not qualify but then suddenly I qualified and that door has that door been closed again or what what role I'm\nGoing to well it's different this time but I'm going to tell you something there's a loophole today that everyone can be using to fund their off everybody and and we're at the end of the segment so you're going to have to stay tuned to the next segment because there's so much I Want to teach you on TALK about but the bottom line is\nI don't care what your income is you can find the raw don't want your CPAs tell you otherwise or anybody else your friends at work\nAnd we're going to talk about how to do that we're gonna have to do next segment because we're out of time but what I Do want to tell you is if you want help if you look if you're not satisfied with your current financial advisor or\nThey're just not doing a great job or they're not helping you with your taxes are you just want to get your taxes down anyway that I can help comment scheduled appointment or sit together and I'll help you put all this together\nYou know Bobby said something very important at the beginning of

something earlier in the segment that you're one of the largest independent a financial firms and that is so important because you're not tethered to stock holders Bob\nYou or the president and the c._e._o. you have built an amazing team around you\nBut you're not trying to satisfy shareholders and and juice up and and jacked up\nA you know earnings and and try to put people to try to generate revenue you and another key word here you and you're from as for ... and you're not a Johnny come lately is some firms that old suddenly ... no you founded\nThe Harwood financial group as a fiduciary
