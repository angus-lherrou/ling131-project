rhetoric\nWell I think I don't want to know if I could really old enough [laughter]\nWell we're we're burning ourselves on the stove again and again\nAnd it yeah yeah yeah we got to learn we've got to learn from previous lessons it's a one of the things is that the reason we picked the show today is your portfolio or your ear investments all weather make 'em all whether we never know if like musical chairs and the music's been playing now says two thousand eight\nAnd everyone should have done great you know the market is fully recovered its ahead of where it was a if you participated in the recovery you would have done really really well\nBut things are changing right now and let's not repeat this bad thing that happened in two thousand they I don't know when the next corrections coming I hear these people on the radio and the talking heads on TV and they they seem to know everything\nOr no one knows when it's coming it's like musical chairs just make sure that you're protecting yourself and you're thinking about all whether I mean we live in Florida in ... you know a hurricane can calm and you want to be prepared just in case so like you said very very well why don't we do that with our portfolio and I will say this\nAll of that stuff that was out there is the same or worse than it was before and I don't mean that in a negative way because there are some things that have improved\nBut our stock market recovered artificially due to stimulus that did not recover because they fix anything they recovered because our government printed a lot of money\nAnd and just forced it into the market and if you force that much money the market of course the market's going to go up you know that isn't fix than anything that spending our tax dollars an hour was you know that's a little scary now let's fast forward today what's going on today\nWell with and they put trillions and trillions of dollars in the market to get it to go up\nAnd they have decided now that they're going to take that money back\nThey're actually taking the stimulus out of the markets the autumn rhino realize that\nBut this is why right now is a time to reevaluate your investment and how you're investing in what you're doing because as change that's no longer a stimulus is um like anti matter anti stimulus I don't know what the word is there ... in the market is that a word\nA sure uh yeah let's take a moment here when we're talking about whether proof thing or making your portfolio old weather to be able to with and who knows what conditions will be thrown at you financially let's talk and let's educate the audience about you\nLet's educate the audience about the amazing staff that you've assembled at the heart would financial group\nAnd how much work goes on in the background your portfolio managers those that make all the decisions on what each individual portfolio should consist of based on ... or risk tolerance and\nAnd what you guys agree on as far as what the strategy should be let's talk about the people\nThat inside your for me as you guys are an independent from in Tampa Bay you become the largest independence from ah in the area and let's talk about the people that do this amazing work behind the scenes with the\nThe the big deal Sherry mindset of having to act in the best interest of the client always and first thought\nGod that is awesome you know we are uh there's no way to measure exactly but we certainly are one of the largest independent producer firms in Tampa Bay there's no doubt about that\nAnd you know our uh we we've done it with a lot of stability and good growth that it's because I've had the ability or or really the pleasure to surround myself with excellent people I mean you brought that up and and one thing about us as because of the fact that we've done well in the size of our company\nWere able to offer more services internally to our clients to keep the cost down so our portfolio managers are people that manage our portfolios work for my firm they work for me and I pay their salary\nAnd so it isn't an extra cost you where most people are paying extra fees for ... for your management whether it's your mutual fund you're using or your visors using outside managers or whatever they're doing\nAnd your advice I mean I tell you this but you got that second hidden cost in there\nAnd that's very very unhealthy uh we're planners were holistic we believe that our clients need to have a good direction a good plan because we never know when the market's gonna crash was in a rising market where we've been going through for the last ten years\nHas been pretty darn easy you know there's a saying rising tides fought all boats right the tides going up and everyone's doing great and you are listening or might become complacent going while everything's okay I made a lot of money\nBut then the next question is you want to keep the money you may you you don't want to lose that and so we're going through a really serious transition right now in the market where the stimulus has done\nThey're taking the stimulus back and because of that this market is becoming very very volatile\nAnd to navigate a hard market you need a really good team is no longer just somebody that can take a fond and said don't worry about it but you got us surround yourself with the best get the best advisors you can on your team\nBecause frankly I think the market's going to be okay but challenging and we're going to see a lot of volatility is gonna be a lot of days where we're happy you know the days that were sad and that's going to be why for a while\nLet's talk about one of your managers in fact before we started doing the show today you brought up the details of a client and uh we're not going to go over specific numbers but you were singing the praises of page for instance and pay a with yeah let's let's talk about hey for ...\nPay well pages pages of the ... manager of our portfolios and that she's been with us from many many years and\nFrankly she's a genius she is just amazing and and she gets a she understands it and so one of things about our from unlike other firms is that we take responsibility for everything including the portfolio management the investments were using\nAnd ask for do Sherry's I I'll listen I'm responsible the buck stops here you know so\nA pages an absolute genius she's done an amazing job\nAnd even in this challenging market because remember the markets have cheese weren't talked about what's going on here and just a little bit\nEven to this challenging market she's navigating through what she's doing a great job and and it's not just pages page and her team we have ... and investment advisory team that watches over ... and what that means for customers is\nIs there money is always being watched it isn't like the advisor every three or four months as going oh let me see what's going on with your account\nOur accounts or watched every minute of every day when the market's up and we have a team sitting in front of all those\nComputers I've ever seen the room where where you have the investment managers they have like eight or ten computer screens on their desk at any one time with all these lines and charts and stuff it's really cool a hate that we're getting near the end of the segment so when we come back and talk more about this what's also talk about\nHow to build an all whether portfolio so that you can whether any kind of storm that might come up I was not be complacent and say OK if these were good last year or next year might be good too and I was talking\nAll of that stuff ah sounds great folks\nI've known Robert Harward for a long time in fact we were very good friends well before I started doing the

radio program and they come in and sit with me and and we do reviews and what I'm finding is even the people doing it themselves but also with financial advisors\nOr frankly they're really taking too much risk or they're not invest it properly for this market and when I say this market the market changed this year so during the recovery I don't care what you did the market's going up so's everybody and we're all excited about how much money we're making\nBut this year that changed because they stopped the stimulus program stimulus is Don other than this new tax plan that was stimulus but there are no longer printing money and putting it in the stock markets are actually taking it back out of the market\nAnd it's become really really volatile and along with the volatility we're starting to see inflation you brought that up last segment that's very important\nWhich means uh bonds are losing money so bonds used to be where you would go as a safe haven market's terrible and put some bonds and I will smooth things out but what happens when they both go down together you're you're in big trouble", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT the Harwood Way with Robert
