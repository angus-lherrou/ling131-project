I remember the news stories I remember my parents who are trying to get a mortgage and some of the interest rates back that if I'm not mistaken they were knocking on twenty percent I mean whoa yeah it was out of control so you don't want a reasonable interest rate it's a sign of a good economy but also what's important\nIs if there is another economic kick up if there was another catastrophic event you know the fed needs room to them lower interest rates if in fact you need to try to economically recover\nAnd it's tough to lower interest rates you know when you're essentially at at bumped zero that's why we're the good economy they're starting to raise rates\nI mean you bring up a good point here here's the thing type two thousand eight was horrible there isn't anybody I think that didn't get hurt in two thousand eight and and it's hard to remember that 'cause it's a long time ago but we will have more of those two thousand eight there's no doubt about it the market goes up in the market goes down\nRight now right now the market has been stimulated into a recovery right lowering interest rates printing money cheap monies available\nAnd and the market recovers well you just hit on it you know here's the good news is the good news is the market is good enough has done well enough that if they can raise rates you got to look at that as a positive thing\nAnd the other part of the thing that's wonderful as if the market crashed again by raising race they can lower right they got ammunition to to address the issues but think about this for a minute if lowering interest rates helped the market recover\nWhat those raising interest rates to it adds to volatility it adds to problems so here's what I Believe we're going to talk about what you need to do uh to to get through this kind of market but here's what I Believe\nThe days of stimulus are over okay they are not stimulating the market they are I don't think this is a word but they are on stimulating or the simulating the market they're taking the stimulus out so what are they doing\nThey're raising interest rates that's a good thing it's a good thing for two reasons are children would not have a future that we just kept doing what we were doing we need a future for our children\nThey also couldn't be doing this the market was doing well but here's the bad thing as they take the stimulus out of the market the market is going to react very poorly is it's like I I think of it like sugar you know you give sugar to your children\nAnd they get all hyperactive you take the sugar away and they go through withdrawals and they act poorly will the stock market is acting out\nHere's the other thing they're doing this really important they printed a lot of money and they put trillions of dollars into the market to make money available so that people can pay their bills and businesses have access to funds cheap money\nWhile they're actually taking that money out with a lot of people aren't talking about right now as of the trillions they put in\nThey've already taken one half of the trillion dollars out so this is kind of interesting they actually physically removed money is called tightening\nAnd they literally if you look it up on the Web you'll see that they burn it you know we have to take money out of the market I mean that's a bags of money on their armed guards and the incinerator now I'd like to be the guy working at the incinerator but not really about the answer is if they're burning money they're taking money out of the market and the market is drug doing\nBecause of the lack of stimulus has been used to stimulus now says two thousand eight the stimulus has gone and what that means to us and we're talking about this is you got to tighten your seatbelt right now it is not that market we're in before where you throw a dart and everything goes up\nIt's a different market and frankly if they don't do a good job and they're tightening taking the stimulus out they're going to cause the next\nGosh if they do something wrong they could cost the next sock market crash so there's a lot of things you need to do I we're gonna teach you what to do\nWell and that's what your clients expect from you and it's not just you know the coal lions as your your uh your customers or your client you got a relationship and you know you your your\nYour

your finances and let's talk about financial happiness\nYou have financial boy is how about financial boys will find a blissful way here's the thing that's important for those you joining us we've been talking about the fact that the market has been stimulated over the years so that we could recover from two thousand eight that was almost almost the great depression that called the great recession\nAnd they stimulate us out of that but after a period of time the market has been doing really well they're taking the stimulus back they're lowering interest rates they their tickets in the printed money out of the market and the market is behaving poorly is reacting to that and that's the\nWhat we're seeing in volatility right now now here's what I Believe everyone's asking me what do I believe in war things going number one\nThis volatility is the new norm this is what we're gonna see we we all wanted to go back to normal world well\nThese ups and downs that's what the stock market does and so we've got to go back to the type of investing that's more defensive not grow grow grow grow grow but grow with caution that's what I Believe\nBecause there's going to be like this for a while I Do not believe it crashes around the corner we keep hearing all the talking heads saying\nOh the ... you know to that was that was a long time ago the world is falling apart\nIt's not falling apart companies are doing well people are employed they're spending money\nBut the rocky roller coaster stock market is back in my opinion is is here to stay for a while so you need to borrow your seatbelt and think about how you're investing and what you're doing and one of the biggest problems out there we're looted to this and talked about it and the first segment\nIs the fact that all this stimulus added to our country's deficit and our debt and our debt\nIs trillions in trillions in trillions of dollars\nAnd that that is kind of like a a ... you know they say the light at the end of the tunnel be careful might be a train yeah that that that that said that if they can't manage that debt than this nice stock market that's been going up and up and allowing them to take the stimulus out\nIs going to one day stop that that will cripple this country if they don't manage it\nAnd so what do we need to do right now what do you need to do with your portfolio number one start being defensive and you're investing I'm not saying not to make money I'm not saying not to invest what I Am saying is let's\nBe smart about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT the Harwood Way
