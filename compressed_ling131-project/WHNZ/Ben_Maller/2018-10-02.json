superstar I mean that people pay attention to will turn on and watch you put the browns on Monday Night football I got into a bigger may feel does\nBrown's got screwed yesterday raiders when does it matter but you add Patrick homes to that list we all saw what he did the first three weeks but when you do something special on a nationally televised game on Monday Night when the whole world is watching you pull a game out where it looks like you played poorly but really you still through for three hundred yards\nThis guy now has become everybody's got to see what he's done because clearly there are two great teams in the NFL there's the rams\nAnd there's the cheese and the rams are knocking on the door of becoming the next great star team in the NFL but I got to see what they do they're right on that cost because of what they've done so far\nBut Patrick my homes is right there too and they play each other coming up in a few weeks in Mexico city I tell you what this is going to be\nFought in the next few weeks Washington's chief scheme a and that will start getting a few home games mixed mixed in all of this bonding excite me you've got the jaguars this coming week uh that's in Kansas City and then on the road at New England and then they get the bangles at home and the bangles coming off a huge\nFinished with AJ green and the touchdown pass from Andy Dalton\nOr to snatch a victory in the final moments so and then they get a rematch with the Broncos at home so a lot of big big games to come for Patrick ... homes or in this ... none of the teams had the defensive

do that over again he was pissed you didn't get the job the New York media let loose a bunch of stuff that quote supposedly happened when he was in Buffalo and he's never forgotten that\nSo he stuck

Mike social now gone after Nineteen years of the angels manager the focus turns to keeping my trout and many believe that the angels need to show substantial improvement in the next two seasons in order to have a chance to keep them the other thing that trout is the er the memorial type that won't leave then what do you think\nWill never leave you'll stay in his parents' house forever and ever and ever and you know the the the angels in my trout is the perfect relationship right Hey Mike trout can play\nWith the angels living Laguna Beach look out of the Pacific ocean during the season\nNobody bothers him he's off the grid there are many players in professional sports the demand the spotlight they need the attention might trout is not one of those players he would prefer to stay in the shadows right and so the angels are perfect\nAnd be already Marino is crazy enough as it owner where he could toss out four hundred four hundred and fifty five hundred million dollars\nTo lock up my trout through a lifetime contract\nAnd Trump doesn't have to play for the Yankees or the red Sox I Know it would like to play for the Phillies because that was the team that he followed when he was younger but he would prefer to go to home plate if he could rather than worrying about eating at home and he would like to wear a lamp shade\nSo no one looks at it this way he likes he likes to be away from the spotlight playing in Anaheim allows that the angels despise the media so much the few reporters actually go to their games\nThey moved the press box near the pearly gates down near the foul poll about ten years ago they don't want people to cover their games in the media so my trust in hog heaven with the angels next\nAnd speaking of expiring contracts the NFL has the

brand is what separates them from all of their competitors in the in that particular realm of a television and so if you're the satellite guys\nTo keep that exclusively on direct TV and number two I Would expect the NFL with what they're going to do the movies you test the waters you see how much time\nWarner and the other you know the the big cable companies earlier call now I Would pay direct TV or in and and get into a bidding war but ultimately I Believe that the move for the NFL is to stay with direct TV and these are interesting times as many people cutting the core getting rid of television\nAnd not paying for it so these are some some dangerous times and the TV industry but I Believe ultimately the NFL will keep\nTogether with direct TV for another contract next I Hope you're

to the naked eye I Will say this for the cardinals to the naked eye sand Brad for his numbers in\nIt's courier aren't bad they're misleading\nBradford is known for what he's known as kept in check down what does that mean San Bradford checks down on just about everything he's afraid to throw deep which is why his completion percentage is inflated\nAnd to the casual fan they say well he's not that bad looking as of his numbers are not terrible there not terrible\nThey're inflated numbers Bradford played a little over Lebanon quarters this season and Arizona and he fell into the Grand Canyon he was completely removed from the job responsibilities the lowest rated quarterback in the NFL this season is Sam ... is saying bribery he earned the demotion\nAnd Steve Wilkes the coach he looks clueless here\nHe was sent Bradford was the best option the number one option\nAs the cardinals attempted to put some building blocks together at the quarterback position and keep the job on hold for Josh frozen but simple after it was the top option according to the coaching staff\nFor the first three games or the regular season and now he's not even suiting up for the games\n[laughter] he he he was that bad that he went from the starting quarterback you're not even good enough put on some street clothes and sit in the press box will get your ticket you can watch the game uh what is that now in addition\nThe main reason this is a referendum on the car in the front office this is the definition of pork barrel spending it was politics you'd say pork barrel spending you flush money down the toilet that could have gone elsewhere\nMike Clinton who is not good quarterback but he's the backup you could have put him in as the de facto starter for a couple of games and I guarantee effort to you that Mike Glen and it looks like a giraffe wouldn't have been any worse\nThan Sam Brett I'm using the same\nGeographical area as wherever now the cardinals\nShould have just started Josh Rosen from the beginning of the year we said it all these quarterbacks the rookie quarterback stardom throw them out there\nWhy do the dance why mess around with these inferior quarterbacks which is what the browns did with her ride tailor the cardinals did it here where this nonsense with was saying Bradford you end up wasting money\nOr you wonder of Arizona's GM steep time stumble out of a saloon in Arizona and then say oh you know I'm assigned Bradford that's been alone will sign word\nFor NFL executives ... they keep falling for this you know some of it is just good agent played by Tom Condon\nPut bread for like they can't wrap their head around and so they say the the old rental rack wrapped in a enigma because Bradford checks all the boxes\nThe scouting boxes he's right out of central casting he's got the good army's got the looks all the and the problem is once he gets into games and you force him to make decisions these things called anxiety and fear and panic settling the same breath for each confuse the old deer in headlights\nI last observation real quick sand Bradford is going to miss out on an extra roster boss every game sand Bradford is an active\nHe loses three hundred and twelve thousand dollars so every three and a twelve thousand dollars now that is a blow to his finance\nDo you have any empathy for San ... I don't uh I don't listen he he is essentially been paid sixteen million dollars by the\nCars [noise] to play three games three lousy horrible disgusting despicable games three of them\nAre for ... in Arizona will eventually release Bradford at the end of the year and they're still gonna have to pay another five million against the cap next year\nAnd then Bradford will always going to he's going to hypnotize another delusional general manager\nTo give him an opportunity next season he's only thirty symbol African play another five years at least and and make more money he's earned a hundred and twenty nine million dollars in history I don't believe he ever played a postseason game\nWith the rams eagles Vikings in court and alleles ever been in the postseason that's just you got to the NFL and he continue on and on this while I was just it was just a hiccup what happened\nIn Arizona you know I'll be better I just need to go somewhere else change of scenery\nThat'll\nGet good luck are usually been Mather show on Fox we sail low to Edmund Dallas steamboat\nWillie\nOr his rights over there I was looking on line to see the agent for sand Branford it's listed as Tom Cotton and Jimmy Sexton\nA and I was some kind and when he got the contract a while back so yeah I I Would say if I were either of those gentlemen and do you ever wanted to meet with a potential new clients and they asked\nFor your you know your credentials just hold up a photo sand Bradford and say here yeah my credential\nThat's all you need to know and walk put slap it on to say if it was founded on that's it I'm done there you go and if I'm the Blair I'm like sold [laughter]\nShe was telling me ... years telling Mr agent I don't have to be that good but I still get the money yeah yeah yeah that's my where do I sign yeah signed me up coach or signed me up at you put me in\nRemember er when Eric Weiner ... ah had those comments about the same breath or you know your overpaid when players in the NFL you're you know you're here a brother in our ripping you openly in the media where he said Bradford who's been paid more for nothing that anyone in NFL history was on ... it's just\nIt's like a lot of these guys get paid on what they could do not what they actually do like preference on that category he's getting paid for what he what\nTeams think he's going to do now when he can actually do\nBut at this point the yes\nWhat do you what do you think's that represented do uh I Do get hurt if you raise\nOr you'll get he'll ... he'll look okay for a while and then when you need him at the end of the most important part of the season he'll vanish he'll disappear he'll reminisce all day and ...\nAgain I was not a St Louis rams fan so to me and bread for never played for the rams he didn't follow the rams when San Bradford played with the St Louis no\nNo allegiance at all for the St Louis rams\nSo ... eighty read is being celebrated have you been seeing some of these kinds of people are celebrating Andy Reid because of Patrick my home success keep in mind that when the playoffs start and if any re does Andy Reid type things and these same people will be just Savage U Andy Reid bingo right\nI mean the people are all that well all kinds of accolades in tribute to anti read what a great quarterback collage management he knows how to find quarterbacks look at these quarterbacks everywhere he's been he's found great quarterbacks and\nWhich is not wrong are effective quarterbacks but\nIn the playoffs clause that brings parts any read in the playoffs clock management and all that I read that the if you look at the the first four games in chief's history the most passing yards\nIn chief's history of the first four games the top for all have happened since Andy Reid took over in Kansas City you think about the chiefs if all these years in Kansas City and the top four seasons for quarterback play has happened in the last few years with Andy Reid\nIt's crazy so\nI don't want my mother and I said that's my quarterback McWhorter\nI'll take your calls eight seven seven Ninety nine of us now Eddie who now want you to go look at that piece of paper in the studio there and we made all our predictions who was the one that predicted that mobile homes this guy who was the one that predictability Garcia who was actually I forget that guy's name the the guy that predicted the Patrick well home is going to be a breakout star this year\nTrying to remember who that guy was\nYeah when you write that I've I forget who I forget I think I I wrote that in July actually yeah sure I was in July or right before the season you more on that yes it was before the season starts\nEnough of that will press on later this hour we got mother's mountain the money we get to that coming up here\nIn a little bit and the sack master that he's next\nHand up and running\nAgain gold mine all go\nOn bond can watch sports radio dot com or Twitter at ... sports radio talk and they closed down ... watch sports radio we\nDominate social media media because we are Fox Sports\nBetting matter here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like then you know that the first groups were actually peach basket or the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we was another fact\nIs on track to be sacked eighty two times this season he is on pace to be sacked eighty two times the record\nFor ... is David Carr who has ... back when the Texas where an expansion team he was sacked Seventy six times his rookie year\nSo the record is Seventy six and Josh Allen who didn't even begin the year as the starting quarterback for the Buffalo Bills is on pace to be\nThe starting quarterback or or just do the quarterback that has the record for the most acts in NFL history and here's another fun fact you\nWant some more Josh Allen propaganda Josh Allen is the thirty second ranked quarterback in the NFL his quarterback ranking is thirty she's got sixty three point eight quarterback rating involved now what does that mean\nThere are only two qualified quarterbacks\nWho have a lower quarterback raiding the Josh Alan and guess what both of them have been banished to rod Taylor and Sam Bradford so that means by default Josh Allen is the worst quarterback in the NFL still starting for an NFL club\nSo it's our annual Asians Josh island and he is just behind or just ahead I should say depending I look at it a case keen them who is next door at the bottom three among the starting quarterback in the NFL or Sam Darnell\nShout out to the jets case kingdom in Denver and Josh Allen in Buffalo that's the bottom of the barrel\n[noise] that's what [noise]\n\nIf you would like to play ... mountain a money call right now\nThere is an operator standing by taking your phone call\nAt eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine
