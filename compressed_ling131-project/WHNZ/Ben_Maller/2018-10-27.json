I'm from ... like ... minutes could play\nA when I was with the cracks and we call it cuts down on like half the fans left uh we got an aunt I got the ... ah we went from being out oh no what do we\nKnow we ... we went down scored again and then there was a we were down ... and at that point and then we got another on I ... I got two in a row I still think that the national record I Know that you want\nMore and they're going to fact\nCheck that and then we uh um we didn't we didn't we didn't go down the field we we had to plant but there were a few minutes like ten seconds left they get the ball they pointed back when we go down and score and are we go down in ... when we come back from seven to eight minutes left\nWe go to overtime um and then the young on the first time runs it and for that sound like that long run\nA and throw the ball in the end zone and I was like man I was all that for nothing but I never had like a triple overtime game ... are never really that long to football but that that that was a rollercoaster of emotion which is that what I think you're asking\nOh they just had a roller coaster of emotion at Dodger Stadium ... months he looked like he just hit a walk off a only to go file I you're\nLike I think you're like ... seconds are ahead of me so I can have you given me up right now though at ... ...\nYeah but you might still be in the eighth and for all we have it might be in the eighth inning that that is as close as it gets you going the way that is brutal man that is absolutely brutal um yeah no ... in it and what's funny about like so when you were covered those do you want to say kicks by the way doesn't that hurt your career kick returned average\n... or the ... yeah\nWe were onsite kicking\nOh OK you are on like okay so so you were covering down Seventeen so does that count as two former recoveries for you\nI don't know Huh Interesting\nI was always really good at the intercepts and when we intercept when they understood all ... the other ... I think they're just like all the all white guy's not going to tackle anyone\nThat's that's very true and then they might they might have a point there but you were lightened guys up I mean you gotta you gotta anger issues\nNow was more of a ... or a a grab hold on and and like judo chopped them down to the ground well like Austin Powers moves down\nSometimes I said well even the way you gotta do it man or because of un Roy Williams they eliminated the horse color All right David Anderson former NFL wide receiver joining us here on Fox Sports radio he is a\nHe is our Dodger fan of choice use our celebrity Dodger fan which is code for we don't know anybody else um and and I was already it was already going to come on anyways I ended up I was ready to go so we're trying to spin this like this was all pre planned to like oh we doing this game was going to still be on\nUm so so if you just like mentally though if you're if you're a team in this spot and and say you're\nYou're the red Sox the Dodgers and you lose this game\nYou got to imagine they've got to come back and play the very next day just psychologically what what do you like in the locker room I Know so I don't forget forget about it you got to come back and you get a rally in play the next game but he's in fatigue a real thing at this point in the season\nI think this is actually if the doctor can pull this off I think this will be three hours to go to one but they ran through the red Sox could thing that I grab it grab an awkward situation like who's going to be there started an extreme\nUm they they put themselves back in the series it ... it's it's it's a big game it's a bigger game for the red Sox and my opinion if they win that the air is about the next game yeah um so do you know it's\nA wash for them but they're committed now they have to all the way it is I'm sure if they would've known they would have gone to a Red Sox and they would walk you know if they lose whatever three to two they would have heard of what will vote for it and the tenth inning look I don't even know you can do it I guess you just walk them all and all that score\nThat's a good idea but right now their pocket and they got one that's famous kind of not you're looking at we're looking at their starting pitcher tomorrow picturing now your own or thinning air yeah or the or the red Sox crazy\nOr David Anderson former NFL wide receiver joining us here on Fox Sports radio Dodgers Red Sox still going on tied to a peace bottom of the fifteenth\nA one hour which I as the uh the Dodgers looking to remind guard yet to figure out a way to to win this game or they were down to one or in extra innings uh they they scored on a throwing air so here we are sitting at to add to appease\nUm I Want to ask you about this is Derek car stuff going on in Oakland there's a lot of people that are talking about you know maybe he's\nYou know crying on the field when he's injured some people have questioned is tough news some people have talked about whether or not their car gets rid of the ball too quick and uh if he if he if the players have lost respect for him because maybe he's not tough enough\nAs a former NFL player\nHow do you react when you hear media members or people around the world is sports call out NFL players for not being tough enough\nOr the ... um I think\nWhen people were so divided on the quarterback blows my mind right is it like Congress ... if if\nThey only Congress you're allowed to me like one of the ... coming like that guy pulled up like a like a little girl when you see someone coming in tackling them and you know what we've learned that the right thing to do\nBecause if you're going to grapple and you're trying to become you put your foot in the ground a raw were only ... your work with the forty niners\nEven if you do run that guy over with a with a corny feel your work with\nAnd so I Would rather my quarterback throw the ball factor a quicker\nAs in about twenty minutes from now this game will be seven hours long this is this is craziness when this game started it was a little after ... pm in Hawaii [noise]\nSo I ... I mean what's that what the hell are you going to do how are these guys that exhausted mad about like this is what ... and I know and I've talked to\nThis with Brady Quinn before my radio wife here on by the way it's ... birthday I'm I was going to call him and wish you and happy birthday but then I just carried on living my life\nUm but uh I talked about this Brady quaint and he says the travel and a lot of that stuff\nSort of goes unnoticed when it comes to athletes and going around the country and around the world and and getting the games and getting to places and then when you add in the actual amount of time that they're playing we're approaching basically to baseball games\nIn seven hours I'm tired\nThat these guys are going to be playing to baseball games in seven hours with no rest in between Nathan of all the was supposed to be the starter for Saturday's game\nHe didn't know he was going to still be pitching on Saturday in friday's game like this is craziness just stop stop\nStop and look I'm not going to sit here and and rip Alex core offer for putting in Nathan of all the and and going with the guy who is looked on the hit a ball at times in the postseason um because I think he realized if you win this game is over because you'll take a shellacking\nIn game for and you'll let the Dodgers wouldn't one because you know you can close it's how you got another three opportunities to witness\nBut he did take a big chance by leaving of all the in there and then you can\nThe bottom of the inning I think of all these bad at at least a couple of times Nathan of all these been up to up to play a couple of times in this game so it's this is man I I just the the amount of fatigue that these guys must be feeling at this point and I do think that they're going to come back\nSaturday and performing a high level it's why you see so many of these players try and and the game on one on one swing a bat\nThey're not thinking about moving guys over uh the red Sox tried to but they weren't able to do it you're also seeing a lot of fielding airs a lot of poor decisions uh mistakes on the base paths like you have to think the tea plays into that\nI mean for us out there if you've ever worked at nine to five job if you look down at the clock and it says five thirty you feel like you've just gone through hell and back you're staying an extra half hour he's got you're staying an extra for hours\nAnd it's the same it's the same exact shift\nSo um we're approaching a ... or just flight out on the in field um and a guy just tripped over the pitching mound I'm telling you these guys are exhausted absolutely exhausted\nYeah it's a this is mad they look tired All right so I won't let you know that we are brought to you by guy go what does it mean when I go says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance it means you probably should have gone to a guy go dot com teen minutes ago\n[noise] um so we'll wait to see how this game plays out or the Dodgers have used everybody on their bench the Boston Red Sox have used everybody on their ... um if ...\nAgain pitches another couple of innings what are we talking about a guy who was projected to be a starter on short rest you already pitched in the series and he's up to Seventy two pitch\nIs this is basically a start\nAnd I believe if I'm not mistaken nation of all the U.S had to Tommy John surgeries if I'm not mistaken my we're approaching a reckless or as as far as the handling of this game as going but they've got no other choice they've got no options\nThere there's there's nothing else we can do so now it's a ... a count a Red Sox and Dodgers tied it to a piece of one out as we're approaching a seven hour long baseball game so if you are Fox you are eating up the ratings you are shooting them up\nRight now if you're Fox so will ah we will keep you updated as we continue on here um who knows when we come back at the top of next hour about five minutes from now maybe this game will still be going on probably ah that's how this night it's gone you're on Fox Sports radio\nUm by the way we do have a have word that if Nathan of all the cannot pitch\nAny further in this game major league baseball has given the red Sox the okay to dig up Tim Wakefield and bring him in\nBe back next week\nIf you suffer from E.

here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to save\nFifteen Percent or more and car insurance with guy go go to guy goes ... eight hundred nine four seven auto the only our part figuring out which way is\nEasier on believable max Muncie whose heads\nUp based running\nIn the thirteenth aiming tied the game has now just ... home run against naval the who I feel awful\n[noise] that is incredible\nThat absolutely incredible and I just felt like something had to give it some point the red Sox finally got somebody up in the bullpen and now this is a big swing game and if if your Boston\n[noise] if you're Boston now you're sitting realizing you just emptied the chamber to try and get this when [noise] and now the series is to one\nIt's definitely a the Dodgers have are are going to come back they're going to be I Would assume the more fresh team Evan asleep at home\nAnd not having to go on the road or or not have been asleep a in a in a hotel room or have to deal with any of just the what the the issues that come along with traveling or staying when you're not at home\nAnd now the Dodgers come back out and they're going to have all the momentum coming up on Saturday or so the game is final or something close to seven and a half hours\nFrom first pitch to the walk off home run by max Muncie a natural wrap at Dodger Stadium\nSo amazing\nAbsolutely amazing wow\nAnd you don't like gave Roberts you would assume that he'd be a ... just ecstatic coming out of the dugout because he realized they just ... a huge win for the organization a huge win for the franchise and a huge win in the series because now the Dodgers aren't down three oh you go down three oh closed the coughing\nIt's over the robbers looks exhausted they just look like they want to go home just get the hell out of there and go home\nAnd as an athlete you talk about the roller coaster of emotions have your Red Sox fan that's a miserable last so you got ... imagine this is all as far as the Dodgers go\nThis is this is a\nHuge huge turn of events for that team get rejuvenate some the red Sox have depleted or their\nTheir Saturday starter and Nathan a baldy Ninety plus pitches\nShort rest after he just threw out of the bullpen he's brought in a new situation you assume they've got the game in control and then a throwing nearby cans or and max amongst the scores in the thirteenth and here we are a few innings later and a couple of hours later and the Dodgers finally\nWhen it incredible\nUh Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio so the Dodgers are are now down to the red Sox still up two games to one in the world series but the Dodgers in Eighteen thinning walk off\nOr for the win by maximize the off Nathan apology odd David Anderson are former NFL wide receiver a BF on the show he joined us earlier on the program that he's a Dodger fan boy and so it was already set to join us so majority majority of the interview\nDavid I were talking about this game because\nWe all assume like were exhausted if you're a fan of either of these teams your spent at this point if you're a Red Sox fan and you're watching a back in Boston it's after three thirty in the morning where you\nAre so you're exhausted and now you're pissed off and now you're depressed\nAnd you're probably bombed and so\nIf you're a Dodger fan you're excited about it but this is exhausting and you realize you were still down to one of the series it's much better place to be in but we're still down to one in the series David Anderson former NFL wide receiver\nJoined us earlier and I always wonder what it's like for these guys after the game's over\nWhen these guys have been through a game where they are dealing with the roller coaster promotions we know what it's like as a fan if you're a broadcaster you know what it's like um if you're calling some of these games and you're in the booth if you're covering some of these games and you and you're a reporter you know what it's like\nBut as as a former player when you're in these situations and you're in the spotlight what is it like and how fast can you recover and how fast can you rebound\nAnd and it's just that this is a crazy situation so Dave talked about as many yeah it's exhausting you you you go back um especially emotionally\nYou feel like you're ... you feel like you you you did everything he could to try and win this game and unfortunately for the red Sox they emptied it all they took they took their shot they try their best to to\nTo to win this one and essentially closed the series out or or put you put some distance between them and the Dodgers and now you've got to try and figure out how you rally how you come back and how you perform in game for\nSo and Eighteen inning affair is final there were as many hits is there were innings which is bizarre\nAnd the Boston Red Sox I have taken or the Dodgers have taken game three three to two and Eighteen innings on a walk off for ... months the in the series is now Boston up two games to one David Anderson joining us earlier talking about the exhaustion that he dealt with in playing somebody's roller coaster games as an athlete we were down seven\nHundred ... um one quick like men are quite a bit when I was with the action was found no one like half the fans left\nUh we got an ... I got the on like uh we went from being out oh no what do we\nKnow we ... we went down scored again and then there was a we were down and at that point and then we got another on I ... I got you in a row I still think that for that phone records or do you want\n[laughter]\nAnd they're going back to that and then we uh um we didn't we didn't we didn't go down the field we we had a client that they're human it's like ten seconds left they get the ball they want it back when we go down and score and are we going on and he'll go then when we come back from seven to eight minutes left\nWe go to overtime um and then the young for your time runs it in for that sound like that long run a ... on the ground and I was like man I was all about for nothing perhaps like a triple overtime game ... are never really that long football but that that that that was a roller coaster of emotions like what I think ...\nYeah that's a gut punch man you're an athlete to put all that work in to to get all that all that way back and then to lose it as a fan were crushed by stuff like that or as as a member of the media we feel for fans and and sometimes we can kind of understand what an athlete goes through I don't think anybody can really know\nHow ... and the red Sox and that team feels right now thinking they had the game in the bag\nA or a ... is so many opportunities a bases loaded opportunities squandered when they did take it to one lead\nAnd now here they are having to come back on Saturday on short rest any depleted a pitching staff\nTo try and take a three one series lead in LA just a crazy turn of events I joined us stocks here Fox Sports radio\nA couple of your life you're from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios want to let you know we are brought to you by

long ago before this game started today\nWith Hank Aaron if they gave out the Hank Aaron towards the night and somebody asked take one of the greatest of all time what about all the strike out and how the game has changed\nYour comment on it and he said to me\nIt was embarrassing to strike out I Try never to strike at a hundred times and the season and of course we've seen in back to back weeks with these long playoff games at Dodger Stadium that's all you're going to get 'cause that's what the Dodgers are to simplify it I won't say home run or nothing but\nIt's almost that sometimes and yet when you had the Milwaukee match up for example you at the top two home run hitting teams and the national league so you went in after eating after reading with nobody bug thing they'll basically you know getting the other way so what do you expect that goes a long time\nAre now Steve ... is joining us here on Fox Sports radio I use a Fox Sports radio anchor and reporter he was at Dodger Stadium

league baseball history three to two was the final score as max monthly hit the walk off for a run off of Boston reliever Nate of all the of all the scandals of the game for a starter he actually ended up pitching six innings out of the Boston bullpen striking out five\nHe gives the laws of giving up the long ball Alice would just a victory for the Dodgers\nOut of the pan the team's combined

victory over the mavericks clippers gonna cry thirty points from Montrose zero in a blog victory over the rockets and Houston\nBucks pelicans in the king's with victories in college football twenty third ranked Utah what they've forty once it's in law victory over UCLA at the rose bowl back the Jonas Knox\nThanks cab company lived here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance have guy go go to guy go to our comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier\nUm look for for Dodger fans are people that were at the game or or driving around Southern California are you at the game on a on friday night the turned into Saturday morning if you left the game early it's fine you know you're not being held hostage it's okay\nIt's okay to leave the game early I've done it we've all done it you got to take off early\nSometimes and you know if you're in if you're in church you're the Catholic Church sometimes\nYou gotta you gotta gym out after you get a ... you do um the holy communion you after you get your communion and you do the body and blood of Christ sometimes you got to get out of there you've got things to do it happens we all look everybody's entitled to leave early from time to time just to lie about it okay to lie\nJust to see you left early it's OK nobody's going to judge you it's fine I get it I would've left early to know boos after the seventh I'm not sitting through that game for that I write a without a that being said it is time for a little something we do on the show now called this\nIllness you more on how could you not get to the door you have or the scraps\nEver that we turn it over to the wives and powerful the voice of LA sports radio ladies and gentlemen you pay your damn respects right now to Kevin figure why the\nPowerful as either that check cleared diversion [laughter] at least I can do that [laughter] that ah so you know the Jimmy butler sweepstakes continues he was booed by the way after reading boot for the opening\nOf the opening night for the Minnesota symbols and he was here because they drop like thirty five points or whatever it was or friday night they lost a blowout fashion he got booed once again and now there's talk about the fact that he could be traded to the Houston Rockets they're offering for first round picks\nAnd apparently a couple of injured players whom the sequels are not too thrilled about getting so according to the ... of the athletic he says that this rate is not likely to happen until and unless\nThey rockets up their offer to Minnesota um how much more up can you go on the offer before a first round picks yeah apparently a air Gordon is sticking point\nMan I don't ... [noise] ... okay\nLet me ask you this cab you're running the Minnesota timber ... uh which means that you would no longer be doing Michelle ... I Hope that you never get the and I'm not trying to to keep a man down I'm just hoping you'd never get the opportunity to run the sign of sense but\nThat being said if if a team offers you for first round picks are taken that deal [noise]\nIt depends because I I I think those two diverging theories and the symbols front office right now you have Tom ... who wants isn't a win now mode and he feels he has got a car and he sounds and he's still as Jimmy right now when he has Andrew Wiggins if those two guys can never put it together them being cat in Wiggins\nBringing a guy like era Gordon along with them first round picks we're still going to be competitive now\nAs opposed the trading Jimmy Butler away for for first round picks and a couple of injured players who may have a little bit of upside but have a lot less production an era Gordon will be less appealing to me so I can understand why it's on several do would say I don't want a breeze is bringing somebody that I can still keep us as a competitive team on the floor while also getting his assets for the future\nYeah I I I guess I don't I just I Wonder what other offers are out there right I mean here's the problem when guys come out\nAnd they announce adult only go to a select\nNumber of teams if you're another team was trying to make a play on somebody yeah Paul George great it worked out for the Oklahoma City thunder but that's that's\nReally taking the risk that guy's going to stick around long term and you traded away a lot to try and get him I just I don't know what other teams are going to be offering as much as what Houston is willing to offer I mean there are more aid I'll give them credit man that guy is doing whatever it takes to try and beat the Golden State warriors\nUm I just if if I were the Minnesota timber wolves and I know Houston is a good team so those first round picks are going to be later in the round Chris Paul's getting older or who the hell knows how this team's gonna look moving forward I just I don't know that you're going to get a better off than what they've gotten so far\nYeah and one key thing you mentioned Chris Ball getting older injury issue throughout his career Jimmy Butler is that some indirect concerns the weather's career as well so if you're a future projecting you trade away those assets and let's say Jimmy does want to sign that extension which will be a max extension now you're paying well Jimmy and Chris fall and absorbing an amount of money no one of those guys fairly often get hurt\nYeah yeah it's ... and look at and at some point there's always the team who didn't win at all but they were always sort of close to winning at all or do you know there there was always the team who's who is pretty good during that run\nBut they could just never quite get over the hump um I I I'm trying to think like if you look in the NFL like the patriots have been dominant for a long time\nAnd the Steelers do have the one Super Bowl that they've gotten recently either one and we think it's recently but it's almost ten years ago now Jesus ... but the Steelers are that team on the outside who just can't get past\nThe ... the charges were like why one else he was still there example yeah perfect example and I just wonder if that's where Houston's that that they're just not there is a really good team\nBut they're just not good enough to get past Golden State and you can say well I mean come on they add a seven game and if Chris Paul wasn't injured they would have won that game in Houston okay but that's the problem Chris Paul is always injure right see if you can't depend on them sooner or later you just have to be resigned to the fact that maybe we're just not ever going to get over the hump\nExactly speaking of injured to mark his cousins what the Golden State warriors now won't be back till sometime around the all star break as he recovers from his Achilles' injury but still have to stop them from getting beat up on the bench during their game against the New York Knicks he was actually seated traveling with the team on the bench and actually got ejected from the game\nI don't know if I've ever seen this happen before he he guy so basically I Believe in the Jackson equals too technical files so democracy because there's already has accumulated a couple of technical fouls and he hasn't even played yet\nThat's great but it's so he got into it with was and is Canterbury what game yes but that is cancer likes to mix it up the dust character yeah he ah he's funny he's and he's a really really nice guy he was on um\nUh we had a chance to interview him on Fox Sports radio for a couple of months ago and he was one of the most down to earth athletes loves New York ... loves being in New York Nick loves loves the just the spotlight and everything are are that comes along with being a nic\nUm but yeah I I saw that and then ... get it gets objectives you gonna get fined should we get is fine I think so yeah oh I Believe so he's just\nGot their good she stepped Steph Curry on Thursday ridiculously good and then they they go to New York and it's like you go on the road to travel all that way you get to Madison Square garden you've got an earlier or start time to a game that you're not used to get your Golden State", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ben Maller", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
