I was ... you can't be a major league baseball manager and not bad it's that way\nBut here's something that Aaron Boone set following the game tonight that really just makes me scratching my head and go ... if she really understand what it means to be a manager go ahead\nYou know we've been through a lot this year um but\nThe one thing I'm most proud of what these guys is is they always compete\nAnd you know\nThe Gary at that I think is a great example of that I mean people behind on two against that guy layoffs in ... pitches battle battle and just miss winning the game\nUm it was great at that [noise] um but just proud of the way they competed I'm just really sucks came up short\nOur number one you talking about Garry Sanchez that bat in the ninth inning when she came back ... to to sacrifice why would you heard him in the beginning there and say we've been through a lot this year the Yankees have been through a lot what have they been through they won a hundred games there one differential was plus a hundred and eighty two\nThey let the league and home runs out I got a new rivers they set a record for home runs in the season the only controversy they had was the one game that Gary said just didn't run stuff out or try as hard as you could against Tampa Bay and what did they do they put them on the deal for two and a half weeks\nHe didn't go through anything you think you went through stuff this year you went through this\nYear I guess the ... the only thing you could say is you missed judge for a while so you would have had more home runs\nYeah but you know what a hundred and all those home runs you beat up on the the sad sack at\nThe bottom of your division and obviously everybody beat up on the central at least the bottom half of the central right the royals and and White Sox gave up a lot of victories or to those teams along the way and but we all know the troubles at the Baltimore Orioles but certainly a\nAnd I'm not really seeing anything in terms of trouble hearing you didn't really have other than judges injury and Sanchez being limited to eighty nine games and adding some struggles and wait for a while you still wasn't Eighteen home run guy on the year but otherwise you\nDidn't really lose your rotation right those guys don't pitch they weren't good in a lot of cases but they still took the mound every fifth day so it's not like you were losing\nGuys left and right and having to shut up and deal I mean yeah we we went to high today role with a lot of home runs and a lot of guys just\nQuietly slowly circling the basis you went through nothing and you hear him talk and not that it's that big a deal not that it's the one thing but you hear him talk after the game you heard of say a a statement from him right there and you hear Alex ... talk\nAnd clearly corps the guy who sounds more managerial and he ... he always had not just because they won but more short himself more understanding of the strategy more realizing what to say what not he just comes across as warm ... Bush still comes across the guy oh hey you know I Want to contest to be the Yankee manager and\nSo I'm a dress on now don't drop what you're talking any you know drunk [laughter] wow\n[laughter] you got a ... thing going on here look look how do you think David ... still got to be coach all I'm a little bit but that's that's that's Aaron Boone while he just your body image grasping sounded like a player and this is a guy who was on TV for a long time you sounded like a players are you you're the manager now\nYou have to do things and make decisions and you'd think you didn't go you went through stuff this year well next year what things are going to go your way because that's not how it\nWorks in sport well you also have a fall off season now in New York watching as the red Sox advance\nAnd willamette's higher Joe Jr already their new GM\nWow look at that hot cake run around how about a ... might as well when I'm going back right here on Fox Sports radio with my buddy Ben mellor [noise]\nThis is Bob\nWe've all been there you're right on the golf course and it's bad hooks slices everything in between\nCertainly it's not always easy to find a fix for your golf game but when it comes to your check engine light\nAuto zone makes finding a fix a breeze if your check in July does on they'll plug into fix binder tool for free bonding you the most likely problem and the best solution saving your time and money down the road so if you're white as odd visit your local auto zone today and let them find your fix which free services firm auto zone you just can't lose\nGetting his own auto zone\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked buddy of rates go down your rate drops either way you win\nCall us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial approval only about on certain three year fixed rate lumps call precaution permission and conditions people having liquor licensing office he takes animal is number three thirty initial conditions are losing\nThe house or just setting the dairy move\n... has your tracks with labor in my lifetime we've got ... everyone's talking about like the fantasy football or a cat\nAnd the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite state you\nMy heart radio takes you back to the top five October twenty five ... teaching Patty was\nFull access to the people I'm deaf [noise]\nMember three someone like here\nHave here at the Ottoman carry Ohio\nOr why why featuring Chris Brown moves like Jagger\n[noise]\n\nHere these ten oh your favorite music all your favorite stations all free on my heart rate\nWent\nYou can listen on our ... our radio ads [noise] download it now [noise]\n...\nVote season baseball game for American we series Red Sox the advance with the wind Yankees after when to stay alive Boston at a full one leading the knife you work with scores twice and then I'd run as a second third with ... as a ... trying to win the game with a hidden\nWell let's hear from Aaron Boone and he says hey listen they're just the tip of your captors to those other guys over there doing that whole thing right yes\nOne of their goals in this series was to keep us in the ballpark they were able to do it hand credit to them for being able to hold us down and shut us down but I mean in the end you know move on usually when you don't can't get those enough big hits in a series and and they they just play this a little bit\n... what about your starting pitching though because you had an E. R. A. of ten point three eight that's the Yankees starters earned run average in the division of ... and that includes\n... who wasn't bad so you you can even take it's worse if you take that out but several Reno God shelled Jay happened the first game wasn't good so bad the is dunk\nIn this game a but a lot of the focus with the Yankees all about all fenced off and it's all fenced off it's often with Aaron Judge John Carlos sent them in these big lumbering massive\nFrankenstein like home run hitter is that the Yankees put up to the plate and er he points out that there was no margin for error here\nWe want to continue to get better\nSo we're chasing the perfect often you know that's a major league athlete or or chase and\nTo be the best we can be and unfortunately it wasn't that wasn't good enough and will continue to work at getting to that point where we're as ... complete in every department as we can be offensive Lee pitching defense you're always chasing utopia you know your case and that\nYou're fired so really to sum this up in one sentence the red Sox beat the Yankees without having to beat the strength of the Yankees\nI it it's if you go against the week it's like a boxer or you go in to a boxing match\nAnd you know what your opponent strength is and you know what you're their weaknesses and they never showed their strength in the in the fight that's essentially what happened here in in several of these games the red Sox\nDelivered the knockout blow and they played for my head they had an eight hundred and winning percentage in the year when they scored first and they scored first in and these games and they just were the great fun so what are the chances that\nMr Boone Aaron Boone is fired it's actually not that high it's not as high as it should be I'm only going to ... percent I Believe there's only two percent chance that Aaron Boone gets fired remember these aren't your daddy or if you're really young your grand daddy's Yankees these are the modern day Yankees\nThe sequel meeting the sun or not the equal the Steinbrenner\nSpawn who are in charge now\nThey don't have the same fire\nThat the boss had like the boss if\nGeorge Steinbrenner the old on her if he was in charge in or around he would have already cleaning out Aaron balloons office they would have put they put a put all this stuff it a little box and they said goodbye seal it it's not in Nineteen eighty seven anymore and Aaron Boone is a good\nSoldier rise a mouthpiece for Brian cash man and his as goose Kasich says his army of nerds and so that'll buy him some more time\nThey'll blame other people's hair bows first year so I'll give them more time he's learning on the job blah blah blah blah blah number two\nWhat are the Yankees going to have you on fire and both eyes there's a Ninety eight percent chance that Aaron Boone continues as manager what's the move here what is the move the move is to overcompensate\nEnded fix the atrocities that was the starting pitching in this series now see see ...\nThe only time he will everywhere Yankee uniform again is an old timers day that's what he will wear Yankee uniform again and that's it assembled Reno I wouldn't put it past the Yankees to get rid of several Rena see that could be the surprise plot twist\nA Louis Severino to be traded and you could say hey he's young and talented but he can't handle\nThe big moment he can't handle what it means to be a Yankee or they could get rid of him and there's going to be other over compensation get the X factor go out and make the move to give you that signature front of the rotation starter there's one person in particular\nWho's wanting a Dodger uniform right now that has to be smiling\nThat's Clinton Kirsch he's he has a chance to opt out of this country now if I'm the Dodgers I don't have a problem with him leaving but that's the kind of guy the Yankees could go out and say hey we can get ... Shaw and he'll he'll check a lot of boxes we can bring him in that's the way to go the other name to keep an eye on is the mad bum\nThe giants the gun tastes have been bad for several years in Madison Bumgarner has been hurt the last couple of years\nAnd there has to be a divorce has to be a separation from the core of that World Series team that that team as as played out the team that won the world series in in the bay area all those times\nAnd and bum gardeners got I think one year left I Want to say in his contract and he's going to be a free agent so it's a kind of ... where the Yankees could trade several of their young players every war chest of minor league players they can trade some of those players\nTo the giants it's a it's a win win right you you get Bumgarner for years see how he handles New York you can pay him a zillion dollars and you just have to give up some minor league players to the giants they'll last me\nLike the Yankees are going to make a big move that unlikely to fire and boom you're going to make a big move\nThe other option they have a say well the pitch is not great so we're just going to fatten up the office and bringing mainly Machado ... I don't know where he would play of who's a free agent from the Dodgers or Bryce Harper\nAnd you know in ...\nYou'd have to move some things around to make that happen on the bed now they're showing ... what do you think about all that eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine we say hello to Edmund Dallas\nStars the\nOpen as I accurately predicted the red Sox are moving on my small expertise that again but the big picture is we are one step closer to ... the doomsday ... we are we're closer a\nI told you I I think there's very little chance that this was a void I don't know I Know I don't think it's gonna happen to know you think the brewers are going to beat the astronaut or the Astros I Hope it's a Red Sox he the red Sox would be easier in my home and\nRobert uh once you and pain that's your buddy\n... once my agony there what he wants to doctors are going to win the ... will be easier to play the red Sox I Believe ... see what you're doing is you're making the ... the Astros are being over value you don't realize how bad the Cleveland Indians are okay that's true that's a great point Red Sox a much better team the Cleveland Indians and the red Sox will\nHave home field advantage right their home field advantage though you throw that out there\nUh I guess it doesn't matter now 'cause those are the top two they have they been probably they're probably going to step up to the game of not than I that was my big talking point on the red Sox review show there are and I said if I'm the red Sox\nI Would consider I probably won't do it but I Would put of all the ... I had a price I Would go sale it in the else yes I'd go sail\nPoor cello of all the and hope you can avoid ... I Would guess I Would push David Price back as far as I possibly can to avoid another nerve wracking worst thinkers on the play offs much worse much worse\nI thought you might give David Price one of your patent andme our pets are not on work so well I I\nHe's beyond pep though is that right is no help for his pep talk no I don't know it's over done skis on that\n... on the price say there's another one price can opt out of his contract is not going to do that he's going to opt in and then demand a trade or force the red Sox you only have to demand a trade the red Sox to say where do you want to\nCrazy bizarro world I Would take a bunch of these calls\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine also a ban ... show follow up will titled this one fight club band Mabel show follow up we'll call it fight club we'll get to that but right now from the studios Andy\nOn Fox giving you the inside skinny eddy that of course when we start with games for the American league division series where the red Sox were taken all the ...\nHe's in New York a must win for the Bronx bombers a win for Boston and they would move on to the American league championship series in Boston in a form one leading the ninth Newark would score twice to make it a one run game then I'd runners at first and second for the labor tour as\nThe first sign house races runners offers second one too swung on tap found her slowly here has he fired the first\nSeries against the Yankees however long my challenge this call\nSomebody a Red Sox were never going to go and de boon to challenge but the call was ... was correct and the red Sox hold on\nJust the ... three when eventually a World Series is going to end like this and you're everyone loves the play by play broadcast his dream is a World Series final call this late for generation that's right and this was ... wait a minute they're going to review\nThat'll be the final call the world series and his wife as a sports fan and as an announcer yeah with the world of review you can't really celebrate until after they've reviewed the red Sox have won a bunch of the games have less when he was the thing about some hotshot young like the ... the games and the other guy's pretty good I don't know his name he doesn't ... gives\nYou the first one to be a big moment for the bars\nAnd then it might be a ... so I agree with you but\nBoston does when they take the series three games to one and onto the Houston actually wanted to Boston where they'll take um Houston Astros\nThat starts on Saturday and the American league championship series of bad seafood for those astro players I wouldn't go out and Boston boys look out my wife got you could be your who is on there you know it's from the NFL the Jacksonville Jaguars ...

his iPad throwing allegedly throwing the stuff\nOver the balcony so he's being sued by the grandfather of the child is the the child has experienced anxiety in trouble sleeping because of the incident and also the owner of the condo the brown asleep so you're sitting in for damages in breach of a ...\nI'm going to break this now I think this is worthy of amount of monologue on my list I liked his stories I Love legal stories at a you know that I I'm a I'm a practicing lawyer on radio for years I've been practicing law here late at night so I there's a lot to that story to unpack so I\nI think we should dig deeper into that because I Believe one of those lawsuits is frivolous the other one has some some meat to it so anyway we'll we'll talk more later you know depending on the show on Fox Darryl\nFrom the peanut gallery writes in Daryl says Clayton manning he says you do the equipment there's Clayton manning will never pitch in New York uh Darryl says guy firmly grabbed his neck and

[noise] downloaded\nAnd sure enough there was that saw the light of day\nNow as an NFL player Antonio Brown has mostly been drama free it's all been about football it's not about drama you've\nBeen mostly drama free in the NFL you know he's had some incidents where he's he's had some amazing dancers and things like that and there's been some some alimony issues ah with the the ladies I live in ... things like that but I'm Talking about\nLegal\nSituations involving law enforcement and lawsuits and things like that\nSo I went back and look and sure enough\nWhen he was a young up and coming receiver he had a scholarship to play at Florida International university and you might say Florida International university not that big a deal but Antonio Brown is like a Miami guy I could have stayed home it would have been a nice opportunity for their he'd always dominated\nBack in the days from a ... I went to high school in ... in Miami and all that so he could have could have really done well playing for a school which is in the area and then he had to go off the Michigan\nShe again to go play college football he ended up playing at Central Michigan well one of the reasons that he did not end up going to Florida in ...\nNational he was expelled and I'll listen to these details carefully he was expelled\nBecause of an altercation with a security guard ... interesting interest it sounds like deja vu to me and I'm not talking about the the the ballet there that's a that's not really a brown appears to have a very short fuse\nAnd that could be why he's so good but he came unglued if you believe these lawsuits which often or a version of the truth\nBut not the whole truth remember the key thing if you've ever studied the law when it comes to lawsuits\nThere's the version of the the litigating party the one that are pressing the lawsuit\nUsually can hyped up there's that version there's Antonio Brown's version which is to everything and then there's the truth right so somewhere in the middle ages three sides of the story there's the side of the people suing this side of the people saying I didn't do it and then the truth is somewhere in the middle\nThat's usually how that happens now the party shot on this Antonio Brown has plenty of cash this is not anything to worry about he can write a check and and you can make this all go away can have a vanish right but you\nWonder how many other of these situations have popped up other other skirmishes that have gone so far on reported and we know that he's a target as a person of interest because of how much money has right now he's got a bull's eye on his back each year\nAnd this is this that I like to bring this up with their losses\nEvery year there were approximately eighty thousand people that take the bar exam to become lawyers\nAnd out of those eighty thousand roughly sixty thousand of them passed the bar and become lawyers so that means every year we get sixty thousand more lawyers in just in the United states sixty thousand more lawyers\nAre not all of them practice law some people just pass the bar exam they take the bar exam just to say we did it you know then they don't actually plan to open a practice\nBut a lot of them do and there's not enough cases out there so when you get somebody like Antonio Brown has got a lot of money that is seen as an ATM machine it's just like Floyd Mayweather looks at the public\nWhen he wants to fight may pack yeah again he's like I Need some cash let me go to my ATM machine I'm going to have another ... a sham fight and I'll get people to pay for and people will pay for it\nSo anyway I ... the one lawsuit it's got some legs you the the one with the the person that was the the tainted through another ten at the the landlord\nThat's got some Jews to it because there's physical evidence there's a contract that you could say was violated the other one smells like a rich\nI mean it sounds like the grand puzzle hey I this was traumatic for me and I'm gonna try to get some money 'cause a lot of two year olds have problems sleeping how do you know the two year old has problems sleeping because of this and not because of something else or how do you know how you have more important how can you prove that\nYou're going to bring in a bunch of psychologists and all that and go through the whole thing\n[noise] we say hello to Edmund Dallas oh\nEunice Antonio Brown fan Garcia\nI'm a big fan of his uh on the field work not so much is off the field work\nHave you ever throw anything off a building\nOr I've thrown something onto a building but never never hurting off of a building now\nWell over\n...\n... would you like to have it come to Jesus moment like who were in high school were idiots we jump off of a\nRoof into the pool and maybe there could have been something thrown into the who may be but now\nWhen I was a kid or David Letterman used to have this Oh yes and he would throws random stuff off the top of a building a house cool it was last night it was you always wonder like what you can look like when it hits the ground and ... and ... it often would would disappoint but sometimes it wouldn't you throw like you know tell the lord of the\nUs you know seven story building just to see what happened it was off\nSo I might or might not have thrown some water balloons and things like that just to see what happened off the side of a [laughter] but but never never more than like two or three stores I never went more than that\n'cause I didn't have access to anything you know I had access I probably would have done it but yeah\nThey're talking about this kid having you know emotional distress yes do you what like how old were you when you recall like your first memory\nAsk your question we've have talked to is I I I think the first thing I vaguely remember I was like five years old\nYeah me too yeah there are ... yeah you know everything else you know my parents could have beat my ass every now and I'm sure they did they probably did I deserved it\nYes but uh yeah the the first member happens about five years old is yeah\nSo you're saying the two year old probably not going to get a lot of emotional ... when the new psychology\nIs that everything that happens you you see it out of you late already oh really so people they they say that I have read that on the Internet\nI don't feel this guy's going to lose a job you know and when and he's like thirties damn Ottoman yes they do that and John thrown the autumn Antonio or\nWasn't talking about thirty so this guy will be thirty two Antonio Brown will be sixty two and he'll be suing Antonio Brown because it's something that happened to his two years old he'll soon again\nLike I my life is I'm a failure because if you are how\nDare you Antonio Brown makes sense right\nOh yeah yeah yeah that's been our show on Fox it's great part I'm telling you to the phones we go and let's go to Seattle and we haven't heard of this kind of wild\nBrent in Seattle hallowed brands\nTalking a felon for soft him on the other thing that I hold on to say\nOnly once somebody doing that I feel this is off the mile Mahler or mall or a one time it was ...\nAbout an hour long going up and down\nSomeone you would probably\nBe a manager and extension when nine one one eighty nine games for the first half of the great second half the service end cash deserve extensions\nThought [noise] I [noise]\nI mean it was ... I mean I I we don't talk about the Tampa Bay rays we don't but but thank you hope everything's going well for you and heard from in a wild man you're late here so I think\nI think everyone should get an extension starting with me I think I should get a big extension and then the trickle down effect or it starts with me and then you can move on to everybody else\nHow about that you get with that I'm going with a very good will\nPress on here it sounded like a good plan in buyer's remorse we'll get to those stories it sounded like a good plan and buyers' remorse that's next\n[noise]\nThe place it makes you rise outta your share the\nMarathon\nThis is why you know what we are an awful\nLot of sports radio\nBut now they're here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first who were actually peach baskets whether the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we use another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car troop car also helps people get used cars\nThat's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and he's simpler by experience what do you buy new or use and withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nThere also more likely to enjoy a faster buying experienced by connecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout ... car and enjoy more confident car buying experience\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine\nIs it a case of buyer's remorse we'll get to that and also ... to the third degree Mao there to the third degree will get to all that from the Fox sports radio\nGeico studios but right now any Garcia to update you with somebody to steady\nWell of course the big story comes for baseball where it was game for the American league division series they must win game for the Yankees at home to take it on their bitter rivals the red Sox were looking to advance to the American league championship series Boston at a fourth one leading the ninth ending with things that are interesting Newark scored twice that runners at first and second with ... at the plate\nFor aside house races up front or is our first one to swing on tap found her slowly tragic as has he fired the first\nThe series against the Yankees however [noise] hair on my challenge this call\nWB I Red Sox radio network with the caller yes it was reviewed the call was upheld the out was recorded and the red Sox game the four three ... report cello earns doing Chris Kimball the said and she sees about he took the laws Boston which the series three games to one and they will host Houston in the American league championship series\nStarting on Saturday a couple of those from the NFL Jacksonville Jaguars ... already backed him all Charles do a one year deal and wash the Redskins that are running back Adrian Peterson somebody just getting shorter Monday Night but we'll play and the team's next game against Carolina this is what brought you buy true car online shopping can be confusing\nNot anymore with troop price from drew current now you can do the exact price you pay for your next car so this is true carded joy and more confident car buying experience but you said earlier that you like to put your\nLawyer hat on or maybe you can kind of decide for this to give us your thoughts did you see\nAnd this is all stemming from of course Reggie Bush heaviest Heisman Trophy strip way back when for violating into the rules now if you recall and do you do 'cause you're you're in Southern California USC assistant Todd McNeil ... ended up being fired over that\nAnd he was hit with the show cause penalty that banned him from coaching for a year and near claim that that ended his major college go to Chris so we filed a lawsuit\nI could see it go away and all these years later they're finally getting around the ruling on busy superior court judge here in Los Angeles up held we show cause a ruling that says that it violates California law\nThe result is that California schools\nThat play major college football now have concerns they may not be able to be a part of the NC double a because they no longer meet the requirements of membership the NC double a released a statement saying it disagreed with the court's ruling and we'll explore all avenues for relief too\nIntruding into believing schools in California can give you to abide by the same rules as the rest of the NC double his membership\nI there are so there's the ... the only thing they can do I guess they'll they'll can the appeal even more can they go all the way up\nI guess I guess you could always you ... have lost their first appeal but it I mean I find it hard to believe that a U.S to UCLA Stanford and cow or going to be kicked out of the pack twelve because of this ruling by a LA superior court judge I mean it looks like but I'm way around it is\nYou know I'm not the biggest fan of the NCAA as you know now I'm not I'm not either so I I I kinda like this because it upsets them I liked it this upsets them are and they're essentially the judge this how I interpret the judge essentially said you have a cartel\nAnd uh you you can't just block someone from working in that cartel right there that they have control over everything in my reading this right I think I'm reading this right\nAh yeah it's actually a if this if if another institution wants to hire this person that's their business you can't ban him from a profession that it's\nLike if you get fired from domino's because your bed at making peace is what you want to go work at Pizza Hut you can go work at Pizza Hut correct foot in this case you can't if you get fired from USC they're saying you can't work at any other school at all for a ... yeah\nHave you seen in those terms you're probably right can I get a point there\nDo you think do we think he cheated probably so right I mean it the Reggie Bush deal and all that\nWell I always thought it was a raw deal for us see because it it okay the coach found out about it but he was involved in it he just didn't 'bout the scores they're all revolving doesn't it seem like in the grand scheme of what goes on and college sports to be a ... we\nTalked about Jim ghetto the other a trial which is going on which the NCAA says they're closely monitoring in a federal courtroom in Manhattan I been keeping an eye on that also\nHe seems like he's got a pretty good case the guy that was the Adidas executive who essentially said everyone is is doing it and he didn't violate the law because everyone knew what was going on\nSo if the if he wins wow he's got a chance you got pretty good chance ...\nIt's all about integrity Eddie highest standard of integrity college athletics clearly a very important not them out of the show on Fox with somebody from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were\nFifteen minutes could save a\nFifteen Percent or more on your car insurance just visit Geico dot com\n[noise] who is that surely any free\nRe quote so this one hits close to home one of the signature moves to the NFL offseason\nThe Los Angeles where I Am Smit a trade with Kansas City to get Marcus Peters now the reason this was universally celebrated is not because markets Peters was he noted hot head it's not because of that\nThis was universally celebrated because markets Peters had the reputation\nOf being one of the premier defensive backs in the national football the he was young at the time you're still young and the assumption was my God what a great thing this is how you're getting a player who's not even really in the prime of his football career\nAnd you're getting them just for some draft picks what could possibly be wrong with that well here we are five weeks into the NFL season\nThere are and I went this right here on them I Want to get it wrong there are a hundred and eleven quarterbacks that had been raided by pro football focus\nThe nerds and the geeks over pro football folks they keep track of this stuff out of the one hundred and eleven quarterbacks that have played enough to qualify where do you think Marcus Peters is\nYou got your answer All right ah no he's not last no no it's not a hundred and eleven or no is the first\n... I wouldn't be doing this story if he was first I mean play by maybe I Would but it's now he's not number one markets Peters out of a hundred and an eleven qualified quarterback so National Football league is ranked a hundred and six there are only\nThere are only five\nDefensive backs in the entire NFL that have been worse at their job then mark is Peter's away from it\nSo if you're the Broncos who ever markets Peters is matched up against on a chilly Denver evening or afternoon rather just throw the ball markets Peters wise what I'm saying I was just about to say you're listening van still yeah well see the problem is the Broncos could do that in in ... can't get the ball to receive a see that's the problem\nSo cheap shot who are accurate that sad Kelly bring on chat Kelly [laughter]\nCheck Kelly [laughter] that'll that'll make the difference upbringing on chat Kelly that's very important [noise] ice grammar which\nIs wonderful ... Lynch\n[laughter] marches Peters is a hundred and six out of a hundred and eleven defensive backs in the NFL the rams treated to draft picks the get him he was a pro bowler twice in Kansas City what the hell is he doing with the regime's what's going on\nGuys socks terrible\nOh let's go now to we speaking about we man hippie isn't there a big well I guess\nIt's not near you there's a big storm but not near your part of Florida oh let's go to weed man it'd be in Miami he remarried when we aren't sure I mean we yeah hello\nYeah good hey man that\nI don't drink raw milk for the law you know I didn't know that are are they all\nGo yeah you're right you know why why it out oh\nOkay what what what what are\nTheir turn off your electricity\nTeams are hurting our white shark\nWhy don't you go get a job about that\nI got I clearly are shut out well at least going to have my electric somebody got an article in wanting wanting to our see\nNow you're panhandling on the radio we and we don't\nLike who are not yet I still yeah because\nYou know we may [noise] you know yeah blow you off we'd\nBeen I mean listen I feel bad for you that you're in that situation I Hope your power doesn't go out and uh but you do have to pay your bills oh it's it's mildly important in most people like to do that most people that run businesses like the have their customers pay their bills on\nTime right and so yeah so what you do I know what you're doing we I Know I Know what you're up you're like yeah I don't want them there are some some sympathetic member of the ...\nNone other than the ... is this guy you're talking about the Tories you talk about legendary and if he was starting quarterback in the NFL is currently the back of match job will be laying the falcons\nIs number two in the last\nSeven to seven passes [noise]\nMop off duty for the Balkans\nAnd none of them have been intercepted so breezes number one shop number two and we're number one\nWas that [laughter] how about that\n\nIs one thing that gets ... and we bring\nIn the coup don't go [noise] been after winning the or the bucks dropped nearly fifty on them to start the season and then almost losing the browns the next week after that the concern for the things was approaching panic levels however there now foreign one and just routed the Redskins and an all around great showing the better the since the rams biggest concerning NFC\nUh no I Will give that a thumbs down these saint's or not\nI'm gonna shockey with my aunt\nThe answer is a team the ramps have already beat\nThat's the answer I I'll tell you what hey even though the rams took apart the Minnesota defense and\nIt was a demoralizing performance from Minnesota coliseum I have more faith in Mike Zimmer just fix the Viking divas river it doesn't matter how you are now\nIt matters how you are at the end of the year the Vikings have enough officers would hurt because\nThey have the nuts and bolts of a good defense they can fine tune it you look at that division Green Bay is not very good Chicago I don't buy\nA Detroit come on that's a division that the Vikings we could come back up that can win that division get in the ... gonna have to play well in the road and be New Orleans traditionally\nHas not been relevant on the road so we're assuming the rams are gonna have home field advantage Drew Brees\nHas essentially been like a baseball player that plays his home games in Colorado\nVery good at home not so good on the road in fact the numbers back that up Drew Brees in his career he's eighty and forty eight at home he's only five games above five hundred on the road and he's touched down percentage goes down by almost thirty percent on the road\nSo I'll take the Vikings rebounding as opposed to the same next\nThat as being reported that when levy on bell returns to the Steelers and a couple of weeks that they could do with a running back by committee approach a number of the players on the Steelers seem to think that it was a good idea do you know it's a terrible like it's an unnecessary\nI Do the reason the students are having problems this year it's not because they don't have Libyan bell or James ... counters actually statistically been fine the defense in Pittsburgh the ... the Steelers don't need to also this is a very important they don't need to worry about levy on bell next season [noise] he's gone\nHe's gonna leave this is the final year however many games he plays so why you're saving you\nWrite what what are you seeing him where he is already miss\nHowever many games or by the time it gets back over seven weeks of the season when you're trying to keep 'em fresh so he goes in science who the Texans are the browns or somebody next year what's up with that\nAnd number two and maybe I'm I'm incorrect on this but I Believe that it's a rhythm thing when you're the running back and you get better the more carries you get and so both guys would be hurt by that is a terrible idea to split cares next\nWe're discussing Patrick my home to the weekend Tom Brady\nPointed out how the NFL game is very different today than it was back when he was the second year player on the rise saying that pro football now is sort of a glorified college ball [noise] and he didn't bring it was actually taking a shot at moms nuts\nHe what he's doing is taking a shot at Roger Goodell is what he's doing he's taking a shot at Dell the commission right the NFL has evolved into a\nHeavy heavy handed past\nFirst passed second past third they've essentially neutered defensive backs in line backers and see Tom Brady when he got in the NFL and the only two thousand he remembers with the NFL used to be like he's crossed over he's he started in Twenty one when he wished to go over the quarterback in New England he's witnessed the transition\nAnd so he's taking potshots\n... when he first became of being in the NFL drew a when when he was but so\nI looked it up there were twenty four the number twenty four [noise] there were seven quarterbacks within twenty four and more passing touchdown [noise]\nNow I think the numbers like fourteen ... real quick rats on how do we do ... you pass as it
