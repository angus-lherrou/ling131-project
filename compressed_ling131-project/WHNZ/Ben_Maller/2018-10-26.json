mistake another guy the mistake here he goes back to the kennel covered and fleas use a dog a ... and that's it it ... the one place that he's had his most joy as an NFL player has been the United kingdom in four games in London\nHe's got eight touchdowns and only two interceptions that\nAppears to be where he needs to stay as you just leave him in London so the next time the jak play in London the plan here is simple eventually dug more own will listen to me and my theory on jacks football run to the right run to the left run up the got Carlos\nHyde you got him use him the only way you pass\nThe only way you passed\nIs when you are convinced that the other team is they've knows if they have no safety is back then maybe you attempt to forward pass but even then I Would have my doubts I Would still running quarterback keeper\nA but that's the ... and then number two Carson when I play play well last week until the game mattered and the fourth quarter until the gay marriage and the fourth quarter and remember just fifty nine percent of the yards gained by opponents against Jacksonville have been through the year that the jak defense while they're not as good as last year\nThey have been very good at stopping the opposing team's passing yards or you know they're holding their own in that department in Jacksonville is the problem they've had and this is why ... got taken out of the game they're averaging three point three turnovers\nThe last three weeks those are self inflicted wounds and since the jags became a contender again for the playoffs in last season\nAs an underdog they've been pretty good they're six and three the last two years as an underdog you're getting three points here that's a good spot the public has turned on the jags that gives them some value you want to be on the other side of the public I'll take Jacksonville to win the game out right twenty\nTo twenty the jazz get the [noise]\nThe penny disagrees with the eagles okay good when Winfrey next up Cleveland to foreign one at Pittsburgh three two in one\nThe Steelers opened up a seven and a half point home favorite Cleveland ... affair by eight now public likes the Steelers did not play well the first time these teams met in northern Ohio this game in Pittsburgh\nI Am going to take the brownies I'm going to cover my nose and hold my nose together while I make this pick but I'm going to take the Cleveland Browns or the browns\nHave already competed to head to head mano a mano and now they didn't beat the Steelers they certainly they didn't lose the game either that they're playing just well enough to lose close most of the time we burn as their record would indicate\nI liked the moxie a Baker may feel they've said this before he has not been as productive lately in fact the last four weeks Baker Mayfield is the thirtieth rank quarterback part of the problem the browns\nHave punted sixteen times\nIn opponent territory that's the most in the NFL that means they crossed the fifty yard line in punted sixteen times an enemy territory [noise] what are you doing\nUh I like Cleveland to have the mental edge or even though the the Steelers play the tear it within the first time you you look at the Steelers their big rivals right now or the ravens that's the match up next week you start thinking ahead to Baltimore and nobody gets up for Cleveland [noise] a ... a couple of things you're better off his work\nHe's been nothing but mediocre is the last four weeks he's sixteenth and the NFL right around the average there as far as quarterback rating these barely ahead of Andy Dalton\nIn the Cuban rating the thing that scares me and the reason the Pittsburgh to cover this game as James Caan or who's going to carry the water for Pittsburgh the browns\nAre so slow defensively on the outsiders there fast in some areas but they're\nThey're so slow outside those little toss plays can kill their defense but any time you get over seven points and he divisional game you don't ask me questions you ask any questions you take the point you're happy with that your final score Steelers twenty seven rounds get the cover\nAt twenty three points [noise]\nPenny

week his age I'm a I had a feeling he was going to have a big game um he was alive out there on the field and and he really showed it tonight he didn't say where they made some tough catches um there are situations where\nSome of the balls I couldn't leave them out throw him on his back shoulder thing\nThat's\nQuite a heck of a game and the deserves\nThe throne behind a ah right I have never heard that before he intentionally threw the ball behind I've heard it on ... that is great\nYou know I mom I had to eat all the chocolate chip cookies they I didn't want to do it but if I had if I didn't need all the chocolate chip cookies you know the dog would eat and some of the dog could have died so I had to do it I didn't want to do it but I had to do it\n[laughter]\nDo you want to hear Scott but said Nick uh well yeah I always\nWant to hear ... sitting in ... said he is the God of the sports cliche he's everything that we judge this against he is the standard he is the barometer oh let's see if this is classic I Want to hear\nWell they're all important we've got to win as many as we can a lot of baseball to be played anything can happen you know we're going to come the yard each and every day battle each night and and look up at the end of the what we're saying we know our work\nIs cut out for us we've got a lot of work to do yeah I mean we can all come together I realized what we have here and trying to get something done that would still applies to this that is so\nGeneric that you could say that for the the twenty eight teams Dodgers ... yeah yeah you could say that we\nSay hello to Steve just said\n... that was an excellent clip you just played there that's well that's a little lame more often well that's from how old is that was that the eight years ago or so yeah that might have said that is the gold standard on a shelf actually do I have\nHeard it before on the show I said it should play more often it ... no we played all the time it loses its gusto we can't play it all the time\nHe embodied everyday Steve no I didn't say every day just like if you like mid ship ice cream and use it everyday suddenly you don't like it you can try\nAnd you have any negative stats Steve yeah there were some negative Dodgers stats block actually\n[laughter]\nYou know I I personally\nDon't watch the games I don't want to hear Joe Buck oh no I I'm okay with Joe I like poking fun at Joe but he's he does a decent job but he he took a shot at Machado during the game did you see that a guy that I took a ... Machado so you know he's he's a ... yeah he was a ... yeah\nHe did what's your negative referring\nTo like it was Machado sliding into second base into an infielder know when the Dodgers one game seven at Milwaukee they did the two most obvious thing in the stats that the Dodgers succeed at this year\nWhen they hit more than one Homer Dodgers to have a dominant record when they hit more than one Homer and that's happened often they were number one and the national league homers and the other is the second home or the week home running game seven\nPut them up by four gotta repeat the stat\nThe Dodgers have never lost this year when leading by four runs at any point in any game the only under ... in the name so we might go up by for safety for an open\nMy theory is that the the commissioner's office to make sure there's a game on Sunday night on Fox after that Packer ram getting they got to get the game five\nAnd so for the baseball is going to give them like four runs in the first inning so they'll be for nothing and then we don't have to even watch the game on friday it will be over done go I'd have a nice Italian dinner have a wonderful time whenever you do knock yourself out okay\nGo to Tommy forget the Italian dinner burgers\nTimes are going to be All right I ate there too much I just had were talking about it I Lived in Hollywood we we we went there one time I had to media baseball game and went through a Tommy's ... original these new stadium yeah by the way jointly\nJoe Buck also mentioned the possibility of the four major sports all inaction in downtown LA and one day Sunday if there's a game five Sunday night yeah\nThat's the ... what is that the polar vortex or something like that what do they call it was a term for that\nI don't know where that is so far above my pay grade I have no way no idea what what is your pay grade we like to share that going to find out where you're paying your mortgage image and you can work as a one Fifteen in the morning a [laughter] a fifth year that I\nI Know where I stand when I hear other hosts have nannies I Know that I ah yeah I'm not doing that well I I Know and they take them on the road I'm like I I'm not I'm not that I Know I'm not getting paid like that so I'm definitely giving somebody a deal on that and I know that that's for that's for damn sure let's go to the phones real quick now I got to get this woman on\nBecause she was at Fenway Park and she was in the crowd at Fenway for one of the of the games there I think was game one I Believe she was that right and it was game one oh yeah Jerry in ah Rhode Island absolutely hello Jerry what's going on\nHey Jerry how you doing\nYou sit on hold for the entire show and you have a wonderful I don't know if you want to tell us on nearby you told me off the air maybe I should bring it up on the air but you have an amazing story\nActually doing actually\nTiger Woods and Phil Mickelson golf I'll go first and each day on the pay or Phil Mickelson Tiger Woods and plus I don't really have to talk about it I don't think because that's on the weekend and I'll\nBe back following the NFL actually what about you to say you're going to pay twenty bucks\nBut there's not a chance and yes there's plenty of Fox college football there will be some people paying twenty dollars for it but I'm guessing most of those people have twenty dollars to burn\nYeah no I'll I'll go out and have a nice a nice meal or go to the fast food get some chicken fingers it raising cage there's somebody there what about you Roberta a\nI like golf but I'm not a big golf ... joined us you know the big of a coup a little bit\nThe latest your Hollywood ... for Gulf here I wouldn't accept twenty dollar [laughter] uh yeah is it wrong that I Hope this was a disaster is it wrong that I Hope that no one will be going to be\nThat if you speak out too much now that'll just bring Phil Mickelson back to the next TNT broadcast to hammer it into the ground couldn't get enough of them tonight on their coverage of the Lakers game\nI heard he was all over that I didn't have a presence a Laker game in as much as four\nOr five games five exciting games mention it last night bed and\nNBA starts entertaining Christmases NBA figure you know\nI think the pay per view will do really well in the uh the coveted demographic of fifty five Seventy five\nThere money counties make Gulf Gulf people have a lot of money but are there enough hardcore Gulf people to spend the money\n'cause you you know twenty bucks isn't all that much for people who have money but it's still in all the time investment and all that I don't\nI don't think there's going to be any juice either because there's no crowd race up is going to be like the that's right just invite the chosen one they're going to be there's there's nothing you know ... it's going to be like a huge gallery those shots of this massive humanity following Tiger Woods around you're not gonna get any of that because\nAnd it's not their money that's on the line which really would make it something and and the anti was trying to play up all there'll be liked and there's no commercials so you get all the trash talk really Gulf trash talk that twenty dollars for Gulf trash talk if you\nWant real human drama if your that's what you're looking for watch the college football all day\nYou don't pick a guy were what is the tigers with like seven hundred million dollars right\nHe's worth seven hundred Phil Mickelson who is I guess the poor guy in the equation and he's worth four hundred million take two guys that are worth fifty thousand dollars total combined alright net worth and give him nine million if they win I'm at that now that would be something\nI'll bet you might tense Mercedes against I mean we're kind of trash talk between these two guys\nLive in a different world altogether who's gonna it's not a David versus Goliath ... versus Goliath and they're going to go back to their private homes with their security guards and all that jerks\nNot just private homes Phil Mickelson when he lives in San Diego when the golf tournaments in LA he takes eight plane home daily during the tournament\nYeah well the reason you answered your own question why was filled all over the TNC broadcast before all the way to Atlanta right to to be part of that\nYou know he went to the sidelines at staples center is sitting next to raise email at\n... somebody said he was born he was Barclay there\nNo they did interview I think pre game show but not at all during the game he was physically a court say\nOh I thought he was in Atlanta I didn't watch it no liquor nuggets ... who's gonna watch that\nI Would I Would buy the pay per view if they did some sort of like skills challenged like in the like in the NBA where like they had to drive the ball through like a small ring or or those trick shots where you know they flipped their foot drive and they're doing\nSome of that to their make are they in yeah I thought it was like well what happens if like woods or or Mickelson jumps out to a big lead and there's no drama they've got to do something else there's gotta be catch only wouldn't clubs\nSomething like that when I was on the line and then one of them could die or some blindfolded how 'bout you\nPut a windmill in front of the whole like the U.S\nNone of what's the big alligator in South Carolina oh yeah oh yeah [laughter] that allegation and we don't know where it is but it might be plenty alligators there at the casinos though just because that's where they show on Fox will\nPress on got lame jokes we got to get to some of these big name callers would do that as well the whole deal\nFrom the guy goes studios are I'm sure filling in tiger will be okay if no one pays for the pay per view I think there'll be All right but let's get to Steve ...\nWith the lady that late NBA game in LA the Lakers beat previously foreign oh Denver\nOne Twenty
