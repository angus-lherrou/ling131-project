and get the ball down field\n\nAnd yet giants fans afterwards to make themselves feel better yeah but don't worry we got a you know at least we didn't blow that sake one Barclay pick [laughter]\n'cause it 'cause he can catch a jump off because he breaks the long run every now and then you're one in five men just be honest you'll feel better about yourself All right just beyond as you say yeah listen you know look yeah look I'm In a much better shape and I'm really really\nStrong right now especially my lower half and I'm really you know because of all those walks to work but man I'd kill for a\nCar 'cause I don't want to do this anymore I really don't want to do this anymore if you're the giants you needed a quarterback sake one looks great but you needed a quarterback

shown them and that you guys screaming at each other over a text message from somebody\nI'm a name Renee but Renee is not actually a woman a it's a guy name Renee and he's from Montreal\nLike they're you know there there's a lot that could go on to fight ... fight your way between couples but\n\nI've said this from the beginning that the only people that hate Thursday Night Football more than the

are behind closed doors now it's on the stage in front of everybody\nAnd we're all watching and we're also seeing it and we're all witnessing just how bad you really are you can kind of hide 'em there's a safety in numbers thing with the NFL when there's a bunch of games going on\nThere's usually that one game that nobody really cares about are the teams really bad or it's a blowout and you're just going to dismiss it and you go through the red zone or whatever on your Sunday ticket or the game mix\nBut\nOnce you go on a Thursday night game and you're bad then you get exposed to everybody it's why we've seen an overreaction to stand alone games in the past it's why the bangles fired their off into coordinator after week to last season\nLook two weeks in your finer officer coordinator why didn't you just do it two weeks earlier\n... well I don't get it\nBecause it was a stand alone stage and you were embarrassed on national TV and you had to react chip Kelly got fired when in Philadelphia when the eagles got beat up on Saturday Night football late in the season\nAfter two winning season he was done in Philadelphia and it was the stand alone game and a division rival that was the tipping point and the straw that broke broke the camera camel's back and chip Kelly was done\nThe only people that hate Thursday Night Football more than the players or coaches were bad teams 'cause now all their dysfunction plays out in front of everybody it's like a fight and public with your with your girlfriend your boyfriend it's\nA bad situation more at a football next

Fifteen when still fail\nYou can listen bought our first I ... [noise] downloaded [noise]\nLike we should all be rooting for good games every one of us should be hoping to get the best games possible with the most on the line every single time so if you do\nAnd if you do want to see good games and that's what you're in this for if your team's not in it you would least want to see good games\nIf that's the case you're rooting for Michigan on Saturday and you're rooting for him to roll and in fact\nNot only are you rooting for Michigan on Saturday later today you're also going to be rooting for Michigan against Michigan State next Saturday and then you're going to be rooting for Michigan to beat Penn State in three weeks and then you're going to be rooting\nFor Michigan to have one last when they go to Columbus the final week of the season to play Ohio State and do you want to know why you're going to do that\nBecause you want to see big games you want to watch a game that actually means something you want as many of those as possible\n\nAnd in order to have that you gotta have Michigan run the table you gotta have Michigan get to Columbus last week of the season a month and a half from now with everything to play for\nWith a chance to potentially ruin Ohio state's perfect season or Ohio state's opportunity to go to the Big Ten title game and then to go to a college football playoff\nBut to get there and actually have that gay means something\nYou can hate Harbaugh if they lose to Ohio State that Haiti is still going to be there I'm not telling you to steer away from your heart by hey that's always going to be there\nI mean when a guy steps into a program and he completely turns around the program yet for some reason people still think it's a disappointment a program that was on death's door and people still think it's a disappointment after all he's done in that program it can only be one thing\nYou hate him because he talks too much or sue in your face or he's too out in the open or ... or he's showing up at a baseball game with a glove on a he is at the Sistine Chapel running pat and go routes or with his uh quarterbacks\nYou just you don't like the idea of Harbaugh doing some of the things that have done so you've got a hold on to that horrible I hate I'm not telling you to get rid of all that you can still do it\nIf they lose the Ohio State he's chewing eight against top Fifteen\nTeams in the Associated Press\nIf he beats Wisconsin and he beats Penn State he'll still only be foreign aid against top Fifteen teams in the Associated Press\nSince he's been in Michigan so there's still plenty of hate to go around with Jim Harbaugh\nThere's a lot of things you could not like about him but I'm telling you you shouldn't be rooting for as many big games as you can possibly get all throughout the season in football that's NFL and that's college\nYou should want everybody healthy and you should want everybody playing was something to play for\n'cause it sucks when teams are playing and the game doesn't mean anything it sucks watching a rivalry game and it doesn't mean anything because it doesn't matter\nIf so and so when you know like they should do go von but regardless this game doesn't mean anything to that other team\nIf we get to that final week Ohio state's run the table Michigan still has that one loss against a very underrated at the time Notre Dame team who's probably going to the college football playoff you accept the scene\nFor a phenomenal football game in Columbus the final week of the season you should want to see as many big games as possible stopping negative put away the negativity for just a few weeks\nPut it in a holster be a gym Harbaugh\nThan temporarily and hope we get to that final week I think it's going to be fantastic\nJonah stocks Fox Sports radio\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox the phone number eight seven seven nine nine six six thirty six nine and you can get me on Twitter at the Jonas ... well

Smith a Canadian in his own right invented the sport of basketball basically in a group in Canada's trying to bring bring their sport back to the motherland apparently a business group in Quebec\nMet with commissioner Adam Silver earlier this week and they are preparing to install a bit to try to bring a professional basketball franchise to Quebec\nOf course we know they have a great success with throughout the raptors not so much success with the Vancouver Grizzlies that moved to Memphis of trying to bring basketball back to Canada you liked the move or no\n[noise] um [noise] I just wait until they have the rappers [laughter] throughout though does not not Montreal yet I don't think it is human Seattle first yeah I don't know what why does why don't lead is it just to have options like not sure\nI mean you think Vegas is probably in the pipeline somewhere to because they're going to have two professional franchises within the next couple of years I mean\nThe NFL could figure out which which games they can put in London and win games they could put an Azteca Stadium but they couldn't figure out a catch until recently right why why don't why are we doing this all wrong white and the most difficult things first aid seat book\nSeattle seems like they desperately wanna team back\nRight and and I don't mean growing up this this super sonics were always a good team no doubt they are and they had good players like that just seems like a no brainer nobody's clamoring for called back\nRight no they had a great fan base to Seattle to instill do we know there was a lot of our preseason game earlier this week where the Oklahoma City thunder came in and Kevin Iran war is old Seattle Sonics Jersey and they went nuts they loved it up there still\nAnd and by the way that's not it not to take a shot at our friends listening on ah TSN up in Canada you know we love you you know we talk CFL football here and in fact we're going to do and it's all CFL edition of the Jonas knock show here on Fox Sports radio that'll be coming up October thirty third\nAll CFLs talk for hours of nothing but the CFL October thirty\nThird here on Fox Sports radio and I believe us at Oklahoma City thunder of course there right now place where the Golden State warriors so that's a slip on my part by the way we want a cat here thing everybody's hammered nobody is perfect fine for Watson is still playing who knows [laughter]\nBy the way so I think a big reason why Seattle and a big reason why the sonics mood was because there wasn't a lot of private funding for a stadium apparently this group and Quebec\nIs willing to pay two billion dollars to fund the building of a stadium and buying a franchise so I think more or less nowadays we're talking about these franchises popping up who's willing to basically pay the entire bill and not have to use public money so I think that's kind of the direction these things are going to because people don't want to pay taxpayer money for these arenas\nLook Adam Silver you want to do something fun man All right 'cause I Know Adam Silver everybody fall washes like he's the he's a cool guy man he's he's a cool commissioner is so cool like because he fired Donald Sterling means for God's sakes man\nAt all you had to do is listen to that interview he gave and you would have fired him I mean what are we talking about it wasn't like a a momentous job done by Adam Silver that was a no brainer um if Adam Silver really wants to to make a move that's going to resonate with people why don't you do the smart things ... and put betting boost in every stadium okay\nLet's turn this up a notch right let's let's really get people excited to go to a hawk scam that's ... that's going to be difficult no matter what you do you see your negative such a negative person Kevin ... not just the negativity from Kevin fingers supporting candidate over Atlanta how dare you\nI'm just a real is Joan now who doesn't love amount is come on yeah [laughter]\nRight rather than taxing by ... by the way the mouse he's alright\nCowboys and then it was once again Jerry Jones or did an interview earlier today as he always does it's I mean there's a microphone on his face is going to talk is amazing on the fan once again it says Jason Garrett is absolutely the real deal there is no fraud and Jason Garrett he is going to leave the cowboys to a championship\nOf course he's just a few games over five hundred has only made the playoffs a couple of times as head coach and he's been there for a long while at the piggyback on that story earlier this week I saw this too apparently cowboy fans have started a petition to bring back Tony Romo out of retirement\nThat position is twenty five hundred signatures are as of about ten minutes ago they had about Seventeen thousand excuse me Seventeen hundred fifty\nIf okay if and this is just the blind game but if I told you that I've got a quarterback\nAnd he had a really really really good year I'm ... and in fact he he's had some really really good games and then not that long after that really really good year I took away his top too wide receiver targets and also his office of line was significantly worse\nThan you expect him to still be a great quarterback no questions asked\nMy must be the hall of famer no like Aaron Rodgers type\n... right or that stack Prescott yep and for people that are that are crushing debt Prescott like it's a deck Prescott problem in Dallas what were your ex but what did you think he was I don't understand like he can when you games he's already won ... games at the NFL level but you need pieces around him he's not Rogers to your point he's not\nA uh Drew Brees he's not Brady and anybody that's expecting them to still put up big numbers when he lost everybody is all I mean he lost an off into blaming Jewish disease before the season\nAnd the idea that he should still be putting up these great numbers that he did his rookie years just unrealistic that really is I I just I I I I don't understand now the petition to bring back Tony Romo mhm [noise] I was\nA so I was watching the Tony Romo football life documentary I have ever going to you know it's it's actually really good um Fox Sports radio makes an appearance on the uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ben Maller", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
