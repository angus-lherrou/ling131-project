I said I compare him a lot to the Seattle Seahawks when they started their\nNot many dynasty run it's because they had so much talent that they were fortunate enough to have under contract at the same time and that's where the Celtics are right now in a lot of young talent all under contract but eventually someone's going to want to go someplace else and go play and be part of a bigger things someplace that's going to happen\nWhether it's Kyrie Irving leaving or he wants to stay whether it is Morris wants to go somewhere whatever it is you're going to see that happening\nBut right now this is their moment in time and they are good that they're going to roll through the eastern conference they're going to roll through the play offs Toronto in Philadelphia are both good teams to Ronald wild\nKurt 'cause we don't know if ... going to be a guy who shows up and plays great or if he's going to be someone who is just biding their time until they become a free agent and does it go outside 'cause it's wintertime and doesn't like the cold and it's going to be awful there's nobody they can really have to worry about competing with each and they'll beat the wars in the west\nBecause there are deeper they'll win the NBA final Celtics or your chance\nTo look at you put your name on it you're on opening night or certainly watching the game and you see Ninety minutes from nine different players Hayward and urban you don't have to really tax them too early in the season right because you have such depth\nAnd make sure that they're healthy and ready when it comes time for winning die down down in the playoffs once we get to April and go through the three months of NBA playoffs yeah that's right Roti talking about\nKnow almost a full calendar year from now when we crowd or next

together and the punch line road so when you bring in some of the characters that are here I mean they're out of central casting some degree and everybody loves a little bit of land Stevenson added to the mix\nBut you've got the debt in terms of the west where you wouldn't be shocked\nIf they're able to roll for right we had what three through nine separated by just a couple of games last year used and got worse and the warriors questions of their debt now eventually boogie cousins comes in either ... great\nOr read some apart and then we have problems either way it's gonna be a wash but for the Lakers you you've got ... done but for the Celtics in the east is going to be very hard for other teams to imagine particularly when you see how much growth you've gotten from Tatum\n[noise] meanwhile

obviously it was bad\nThat's an off the field thing and that's something that happened in the dugout after after a play this was something that was on the field that could have resulted in injury for a player that's why I think immediately this needs a little bit more immediate attention because if he did this in this game to say okay we're suspending your next year from it\nWhat you may not be on that team that's kind of a weird things I Would I Would say that ... will wind up suspending Machado Oregon nobody talked\nAbout it last night with Michael era when you've got a guy like Bob has

the pitchers in the batter's box right they they stole science from the ... and it was going\nBut by the by the is called the league office\nThe league office it will investigate\nNow what happened we do know a\nSupposedly it's ongoing some reports say that the Astros were warned to knock it off to major league players should they\nPersonally witnessed the Houston cheating Astros heating a trash can in the dugout in recent years and they believed they were relaying science to hitters rhythmic clapping trash cans guilty guilty guilty\nThrow away the key throw away the key\nIs also point out the Los Angeles Dodgers believe that they were wrong in the world series that the Astros who stealing signs\nIn the fall classic glassy\nSpin on this yeah I have spent a lot of time thinking about this now my theory\nIs de yah ... that's my theory now when I say is you have a I don't think I'm going to can combine this with a football story baseball's Spygate now you remember that the bill Belichick\nFamous story the originator of all the ... you know the accusations against the patriots started with what was known as spike patriots got in trouble for having a camera guy recording in a spot where he was not supposed to be even though in previous years he was allowed to be there\nThey changed the rules and so the patriots got caught recording during a game from a spot they weren't supposed to be\nAnd do you remember the coach of the jets was Eric man Jeannie now why does that matter Eric command Jeannie was a disciple of Bill Belichick he was an assistant a Bill Belichick main Jeannie had knowledge of the patriots and the what they were doing recording\nAnd what not and he had a feeling that they were going to be doing that against the jets though he tipped off the jets brass and they caught this guy for the patriots in the case of the red Sox the reason I'm using the word deja vu\nWith the red Sox and Astros this has the makings of an inside job\nAlex Cora is a disciple of who he is a disciple of a J Hinch right he was an ass throws\nA system was the right hand man so it's being spawn\nAs\nYou know the Cleveland Indians BAs were the ones that were the originator of this that they started my theory is that it was actually allergic Cora\nWho tipped off the red Sox brass at the Astros were up to no good and he was the one and explain here's the person who look out for this his palace industry injuries what it is now secondly\nSince the security at Fenway caught this dirt bag and uh they didn't kick him out but they caught him and his photographs going around we have seen a change in the American league championship series\nI if you just look\nAt circumstantial evidence you say wow this is amazing the Astros are really no good without this right because this was in game one now the Astros pulverized the red Sox in game one of the American league championship series but since this guy was\nCaught red handed right cheating\nWith the cell phone camera in a place he wasn't supposed to be the time he wasn't supposed to be there the red Sox have polarized Houston pitching they've scored Fifteen runs the past two games the uninhabitable astro pitching staff is suddenly very humid\nVery very human the astro pitching staff\nIs that just a coincidence or is there more to this story Mm inquiring minds when all the Astros appear to be shell shocked but suddenly not so invincible without inside information now since Houston got caught\nThey're trying to spin this ... this is another wonderful technical to this story the Astros are claiming\nThat what happened here was and this is wonderful spin\nBut it's lazy spin the Astros are spending their stories saying well what actually happened here is that they were just trying to ensure that the red Sox were not the ones cheating they were just making sure the red socks want you to now where we heard this excuse before that would be former St Louis cheating cardinal scouting director\nOr are there was a Chris Korea was his name he's the one that committed corporate espionage his defense as I recall was it the red birds were spying over checking into the Astros database to make sure the Astros one stealing the cardinals data\nI did the judge believe him\nYes what are the guys in prison he's been in ... he pled guilty to five counts of unauthorized access to protect the computer for twenty Thirteen to twenty fourteen at least\nAnd he was promoted during that to the St Louis director of baseball development he was sentenced to four years in prison for that and the and the Astros have the chutzpah to use that as their excuse the same thing the other guy got sent to jail for\nWhat the hell is that what's the laziness is what it is ... West Point you know there has been a cloud\nWe agree on this every man woman and child around Houston baseball either shadow them uh I have been one who's brave enough to pointed out I've been taking some blowback for that or I'd like to hear that that gas back in the morning on Houston radio who was having some fun how dare you say you're treating well\nHello how are you more on your ... heaters in Houston [laughter]\n\nThis is shadowing you write\nThe ashes and what makes it even more wonderful and poetic justice is the Astros have been selling this false narrative that we do things the right way we win the right with the white ... the wonderful right way and it's bogus [noise] alright\nReports of pitchers doctoring the ball to increase spending rates feeling signs from you ... and the Dodgers game seven of the world series\nAnd noble baseball do anything that's the problem baseball typically does know the cardinals had a guy go to jail for for years they got a slap on the wrist from the commissioner's office\nLike Rob Manfred is gutless when it comes to punishing teams or this kind of stuff\nLet's see if he gets a pair of balls and actually does something and puts an end you know I I Would like to recommend to begin the healing process from this horrible injustice the Astros have been part of I Believe it first what baseball she'd do is they should have the Astros vacate the twenty Seventeen World Series championship they didn't deserve it\nThey didn't ask or the Dodgers are clearly cheating using rhythmic clapping and trash cans to\nCheat how long can you go to trash cans and rhythmic clapping ... began with that asked us not to vacate\nThe twenty Seventeen World Series\nBanned them for post season play for Thirty years I Would do that I Would take my every draft pick for the next forty years and I would force them to play in the little league field ... wider\nThat stream no not not extreme enough right exactly\nFaith all done right they're done it's over turn out\nThat a lot of the parties over go back to suck it actors you can't cheat anymore with your trash cans and you've written a clapping\n[laughter]\n\nBig guys right there with the Astros owner or a

ten all your favorite music all your favorite stations all three of my heart radio\nWhat they did last year they going to have trouble making a play on notice now and I'm like Jacksonville is a deep dish style alert the running game it's deli they just don't have a quarterback with the border to minimize the mistakes they would be in the mix but they're looking back\nBorder not looking good orders will get it together that a rough patch you're listening to the odd trouble with Chris Broussard Enron Parker me about that ... that seven pm eastern ...\nBox with\nOn our ... our radio out [noise]\nCharlie Steiner on the call on this particular play a let's hear from\nMany Machado and we'll hear from day Roberts yeah let's go see it from a child of first on the play that happened this was back in the in the evening the the famous Machado I'd give our play\nHorse that incident at first baseman attempting what did you tell him what happened on that\nNow we're family you know having\nGrande got to go way back to health and fitness I'm On the game or a ton of coffee here we are trying to win\n... they hugged it out of the uh put\nThe brewers do not agree with that Christian yell at each\nAsked about the Machado play and he said of the incident with his ... he said quote it's a dirty play by dirty player\nThat's the quote quote from Christian yellowish dirty play by eight dirty player and that seems to be the Senate or getting some of the quotes that are coming in from the brewers clubhouse and that seems to be the consensus Craig council a began his as we have ... let's listen to counsel because I Believe he had\nThey are appointed comics ... somebody was trying to defend the Machado play by saying that he was a he was being aggressive and that's what happened but I Believe council pushed back on it let's go to the audio tape\nYou know I don't know I guess they they got tangled up the first thing\n[noise] [noise]\nSee that that I Will agree like I I Would like\nTo rent later about some other things made me much out there that are that are separate from this particular play a but here's my my ten cents on the plane I this is\nFull outrage is what it is by the Milwaukee Brewers because of the trade in line the team that was desperate to get many Machado other than the Dodgers was the Milwaukee Brewers so\nIt's nice that Craig council says he doesn't play hard and it's very nice of these other brewer players to call out Machado and\nHe's a he even in Christian yellow says he's a dirty player and all that stuff which I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing uh but you know maybe now in this you know softened up society we're in it is a bad thing but\nWe all these guys are the brewers they were this close to having Machado in their locker room as a team made and we're now supposed to believe that he's public enemy number one cause he's wearing different laundry and I hate to say this but I I guess somebody has to say it a memo to hey Seuss Aguilar at first base\nIf you don't want to get spike don't allow Machado the opportunity to spike you stop being a slug and get your foot off the bag okay\nThat's when you're the first baseman you if you leave your foot on the bag you leave the opportunity for that to happen Machado cannot do that if I get lost not lazy\nAnd I was lazy on that play and he didn't get his foot off the bat you gotta have cat like reflex is he did not have cat like reflex is bad job by you\nAnd this reaction of people is absurd\nNow but yeah I I feel that the whole slide rule silly I think that some do I think Machado place I Know I don't even try to place art do I think this was a war crime Machado did against the brewers absolutely not I think this reaction is over the top nonsense is what it is it's absolutely ridiculous\nBut it is absurd ... what are we talking about here\nIn baseball it's kinda like that whole thing I I guess the world is changing as we have to adapt\nYou know it's like when I used to watch NFL Films years ago and they would celebrate the hardest hit human torpedoes safety is that would come off and just deliver\nBone chilling hits now people wanting to their smartphones oh my God I've been triggered I Need my blank e because I saw a hit in the NFL and in baseball the equipment that anything with physical contact is a nightmare\nBaseball again they used to talk about how players would do anything to gain an edge and\nThey were you'll bend the rules and you hear some of these these stores in the olden days of baseball on guys if you didn't get your foot out a way you're gonna get spy and it was celebrated right that was the only part of the cheese ... that was in baseball and now now we have a bunch\nOf I guess but we have a bunch of people right now it's the worst implication that annoys me it's absurd\nAnd if you're one of these people with his photo outrage just like the brewer pliers and\nCraig council about many child they would love to have many shots right now if they can have many Machado they would take him on their team they wanted him they tried to get him\nCouldn't get him couldn't do it weren't good enough didn't have enough players to get him to be\nThe better our show on Fox again that took five and a half hours ahead Fifteen photo it's five and a half hours that's different day Roberts\nWho is in the awkward position of having to tap dance around all of this Year's Day Robert's on the Machado play we uh just give you my version of events here is the Dodger skipper\nI think it was one of those things where a bag he had his foot on first base and [noise] you know\nWhole lot of room on the facts either didn't see the replay so he stepped on his ... and I think that's what a man he was talking about but we all worked it out\n[laughter] [laughter] where did you go to group therapy sexy if you do\n[laughter] so we we have this weird thing going like many which I ran about this later some others but like many Machado is just lazy\nRight so on one hand he's admitted he's lazy but now he's dirty so he's like dirty lazy like aren't those two things\nOpposite I mean if you don't ya [laughter] but you're lazy how can\nYou be dirty or if your dirty how can you be lazy or you're trying to figure out [noise] you know what I'm saying I maybe I'm wrong is I I don't know maybe I'm I'm incorrect I think I'm a ... the the negative stories are he's agree I don't think he plays hard I I agree with that I and I\nI can rip Machado for that but this particular play if Aguilar gets his foot off the bag quickly you know he was a big fat told he can't get his foot off the bag if he could than many Machado cannot do that\nBut if they were gonna blame Machado but again it's a play baseball in the past\nWould be celebrate a Eddie is on a flight to Europe I Would guess at this hour he's probably somewhere over the Atlantic and uh yeah NO PLAN right now for a seven hours I think at this point\n[noise] better him to me so I have to better him than me and we have Ralph on tape or here and\nRalph when he came in and it's great when he came into tape his his work he brought a baggy with him and his baggy said Ralph's on it\nGreat what an eagle mania what kind of egomaniac comes in here with a I mean that's like a little Brian James do fact move he comes in here with a bag with his name on some believable you see that Roberta when he was in the early ...\nSome crazy I Can't believe him out of control I like my child then\nYou're ... you're the first one in you you you're in an early guy in the shadow bandwagon you bought him a ... shirt before he'd done any\nOf those the lady who's men ran with the red Sox was lazy but I tell you yeah\nI liked him because he was good for talk radio many rivers in many ways Machado has been good for us and talk radio vote Domingo several shops because Machado he gets a reaction out of people people freaked out and\nAnd on and on and goes I Will take your calls again eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox the Dodgers when the Astros a big story in the American league had been caught cheating or the floodgates have opened on that we are told the Astros had a friend of the\nOwner who was kicked out of an area at Fenway there were photos of this dirt bag and his uh his activity there and it's very early in the story but apparently a if you believe the initial reporting the athletics the Cleveland Indians in Los Angeles Dodgers all of accused the Astros of this\nActivity they were using what we believe at this point to be rhythmic clapping and a garbage can to signal\nOr to their players what's the other team was going they had they had a cheat code to the other team bunch of cheaters man it's one of the great ethical violations of our time I put it right next to the black Sox scandal\nYeah uh from back in the day when you think of the great\nScandals in sport uh all of the success the Astros have had has been wiped away or it has been\n... you were just over the top on that I Know I'm not I I feel like I remember you being one of the people anytime a story like broke about a one team accusing the other team is dealing signs you're always the one oh well that's that's gamesmanship like you you know that's part of baseball stealing signs uh yeah\nWhen you're not doing it with someone outside the dug out that's why teams used to employ all guys this goes above and beyond this is a criminal act and the Astros were caught and they're trying to spin it knowing you know smart people don't believe it dumb people believe it\nOr it's just embarrass it's a sad day for baseball and I hope that Rob Manfred will see it and it's hard to do the right yeah the way they did it\nOriginally paid two point five million dollars for this this costing eyesore which is a blight on their stadium and the owner pay two point five million for it\nAnd then my other favorite part of the story is that the Marlins announced they're moving\nThe arch does sculpture because they can't get rid of it they can't destroy because the art in public places board of Miami Dade County who knew that was the thing they had to approve this they approved the scope should be relocated outside the stadium so they can still have to have it outside the stadium so people can urinate on and I guess but\nBut the Marlins and now is that in place of the sculpture [laughter] this is great they're going to put a standing room only section\nNow what is the only team in baseball other than like the Oakland Athletics and the Tampa Bay rays that does not need a standing room only section and their stadium\nThere's no one going to Marlins games this no one's going to it and how much is this going to cost the it costs two point five million to put the the structure and was commission for two point five million\nI've got to think it's going to take at least the million dollars to a movie which means that is going to come off the Marlins payroll they're going to have to take that off the months to but Derek Jeter is making his mark the team blows either the players suck but at least they're going to have a standing room only area in the outfield\nFor the Seventeen people that watch Marlins' baseball the way to go good jobs each way to go get that right salad\n[laughter] she didn't she didn't want him to go take a bow he's like oh yeah we we listen to our fans we live of course when the fans said don't trade Christian yell at each and as John Carlos and that you know wasn't listening men but if the\nMarlene than watch an art structure relocated cheaters all years but I just don't ask them all if you don't get good players 'cause they can't do that\nDick\nPress on your knees need depending on a show on Fox later this hour we're going to have ... to the third degree also get to the land up in ... and ... will go there as watching people lined up I see these guys I Want to yap about many Machado and other things will get to all that we will

going to guess the accurate score the Dodgers game I don't know how he did that [noise]\nThe Dodgers were to one winters here Thirteen have and you\nNever can you play the one where he said the brewers won two to one could because if we can go with Ralph can you play that one yeah OK to see it that the one over here and see how that's\nWhat a night for Christian yell at you he led the brewers two or three one series lead over the\nDog she uh she went right now like Ralph comes in even in like ... different versions like yeah it's a real pain in the asked why not play the right one

run through first but you got to run through the bags yeah I mean ... yeah just sour grapes by the famous ... what did you supposed to do that was in Vegas he wasn't in Wisconsin yeah\nYou hear the stories about old school baseball player and how to use the step I you'd better get out of the way it is step on you\nImagine if they had like social media back in those ... people always been like this or is this just like a new thing is it just send you a thing I think I don't think so I mean people have always been like this but they're just exposing it more because they react immediately

that the Astros are saying well we were just trying to make sure the red Sox were the ones that weren't cheating\nYeah and even the most gullible fan boy Astros fan it doesn't necessarily believe that

Mississippi in Delaware they're all smarter than you 'cause they've already figure\nBecause we really know what this is the wouldn't Nevada does not want California to have a legalize sports betting because we said well most people don't bet on sports but a lot of people do go to Vegas from LA in particular or in northern California hit a RINO to bet on games are so they don't want to lose

little\nGame I guess games are shipped by preached to avenge allies in rapid eyes about gamesmanship I don't mind game to chip but this goes beyond that\nThis is someone outside the dog out outside the inner circle and the various dirty actor for the Astros and it's it's a shame it baseball will likely do nothing because they get a spineless commissioner but this this this deserves major punishment\nIt tarnish his everything the Astros have done it it tarnish his everything\nLook how out of work do you call the evidence you found the guy on the stand out during the game oh my God what evidence okay\nHow about ... ... that's a nice way to the soften it how 'bout\nThree of thirty ... well the well this kind of the Astros because they're one of the themes guilty but three of the other twenty nine teams have now accused the Astros have this egregious activity and you have a ... a non credential personnel who was not supposed to be in an area which I Believe is trespassing where this guy was\nAnd he got caught and kept doing it\nIt it's like it's one thing if you use that you saw he got he did at one time but according to the stories that are out there right now we're hearing is the Astros get ... on this and\nThey went back in didn't it multiple times\nYou know you know northern aggravation because it was\nOne of the world ... then they don't want it to happen again or should we should believe this is a a a southern versus northern battle is that what this is\nWell yeah last year last year when the Yankees and and and and went on and and one of the world yeah they
