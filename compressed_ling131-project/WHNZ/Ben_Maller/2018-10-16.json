or\nIf he was playing gold glove defense and wasn't hitting you say you know what I can deal with that because at least he's doing half of his job he's doing nothing\nI should I have a feeling at this point grand don't forget to put the toothpaste on the uh the the two out of the two and when he when he brushed his teeth there he's he's brushing your teeth without the toothpaste\nHe's got the toothbrush but no toothpaste on forgetting everyday\nRidiculous now the second thing\nI mean ... on Fox Sports radio the Dodgers would\nHave better luck if they put a trash can behind home plate and had the pitchers so into the trash can there would be less pass balls if that happens [laughter]\nThat would be a more efficient use of team resources then putting grand all behind the plate\nHe makes me want to ... watching him play catch your at this point is an eyesore he must be corrected it has to be corrected and the fact that Austin Barnes who is a marginal player in his own right let's not get carried away\nBy Austin bonds is nothing to get excited about and post on this ramp however as long as you just merely catches the ball\nHe will be a dramatic improvement over grand dog and as long as he doesn't strike out every other at bat he will be an offensive improvement over grand all behind the plate\nAnd if the Dodgers do not have the balls to remove ... from the roster they should at least force him to get him Roy DHS from sitting on the bench and watching Austin Barnes play\nI only in an emergency situation should grand all be removed from the bench and we have seen is if you're an old timer you remember some of the history of baseball and the ... players that have had they call the gifts but typically it involves throwing not just catch it\n[laughter] this is bizarre I I don't recall this\nI I Know I I'm I'm getting up there I guess I remember Rick and kill could suddenly the pitcher for the cars could no longer pitch he had to become an outfielder Chuck ... case with the Yankees where he couldn't throw a Mackey ... the most famous catcher\nIncident but he couldn't his problems he couldn't throw the ball back to the mound he had this weird kind of hip hop in his guinea up\nBut I don't ever recall maybe yeah there there have been a case of a guy just can't catch\n... that he hates the name of the physician is catcher and he's having problems catching now what do you do he should\nBe banished from the roster and if not just don't play that's the grownup thing to do that to the final word here the Dodgers are the more talented the\nBut that alone is not going to win the brewers are are a feisty bunch and the Dodgers have to get the old smelling salts going here and we'll see I I did as I say I pick the Dodgers in six and he's you know I'm a distant relative of the great Nostradamus we go way back to my DNA uh and so I'm sticking with the Dodgers in six\nEdge but should they continue this the collapse\nThen heads will will roll of the the Milwaukee Brewers play a side show freak show style baseball\nThey have bullpen neurosis they suffer from and it's a good bolted but you did the pope is not supposed to be something you look forward to going to you should only do that when the starting pitcher failed on this particular game should've seen by brewer standards pitched a complete game 'cause he went five and a third any\nMy my

pay any attention to I Will pay you will not watch it at all [noise]\nNow did the Dodgers not get the memo that the great bend our was in attendance at Chavez Ravine I Know a rare appearance I was told by some prominent then they would leave me they were so nervous that's why they couldn't perform I was told by was\nIn the media that I Am now become everything I hate that I only show up the big games that I Am and the leaders that only show up the playoff games\nWhen you're as big as bad mouthing really how it has to be you can't just show up for any Thursday night game it's about you know\nMy position is I pay my dues I spend a lot of years out there already watching crappy baseball and it was like a throwback watching crappy baseball baseball today at a playoff game right ... yes yes that's got to have a ...\nSo I better days ahead any that the\n... grand all will not see the field again\nWe will taint him to the bench and we're going to go get a genius yes yes I Am up seasonal beyond the face and ah it'll be all in fun\nLike some of those all the way through and a lot of things back before we couldn't and now you can't ... no ... yeah yeah the hot with thing and you know now that is bowling but back in the old days it was just you know fun\nThey just called it fun now they call it come to me how that works you know what that is crazy it's going to shift life really comes as you fasted changes he doesn't it sure does your does yeah\nI'll take your calls a lot to talk about here obviously I was focused on the baseball game but I did have any I did have the Packer forty niners game up that's on my list yeah I think that was going to be a good game\nIt wasn't supposed to be you know I did take the niners I was very happy that the United has come in\nAnd they they actually for for thirty minutes of that came out played the Green Bay Packers\nFor the middle part of that game forty niners are the better team at ... field yes\nAre real quick and we know the Packers are the team in the state of Wisconsin the great state of Wisconsin yeah ... but you know the brewers are also involved there where do you think the attention of the ... of Wisconsin aisles were focused actors\nWho I saw guys at the dye Dodger Stadium where Packard year I saw as\nMuch Packard years I said brewer gear all decked out in their Aaron Rodgers jerseys and she said no\nNo I wasn't looking I was I had my thing I don't set up man I had like I was watching the Dodgers game but I had the NFL game on my laptop I had a whole lot of stuff going on I understand it's multi task you\nKnow when I go to the game today I Will be there a rubber tomorrow's well Roberta will be hanging out tomorrow I mean you know the better when are you going to win no problem occurs within being more pain for the for the cheese heads the cheese curds will be bad in Milwaukee are\nJust gonna win in Milwaukee great yeah I mean wonderful on a snowy day in Milwaukee\nI ate seven seven Ninety nine on Fox and a number eight seven seven nine nine six six thirty six and I were going\nThrough our Fox Sports radio and on Twitter at ...\nWhole lot chutzpah and a whole lot of explaining to do we'll get to that and we will do it next\nNow the\nThe\nFor teams to modify the em out the\nSports radio\nBut now they're here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like then you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we use another fact\nThen ... what did they knew either way off I don't care about he didn't recognize you and and by the way there is there an expiration date on you catch a certain number of games you explode in the playoffs that\n[noise] ... well you don't want to get behind home quite a lot a lot of baseball\nIn that time I Wish I Wish I had to you as a parent time when I made the right now I Know it's wonderful you like the greatest paradox [laughter] he's a terrible he did a terrible thing but I'm Wondering why terrible thing I got to the swarm I mean my goodness\nOkay the people I think we should be really really upset with\nAll that far off his ... for not but we need to buy in situations where we got there on on forty second we're second and third where we can work and and specially while they're playing in the show they're giving us a pay\nWhat listen to all don't do as life upon a time if you watch do you watch the Dodgers all your how often did\nThey button and you can count you know you can count on one hand the times they bought it I there's a there's a real time there's a reason they don't but but that's why they don't\nWant to you and I were to one of my favorite stories I've told this before but many years ago and I was covering the angels and Terry ... was the manager and this is a long time ago 'cause he's man is like a bunch of teams that but I asked a week we asked her why he didn't want\nA and he proceeded to go down the angels line up and explain how this guy does not want that but it was hilarious if it was it was just wonderful yeah nobody knows how to find any more that's and that's they they don't need\nMore Maury Wills bunches of grand morning well she was one of the greatest wonders of all time but what they're giving him if they're in a shift and they're giving you for that\nI Know and you know what I Want to they don't want to tell you\nThat they're telling you they ... they ... they love you don't watch but when it comes to body at all you have to do is just lay that but\nThere's nobody in that area it's it's an interesting I think\nIf you have to wait a minute if you hit the ball the ... billion that's better than a book though that's the that's their argument I tell you I got to go with\nSomething you can call anytime you're free will not use that gays are it's a defense although I've got to a lot of votes but we get to that it's on my list will get there and more your phone calls years we yeah the night away burning\nThe midnight oil cannot quite them into us it depends where you are\nOn the west coast is not quite ... but for everybody else has to be way after ... way way past we get to all that and\nThe most punishable face in baseball so I'm On my list is well we'll do all\nThat right now though any Garcia from the guy ... studios is going to make this really quick because you've got one foot out the\nDoor and he goes to see if we start with postseason baseball game three National League championship series and the brewers shut off the Dodgers in LA for nothing Ryan Braun and R B I double in the first\nWhile pitch school he was signing rounds and she has been a cheater before yes in Orlando are Shia with its run home or not I haven't been there is all plenty of run support for joining these just seen with five and a bird no runs three it's meant for relievers when three two thirds endings which are not baseball long just two heads\nLA do load the bases them and I would run does your struck out against Jeremy Jeffries typical Minnesota the tying run the place that all clean humor took the last run away\nAnd Milwaukee now leads the best of seven series two games to one game for coming up on Tuesday in LA nine eastern on up as one of the there'd be square and Monday Night football the Packers had a rally in the fourth quarter to beat the forty nine or ... thirty the final Mason Crosby was\nHorrific last week for for for on field goals including a twenty seven years of his time expired I could have made a twenty seven you're probably not I would have Aaron Rodgers to touch them has to develop the Adams in the wings ... enough three two and one with a victory\nAnd San Francisco dropping to one and find an area code somewhere in the last he might be it might as well that's actually from the Sesame Street has three two one [noise]\nThis report brought to you about your car my car shopping can be confusing but not any more with the price of fuel car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next car so\nIt's a true crime to join more confidence car buying an experience been sad news is Paul Allen the owner of the Seattle Seahawks and for all your ... your way at the age of sixty five due to complications from non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nOne of those stories I was talking to somebody ah my buddy that civil about this we're like you know you have all the money in the world\nJust assume if you're a poor person you assume if you're rich person you get cancer\nYou have enough money that you can you can beat him or he had the best or yeah it'll yeah to rely on\nThe Microsoft cofounder had on this Iraq since Ninety seven of course he was ordered the team when they when they're only Super Bowl title and on the trail blazers ... eat eat also was the co owner of the Seattle ... you know major league soccer so obviously a big presence in the sports world in the Pacific northwest\nAgain Paul Allen passing away at the age of sixty five yeah\nAll right ah condos is there it is the Ben Matlock show on Fox we continue on from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance just visit Geico dot com free free\nRape quote\nSo you have to do so let's go to the audio tape that we have this ... Hernandez soundbite I think we is that the one we have there are no do we we have that's the one right we don't we have that\nThat's not ... oh 'cause that's his real name is in ... right that they call them ... I'm not a Dodger fan but I don't know these things All right ah [laughter] about this is\nThis I Believe this is the soundbite that is going to make she gave her name is public enemy number one guaranteed to get booze or for the rest of the post season here here's what he had to say following a lifeless ... list performance ... by the Dodgers\n... you've got to want it and today was is this was in our day we had no energy stadium and no energy defense in order to do so overall is a pretty big game for\nEverybody that call themselves Dodgers\n[laughter]\nOn a huge man or are they supposed to cheer for every time you struck out with the runners in scoring position that guys talk he made his breaking batting average yeah hey man are bitch in in ... total climate show when he went in to pitch their in Philadelphia and uh yeah so\n... maybe ... ... what was the follow up question like what were the fans supposed to do when the Dodgers were motionless on the field where they support what we're supposed to do that\nOh what did you want to see somebody run on the field maybe the yeah that would show normal life and the Dodger players showed on the field\nBut that is the car do send though we're kicking your name is dead is he did the thing you cannot do you can rip your teammates you\nCan rip the media you can rip management you can rip ownership but the one thing you cannot do\nIs a tack to feign attacked the fed especially that you think about that this start time\nUh in in LA people had to leave most people I think have normal jobs not like know overnight radio gas bags\nAnd they have to like leave their jobs\nCome up with some kind of excuse and then deal with the worst traffic in the world in Los Angeles at least in America\nAnd get that to Dodger Stadium and people did that and the stadium was almost all the way forward started the game and yet he has the votes kick in and it's again this is kicking\nIn is after the Dodgers plenty boring monotonous game a spirit list baseball a runner leadership and this is what he says\n... you got one today was it was in our day we had no energy stadium had no energy the fence and honored overrode the predominantly for everybody that call themselves Dodgers\nYeah except nobody in the crowd struck out with runners in school he position not a single praying go no man woman or child and the crowd struck out with a runner's Lewis is used for having no energy\nHe says bad that's ... it's just bad bad bad bad bad bad bad I had been out of the show\nOn Fox just keep it going to go to Adam who is in Southern California on Fox Sports radio hello Adam you're on Fox\nOh yeah I bet uh regarding your ground I think you hit the nail on the head you make it so many good points aside from the fact that he didn't do it number one and number two on the field is number three is all over the field\nAnd so I just don't understand I thought for sure when the bases recused from the Knight penchant for him I mean obviously not handling high pressure situation whatsoever\nAnd I think Robert ... single handedly I mean\nYou know what like what about other than what the part okay you know yeah we're not time to change your identity and do that but you know it's kinda like in basketball when somebody wants to when they're not ... shot and you know you gotta you gotta get get gotta get free throw line this fall and then the other thing happened\nLet's get one run on the board let's get a lot of fun let's do something different and you know what if we would miss the square once or twice but what's the name of the famous Willie strike out anyway I mean\nIt's so ridiculous to watch but I think they're going to come back up\nBut I Do agree with your money out of right All right\nAll right I think you add them yeah I think the word you're looking for is multi faceted you have to be able to do more than just one thing and if you only do one thing and then you don't do that one thing or then you look terrible but to be you know be perfectly honest the Dodgers had punted in it didn't work you would have been why were you doing this\nFrom Nathan ... or just your actual Nathan ... should us the obvious answer Conor McGregor from Frank in LA Harry Carey from car parking Kyle in Kansas City Mr wonderful going was sitting bull\nIs his answer who else do we have page down ... higher from Rob in Minnesota\n... going with Ben Roethlisberger Eric ... from the cowboy killer who else do we have your Paige and Paige that Andrew Luck from Andrew the devil from trucker Joe that's his answer no way no patch termer from Ed in Spokane\nAny do you have an answer yes the answer is John struck Don struck a find find gas incorrect do [noise]\nAnd Matthew has a mad and receive that has Blake ... milkman Mike you went with a travel agent you know the correct answer none other than Josh Rosen of the cardinals his pastor raining on\nTwenty five points by which is a good scoring average in the

that way so um you know I I think what I needed to get in line up\nAnd that ... that I don't even let it happen I think I thought that the ...\nAnd ...\nAnd all that can't get any more ... oh yeah I think that like I I\nDidn't like that it's bad enough but at the ... the ... the problem is that the Dodgers are trying to their reactive to what the brewers are doing rather than just leaving their guy then they'd been maybe there's more and the games in Milwaukee but the brewers use these open games and so the Dodgers end up they start their ... and they bring in the they bring in the starters in so there I\nDon't understand why you get a guy like why am I going to make it out even want to get out you know you are you at one over the fence\nAnd you don't even give them all the time I mean I

interceptions in those two corps\nOr in the first in fourth quarter as he was the Mona Lisa ...\nHe had three hundred and Fifteen yards passing in the first in fourth quarter combined the average ten point eight yards for play but in those middle two quarters it was a protest or in six point for yards per ... so that's the point like the middle part of this game was controlled by the forty niners defense they out scored\nThe Packers Thirteen to safe now for a play the whole game Mallory you idiot I understand\nIt just really observing what I was a witness to watching this particular game that'll last word on this the Packers are now on the by week which means they tropical vacation and they have a gargantuan\nMatch you up in ... against the team that the team the only team in the NFL I ask you a question do you know the answer the only team in the national football league that has yet and you name the team that has yet to lose a game and the ... of the raiders\nNah it's incorrect you can ram and all day and\nYou can write out all ...\n... thank you very much\nAnd that's at the coliseum pit of wipers their\nLos Angeles no chance Green Bay will lose that game that's a loss loss loss loss loss loss for the Green Bay Packers\nThey're not on the same level the rams and I'm the same level as soon as you look at the NFC that I have Green Bay on my second line not my first line I don't have Green Bay on my first line I have the Packers as a second\nTier contender in the NFC\nThey got some work to do work to do how 'bout you oh void a a you know in other states bomb like this just gives you happen to win this ... this and you avoid the demoralizing loss does not mean that you should celebrate with cake and blue\nAnd for the forty niners your CJ Bedford\nI guess who better

has to be addressed\nBut he he's God compared to ... and Peter ...\nKids playing ... football that are better than if a bitter but at least there's something to work with with CJ battered nuts at the niners are going to be in any more than a top ten pick team in the NFL that's already been\nWell it's pretty much been cemented at this point the niners play the rams the rams are eight ten and a half point favorite in that game and that's another game as you look at\nThat game you say well divisional game I haven't even handicap the game but I Would lean toward staking the niners plus the pen and a half\nThe rams the last couple of weeks if not covered as road favorites that's their third road game and early didn't cover in Seattle they didn't cover in Denver they won both those games that appears to be another game where the niners will be able to hang around on a short weak and they'll lose their one in five now there'll be one in\nSix after that so but then again maybe he's a poor man's she get Beth there's like a a a poor man's or he can be a poor man's Amish wife I that's why you can be a backup as\n[laughter] as a backup quarterback in the NFL you can have a long gory as

AOL [noise] download it now [noise]\nAnd may weather just kind of being there you know it's kind of laughing and you can play all and that's it being the he'll be in the back\nSo the odds are extremely small his fight ever happens Habib would never stand a chance in a boxing match but he's not box and you will not go toe to toe with Floyd Mayweather in fact\nIt's fair to say that Habib if he went against McGregor couldn't go toe to toe against Conor McGregor\nIf you take away the submission hold what does a beep have no I'm not an M M A fan\nI happened to watch the the B. McGregor fight\nIt was at a party it was on there and it was pretty much a Habib taking McGregor and holding him and that's all I really remember I don't remember much else other than that that's submission hole without that\nWould have been able to win if it was just a you have to fight each other with your hands and all that I always\nEnd McGregor he he I still can miss it ultimately what's going to happen is team McGregor is going to end up circling back around and fight may whether again I maintain that now the story has changed the fact that\nMcGregor last year and the ... value go down shirt goes down a little bit so it's changed the narrative is changed but ultimately if may weather's going to go back into a fight and em eh main guy he's going to go fight McGregor because there's more money\nIn it then how beep just the reality\nAnd again this will be a bigger share of it happened it would be a bigger sham a Habib against McGregor then may weather versus um McGregor I Would just give me a little chance of it I mean now the\nThe last particular point now Mayweather is trying again you should get a fight you know work out big paid I and he also wants to do the least amount of work\nHe wants to share things you fight a washed up many pack yeah you know you're going to get a lot of ... to pay for the fight you know when the fight no concern there McGregor knows that he can get another big payday he's got this deal with in a way but if he wants another massive pay day you've got to go to may what\nRight McGregor may wit and may whether I how would he became as there's only one way that may weather can be convinced the fight hobby you know what it is ... and has to enter into this he's\nGot a lot of buddies who are Russian oligarchs 'cause he's a Russian oligarch and if ... ... ... there's so much money in in mother Russia and if who can get these people together\nAnd they throw up enough gold bars at Floyd Mayweather me why they would fight in Moscow he doesn't care uh you know he'll go to Moscow and fight if there's enough gold bars on the table and it doesn't matter at that point\nWhether or not he horns ... people to pay for the fight if there's bankrolling sugar daddies\nThat bank roll to fight the Russian oligarchs who step in\nBut any fight between a professional boxer and an amateur UFC fighter who's not a train boxer is going to be a cat and mouse did you wish it would be the same thing and I give them they were the credit\nBecause may weather pulled off the top right to come on and that fight against macgregor was hey let me just stand there and let\nMcGregor do whatever he wants for the first four or five rounds and then after that I'll Fox and the fight will be over and that'll be that it's actually what at the same thing would happen if he\nBought a beep and same suckers that thought macgregor was going to beat\nMayweather will think that ... going to be ... you may weather and that is in the beach kissing [noise] so then our show on Fox we say hello to eight men down\nTo their feet out the\nDoor and the cheesecake and his belly Garcia over there now that you you know we don't give a shout out so I'm
