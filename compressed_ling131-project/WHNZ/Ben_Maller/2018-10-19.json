works for the charges but they're all going this game chargers open\nA a seven point favorite they're currently favored by six and a half the public loves the boats they're all about the boats because of their domination of Cleveland last week I'm going to go the other way to me there's value with the titans and I'm gonna take the Tennessee Titans getting six and a half\nThere's a lot of ... number one around tendency Marquez Mario to was sacked more times than he completed passes last week this is a big spot again this is one of those points in the season where are you going to get things back

Tennessee the charges are a better team but I don't think there are six and a half points better\nThan the Tennessee Titans over the last three weeks Tennessee has had pretty good the last three weeks affected night's best in the NFL they've got a better defensive stat sheet than the patriots and the bears their issues are off and\nI'll take the titans to figure it out a couple of interceptions by

primetime game but it's a big spot would've been a bigger spotted the bears hadn't dropped the Deuce in the woods in Miami last week Chicago is three and two patriots opened a two and a half point wrote favorite their favorite by three right now\nA slight lean not an overwhelming lean to the patriots over about sixty percent little over that\nThe money on the side of New England I liked the bears I don't love them but I Want to take the bears this week and I tell you what [noise]\nThis is a let down spot you look for the mental age you can get the patriots coming off a big primetime when shutting up Patrick my homes and the chiefs last week in Fox bro vela check it doesn't always get it right it doesn't mean the page is not going to win but that doesn't that also means the psychological part\nYou're talking about a sluggish start to the game which is going to give the bears some footing in this spot I also am not convinced the patriots can bring it on the road there owing to\nTo dismal performances on the road early in the season to Jacksonville and the lies that is true the patriots did not have Edelman did not have Josh board and in those games those guys will be playing\nThis weekend but I I'm gonna take Chicago ah ... mainly because of the the boomerang effect they were looking ahead if you're looking ahead if you get caught looking ahead and you lose to a backup ... you then have to come back and play much better the following week\nAnd the patriots have only a for Thirteen winning percentage against the spread as a road favorites is twenty Thirteen generally there's value in home dogs\nEven small home dogs patriots thirty one\nBears thirty [noise] and the effects from\nRyan patriots than if they don't show the penny does 'cause he's a [noise] a

cold [noise] you know a real quick Detroit two and three at Miami it's on Fox my man Dick Stockton has because it'll probably be the lions versus the Miami Heat ... that's a cheap shot\nI like to start to dig stocked in March labor in the Fox box that rocks lions hope for they opened up a four point dog Miami was favored by for now the lions are two and a half point favorite what happened\nQuarterback change that's what happened here the public loves the lions all about that action boss over Ninety percent of the money on the on the side of Detroit\nAnd against my better judgment here I'm also on the side of the ...

NBA including LeBron James making his Lakers debut end up losing at Portland TrailBlazers you can't lose his LeBron James he's on the Lakers game\nMan he learned a lot I thought the Lakers are going to eighty to know what happened a reality set it off that she had to play yep him he went out to Portland Windsor one twenty eight one Nineteen Philadelphia you're a lockout guy wheels doing is he okay I didn't hear him on the broadcast zero [noise]\nI was listening to the rate the blazers radio [noise] I didn't hear wheels the okay I was none of them you know I was I Will look into that I

ripped city a radio there in Portland I'd anyway here's the the question we get back to bury versus depending name the quarterback that has completed just thirty seven point eight percent of his passes and the red zone the lowest rate for all of the quarterback with twenty or more red zone at times\nSo far this season that is the question what is the answer\nQueen Roxanne thanks to that Rousseff talk when rocks in that case Keenan misspelled by queen rocks in Dakota Prescott tossed out by von\nEliza manning from Rob the ambassador of Bakersfield Maddie ice yes by Chris the Duke fan Brady Quinn from the rooster Matthew got this right clearly cheating budget but you have to do and Brian did to cheaters Charlie went with Blake board does is his answer\nPage down ... do you have an answer Rob I got to get back to these games that'd be guy Benjamin them\nNo I think [noise] the correct answer a man who called me a clown to Sean Watson overused in Texas\nLet's get back to it\nThe Houston Texans speaking of those taxes at three in three and Jacksonville also three and three it's an app see south bloodbath an old fashioned donnybrook\nAnd jak to open up a four point favorite the jacks favorite by five the money on this game is pretty even [noise]\nNot a big shift on either side I'm going to take Jacksonville as a five point favorite at at first glance it looks absurd the way the Jackson played the last couple of weeks how can they possibly be favored by five against anybody\nBut upon further review it makes sense Jacksonville defense is going to abuse the Sean Watson's fragile body\nThis is a get back on track situation for Jacksonville I'll even watch and finish the game he's likely going to end up in that injury ten\nNow during this game and the Texas as we pointed out or the trust fund babies of the NFL they have been gifted all three of their wins by negligence from Frank\nRight Jason Garrett and Nathan Peter I'm In line them up and knock them down that's humiliating now does Blake portals give this game away also I said no\nMorals is sucked on the road he's thirty fourth ranked thirty fourth quarter back riding on the road however [noise]\nHe's ranked thirteenth at home he's put his best football with that swimming pool in the end zone so I Will take [noise] the jags and write that defense Jacksonville\nTwenty eight the Texans Thirteen

only reason to watch this game it's on Fox that's the only reason to watch\nSam Rosen will be polishing church Enron they borrowed putting lipstick on pigs\nAnd this particular game the bucks opened up a three point favorites and they're still favored by three of the public does like Tampa turning on the Cleveland Browns but I Am not [noise]\nI'm not take the browns in this case first of all there's no way I can bet on the bucks to cover against anyone when they have the NFL's worst events so so bad they sacrificed their defensive coordinator human sacrifice Mike Smith guns though he was a scapegoat [noise] let's see how this plays out\nIt's going to be the placebo effect\nI don't buy the bucks up bad players they also had bad coaching\nThe bucks last in the NFL just about every defensive category across the board they leave the NFL in a few offensive categories but they're defensive categories are atrocious I also don't trust him is Winston\nSecondly Baker may feel has looked like an eyesore in recent weeks in fact the last two games he's thirty is in the NFL he's ranked thirty the NFL\nTeams have started to figure out his weaknesses now fortunately the buccaneers\nAren't good enough to take advantage of those weaknesses they they very rarely tackle anyone and when they do they generally have bad\n[noise] [noise] less than that so [noise]\n[noise] I
