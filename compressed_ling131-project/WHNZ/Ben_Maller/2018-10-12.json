{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Not being competitive at scoring Thirteen points in the game 'cause that's what happened tonight when Barclay went for two hundred yards this is why when you pick number two if a franchise running back is there but a franchise quarterback is there you go for the quarterback that's just what it is it's not about sake one Barclay being terrible it's about\nHe's a running back and you need a quarterback and the giants needed to make a bold decision a strong one but it's dead ownership said yeah I Know we agree they were good whether you like oh you're going to set that franchise back\nBut you know the push the button by injecting him off is\nLong streak of game started playing Gino Smith show and you were turning the page and then you didn't get got pulled over and they wait I missed that last paragraph let me read that again so let me get one more shot\nLike people will do tomorrow the New York post is out battle body yeah headline little giant ah that's a wrap our AP big blue season over as old Eli big Bob obey Jay come up I any\nYeah that's a it's gonna be great to and then there's a instead of a giant I'm a big giants fan and then a little\nKid got mocking him wearing a ...\nIt's a great day to be a jets fan that's so exciting feeling pretty good about yourself or now let's hear from a testy patch ... talking to the media following the giants defeating which well he's not happy being questioned about the effort you lie back and leaving at half time all of it\nBut didn't keep them off the board or we didn't do anything well enough to win so [noise] we go back to the drawing where we would go to work tomorrow try to clean it up and then um\nGet ready for next one so that's the reality of it and um we got on it and move on some of\nAbsolutely everybody fought we got beat by good teams Vince ... points they scored way more than us [noise]\nWrong with the effort they fight they fought hard\nAt times you know there there are good front for and we knew going into it that you know you always have to bet that's where that's where their defense is the strongest and at times they did do a good job against the\nI'm sure the cameras could've caught me upset a bunch of times so\nI don't know what you're referring to but um\nYeah there were many moments just cannot I was upset [noise]\nI'm not concerned about eleven [noise] like I said none of us did anything good enough to win tonight [noise]\nWhile they did a good job of staying on the field that there weren't a whole lot of big plays a aside from the one we're an again Carson once as a good job off schedule it hit the ball\nA converted on third downs right who were the mine for sixteen on third down so when you when you're that good on third down and you can stay on the field then you get yourself a chance [noise]\nThey were ... they were cloud known do so and that's why we we did get a couple of big plays away from him and he did get such as I realize some of it was at the end but he got a couple of touches\nWhile we were able to do is get the ball Barclay throughout the game he was productive\nI just told the team I told you guys we didn't do anything well enough more to come and tomorrow and work on fixing it I just said I'm not worried about their effort I'm I'm worried that didn't he asked me about effort and then I said\nI wasn't concerned about their effort right they were going in one concerned about their effort I'm concerned about how we executed and how we didn't get in the end zone and how we let them in the end zone again tonight we didn't do anything well enough to when we lost\nWe lost last week to write [noise]\nAnd you know it doesn't really matter when you lose you lose friends\nI thought you said I'm alright spider I tell you I said that and I pointed to you and you said that and I said that yeah a little testy well it'll set I don't\nQuestion my teams fight he was ready to throw down there well you know the reporters here let me get mad at you instead of actually answering the questions with any level of honesty DUI manning dismissive yeah I'm not worried about\nHim and and I know it you know some people want to defend patch armor and say well this you know in private it's different no no no very publicly he said we didn't do anything right I'm not worried about like what the rest of the team does he lies terrible and they're like can they trust what he says you have to get buy in from players you get your hair that they hear that and they go\nOh I I Can't put any stock in what coach says and they tune out and that's the worst thing you get players tuned out you'll need a new job right now we\nGo there and you're already made it look to divide was already there we already recognized this was\nBuild it up and we talked to Jason luck and for you and I have talked about this quite a bit it was going back to the pre season build a bunch of component march see if you can't get one last run out of ... maybe the eagles have a suitable hang over Dallas had no discernible wide receiver help\nAnd then you look at Washington they bring in Alex Schmidt you got a lot of questions you're trying to turn back time with Adrian Peterson you've got wide receivers\nThat you don't necessarily trust so theory if things break right and why is competent\nAnd the defenses marginally marginally what they were put up as advertised you might be able to win this division instead you're floundering at one in five and you're trying to tell a years all the parts where we failed except for that guy is good bart Simpson as the quarterback\nOr the Simpson these terrible and he looked at me\n[noise] meanwhile why didn't own back um junior had bought an electrical fan this was after he walked off the field before half time because you know it's all about oh dealt a let's hear him explain why he's gone from a kicking that to an electrical fan\n... just trying to get myself going for like some of those players right after I was you must have goal was to some of my best stuff so I was just trying to get myself up I did that and it helped me you know there was a lot of things going on there that had me fired open to bring out the energy out on the way around it but but the muscles and worked\nWatch out electrical fan he's coming your way again\nForget about that not it worked it worked for he's going to pound is that against you sometime soon what's he escalates you the next I [noise] oh what other implements of destruction of science down the concussion sent

I Know how to type ... learning the cubs yeah scout honor damn white ... first of all owned by muse my theory on this guy the giants are hiring me as a PR guy I Know the perfect Smith\nThey don't even know how to spin this I Know how to ... I'm I Am DJ spin master is what I can\nTell you something just a hired I\nI could be the PR guy for big ... here's my theory on this here's how the giants should pitch it ... back to them was being a leader that\nTemper tantrum on the sideline was leadership why the giants were getting crushed Eli Manning was playing like dog food and not not name brand dog food generic dog food like horrific\nSo Beckham said you know what I'm a leader I'm going to lead the giants in song and dance is what I'm going to do dance dance dance that's what he did that and by dancing he deflected some\nOf the finger pointing away from ... he worked as a human she instead of the headlines being all about you lie no no no it's about\nOld L A Kevin splitting hotel sideline routine and the Korea graphics on that uh back to them is the walking talking sideshow he's like if you go to the ... the boardwalk or\nThe county fair during the summertime you see they have the fire eater the human blockade you know things like that the sword swallowing he's like that he's like a side shows it's amusing\n[laughter]\nAnd this is the new generation I'm so excited to see what's next you know I remember the old guys T o and shadow chose cinco and Randy Moss that generation and now we've got this generation it's only going to get better it's only getting better now secondly some oil back um fan boys\nAre are saying that he was simply trying to get hype that's all he was heard vacuum reference that a little bit there's nothing to see here or ... you can spend it that you were trying to get high but the reality is this was frustration mixed with the election and the need for attention now this is that if I'm not the giant PR guy I Would say oh back to them is\nA show pony is what he is now it's not bad to be a show pony he stylish that style works Madison Avenue loves me love him he's very stylish very flamboyant bowed out back up he has a need\nFor performance he does he needs the limelight he's got it in fact I was always aware at any moment\nIt it's kind of like when you go into a shady part of town they put up those cameras to keep an eye on crime there's always a camera on back and when he's on the field there's always a camera and he knew exactly what he was doing this is not something that no one will be paying attention I could just go over a box\nI I can I can walk to the giant fan or no no he exactly it was doing he was frustrated the team is pure\nSequestering Barclay was doing well starting to see some of his thunder Barclay had a statistically Dominic game much of it in garb buys time where you at a hundred and thirty yards on the ground in Ninety nine yards\nReceiving end so O L realizing hey I'm handicap here\nUh you know he's he's playing football with one arm tied behind his back and blindfolded with Eli Manning\nUh who should be playing shuffle board rather than football but continues to play football for the giants Beckham average seven point three yards perception that is the lowest he's ever had in a game and his co reader\nIn his career the worst he's ever played a ... and we'll have more on ... in the future a mallard monologue download a but it's about back right it's all about the soap opera\nAnd oh del ... just hovers around and it it's it's great for talk radio uh we need more of these self absorbed overly dramatic ah performances and athletes so we get a lot of them we do\nBut this idea of the giants have always been well kind of a blue collar team and do your work the giants that mentality of giants football\nAnd ... back to them is about as far away from blue collar\nAs you could ... he can't even get within like three miles above factory you'll get he'll get like a deal with so many denied the\nProvides great content though so I ... you know ten years in the NFL now the final word I was real quick the giants are in the audio back in business for the long game not the short game\nContracts and then they can always be traded in and we can move contract but he just side and that comes to headliner in New York the giants invested in Ninety five minute not all guaranteed but Ninety five million\nAnd the chances of backing them being traded\nNot that great even with this the jets are bad but they're not that bad where they're going to unload everybody I'd say plus four hundred of the fair Raj which is around a twenty percent chance so\nThe percent chance ... he's the brightest star the big apple and that matters you think of New York sports the New York sports scene and Aaron Judge who's making his mark with the Yankees but he's not as big a star and soda back in and they don't even ... joined up sucked\nThey've been terrible and it doesn't matter it's in well the giants their past twenty two games or foreign Eighteen they're ... they're the Cleveland Browns not in Cleveland Brown uniforms is essentially what they are\n[noise] [noise] so what happened [laughter]\nNow Beck and will continue always gonna hobnobbing this more hobnobbing with the Manhattan elite he'll do that and the giant inner circle circle the wagons and they'll find them again and they'll complain and then they'll have to bite your tongue after that and\nIt's not like you weren't weren't warned\nYou didn't have to be a distant relative of the great know Saddam has like myself to for shadow that the quarterback sucks and and you will ward and you're just you're such a a contrarian you're so stubborn\nEddie yeah I'm a ... I ... I Know the your eyes your fire that have nothing to do with this is your fault\nIs that that must be a misprint can you call management coup and wake them up and that can't be right candidate\nI thought I thought that there was a that he was occupied I mean I don't even\nWe have a triple shot racket Ralph next week a triple shot him I get really good ... yeah yeah\n[noise] man\nCan we put like a wall on the door so he can't come in during the break can we do that\nI don't think those doors have locks on them and for [laughter] you know teachers so [laughter] crap man can I can I Do the show from the studios [noise]\nKnow Eddie and we we we worked together a long time and he this is not you don't do me like this and you know my\nI have no control over that whatsoever\nAnd he's the only guy or not ... but but the ... the only guy I've ever worked with when I asked me do you have an answer but the way might get nope [laughter]\nWhich like they have a talk with him about that 'cause he he does come in a following me sometimes I could talk or give them a while\nYou just like talk to me before the show during the show I'm not used to that these things I'm not used\nI used to

back in the day old stories about Jim Rome when he did a local show in San Diego\nAnd Ralph always has a story about his days in Orlando is the program director of a radio station or Leno emails me

I don't trust them simple as that falcons thirty one box twenty seven Atlanta gets the\nYet another disagreement with the bucks All right we disagree disagree\nDisagree next up Seattle at London against the London or leaders ah yeah well the games in London Seattle\nAt open so Oakland home games in London it's on Fox you better watch part of the Fox sports radio alumni association which grow

raiders I don't love the raiders when I picked the raiders here and I'll tell you why to me these teams are pretty even you're getting a few points the pretty it's a neutral site game the raiders have been horrific up with it but you know if ten yards per pass attempt the past three games [noise]\nThat can't keep going on can I add some point the by blind luck the raiders are going to slow that down Derek ... leads the NFL would eat interceptions uh in everything that could go wrong has gone wrong so why my mom went on the raiders well trip to Heathrow Airport\nBy that'll slow things down [noise] maybe the Seahawks will have some bad fishing ships or something like that in London and the\nFood poisoning but the key to this is egging when everyone else bags and so I'm not so long that Seattle team oh they played the ram stuff they last\nNight they lost I'm not impressed by that they lost the losers [noise] Russell Wilson can put up stats and all that but [noise] I think the raiders

saw the game was a tennis believe it's still on the board to Sean watching\nBanged up can't believe we'd be heard expected to play buffalo is the pick and the game was off the border to begin with so we don't have the numbers on who people are betting on I assume they're betting on Houston but to me the the Texans are not even as good as the record they've been given to gifts\nFrank right deciding the cultural rather losing tie in a game a couple of weeks ago last week Jason Garrett with the top running back and football and in the lead off into line decided not to go forward on fourth in wanting overtime instead pointing to lose\nSo that's back to back gifts now is Sean McDermott going to continue their hand games to the Texans\nHouston has scored a touchdown on thirty six percent of

this often works Baltimore at Tennessee yeah how about that I said nothing game on ravens\nAre a three point favorite it open to pick them there are injury concerns involved in this game\nThe public likes Tennessee and I like tendency to want to take the titans your this is a rebound spot both teams need to rebound I trust the titans at home here they're much better own team they slept walked in Buffalo we thought that would be the concern it was their concern\nSo you get a boring back when you have a snake bomb like that you got to come back at home and take care of business and they've been very good titans are eight into their last ten at home [noise]\nTennessee has a pretty good defense ear the ravens Joe Flaco well he returned to Joe Flaco form last week floundering yeah average just

they don't say well you have the final position in basketball you don't get to take the final shot you're not guaranteed the final shot and basketball but in baseball you argue that the the final but as the home team you get the last chance you have the final\nTwo hundred and ... that's that's huge when the margins are thin in the postseason there's a big deal and the other thing to point out is Houston playing a light weight Indian squad in the opening round\nAnd the Astros have been a popular picked by a lot of people because they want and people who live in one last year that I keep wanting we're not talking about the twenty seven Yankees here and when you go behind the curtain\nAnd you see what's really going on here you realize ... teams vulnerable\nRight there in fact the Astros this year against teams that had a winning record you know the good teams the Astros were three games over five hundred this year against teams that had a winning record three and a five Nineteen\nWinning percentage the Boston Red Sox were eight games over five hundred against teams that had a winning right they were better the red Sox against the other good teams then the Astros were but wait there's more how about close games right playoff games usually close\nRegular season I Know it's different in the postseason but at the regular season Houston was twenty four and twenty four games decided by one run they were five hundred in close games the red Sox had a six forty one winning percentage in games decided by one run or less advantage\nTo the red socks [noise]\nLast observation\nFor the astro fans that reached out and you know who you are you're drunk with power I get it I understand I have to deal with this no go ahead Chris who calls all the time from your city uh it's it's nice that you've been an Astros fan for like you know the last\nTwo years I Hope you've enjoyed it up it's been good for you [noise]\nAnd I also if you didn't pull any muscles when he jumped on the bandwagon of Astros\nBaseball [laughter]\nDollar for dollar the phone is fan base in baseball the Houston Astros fan base does anyone\nDisagree with them and no one disagrees I don't disagree now what's my evidence or let's go back that's go back to the the archives here in twenty Thirteen the Astros were twenty sevens in attendance in baseball five years ago twenty seventh through the\nActual bodies in the stands much lower no body was going to the games they were on a watch about nobody was going these were intimate gatherings Astros games further more oh this is where it gets really good outside of friends and family\nYou needed an invitation to watch astro games on TV\n[laughter]\nI was trying to remember exactly what the number was so I had to go back to my uh my research and I'd look it up the Astros in twenty Thirteen play the game that according to the Nielsen TV ratings had less than a thousand people in the Houston area watching\nLet me repeat that they a professional baseball all these sudden astro fans in\nTwenty third team where where they were watching the Astros baseball they add a game a quarter of the ratings that had less than a thousand people less than a thousand people watch you take that for data bam\nBam bam bam bam bam now do you know eight though yeah that's right\nThe population and used just to put in perspective it and I'm not piling on him I\nHope I'm not pilot it's not like me to know all you're doing good thank you are the census population the last census estimated the population in the Houston market is to point three million less than a thousand we're watching a game in twenty Thirteen now they're all astrophysics they all go way\nBack they love the city of Houston right they they ... ... what's your phone is ripe\nBunch of phony ... well yeah sure you all\nWere hanging out down on the Gulf of Mexico while the Astros were playing five years ago now you're like I Love the Astros I go way back me and be geo and bags\nAre held a hard sell art house my homeboy\n[noise] yeah exactly and they also unlike and the answers are on light yeah Roberto sooner or who are you pull for that guy\nAnd Gary al with his races gestures during the world series there's an ... an asterisk\nOn that because he he made the the gesture that died and he wasn't suspended until next year so that's a bad job by Rob May have\nSome barriers ... he's a lot of racist to play in the world series last shame on\n... the Ben our show on Fox cello to Edmund Dallas the\nJudas Garcia\nWell I Would just like our friends in Houston to know that I have picked the Astros to win the world series over the Dodgers baseball guy\nAnd I encourage you said before bed malware that only stupid fans support losing teams that if you go out and pay hard earned money when the team is in trying to win\nThen your ... you should wait until they put out a good product before you go spend your money on that product\nThat less than a thousand people watching the game on TV where they good did back then\nA TV ratings do not go down that much money if you have real fans they don't go down people so watch\nI'm just saying I I've heard you say I have said I I already if your if you are and and your continue to pay for oh terrible product you are sending a message the organization\nThat losing is acceptable so\nCould you could be argued that the astro fans were merely telling the organization that this is not acceptable we don't support this and know you put a good product on the field will return that's an incorrect position on that why why why are you guys again\nI've said you're going to games fine but the people watching games on TV that doesn't go down you if you like the team doesn't cost any money you watch the game on TV you pay if you pay for TV channel anyway so that's when your time let me do the math to to point three million\nLess than a thousand and now everyone's that astroturf that's terrible yeah that's right her bra so I thought he\nMay have yeah you you have you done a ... year\nOh boy has you Eddie you're supporting a racist and the wife being oh stop girlfriend bitter that's
