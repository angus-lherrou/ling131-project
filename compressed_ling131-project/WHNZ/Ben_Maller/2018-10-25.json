[noise] download it now [noise]\nOn for the powers of college basketball\nIt's called what it is now the final point here and we said this at the time and it bears repeating if I'm On that jury based on what came out of that courtroom via media reports this would have been\nA simple not guilty plea innocent whatever you want to say the reason why I tell you what\nIf there is no victim there is no crime ... how can you have a crime if there is no ... I I can you have that's the case you this is a victimless situation\nIn my evidence I've already laid it out but if you're new to the party all laid out for you again here on Fox Sports radio to the ... show\nAdidas got what they want it they got top high school players to wear their logo school employees assistant\nCoaches middlemen who represented the schools and sometimes in some cases the head coaches signed off on this they were the beneficiaries they got a league talent this is how the game was played the players and their families their guardians got straight cash homey\nThey got paid paid to play so who exactly was hurt by this which party was surprised that the U.S attorneys I said the U.S attorney's office was saying these universities were the victims but their employees were orchestrating this\nSo I'm not that bright ... walk me through this and explain why a jury of eight women in four men determined that\nThis was guilty\nI I don't understand I I Will what where is the guilt in this if everyone knew what they were doing and everyone was was culpable I get the rules violation and you can argue that there's a tax violation but wire fraud\nIs that really the case you it's a false narrative is what it is it's ridiculous and I\nI heard also this argument wow these these shoot people they need to go to jail because they were manipulating these basketball players future for personal benefit\nThat's farcical with that is it is absolutely force he if\nAll the big schools were offering big money let's assume that to be the case 'cause I think you're pretty naive if you don't think that's the case\nWhat happened here as these players took the best deal they could get they said I Will go to Kansas 'cause they're offering us more money than North Carolina or you go down to Lake Michigan state and all the talk we're getting more money from these guys who will go there\nEvery crime needs a victim not some kind of potential\nVictim a not a possible victim not supposed victim but an actual victim and the fact that this attorney's office and say well if the damage was done to the university is because of the tarnished a ideal will\nStop that Senate pinion it's not a fact okay it's it's just ridiculous and this is just the tip of the spear because the\nRifleman Chuck Person who I might or might not remember when he played for the Indiana Pacers years ago as\nA top NBA player and he was an assistant coach at all burned he's up next and there's several other prominent assistant coaches from college basketball people in the\nCombined the scenes of the college game who are also facing federal charges those cases there's two more federal cases that are warming up in the bullpen\nAnd they will be coming out to the mound\nSoon so this is just the beginning you might want to consider a ... this point based on the results of this I I don't get it to me this is the head scratcher\nDid they did they find eight women and four men that have never watch college basketball before and don't understand the meat and potatoes they must they must have scoured lower Manhattan and\nSaid let's get a twelve dogs\nAren't sports people and then the little knowledge is sports has maybe they watched like five minutes of the final four and we'll bring them in here it's just really\nHigh speed been out of the show on Fox we say hello right over there to Steve taste mean Perot have you not been on jury duty ... eye for that is part of the ... people that don't know anything\nI had never been on jury duty I had a job when I first when my first jobs in radio I was traveling and I got eight deferments\nFor jury duty because we have a job that you travel they don't call you for jury duty and that lasted for like Twenty years and they finally finally figured out that it didn't have that job anymore and so I got called to jury duty this year I was on standby jury duty but I never actually got called I Would kind of like to be on a jury because I Would be a good ...\nAnd the company would pay me to be on a jury so I agree with that\nNow how would you be a good juror\n'cause I'm not going to fall for the dos ... this this statement from the U.S attorney here\nThat these universities were somehow deceived than it was a false pretenses and deprive the University of an economic rights and tarnished an ideal I would've thought that I'd say no this guy did nothing illegal no victim next case let me go home and have a sandwich\nLet's say it is illegal I'll say it is it ... it was very hot wheels are not victims since we are athletic departments way on how how is that illegal how is it illegal\nWell it's like the other victimless crimes quote unquote in society you just need to rewrite the rule and not call it a crime and making above board\nBut how is this illegal though right conspiracy to commit a crime there was no crime there's no big\nDeal because they have eligibility requirements and they're called\nThe one that's the rule that's out all the law\nYou understand the difference between the NCAA rule of law at the NCAA can take now federal your own or is it for the rule not in in CIA role is not a law it's never been a law it should never be a law it's not a law in this case you eat it out to\nMe the NCAA bylaws now have the bite of a federal\n... the end they have the whole Rob operation that that rhetoric disgusting is the Olympic Committee and all these combat operations fevers another one you write\nBoxing that's the best one was a joke of the Olympics are ridiculous and then all these things are the
