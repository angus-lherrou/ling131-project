gesture they all thought I had that in one money on the game because it's\nYeah it's more it's supposed to win this game and they all but I bet there were like how did you know what you know did you bet straight up I said no I'm just a jets fan of the one they're going to the playoffs and they're like oh they're all little disappointed that doesn't have the same and resume and strike

I\nYou can listen bought our first ... AOL [noise] download it now [noise]\nAlbert Wilson a wide receiver from the dolphins and Kevin fired a safety from the titans\nLike all those players have a completion longer than Eli Manning the season\nThat's a fact those are those are numbers that's not speculating that's not thinking oh they'll bathrooms calling odd Eli Manning when he could be calling out to eat the play calling that is a factor those are All Facts that Albert Wilson and Kevin Byard who if they walked up to you with ID's or name tags said\nAlbert Wilson and Hi I'm Kevin buy or to you wouldn't know who they are they're not quarterbacks and they've got longer past completion this season the manning\nThose are All Facts\nSo goes to another question because I liked demanding a lot Archie Manning has been a guest on Fox Sports radio before could not be a nicer human being\nA great guy I've heard nothing but good things about Eli Manning have never met Eli Manning never talk to them never talk to Peyton Manning but you hear a good things depending on who\nYou who you discuss it with so I like the man and a lot but if you lie Manning's last name was knocks what he's still be the quarter back in New York\nAnd seriously insert your last name with Eli Manning's last name and ask yourself am I still the quarterback in New York based on my performance is over the past several years\nAnd I get the loyalty there and I get that he's won a couple of Super Bowls I get all of that I understand they they want to be they feel indebted to Eli Manning he brought them I'm a ton of success and he's to an elegance Tom Brady in a Super Bowl get all of it but I think the organization is almost afraid to make a move\nI think that spoke volumes in the offseason when there was an opportunity to have basically your pick of every quarter back in the draft outside a bakery Mayfield\nAnd you pass on it for a running back\nI Wonder if the organization sees the last name manning and it changes their perception it changes the way they look at it and it changes how they view the quarterback position in New York\nHe's had a lot of rough years since the last Super Bowl there's been a lot of down times and it's not a hundred percent his fault but clearly in today's NFL when you can't throw the ball down field and it's it come on it's not like\n... didn't come from an off and put up numbers with case keen him\nLike he's got the talent they're so what's the issue you've got a wide receiver\nSafety in some backup quarterback who got longer completion on the year the new why is that happening either it's not in the playbook which I find hard to believe in today's NFL or you don't trust that the guy can get it there\n\nAnd so I just wonder if the New York giants field is loyalty to Eli Manning based a lot on his last name and because he won you a couple of Super Bowls the awhile back\nBecause you remember what happened last season\nBend Mac do have the gall to stay to Eli Manning listen man we're going to put Gino Smith in at some point or we're going to give you the option to start the game to continue your consecutive starts streak and then um at halftime we're going to take you out\nAnd he managed to his credit said no man and that just doesn't feel right that feels force just let you know start the game\nAnd everybody was outraged\nOutraged at the idea of ... by manning outrage even though it was Eli Manning's call as to whether or not he wanted to start the game and how did the giants respond to it they fired bend Mac do the next day or the day after\nCould have been an hour after the game who knows they could uphold the tarmac stunt like they did with Wayne Kevin USC\nThat was the organization saying and and getting a reading from the media and everybody else that was so upset with the move how could you do that too many of the guy who won you a couple of Super Bowls\nWell because it's demanding they got so much heat and there was such a backlash that they were afraid to reprimand or they were afraid to to back up their head coach so instead they fired him so we have proof that the organization bused Eli Manning differently that a lot of people in the league do\nSo when you hear owed back him call out the fact that they don't throw the ball twenty yards down the field and then patch for weeks into the job has got to do a back and forth on a friday without back him in the media\nI'm telling you man in ... your last name with Eli Manning's you'd be long gone by now\nJonah stocks Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox the phone number eight seven seven

auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier Jonah stocks here on up us our\nUm so we thought we came up with this idea a couple of weeks ago where I thought you know there's a lot of things that go on and sports\nAnd I've noticed that some of the stuff I just don't care about okay and and and and I just I Am I going to fake it I'm not going to do a fake bit I'm not going to pretend like I really care about something if I don't care I'd rather just be honest I think people appreciate the honesty\nYou know that that's just the way I look at it so we decided to write what about what can we come up with\nThat we could sort of put a spotlight on these topics that come up that I Can't believe turn into mainstream stories and that people can actually do full segments or shows on radio for and so we decided well why don't we uh we just called this [noise]\nThere's so many stories in the world of sports and most of them are a complete waste inside the um ... let's get kinky here's some of the big stories from the last week for joining the real question do you\nCare here we go Mike mayor our executive producer is going to file fire off some stories some headlines and we're going to find out just how much they actually matter on this show Mike\nAll right let's start from a game of Deborah Estrin sooner update the Dodgers\nThe night but Clinton curse shot through a gym through eight innings two hitter Dodger fans actually boot Dave Roberts for taking Clinton ... out of the game for ... in the middle of a shutout Jonas do care OK I care but only because of this\nBecause um our flagship am five Seventy LA sports a lot of people that that we know and we're friends with they worked for an five Seventy LA sports there the home with the Dodgers right is actually the Dodgers station and so because of those people\nAnd and the great people over and five Seventy LA sports I Do care I Hope they have a long run I Hope they do big things selfishly and for all of them yes I actually do care but I Love it\nAll right okay on next one here another big story from a friday night or Kevin written the warriors actually played an NBA game on friday in Seattle and Kevin Durant even dawn ... vintage Shawn Kemp number forty in Jersey Jonas de care I okay this I really do\nCare about because I grew up in the Seattle Seahawks or Seattle Seahawks be Seattle super sonics word damn good team and one of my favorite players in the NBA growing up was the savior McDaniel\nNow I don't know if anybody remembers Xavier McDaniel but he always looked like he was about to punch in the face\nI think I even had a ... McDaniel shoes I might they might have been like hand me downs where I got him at a thrift store and like one of those bag deals where like five bucks at whatever you can fill in the bag you walk out with I even know if they were the right size but it was ... McDaniel he was one of my favorite players I Love saying the name ... left shrimp\n'cause it always sounds like I'm going to curse on the air when I say so yes I actually do care about this and I hope Seattle gets a basketball team\nAmen to that or I or I Love it an interesting story from the earlier in the week uh there were reports that U.S Open champions Brooks kept good and Dustin Johnson had to be separated after an altercation at a Ryder Cup after party works kept ... actually denied that this even happened so Jones dusty care [noise]\nYeah I like this is just so lame man\nLook golfers

tea man I I I've been to a bunch of golf tournaments they're fun they're nice it's cool I always feel a little bit awkward because\nYou know I'm wearing jeans and I don't shave\nAnd I didn't grow up

Irving has spoken to Anthony Davis about playing in Boston with the Celtics joined us do you care no I don't care\n... this is I mean like how many ... at some point at some point doesn't doesn't have to just ... they\nThis whole wave of player movement and all this stuff at some point don't players just want to like know where they're going to live for the next four years or five years I mean I have always seemed like the peak of player moving in the NBA and there's always these stories reports raking\nA a source is it's like all the same stuff over and over again until we get close to the trade deadline until we actually tipped off the the new season in the NBA all this stuff is just ... pretty much a waste of time next\nUh interesting story from game one of the division series between the Astros and the Indians an Astros fan bought five hundred dollars in beer after calling a George Springer home run in game one of the division series joined us the care [noise]\nI Do care so let me get this straight so five hundred dollars because he called the home run ... one of those Avi its own run your own by everybody a beer\nBecause he's an idiot um if you didn't watch the world series

you're hired the guy on social media you actually have to have a signed contract first\nYou know like gay one stuff when you go to law school as far as contracts go well they didn't do that and instead Josh again is went back to the New England patriots and so they were less scrambling to try and find a head coach I Believe they settled on Frank writes about an hour and a half ago but this was general manager Chris Ballard\nAfter getting burned by Joshua Daniels Josh\nCall made made a decision is not come in I don't\nI don't deal with New England [noise] I don't I have no idea what

sixteen touchdowns allowed in the NFL the season as a quarterback\nAnd um it's just interesting because I it was it was weird 'cause all I kept\nHearing about what was what a mistake Bill Belichick may like it was just a total mistake like Bill Belichick how do you not play this guy clearly he's one of the best cover corners in league many scientists contract he goes over to the Tennessee Titans and he's allowing a touchdown a game\nIn Carson once completed like seven completion on him last game I'm not mistaken so it's it's why I said\nAnd you shouldn't have been surprised by that is when

AOL [noise] download it now [noise]\nFox Sports trend being\nBut if you want to know how good the team is the next two weeks are going to get your answer\nBecause next week and you get Kansas City and it's going to be in prime time and it's going to be at home and you're\nGoing to get Bill Belichick extra time to try and prepare for the assault that is Patrick moms and that chief softens that's gonna be fun to watch that is going to be a damn good game to watch and see how Bill Belichick handles and prepares for that team\n\nSo that'll give you an idea as to whether or not this off ants if need be can go blow for below with the Kansas City chiefs 'cause I don't know that anybody can outside of the rams but if the patriots can\nBe a of seeds in trouble\nAnd then you're on the road at Chicago which all of a sudden with that the fence a little Mac and flying around\nCreating turnovers pressure on the quarterback\nThat's all of a sudden a real game that's a game if it's later in the year that game gets flex to the night game\nSo the next two weeks to me are going to tell you how legit and how real this patriots team is because yes Brady is older we thought that they were flawed they dealt with some injuries they let go of some key pieces in the off season\nBut if they end up ... you know thrown back for wins in a row and they're sitting at five and two and a couple of weeks\nIf she's got a problem so you can try and sell me on Kansas City and you could try and sell me on Baltimore but it'll be the same story every single year and it's the patriots ruling the AFC and figuring it out on the fly they just do better than everybody else\nNew England uh Lebanon one against the spread in their last twelve games when they're favored by ten or more points right so that means there are no let down like if they're double digit favorite\nNot only are they going to win that game but they're going to win by more than double digits\nOr or by double digits like there's no let down at all\nSo when you saw Thursday night it was expected\nYou knew what they were going to do banged up Indianapolis Colts team patriots fans are excited about it and as much as I'm a believer in the patriots and they never bought into the dysfunction rumors and all the other crap we're being fed me off season wait two weeks just give it up and give it a minute wait two

Nineteen oh three were the first World Series begins play Boston Americans need the Pittsburgh Pirates five games to three and a best of nine theory play this week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call great points to center field before hammering into the recovery\nYou can listen bought our first I our radio ads [noise] download it now [noise]\nHas to do with it and it's you know we have a very don't bring over some of the um [noise] you know medium or the other person I was there that if I don't [noise] this will be a problem for me [noise] um [noise] just [noise]\nI was so hard to do they play with them or only one in three you know we last year to year we want to live in a far we're through and through into all three of the man [noise]\nSo you never know when you can go wrong when we were going to vote for this what are yours how come we don't attempt to throw the ball was one of those um those are questions that we have to figure out but [noise]\nFor now houses or images before we burn rely on before the game [noise] all of the house\nNow I'm Patrick rumor the giants head coach now interesting there he talked about it not throwing the ball more than twenty yards and and uh and and all that stuff and you would think OK well this is a shot at Eli Manning well past Sherman who was also asked about it his head coach it was passed rumors response\nOut or I guess you'd have to clarify that's probably a better question for him what he meant by um [noise] but I Do know that is our team has a heck of a lot of heart our team plays with all our energy what we haven't done is we haven't really executed quite as well as we need to yet and that's really the\nOnset of a energy it's more execution and I think that's what we're all striving for but ah now we've got a locker room of these guys got a ton of heart including hotel\nAnd a lot of want to and I I think that you know will break over here once we start executing better we as coach has got to continually fight to put them in the best position possible and then we got we got to execute\nA solo back and forth there uh one one says why aren't we doing this the other said well you know we've got a lot of hard but it's about the execution which is code for you guys aren't doing what we're asking you to do good enough which is why we're one and three\nThat's why we're bad and all that back I was calling out the officer not throwing the ball down field here's what I Do know right and I was making this point earlier if you lie Manning's last name was knocks\nHe's not still the starting quarterback for the giants let's just be honest man like the fact that he's a manning that goes a long way and if you don't think that organization thinks about that if you don't think that organization reacts to public perception\nIf you if you don't think that's the case I got two examples for you one they fired bend Mac do\nAfter he bench to Eli Manning and ruined his consecutive starts streak last season fired bend Mac do\nBut then ... gave you like manning the option of starting that game against Oakland Eli Manning declined dust Gino Smith got to start\nAnd they got so much heat in so much push push back for how dare they ruin Eli Manning's consecutive starts streak that the organization fired Ben ... during the season\nWhich is not something the giants organization routinely does something and they do every day I don't know that the giants organization is fired a coach mid season\nBut because it was he lie manning and because the public was so upset by it the giants overreacted\nThe giants ownership is also even talked about how a season ticket holders when the whole uh anthem protests going on that they spoke openly about how season ticket holders have threatened to ditch their season tickets\nUh if any players kneel during the national anthem and giants ownership was speaking about it as if they were concerned if I was giants ownership I'd say\n... and I did this goes above and beyond just the national anthem if anybody's threatening to drop their season tickets if I'm giants ownership by go take a walk we get a three year waiting list we don't need you to hear\nYou describe you'll go away\nBut you think anybody at McDonalds if your coffee comes out and it's cold and you say I'll never go here again do you think any of the employees are like\nOh wait but don't go you see the drive through line it's around the block ... nobody cares go way you like you don't have an impact on this subject they\nThey have a clear clear we're we've proof pattern of behavior that they overreact to criticism publicly pattern of behavior\nWhere do they go back and was saying about why aren't we throwing the ball down field I got some numbers for ya you line Manning's\nAnd and get your management better the last three weeks he's been better than week one but still like there's no real threat to go down field in today's NFL that's that's not a good thing you've seen these often says Eli Manning's longest pass completion of the season is thirty seven yards\nThat puts them in thirty six in the NFL behind every starting quarterback a couple of backup quarterbacks and Albert Wilson a wide receiver from the dolphins and Kevin buyer to safety from the titans\nI mean anybody noticing something a little off their pat Schroeder\nYou remember the Vikings off it's a year ago it wasn't like you know they were ... Duncan come on man case Kim was stretching the feel a little bit Adam the un Stefan digs at monster years\nI mean come on like there is something to it either Eli Manning can't go down field with the football or they just don't have faith in him doing it\nIt just it makes you wonder man insert your last name with Eli Manning's last name tell me if you're still the quarterback in New York I don't think you will be\nSeven seven Ninety nine on Fox Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio or you can also get me on Twitter ...\nHe joined us stocks I Want to let you know we are brought to you by discover\nBecome a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learned more at discovered dot com slash match limitations apply coming up next year on Fox Sports radio\nUm he's spotted some some sound that he thought that we would like on the show okay we're all about trash talk even if it's really really offensive and we can play it on the air we're going to play it on the air so Mike how does this thing go in Seattle earlier\nThis week All right so this was a promo because they're having a big show in Australia and that's actually underway right now so Elias\nAnd Kevin knowing the WWE WWE of at AT T arena in fact one of my friends was there so I yeah I was a I Believe it was a shell out for walks with their promoting a match Kevin Irwin good ally is they're going to team up to face Jon ... so they're talking about\nA gift setting up their match saying that she ... them teaming up doesn't make any sense so I said this audio to you this was a lie is talking about\nTeam of Kevin wins or did the ... and John So you know your vote\nYou know it's\n\n\n[noise]\nOh man that's brilliant I tell you that would be [noise] if you want to WWE traveled all over the country [noise] I Would [noise] literally\nBefore I Would go into the ring I Would look up watch what would pitch that crowd off the most and it's ... listen\nIf you've ever been to WWE event I got news for you or those fans aren't exactly going guy sitting fifty yard line in a football game right and that's fine not trying to judge but they're just not\nI Would go through the history of whatever city I was in and find what would bother them the most like if I was in Chicago\nI'm bringing up Bartman it that's just happening if I was in Cleveland I'm bringing up what Braun leaving um\nIf I was in like that was why do we have the ... the ... uh from years ago when Johnny Manziel was a member of the Cleveland Browns Seth Rollins a W W we a superstar\nWas in Cleveland cutting a promo this was before they won the title a came back and beat the warriors Johnny Manziel was still a member of the Cleveland Browns for Johnny Manziel sitting front row any Monday Night raw Ben in Cleveland and here is that drones\nTwenty one [noise] [noise] [noise] there's one on\nOne\nTrying to trace over there for an hour I don't [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [laughter]\n\nOh my God I to be a healing professional wrestling I I Would you just go city to city and you find out what would pitch their fan base off the most and that's the first thing you go to\nInstant heat everybody wants you to lose first thing you'd go to All right Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio or coming up next year on offense are we are going\nTo have another edition of the scraps I've already heard about one of the stories we're going to discuss\nAnd it is not a good one for the NBA so that is coming up next here on Fox Sports radio but for all the latest\nKevin figures I joined us every single major league baseball playoff series in action on a friday the ... the ... in LA where the Dodgers got home runs from any Machado a two run shot from him knows ... what the solo blast they will be the Braves three nothing\nAnd they gave to nothing's theory lead in there and that would be as theories Milwaukee also up two games to none they would shut out Colorado for nothing\nAnd the American league Red Sox get to get three run home run from J.
