Daniels who was in Denver back in the day drafted to marry as Thomas so because of that kinship it's the same reason\nThat the patriots who went out and side Eric Decker who couldn't play anymore and they brought him into training camp and then he dropped every pass that on his way or the wife finally released them while you were I tired quote unquote\nA foot but yeah so I mean if it comes down to this based on past\nResults which don't always guarantee future outcomes much like analytics shutout Dodger for an office job the this sentiment would be that they did they make a trade the patriots were receiver it's going to be for\nYour Mary's Thomas other should be for golden take 'cause he's the better player they're relatively the same age I think that takes a little bit younger than did Mary's Thomas petite would be the better player\nAnd the trust me I Know my I have great scouting pedigree tremendous scouting pedigree I Do I have that are unless they don't I Will take your phone calls have you like to be part the number\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine\nWere also on Twitter at Bain manpower that's at Ben ... good another good last for the Lakers are coming together I think they're playing very well\nAnd the bronze doing a great job has got those guys playing right where they want to be so that's a quality laws and um I don't know how in a sort of won that game but the Lakers really look good in that last this solemn loss for the Lakers so good job by them when the game six of the world series\nHe comes over and he had to pick up the uh the device or the the pleasure device\nBut he used the towel yeah tough 'cause you got to think to sneak that through security at an NFL stadium\nThere's only a couple of ways of doing [laughter] ways well the way you would have to sneak that in there would definitely leave some uh you know some evidence that show [laughter]\n[laughter]\nNo Ralph how much do those things cost route that do you have a couple of how much would that item costs what would you want to buy one Ralph I Know you have a few so how much that I go\nI'm just going to stop you there because you don't want me to say ...

for it I'm sure he lived to find life\nBack in the back in the day so the flip flop story this goes to the world of basketball and\nIn early September Rick Pitino did an interview and he said I Am done I'm not going to coach anymore it's over done ski\nI'm Out the old Louisville coach I'm not back I'm not going to go anywhere else that I Can't do it anymore I wrote a book\nThat's all ... that the coach well turned out that less than two months later my man Rick Pitino is that a change of heart he has flip flopped and are these just announced\nIn the last forty eight hours that indeed he not only wants to coach again Rick Pitino has the intention of finding an end be a job he wants to be an NBA head coach he coached the Celtics and the Knickerbockers back in the stone age before social media and he wants to be\nA head coach again Rick Pitino so what are the chances that Rick Pitino becomes a head coach\nIn the NBA I Believe they are actually pretty good but there's two conditions\nThere's two cabbage patch to Rick Pitino coming back and there are two things that Rick Pitino very proud man would have to do even though he's been embarrassed on the Internet because of some of his shenanigans in restaurants that were close in the greater Louisville area but there are two things that Pacino asked to do our number one\nHe has to work sheet okay I said cheap and that's cheap by NBA standards now Pitino expects to be the highest paid coach that's not going to happen\nPitino can get a job in the NBA if he's willing to work\nFor a reasonable some that's number one and number two he asked to be willing to go to the basketball version of Siberia\nWhich white now would be what Cleveland the the Cavaliers job is open that won the Sacramento Kings come to mind if Pitino was willing to go to a place like that and not the glitz and glamour of New York city or LA\nPitino can get ahead coaching job and we'll get ahead coaching job would\nGet put that in your\nPie but

I realized that this is a a just a total pipe dream but just bear with me okay you please entertain a here's my dream my dream is that Clinton ... option to his contract for the next two years\nAnd then the giants Dodgers say I know we're blood rivals I Know we don't like each other very much but we're going to give you two years of Clinton crucial two years of Clinton corrosion and you just have to give us one year of\nMadison Bumgarner and we'll pay\nSome of her shawl salary you're gonna get her Shaw who is wonderful and the regular season owns the nationally west and all you have to do is give us one year Bumgarner\nLet's make a trade we make a tray\nRight let's talk it out well we'll hook it out right\n[laughter] we'll forgive you for that you know that tweet that were sent out by your TV affiliate that was mocking the Dodgers what\nWe're going to have to fight\nLet's make it happen yeah you're good All right how about this I don't want to make that trade okay how about this how about just give us Bumgarner for the playoffs as you guys won't even be a plus so how about the last month the season when the giants are playing out the string\nAnd the Dodgers are winning the nationally west where the seven consecutive year how 'bout you just give Bumgarner to the Dodgers and we will send you some full leaps friendship sandwiches how 'bout that\nYou get with that a done deal\n[noise] what else did I see I saw the Mets I was I was busting Jason Smith or jobs when I was coming in because this was on earlier big Mets apologist Mr met and all that and the Mets hired Brody bandwagon in as their general manager who he's an agent\nAnd I never told Jason as I said Jason and he agreed with me at least offer you I don't know what he said on the air but he agrees me off the I said\nYou should never hire an age as a general manager because any good agent would never take the job because you make so much more money as an agent right and the amount of money you make like Scott bore us is the greatest Asian of all time in professional baseball doesn't new football he doesn't have basketball\nYou think Scott Boris would leave his Boris agency in Newport Beach his compound in beautiful Newport Beach\nAnd leave that behind to take over as the general manager of the angels are the Dodgers\nOf course not but you know what do you do just like the\nLakers hired Kobe Bryant's old age and is there supposed a general manager even though we know la Brian is the one\nCalling the shots but [noise] I I'm not against outside the box hiring but let's think this through here did anyone in the Mets organizations think this through\nAnd I saw the quotes from\nFrom the Mets they they're going to introduce him later on Tuesday but there was a statement a prepared statement from Fred will pod\nThe owner of the Mets who still using the Bernie made off card as to why the Mets haven't been competitive because made off took all the Mets money but here's the statement says Brody is high on here we go character\nBlend of analytics scouting and developed mental ideas illustrate why he will be successful\nShould go back and get some of the old statements from Fred will upon previous Mass General managers who also he said would be successful\nDry hump and guys is something that I feel very strongly about\nYou need a good spin rate is what you do that so we get it's all about exit velocity\nThought about that exit velocities spin rate that's the key\nClearly\nSo that's about an hour show on Fox will take your calls at eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine get the coup over there Robert though the whole cast of characters that somebody else yeah I don't know who else is someone else's the building I forget who\nThat is I met my memory is going I guess it's the middle of the night so if you just the way this us go to the phones let's go to Brian in Minnesota who's next up on Fox Sports radio host O'Brien\nOr Dan how are you Brian if I was any better I Would be Dodger but not all Los Angeles Dodgers because they're they're not good they lost the worst is what's on your mind\nAll right so you're talking about earlier and I'm thinking it good landing now what's it what's a good team that's in our Siberia ... ... young player crack jokes in Oregon and what the city that has a cleaner and art and correct them right\nOh here we go down here we go yeah here we go I'm going to do that you're you're already done with Tampa's you're done with coach teams\nI mean I feel like him butler are gonna you know they can't read I don't know what's going on there I feel like I'm already getting me on to that that that's going down down any bumper stickers on you know they can you hold the wrong thing when you're young immigrants yeah that works out for talking about the future then\nYou know and I'm sitting here thinking you know ... aren't they bring in her late and Richard or bringing worker\nOr something and they can get like ... ... when they were little and I entertain that so I'm just you know\nSo when they when they hire them when they hire the hookers they can get like a a group deal that yeah\nI got\nSome money I think you\nKnow yeah you know that's a smart I ... I I I like how you think actually that's a great idea I'm ... I really\nDo think though that some coach ... ... ...\nYour ... your ... your connection is terrible I Would like ... I like the content but I Can't hear the content and we're really only have audio here so hopefully you can call back we'll get a better line\nSo unfortunate good Pacino to Minnesota they go\nHe would take that job in a second to love that job and how about this like he'd say I'll take the job I'm sixty six years old the coach the team was for a couple of years and then I'll hire my son as the heir to the phone and he will replace me and you'll have to generations of potatoes on your side line\nWhen you mentioned that been your dream ... uh Bumgarner in her shop that I was thinking the same thing but not a great idea to my\nYesterday that the only do they make a deal with the enemy you got to make a deal with the enemy it's a win win two years that occurred Charlotte the Dodgers only get one guarantee that added\nBumgarner make it happen\nI'll never as I'll never have I'm willing to throw in some minor league or I don't care about\nMinor league playoff throw some minor league player in who cares every year there's a new crop of a prospects there suspects anyway so somebody in there\nThat's all do it\nWill take your calls it is the the better now their show on Fox will call this one year old dad\nDear old dad will get to that and we will do it next\nTo use brain won't catch us by surprise\nThat's why that's actually the damp GM and the Dodgers they should hire my ass over there they should yeah absolutely and I'm I'm\nPretty I'm bringing Roberta with me you're ... you must do will take over\nLike the giants of trash talking with occupy would drive herself\nUsually you would be the starting second baseman [laughter] ...\nYeah probably get suspended about fifty games you know what I mean\nNot only that but you don't mind till they catch you you did a lot of home runs well you'd be Great Hey man ... ... ... and I think it might you know the giants organization does not have a big problem with that kind of thing anyway you know they've got a statue automated for a guy like that so you're in good shape\nExcellent excellent we find out next year yeah\nYou gotta you gotta go to spring training and ask for a tryout that such a ... yeah\nYeah it's probably has got some close by\nThere you go that's what I used to drive down there to say I'm ready to go home and I'm ...
