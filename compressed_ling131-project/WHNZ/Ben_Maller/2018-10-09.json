same play by play man in July of this year now\nNormally when you see athletes retire they become adults you don't see them becoming play by play man but that's what ... wanted to do play for the saints for so long the same name and their play by play man we had him on the show phenomenal interview talk to us and gave us all kinds of stories\nPracticing his call for when Drew Brees broke the record he said I practice it for about ten hours this week and it was ten wasted hours because it just kinda happened and I said what I said\nBut he also said to us that you know Drew Brees over the course of his great great as he is there are fourteen players that breeze through a pass to that did not catch one of his passes and I am one of those guys and I got to relive that this week when they wrote a column about it the story about a year New Orleans\nSo I said to him well do you have to tell us the story now Drew Brees through a pass through urine off bits of lime you didn't catch it tell us the story here is ... story\nI'll tell you about it 'cause I'm going to blame somebody for now we're talking with a hot potato [laughter]\nSo working so I I was the jumbotron in New Orleans for really my first five seasons and uh it was a pretty common occurrence I probably cook about five hundred reps over five years of titan\nAnd so people here kind of got used to report you know to go and it was kind of a running joke or am I I'm I'm not like a very athletic I have a terrible body unlike the guy you expect to see going out for a pass in the NFL so uh there was a big built up\nWe call a player playing the Pittsburgh Steelers on Halloween Night Sunday Night Football in two thousand and nine and they knew that tore Palmolive was going to cover the jumbo guidance and they also knew Detroit power would create is not a chance in hell they're going to throw that\nGuy's a ball and\nEverything worked exactly like that what didn't work out well was I had to walk Lamar Woodley and then released into the route and as I released from a bar grandma Jersey on me around and I fell\nAnd so I really never would stand him or her down to ... how many people that were convinced drew overthrew me let me just tell you if you think drew overthrows an office environment I Would lean toward blaming the author of why not in that case it was my phone so\nWent over my head there's an awful picture that exist that I Am completely horizontal uh there's no nothing but air underneath me and the pass was overthrown so every single year when they install go on to this day the stakes are so they introduce a\nFiery to St pop [laughter]\nThe name of the way the play doesn't exist anymore\nBut we go ahead and go through it every single year or so that the nerd so yeah that was my that was my worst moment of my entire career\nOh I'm looking at the picture right now it's ... you're in the air it's oh the ... over your are\nPretty bad as I Know I think you know there there is that and\nIt wasn't lesson that Sunday Night Football crime\nTime against the Pittsburgh Steelers [laughter] I don't like it was just like little insignificant like you know things will Sunday and you're not going

blessing in disguise were Drew Brees I Am convinced as much as I'm sitting in front of his microphone had Drew Brees landed with Miami\nHe would not have come anywhere close to becoming the all time leading pastor in NFL history it would've been a very brief run they vote between the dolphins and Drew Brees right the smart money in fact says that it would have been a disaster would've been a toxic situation\nOr in in Miami and\nIt didn't happen I 'cause his Nick Saban who's the smartest guy in the room and knows everything except when NFL games more than he loses a Nick Saban shows Dante colpepper now the second thing here for all the success that Nick Saban all the success that he is head\nAt Alabama none of it happened in the NFL right he's still haunted\nBy his failures at the pro level under five hundred as an NFL coach he famously lied to to the media when asked\nIf he was looking to to leave the Miami Dolphins and there were reports of the Alabama boosters plane at the airport in Miami and Nick Saban a famously said I Will continue on as the dolphin coach he lied\nRight to their face could not admitted just like he couldn't admitted he blew it on Drew Brees even with the obvious\nCat out of the bag instead of just saying hey you know I got it wrong I got it wrong uh we had two injured quarterbacks I picked the injured quarterback I thought would be better uh instead he threw the medical staff under the bus as the fall guy in Miami passing the buck\nAnd blaming them for incompetence rather than owning now there are many longtime Miami\nOfficials who think differently\nOr they believe that it was actually Nick Saban who boy when he had the final say and as I point to keep in mind that there aren't they call pepper at that time we're going back in number of years here he was coming off a serious knee injury so they had two options they had the option\nHey door a door a injured quarterback door be uh injured quarterback\nAnd they chose the injured quarterback that was physically more imposing in Dante colpepper 'cause they thought he would be able to come back and handle life in the NFL how did that work out don't ask or not they culpepper lasted four games with\nMiami for he had to touchdown passes on a dolphin uniform he never again after he left the dolphins he never through more than five touchdowns in one season\nAnd Drew Brees now has four hundred Nineteen passing touchdowns just as a member of the saints he's got four hundred Nineteen passing touch us now the last point\nI have enjoyed watching Drew Brees quarterback I have a place with a lot of enthusiasm uh I I get the you can tell you he's enjoying it I get enjoyment watching ... he's a hardcore guy when it comes to playing quarterback and these scenes teams\nIt it's been the videogame office especially when they play in the dome and the temple the rhythm of the officers there it's fun to watch and rarely\nRarely to the states especially at home ever get bogged down the stretch a couple of years ago they had had a rough patch but Drew Brees is likely not going to ever win the super bowl sensory contender in the NFC but the rams are better now there is a\nBetter than the saints in New Orleans the chances are very low they're actually going to win another Super Bowl so he will end up being part of one Super Bowl winning team and he was on a bunch of good teams with the St a bunch of teams that one a lot of regular season games\nBut there was always somebody better\nI that's the that's the legacy of ... he will end up when he's done the all time leading pastor in the NFL which he is right now and have a bunch of other records\nBut bridesmaids status applies to Drew Brees even individual you get some of the years here and he put up great numbers but they said well yeah but Peyton Manning was better this year you have a Tom Brady was better this year\nOr Aaron Rodgers or you go back Brett Farr some some of the players a decade plus ago and so he's he's always been like the number two and number three guy in a year but rarely the number one guy\nAmy in the NFL is event Mather show\nOn Fox is we take your phone calls and you can be part of the facilities eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six thirty six now I just want to say before I forget I really would like to apologize\nTo Adrian Peterson

it was just wonderful\nUh and um it was just marvelous so you know what\nI'll admit it I'll be the adults here I was wrong that is not look like a player that's done you can trust Adrian Peterson man is that guy bringing every week and he's not in every other week player you know those of us that said he only shows up every other game we could not have been more wrong\nWe could not have been more wrong about Adrian Peterson my God was impressive and the Redskins are so lucky to have a reliable running back like that who they can depend on\nThat one for yard Kerry had was really really beautiful\nIt was really good\nAre we say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat Willie\nDarcy\nTakes a big man to admit it was wrong it's not easy at all I Know it's tough to do but I or you were a man of

uh just no good games\nNot one yeah\nLet's not Sarah that she Adrian Peterson after the game said he dislocated his shoulder yes I did the apparently\nA Jake Bruton a refused to that or had a different\nI Believe that say career ending injury I think there should be a career ending injury\nOr you could see that sure yeah that's it put them on the ... put them on the show we saw probably saw was was good though before he got hurt you know 'cause you got to be ... I thought he was going to be knocked out earlier in the game and that guy looking out at the legs in a few of them upside down I thought that was it for him there but they didn't go about it [laughter]\nYeah so if his shoulders or does that mean you can't whip any kids is that it I mean he's got other you know the other shoulder All right well yeah the whip yeah so he can ... that's not a strong shoulder though he's got to make sure these focuses on his shoulder well you could you work you work up the other one though you know what I'm saying\nYeah get that uh I got ya that are ongoing understand completely and got you I Will take some phone calls have you like to report\nEight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine eight seven seven nine nine six six thirty six now you can be part of the festivities here and we're also available on\nTwitter at Bain Mallory that's at bin ... got ...

things for the Redskins ...\nNow what was forget forget about would be the performance of Alex Smith now the numbers do not look terrible the numbers do not week\nBut this is one of those things have you watched the game you know the Al Smith\nWhen the Redskins needed to match below below the Redskins off its got bogged down and was unable\nTo matriculate the ball in the end zone Smith finished with two hundred Seventy five yards on thirty nine passage dams that's not good didn't have a touchdown pass it one interception\nAnd uh we did have a four yard touchdown run but he was bad really bad and his numbers at half time so that was ... when the game was somewhat in the balance\nIt was a Thirteen point game at halftime and Alex Smith had a hundred and thirty one yards passing at halftime eight no touchdowns no interceptions he was just kind of there\nIf it wasn't doing anything is this kind of like filling a slot like a like a left guard\nWould do hit a quarterback reading of Seventy one in the first half hour Smith and it it it it it should be worse I feel like it should be watching the game you felt like it should be worse\nAnd he has these hiccups now John grew ... after the game trying to stand by his quarterback Jake rooting rather not John John doesn't care Jay the coach of the Redskins cares he says that he blamed himself the Redskins coach he said he needs to get better\nAt coming up with plays that Alex Smith is comfortable and making Alex Smith more comfortable\nSo how do you make Alex Smith come give him what a three touchdown lead is usually pretty comfortable when he's got a three touchdown lead [noise]\nWhat else can you do\nI'm well I'm trying to think how could you make Alex Smith come from other good and I did like what he said Jake route and as you left the day is his last word at his post\nGame news coverage was that was an absolute embarrassment those were the final words from Jay groove and as he walked off the stage [noise]\nAnd

Milwaukee is depending\nAnd this is the forward the brewers everyone's like you gotta have a great bullpen but the the Milwaukee bullpen well it's been very effective this season\nYou keep bringing those guys in the\n... factor goes up because Everytime you bring a pitcher in there's a chance of that day that particular pictures just not going to have at the moment is going to be too big and he's going to vomit all over the man this is the flaw with the Milwaukee Brewers they're overly dependent on that\nYou've got to have a little bit of balance you can't always rely on that you've got a ride\nBut the starting pitching to appoint the brewers don't have great starting pitching they have guys that are going to go for five innings and so you're going to go into that bullpen and it might work out early in the series from Milwaukee it couldn't work out that those guys are effective early but as a serious goes on\nAnd the Dodger lineup seized those relief pitchers the last couple of games of that series the competitive advantage goes to the Dodgers 'cause they've seen all those birds really pictures and they they have an idea what's coming at them and should be able to uh to take advantage of that situation\nIn the more pictures you used a more opportunities you up for a guy to blow it to not be able to handle the situation now for whatever it's worth it it's not worth much\nOf the regular season the Dodgers didn't when the seasons serious and the number of course they put well in Milwaukee that's all the way back in July I don't think that's relevant today because it was back in July and then we'll we'll see but we we know that Joe Buck who will be eight trending topic Joe Buck will be a training topic on Twitter because\nBrewer fans aren't gonna like him Dodger fans aren't going to like him that's the beauty a job up embrace this is the great thing about Joe Buck on on Fox Sports and Fox Sports one is she knows this and he loves so it's Joe Buck John small in the booth the Fox box that rocks and Ken Rosenthal and Tom reduced\nAdding flavor for the national league championship series the\nLos Angeles Dodgers we'll win and the Dodgers even when in six games Los Angeles wins in six on the\nSeries yet again\n[noise] hey\nMan Dallas the boat clearly\nJudas Garcia right over their head\nWell then I Am not a nearly the baseball or inside of that you are but I I agree with you on this one I think the Dodgers are going to advance to the world series you're smart any and then moved to the Astros and\nNo no no no I'm On so difficult to repeat Eddie the Astros by law they're going to run into the the Boston Red Sox and you know let me say something about me and you've been with me a long time to get it for many years you were to the old timers ... is our number is going to come up before you know but we've been here a long time\nAnd or whatever it can happen in sports to make me uncomfortable is going to happen what is the most uncomfortable thing for me a Red Sox Dodgers bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing yes so we ... that it's like it's destined to happen right\nYou mean if you make a strong case where this argument that this wouldn't make my life living hell I oh I Would love it so\nI Am a occasional talk show host in Boston at the red Sox station in fact that he after the game tonight on Tuesday night I Will be hosting the post game Red Sox talk show after the game with the yeah so I'm In an awkward situation that the red Sox end up in the world series against the Dodgers this would be very uncomfortable ...\nWell it's interesting you say that because I I I Know how you operate as you said had been with you for a while I'm\nI I could see spending this as a ... is is uh when when you have no way of losing because the red Sox when you're going to go on the boss the radio station they're going to sing the praises and kiss their took us ... and do all that if the Dodgers were going to come here and do the same thing so what is true to a\nPoint but you know why\nAre you are you saying that down your your heart bleeds blue and they have to go on another radio station and sing the praises of beyond your team might actually be crying on the inside doing stuff you'd be like the clown smiling on the outside of the crying on the inside a little\nDifficult and you know a lie to you and so that's that's ... that's the the the Armageddon situation for me is Red Sox Dodgers and the world series\nBut on a positive note I Would have access to all of the games that could like fly to Boston see all although although the rest of well yeah but the red Sox would said I'd have to make two trips because I'd have to go the first two and then the last two that would be expensive\nSo maybe they'll they'll pay my way I'm sure they'll take care of that yes that would be awesome if they did that would be very nice\nSOL they will will see Roberto your production on the ...\nAh Dodgers in six ivy with human ... maybe maybe last year he said three Dodgers three they don't even need the fourth game that I Want to say that David David freezing rain mats and every did more than chase delivered able to read that I'll just do not wrong so hopefully a Dodger fan again I Am\nStanding room only honestly I had no idea David Freese is on the ... he's been playing with the dog he's all over the place been all over baseball or he's like he's rivaling man he says ... was he he did time with the cheat and currently oh yeah yeah yeah\nAnd I think fifth most all the time in post using a

after he already sandwich you've taken the sports world by storm and ah it it's it's everything that's orange like this this sandwiches is huge in origin of course as Cheetos all over\nShe does what else what ... meat is the meat or there's like orange cheese you know it's just it's just a big orange blah their actual oranges in there and I don't think there are actually oranges go with the flaming hot you to see I think those are in there too I Know I don't like the firemen I I'm a basic cheater guy ... yes I Am I'm I'm a pure [laughter] is\nIt now I Do like the crunchy more than a puff I'm more of a country she does a puff and when the ban All right thank you for that kind of [laughter]\nOf our rights group like supposed to have to spend a lot of time doing that over the years he was a big fan of that\nYeah that's a production meetings ... ... ... ... ... is the the ... now the show on Fox will take your calls eight seven seven Ninety\nNine on Fox [noise]\nEight seven seven nine nine six six thirty six and I said it wasn't that much to discuss in the Yankee\nRed Sox game because it was a route to or root\nInvolving the the Sox as they just destroyed the Yankees biggest blow out last playoff history for the Yankees sixteen to one was the final but we do have a conspiracy theory of course we do and we will get to the bottom of this area because there are some thinking that there were some shenanigans going on as well the Yankees\nNot the right so I did see the story I Will get to that uh it's a good one I think there might be something to it so we'll get to that and we'll do it next\nTo me [noise]\nThe place it makes you a rise out of your share hey\n\nThis is why you love what we are an awful\nLot of sports radio\nBut neither here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like then you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we was another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car true car also helps people get used cars\nThat's

right back with us keep putting him on the air how jealous is real talk did he gets to golden ticket to\nMe my God that is what what a package for KGB we'll get to that Bronx conspiracy we have some other legends lined up but right now let's get the latest and we say a low from the guy go Fox Sports radio\nStudios to any Garcia ethical but it was sort of this one off with some postseason baseball how about the red Sox are whipping up on the New York Yankees in their ... L. D. S. and a what a night for Brock hopes of Bo Sox huh here's the rock star with a night he's had a rock stars\nTo direct want to write down the line toward the Carter hooking\n[noise] and he has hit form a cycle for the second time in his career\nWBAI Red Sox radio number on the call and for the first time in postseason history Brock hold hits pleading for the cycle the player a done it before believe it or not Red Sox roll over the age of sixteen to one\nTo one series advantage will the YES Network where they called a Yankee all graffiti on this game or they have a a pressing no probably not but you know the red Sox scandal will likely\nDo absolutely Dodgers beat the brain six to too many shots or with a far beyond including a three run Homer he'll begin to win the game and the series they take it three games to one\nWho they think of land and it's on to Milwaukee but the Dodgers and the national league championship series Astros goes out the Indians with an eleven three when in Cleveland more when ... and ... each three RBI Houston sweeps the series\nThree games nothing and advance the American league championship series NFL Monday Night football seen some of the Redskins

I Love that drive it's wonderful you could apply that John ... yeah enjoy Hernandez the umpire original series and through the red Sox Yankees luckily the game didn't matter so no one really cared but he\nWas terrible or in last night's game three of these calls at first base were overturned by replay in the first four innings obvious game now you may not remember this angel Hernandez is suing major league baseball now for discrimination\nAnd he's one of the most amazing things that he's still work yes suing baseball and he's still on firing off\n... he's been umpiring since Nineteen Ninety three of these pissed off that he's not been a crew chief could it be may be that he sucks I dunno you decide but good news you'll be behind the plates for game for good of Tuesday's game gave me the Yankee game of the Seventeen\nHours and I know last time I was supposed to be on one of the last times on on the Boston station I didn't even get on it because the NFL playoff game between the Rockies incomes went so long that I didn't even get on with that happen tonight with the red Sox game against the A's I'm going to say no you think it will not come along the angel Hernandez [noise]\nYou know who was happy the happiest guy Joe Torre right which is how the beef between angel Hernandez as I can and Joe Torre there's this personal of beef it goes back many many years to enjoy tore was managing the Yankees and angel her name as believes there is a personal vendetta\nBy Joe ... you know I'm a casual baseball fan but even I Know angel Hernandez sucks right is he and he does he not had the reputation of being a very poor umpire\n... yeah so usually when he he's doing a game there's going to be a disagreement and it's going to involve enjoy named as he's going to be at the center of it I miss 'cause I'm a I'm a romantic any I I missed the\nDays of an umpire's like angel her name is one of my favorite memories ... as a baseball game up to the time that you Canada or it is was the ... the late great era Greg Greg the or the ... ton empire\nIn a National League championship series game against the Marlins had the most amazing magnificent strike zone ever\nA [laughter] just the most ... beautiful the catcher\nCaught it that was a strict\nIt was the opposite of that iconic scene in the movie uh was it the naked gun right Leslie Nielsen where you know everything was a ball and and this was where everything was was a ball this was evidence strike\nA live on her name is could have struck out of all all twenty seven batters could've you could've but everyone could have been a strike at that particular day I'd spend our show on Fox were coming to you from the guy goes studios Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance just visit Geico dot com free free\nRape quote so the grand conspiracy\nIt's go back to the Yankee Stadium and Ron Darling calling the game for TBS revealing that Luis Severino the Yankees starting pitcher did not\nDid not go to the bullpen to warm up until ten minutes before the scheduled first pitch is the red Sox now standard baseball protocol first starting pitchers to me ender out in the bullpen a out towards the bullpen and dual stretching little\nA sprint exercise long pause in the outfield and there's no set hard and fast time how long the pitcher is going to warm up but in baseball parlance it's generally twenty twenty five minutes or so\nIs the amount of time most pictures on average warm up Luis Severino didn't show up till ten minutes before the first pitch this led to speculation some of the New York media from what I we're being told here speculating that Severino wasn't even in the ballpark when he was supposed to be in the ballpark I find that hard to believe\nBut he did not show up until late\nThe Yankees are circling the wagons Aaron Boone said he had no issue was separate those warm up time the Yankee pitching coach also backed up stood by his picture there said there's nothing in the central there's nothing to see I'm paraphrasing some of this\nUh but they were all circling the wagons about ... and I love when ... was asked after the game about why he showed up ten minutes late and sit on the broadcast\nRun darling made a big deal about this Severino that said who is he he said when asked about Ron ... comments\nAnd he said he is not the pitching coach he's not here all the time whatever he said this is from several Reno he is not always in our bullpen how does he know when I came out I came out for the game like I usually do\nIt again the Yankee personnel backing us up Larry Rothschild the longtime pitching coach he was right there is it you know usually a separate basically they claim he he warms up in the bowels of Yankee Stadium and then goes out to moving what'd you say plausible\nPlausible explanation\nHere's where it gets a little murky\nA former Yankee a former Yankee catcher John ... who is part of the state run Yankee broadcast team in the post game show for the Yankees\nAre he indicated and it's certainly intimated that that this is not normal\nOr he said there is no way there's a quote from John floating on the Yankee broadcast you said there's no way that you can go on a big leap open mount eight minutes before the scheduled first pitch and expect to be ready\nI he indicated but yeah the Yankees are all sorts of ways now part of the conspiracy ... there's two parts to it\nOh one is that Severino showed up late or he wasn't aware of what time the game was that's the that's the other angle to it ah and then there's also the the layer of why several Reno was left him again this is what you really have to go deep state Severino came out he was not good the first three innings\nAnd he then came back out in the fourth inning and Aaron Boone left him out there to get shelled by the red Sox so some are wondering if this was some kind of mess I I don't I Can't believe I cannot believe\nAlthough I really want to believe\nThat Aaron Boone chose to sacrifice a playoff game which now put the Yankees on the brink of elimination but the conspiracy theory part of it is that the one of the reason they left ... out there is this punishment because he was not prepared for this particular study toss them back out there in the fourth inning\nAnd the the Red Sox kept going run after run after run after run after run after I was a\nCongo line around the bases\nThe game was over after it was over after the fourth any Yankees have this this uh supposedly amazing bullpen and all that\nUseless\nSo them out of showing it I didn't run down and said something's over the weekend that something that bothers some people are well yeah well one dogs the Mets broadcasters to the Yankee people don't like him because he's an enemy an enemy of the state let's go to New York and we say hello to real talk\nBoom boom boom boom\n[laughter]\nI'm real\nWhat I\nWas out there like Harry is looked at that they're real park ready to go\nMy
