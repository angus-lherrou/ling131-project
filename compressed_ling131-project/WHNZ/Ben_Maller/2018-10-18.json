I may play you decide on replay because you know what I Can't see that there's no way ... even ... west there's no way he saw that there's no way he saw no chance and he's and he's he's being typical Joe West in his explanation on\nYour here get only got angles\nYou're guessing that the fan reached over know that there's\nEvidence of one of the fans in the front row he's got a brace themselves that there's some bodies flying in batches getting about about the crash in but there's no evidence of that reaching over ... into the stands\nAre they in ads for more drama\nAnd now the red Sox go up three games to one we had twice up and throwing yet kimbrell potentially a turning things into a dumpster fire man you had all the twists and turns you want to continue ... once by Jackie Bradley junior another couple of RV eyes yeah with two outs\nMeaning should get a phenomenal series and well we'll see how things blow\nI think he's gotten more ... more RBI this series then he had an entire month of September but that's about right\nYeah I mean that you're three stars of the night for the boss all we're doing like hockey yeah sweet your three stars of the night Jackie Bradley ju yeah\nAndrew Ben intend no question about it\nCountry Joe ...

[noise]\nWait are they calling an out they're calling announcer Springer goes back to first base their car out of out\nOf all to mail out there too often the ending of spring or is that first base [noise]\nYeah that's the accurate call and\nYou know you hear ... I hate to say this is a lot of people that I like and radio who are being exposes fraud they don't know baseball they don't watch baseball Joel West made the absolute correct call and the reason we ripped Joel West a million times everyone does\nPut country Joel West in a hostile stadium with a bunch of crazy Texans all around him had the the machismo to get the call correct movie batch was denied the home run and\nI Love these ex bought it was horrible and that's why the Astros lost because of first inning call which by the way is absurd\nFight because why the Astros tied the game so that defined the game that first did it take you know is it what is the correct call that was the right call I don't\nWant to hear the Astros came back and they shipped away I chipped away at all that and they work themselves back\nInto the game they worked in the cells back into the game loser yeah it's the losers limit blamed Joel West blame good old country jaws here for more of the participants in this how about AJ Hinch the\nAstros measures you going to be on the hot seat for losing this year is the way the Astros are losing his embarrassed ... lost his way that you buy him I guess he's not that great a manager after all without that extra help huh yeah are they use a AJ hinge asked about what happened you'll hear the question the answer\nIs your what did you think of the call on I was able to be what do you think uh what what what is what I see I saw fan interference of how does a couple of times that's right I was a name that's what I can say deemed the fan reached over [noise]\nDirector of the ball looked like he was going to leave\nWe assume and you can assume a lot of credible actually we assume he's going to make the facts are cash shoving as high as he can and [noise]\nOnce the fan reaches into you know pass a line of the fence there we're going to penalize hitters\nYeah and that's the way it should be that's what grownups do Joe West is going to\nGo [noise] we got a lot of children that don't obey fall and Joe ... says the adult in the [noise]\nHere's Alex for\nVisit from the other side the red Sox measure I'm sure out score will say it was a terrible call it should've been an al ... home run right yes no\nDon't call it out right away I saw the replays and I know the boundaries of all that and I was pretty sure that it was going to be called out you know even reach 'em a fan's he was actually ... when the when the wall so that is a role and we got yeah\nYeah so [noise]\nSisters are dumb people when they explain here okay 'cause I can help you out you're not that bright okay here's why that was the correct\nCall if you go to the major league baseball rule book rule three point one six I Love reading rules when I got in radio for Reed rules but rule free point\nOne six if a spectator\nA spectator interference clearly prevents a field or from catching a fly ball the umpire shall declare the batter out\nGone that's it nothing else ...\nWould have caught that ball that old dude from Houston interfere with the great ... he should never be allowed in an Astros game again he should be banned from all major\nLeague baseball stadiums what kind of cool um activities this guy doing how dare him\nThat's a criminal act by the way we what are you doing OK serious will keep us with a great defensive outfielders and he would have made the case now\nThere are these conspiracy theories eyes blood was closed he opened it up he was hoping to go up is what he was going to do we know it was open the glove\nJust say All

back\nIt's great part of town here that's what the commissioner's office was doing rather than investigating but it was a thorough investigation by major league baseball I asked her yeah yeah you know President Trump wishes that major league baseball would investigate his activity rather than the ...\nGoing on for over a year you know baseball nothing nothing not thorough investigation no wrong

sent over yet [noise]\nIt's torture the Astros there'll be tortured because I imagined Berlin Wall pitch a great game and you expect the Astros win that game which means the red Sox within have a big celebration back if any way but you know what happens when you assume so it could be that you assume overland is going to pitch great\nBut I remember last year in the world series the Dodgers ended up winning both games he started right they didn't know that that game to where they would have his was shut or whether they should have one that's right but they got 'em and game six right yeah they say they want it yeah I I consider game to win\nYeah I'm pretty sure Marwan Gonzales cheating to hit that home oh yeah yeah right yeah I think what happened was somebody gave him a sign there was rhythmic clapping I asked her a dog out or how was your bank the trash can\nYeah I was at that game I I think I heard some kind of weird clapping I did too that's right a door baseball to thorough investigation I'm sure there was nothing going on there at all\nNo no no no this is one of those ... things in life that right after the Astros were told the knock it off they suddenly have been terrible I mean we're\nWe're we we were just a quick I never thought of that yeah it's a quickie dig it is you know yeah they ah game one or you shouldn't be doing that and all\nOf a sudden la la la

a pandemic it is now\nI Would put this on par with what the NBA has had the last couple of years where players are Jerry rigging the schedule except this is a playoff now I you know in the NBA playoffs players missed games during the regular season now the ... the reason they started the NBA season way before they should have started the NBA season\nWas because they wanted to get more days off because the many of the NBA players are delicate little flowers and they you know they can't work back to back days because they they actually just they melt when they they play back to back this and so that's become a thing and the Jerry rigged the schedule\nTaking healthy days off to rest up for the playoffs a and it's it's absurd\nRight but this is also absurd Rob Manfred and the powers that be me to nip this in the bud and they won't do it\nBecause they don't do anything they sit on their hands that's baseball's management style to sit on their hands while saying we don't like the

the of the Dodgers lined up and so they decided well we'll help 'em out we'll put weight my way out there for five pictures I'm also convinced\nThat the brewers the Dodgers are in their head so much being a spit roasted here recently that\nThey are convinced every single player to Dodger uniforms dirty I and there's this great injustice against the Milwaukee Brewers by these players led by many Machado and friends or even the first\nDating there was a play at second base max Muncie tagging the runner Lorenzo Cain and Kaine pushed me off the usually pass the bags stupid that's what you did\nComplain whining and complaining\nAnd all that ah but the Dodgers are winning the mental warfare part\nOf the ... the series is what they're doing and its greatness is what it is\nThey have to because they are not a dominating offensively they're making some very marginal pictures look very good is what the hell let's hear from the the the man of the hour here the one that complains about everything Craig council and he explains his disingenuous this on his decision\nAnd with the five page starting pitcher weighed Miley\nYeah that's all we were going to do all along the way it is going to pitch game six you know we if we went down three one we were considering having away pitch this game [noise] you know other than that this was this kind of what we were\nWere decided we're going to do\nYeah who's going to pitch game one of the world series well you have to ask the Dodgers that cause the brewers will be watching so David Robertson the\nKey for analytic department will have the decision\nTo make on that oh here's more from a Crick out there who admits he's ... at least I'll give them this he's in meeting the brewers just aren't good enough so they're trying to do that especially when\nPush the rules they're trying to get match ups were trying to get matchups there are very tough team to get matchups against and um we were able to get what he said matchups\nYeah how's that going count with that Bozo ... seriously I'd be embarrassed I I Would literally be embarrassed and I was a big we measure doing it and what what do you do what are you doing oh\nCars that hide your product and they'll put them on a cell\nTower real tough on that map I I I Love I Love I Love says you're you're the\nOnly governor corners show he rides you know you\nDon't mind cooking on track and wondering what how do you also that of course when he was going to say you don't have a different then you're going to find that I Know you've written a like a couple of months ago he was begging fucking nicknamed up that late mentality\nYou [laughter]\n[noise] but I make the podcast coup no ... okay well that's another reason you sent home [laughter]\nWow because I think that was going to make the park yeah do you mean we'll talk so oh yeah that's right well ... yeah yeah yeah I think he locked himself their first when I was taken aback by that\nHe is he how you keep using were obsessed he's such an obsession with Chris in Houston and Tammy in Montana he's got this preoccupation with these people it's fascinating\nWhen they reel to reel talks on our we've got to have my ... on that\n... that was some some serious vitriol that yeah that was not made up for the radio that was from the core I hate you\nKind of stuff [laughter]\nSo terrible that works up by a like a

the key members of the amount of Moshe a branching out doing podcast who would get more downloads though\nReal talk or Christian Houston\nWho win the podcast download battle between these it'd be real

for a free diagnosis one eight hundred six one seven one\nThan the charges but I'm going to bring up a story that I I don't know if I've told this before but the late great Tommy Hawkins he passed away recently us up to me is ... maybe it was two years ago maybe last year\nI forget exactly what but Tommy Hawkins was an executive with the Dodgers but before that he was a basketball player in the NBA and one of the nicest people I've ever met in professional sports was Tommy Hawkins\nAnd Tommy one time told me a story when he was with the Minneapolis Lakers I Want to tell you how life where there was a different time rides back in the Nineteen sixties but Tommy Hawkins was on the Minneapolis Lakers for one year and then the franchise relocated to Los Angeles\nAnd so Tommy Hawkins was on the original LA Lakers team when they move from Minneapolis\nAnd he told me how people didn't care about the Lakers when they moved to LA and it was so bad and the Lakers you know such a hokey time I guess in sports history and ... and just in life\nThat Tommy Hawkins said that he and some of his teammates\nBefore games the day of the game\nWould go on a flatbed truck with a bullhorn and they drive around neighborhoods in Los Angeles inviting people to come out and see the Lakers play that night against the\nWhoever the Cincinnati Royals in St Louis hawks in the Syracuse Nationals and and no tell me out because he he the way he told the story was romanticize those were good memories for him it was a different time and all that now the Lakers are\nAre you know again not my my choice but other people seem to enjoy them and they have a a pretty decent following how can you imagine Philip Rivers and Gordon and these\nGuys in both uh getting on a flatbed truck the morning charger game with Pearl horn saying come out and see the chargers this afternoon when we take on the Denver Broncos [laughter]\n... those were different times I into those were different times but the real question is do the NFL Owners have the\nPatience to wait this out I say no I no\nOne has patience anymore we the the old line of goldfish has more patience than we do a ... the way they pay attention they pay attention longer than we do\nA their attention span so the planet been for this man those family to eventually sell the team they anticipated the value would skyrocket in the LA mark has happened I is it ever going to happen what we don't know yet\nIt could turn around the charges of a pretty good team this year and they certainly looked like they better chance to win the AFC whatnot when the AFC West 'cause the the chiefs will but they have a chance in the wild card berth in the AFC so you'd be playoff team\nAnd we'll see how that shakes out but what is the endgame let's say the chargers don't turn this around the people just don't buy it and the people from San Diego the boycott now the assumption many are making is that moved back to San Diego\nThat's not a lot I I Would say there's less than twenty percent chance of that I'm going to give you a wild scenario which is nice good blow your mind okay how about this year\nThe chargers moved to Las Vegas\nHow about and the lemons hours which by the NFL they say you know what the people of Vegas would support the charges because it's new it's professional football they go out and support the charges why don't we just put the raiders in LA with them re [noise]\nAbout that [noise] like one out of getting a standing ovation from\n[noise]\nWe have record Ralph here somewhere he's using a sandwich van ... exactly what I was going to say right now no job really\nIt wouldn't it wouldn't work van [laughter] why not wet blanket coup aloof why not well while I I Do believe that LA would welcome the raiders with open arms would already have I don't think that Vegas would welcome the charters I think you're wrong they're not they would the chargers are two\nLame from Vegas [laughter] ... yeah they don't they don't have that I mean as much as I hate the raiders\nThe chargers don't even have that same kind of swag Iran's the brand now the other thing is is\nYou know how many have you ever go outside outside the strip coup have you ever been in where people actually live life in Vegas not in the strip where they actually have like normal houses in ... yeah ... areas yes yeah regular people I guess but you want to you want to appeal to\nSo I mean sure maybe they'd have like a a fan base of all the people that live in Vegas but you\nIf you move your team there you want the tourists you want you know everybody that's coming to gamble people cope with people would go to Vegas to see what would the chargers play anyway we'll be the same thing like in LA when they go to Carson and I'll tell you I'll tell you this what\nWhen I heard the raiders you're going to Vegas I thought awesome like yeah I go to Vegas all the time I'm totally down to just you know kept a raiders game\nHave no interest in seeing the chargers game the lessons against the Broncos okay fine\nNo but my\nPoint is this like they you know you've got a sure thing if the raiders if they put the teams at the eleventh hour and said you know what would you can put the raiders in LA\nThe colors don't even sound like Vegas the powder flew into my ... oh my God and black and silver that's vague it used\nTo have slot machines with the with those uh uh ... you know lightning bolts huh you know\n[laughter] them it'll be up in the room is your your man you're you're ... you wouldn't want it\nBut I think rocky does not want the the raiders infringing on the rams territory but if the other owners say a ... you you have to do it because that's just the way it is and you know you're\nWell we'll we'll cut your deal you won't have to pay the full relocation for yourself out there yeah there you know ... like same clock he's got more money than anybody has his own little like Wall Street deal he's got going on here he is really the biggest\nIndependent landowner ... in the United states the other than the you know the government on to the mostly in the United states but I Believe stand ... is the biggest non government
