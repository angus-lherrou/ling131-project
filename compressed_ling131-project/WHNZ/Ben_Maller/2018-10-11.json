listened to this\nBack and forth this could new drilling between Jimmy Butler and Rachel Nichols here on the ah reported cracked I'm sure butler was blindsided or he was blindsided that word repeated everything is agent told what to say listen to it\nA lot of it is true but you gotta think haven't played basketball and in in so long how so passionate and I uh I Love the game I don't do it for any other reason except for it to compete and go up against their best to try to prove that I can hang so all my emotion came out at one time\n[laughter] so where I Am going to do radio\nAll my emotion comes out through the microphone saga so I'm stuck in the two AM six AM slot east coast time ah here's more from from Jimmy Butler and uh you you have cooked food and you have on cooked food and let's see which one Jimmy ...\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control of that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me Rob me at my finest me and my curious

and delicious or here's one more from a Jimmy Butler you hear the question\nAnd the answer boy this is really over the top I Need to take a shower simple\nBecause he went back and practice [laughter]\nI think people think that I Would say that [noise]\n[laughter]\nWell it could be it could be but uh do I think so no 'cause you got to be honest you have been on here like I Know I'm being

absorbed drama queen and I'm Glad the guys get a basketball but let's just as embarrassing\nDoing listen I get it [laughter] [noise] so do you\nAh party Shannon was no one last layer to the the Jimmy ... conspiracy which isn't even a conspiracy it's I Believe to be fact uh the planting of a story\nI read body language okay that's what it is\nA hobby I unfortunately radio you cannot read someone's body language world blind all we have is our ears your wellness together or we can do is here I did this the platform is audio we don't have any photos but I was able to watch the interview and they have a saying when you read body language for the face the eyes or the window to the so\nIt's an old saying you've probably heard that over the years maybe your mom told you your grandma your answer your uncle or maybe nobody told you but I watched this\nAnd I notice Jimmy Butler often looking down okay that's what I notice what does that tell the eyes were looking down at several points what does that mean generally speaking downcast eyes are a sign of deception\nOr lying\nYeah go back and look at it wasn't always looking down but he was kind enough he was holding linking the NBA fan and a lot of them bought it they loved it\nThey want more and more and more and more and more and again I like Jimmy but I Want them to be on the clippers but this was the end of the absurd is with his was this whole day I mean what are we doing here what are we doing All right let's say hello to Edmund Dallas\nWe really are see\nI just want you know back when I say the things I say on the radio I Do not have any control over that it's just me being a competitor wanted to be the best I can be you being raw Eddie you being right editors who I Am where you want me to do [laughter] no control\nDo back I mean seriously what does that I I don't like I don't you just I Can't stand that kind of stuff\n[noise] well there's plenty of any sport so I Know a wide receivers in the NFL it NBA players\nBut I have like a love hate thing 'cause I I like the showmanship yeah these celebrate but then like when I Want to hear that interview I was like wow this guy's a real I mean what a ... to water loony tune this guy she ... she\nLike\nHow can you not anybody with critical thinking we know this is the day which stage just to me just say hey this is our staged act\nTo get some attention it all worked ... down Rachel Nichols flew to Minnesota\nYou know it was crazy about this man was didn't happened yesterday when there was like postseason baseball or going out on a day where there I don't know there really wasn't anything going on\nI was just about a mile I pointed out you've got to fill a twenty four hour news cycle you have no games the preview and your games and tomorrow is you know ...\nYeah what's happened to work out perfectly yeah it's great tremendous timing to help out programming at certain networks are networked who 'cause we here we are hey look at the Capitol stupid I'm Talking about it uh [laughter] we there we are anyway All right well that's I feel better and I think today you believe members of the ...\n... to people contacted me and they say name names than what one of them I'll tell you one Danny in Nashville that's one about that I'm not surprised just dopey fell for it 'cause he also thinks Peyton Manning's innocent so we know he's not that not that bright\nLacking a little bit in that department critical thinking then he's a little behind them that's bad job by him\nBut anyway All right well we'll take your calls if you want to be part it listen let's try to get some new people it's not an official movie night we're not saying it's official movie night but we're okay we're new people were good with new people\nAlthough be careful

the other guy\nAnd ah yeah they're trying to ... trying to do would ruin the show yeah they do they yeah they exceeded yeah I mean that's pretty much wrap\nAlways good to end the four hour show

mean that's just bleeping me you know that you know that's that's how I work and so when I go out there in the court and I've been wrong and all that but that mom of mentality\nDoes your mother has always make my last shot and I like to always finish with a pretty good segment radio because I feel like okay now I can come back and do more good radio but we have a crappy segment of radio at the end you're convinced every other segments going to suck\nThat the rest of your life is going to be terrible segments of radio mind numbing we boring cliche field\nA boring interviewed type radio you

or when he got out of jail you got to be good for a while don't you usually that's how that work\nYeah I mean we are that is how it works out I don't I don't know if he's still on probation or not but what I Would think that he's still a required to check in with people\nEvery now and then my theory is that this is not a big deal I'll tell you why because he was offered a plea deal by the authorities there and he chose not to take well he does make great decision like ... that's the result MSL or those types of\nUh uh I'll I'll never forget when Lenny first got arrested we were doing

[noise] download it now [noise]\nFox Sports trending\nDid they deny that the team is planning on relocating to London\nIt just said it's a district is simply just going to appoint bogus claims and all that ongoing nonsense but then there was no it's not true there were said that\nAh at all now keep in mind\nThe mayor of London is on record as saying we would welcome with open arms in NFL\nFulltime the NFL itself would be\n... wonderfully happy if an NFL team relocated to learn the ugly truth is\nThat Roger Goodell and his minions are in many ways in cahoots on the relocation situation you've got to think of\nThem as accomplice like the look out\nOr the getaway driver if you will in this because Jacksonville is the forty seven figures TV market in the NFL the populations around nine hundred thousand it's been a dormant franchise until recently not able to convert\nMany fans outside of Duvall county in the jags fans and the belief is that the\nNFL in London would be sitting it's kinda like sitting on oil reserves that could be worth billions or trillions of dollars and so the NFL would would like to get that now we used to matter map\nIf Jacksonville has a population of about nine hundred thousand not all of them are football fans London has a population of eight point eight million\nSo a lot of potential ticket buyers people who can buy merchandise if they have a London type names something that is\nTo the to the locals their local pride a if you will know this is a different set up I've been told over the years but people that have lived in London or live there now that it's different it's you know the the mindset is not that there are neighborhoods of London versus other neighbors they have the the soccer clubs\nThey play each other so it's not the same as here where it's always city pride no it's broken up into different neighborhoods in parts of London\nOr so it's it's not the same set up but still the NFL's banking on that\nAre working work yeah and then they're counting on people not only from from London but other parts of Europe flying into Heathrow to go check out games and and just generating cash for\nThe last thing here so I say Ninety percent Ninety percent that the\nJags we'll be moving to London should the jags continued to be good on the field that makes it more difficult\nBecause you very rarely see teams that are good relocate usually have to suck for a number of years and then people just like you just stick it out here but that's the short ... right that's the short game that who knows how long they're going to be good the long game is something more than a ferries\nAnd the the only hope and this is my theory is the Hail Mary defense for Jacksonville the only way shot con does not move the franchise is if he is forced to sell the team\nSo you got to find some dirt on con meaning some kind of fraudulent business practices after all the guy's name is Khan argue make card I mean I think a top man how hard could that be\nSo this could actually happen ...

gonna\nWait it out and see if we can get a little more money now he's under contract with the cubs for three more years for rookie of the year two time all star in and out and be\nYeah I have two thoughts on this first of all his Asian and Scott for us yeah so that's my first buddy and secondly I Believe part of this is payback\nBecause remember a couple of years ago when he was the minor league player of the year for the cubs and yeah he was a whole middle average yeah the only thing they held him back in the minor leagues because they wanted him not to become a free agent which is now standard practice they got to save him for an extra year by leaving in the minor leagues for a month\nBut I got to think that he has a little bit of a grudge though because of that so what's the the point ... and you know it's also wise to wait and see what happens with Bryce Harper and made him a child or to see if they break the bank and then you can break the\nBank I say that he's definitely doing the right thing it's just again with when you're off for two hundred dollars and you're like oh wait and see if I get more\nThat's how I operate when Fox approaches yes I Know I Will
