give her credit council I'm the brewers crediting the home crowd at Miller Park is\nAnd a better future the Oakland Raiders we'd love to have the raiders in LA no of course she couldn't land them what a bummer\nBut let's actually take a closer look at twenty sixteen 'cause this is where the problem was how war they twelve and for\nYou take a closer look and you realize nine of those twelve wins we're by one possession or less\nThey played eight games all season against teams with a winning record\nThey played three playoff teams all year long\nAnd we're one in three because they played Kansas City twice the one when they had against the playoff team was the Houston Texans and ... who was a disaster that season\nYou start to look around at some of the other close games that year opening week\nAgainst the New Orleans saints the raiders lose that game if they don't converge on a to point conversion late in New Orleans and then the saints missed a field goal as time was expiring\nYou look at another close game that year a couple of weeks later at Baltimore they were trailing with under three minutes left to go in the game\nThere was another field goal game later in the year against the Carolina Panthers the raiders were trailing in the fourth of that game there was another field goal game against the awful than San Diego chargers that the raiders one on a Sebastian ... field goal\nWe overrated this team\nWe completely misjudged the Oakland Raiders\nThink about it\nWhen do we get the most disappointed because everybody's disappointed in the raiders right we all thought they had something and now it's all John Gurdon spoiled when do we get the most disappointed\nWhen there's expectations that are really really high every time like there's a difference between getting flake down by somebody that's dependable and getting slapped down by somebody who you know is a flake you sort of bacon that in to making your plans that night\nYou got a buddy who never shows up sometimes or or it doesn't show up sometimes you get a buddy that's never on time or you've got a buddy always cancels last last minute you sort of bake that into that night's plans your call another buddy and say uh yet uh Tim supposed to come over and eight o'clock but it's Tim so who knows what will be nine thirty or he won't show up at all\nBut it's the dependable ones the ones that you don't expect\nThat gives you the most disappointed our assumption was the raiders were the next big thing the next great franchise they were it and it was all based on one year because of one season when a lot of things went there a way that year\nOutside of the car injury every bounce went there way this schedule was set up perfectly close games in which they won two point conversions Les Mis field goals laid a lot of things when the Oakland Raiders way\nThat season and because of that we all assumed that it was a sign of the times it wasn't we overrated that team\n\nThe disappointment that everybody's feeling about the Oakland Raiders now we're all poking fun at John grew in us to a hundred percent John ... no it's not it's our fault as well too\nBecause our expectations were completely out of whack\nJust go take a closer look at that season I just broke it down for you\nThink about that year and then think about you know really were they not good because if you look at those games and you take a closer look there's a lot of laws on that team of all playoff teams they had the second lowest point differential all season long\nBut we were so enamored with twelve and for and the idea that the raiders were back then we overlook that and now we blame John ... like he's the reason the franchises is where they're at no no where are the reason the expectations for the franchise where they were at\nWe got this wrong and if you're a raiders fan you can think back to that season you know a lot of that twelve and for was an illusion you know which if you're honest with yourself\nDeep down you understand going back a couple of years\nYeah there were a couple of those games you probably shouldn't have had you know a couple of those things didn't go our way we can all talk about what a bummer it is a deer car was lost late in the season and I agree that would have been a blast to see the raiders in the playoffs at full strength would their car because they were the ... the most enjoyable team to watch that year\nBut you got to be honest about what you saw and you've got to do the research and you've got to do a little bit of digging it's not on the surface you can't go by box scores you can't go buy records\nGo look through those games\nWhen you do that you realize yeah we over we overrated this team that's what we're bummed out about them that's why it's a surprise\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio uh you can get me on Twitter at

four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which way is easier\nOr coming up in about Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio we will have a conversation\nAbout some very very bizarre behavior here in the world of sports and stuff that needs to be discussed right it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it needs to be talked about I Will be the one to do so that coming up hearing about Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio so every single week here on the show we started doing this a couple of weeks ago\nUm there's ... you you were infiltrated your brain is infiltrated with stories and narratives and reports and sources and everything else that goes on and sports talk\nRadio all throughout the week but there was one man who can clear it all up there as one man who can let you know whether or not their actual stories of importance or whether or not you should take 'em all with a grain of salt and that man is me [laughter]\nSo many stories in the world of sports than most of them are a complete waste of time she um she reports [noise] let's get kinky here's some of the big stories from the last week but Joan is the real question [noise] do you\nCare [noise]\nWe turn it over to our executive producer Mike mayor [noise]\nWho if he doesn't pull this segment off it's going to be the last time he does it I'm Serious it's going to be over for for my ... doesn't pull this off year it's and that's a wrap attracted to the show doesn't go well for my marriage the last one of these friday and Saturday shows he's ever going to do here with me all my foot down on the ground on man not messing around\nAre well explain that joke later on aren't so Mike mayor or what do we got as far as stories in the world of sports in the past week\nAll right so let's start off with one that happened actually today out of the NFL or my Cleveland Browns the Cleveland Browns treated Carlos Hyde to the Jacksonville Jaguars for fifth round pick joined us do care\nI don't I don't give him about Carlo side to the Jacksonville Jaguars I mean look at letter for nuts banged up um there's it clearly there's something more going on with Leonard for that but I don't think Carlos Hyde makes a difference in Jacksonville I don't think it does anything to to Cleveland there was a log jam their running back so to me\nKind of a non story in the NFL next\nAll right let's sort of oh what's it continue with this one a Jimmy Butler home debut deny are not home debut home a first game since all the chaos in Minnesota for for some gives so he was booed\nAnd then got envy peach ... do you care [noise]\nYeah I I I actually do care um and I actually want to get into this a little bit later on because I'm really really confused as to what the plan was there like I\nThink I make up your mind man ... what ... what what happened there were they silver when the game started and then bombed when the game was over and they forgot everything that happened in the off season it just I don't know I don't I don't I don't get it I Do want to get into it later on because it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense and that's\nAll right John this is an interesting one I Would have major league baseball former New York Yankees manager Joe Jr already was in contention for the reds manager job but to yet today or yesterday he pulled out of the managerial search joined us do you care\nDon't you know I I'll come on man reds managerial jobs I mean come on [noise]\nYou know this I mean this brings me up to a funny story Andy ferman who's a Fox Sports radio legend deer Fox Sports radio host you hear him every Sunday Morning after I go off the air ... for bag is one of my good friends and the rate in in the business one of my good friends period\nHe went on the air with a story a couple of years so funny [noise] we're doing a morning show together and he goes on the air\nBecause one of his neighbors because Andy lives near Cincinnati and he's really connected he's alleging there Chris Collins worth his first radio partner his first partner in sports media period was Andy farm\nSo and ... gives ... shot out in his book and says anti taught me everything I wanted to know about uh sports media and so they're ... you know to this day Chris ... who are still gives them credit for and he's really connected in Cincinnati and he comes out with this report and says by the all star break the\nReds are going to fire their manager and they're going to hire I I Believe it was they're hitting coach or the or somebody from the front office is going to come out [noise]\nThat guy was there another two years\nI was like he went on the air force had everything going with it he went on the air that after that I just couldn't I stopped caring about who the reds manager was going to be an anti can't get it right I have no interest in talking about it next\nAll right so you talked about are the ... in the last segment Jonas but this was one of the more interesting stories that we can game for the fiesta when running out of play in the tenth inning many Machado collided with the Seuss Aguilar Jonas did you\nI did because at first I thought man what a dirty play by many Machado what does he tried to ensure the guy and then you realize that ... are kept his foot on the back for an extended period of time if you watch him when he makes a I I catch it first base\nBecause all we're basing our opinions on his two thousandth sixteen which the more you step back from it even with ... looks like a fluke here\nSo I just I I I don't think that you can actually\nIt take you know did this criticism of John ... put it solely on John good and we got to accept some responsibility we expecting them to be good based on one season but if you actually do the research you realize yeah they weren't all that great to begin with I'm All right so coming up about\nTen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio there is another NFL situation\nThat is really really bad and a lot of people are surprised by it but I Will tell you why you should not be okay to completely different organization a completely different franchise and some bad things going on so we'll get to that here ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio do won't let you know we are brought to you by discover card\nBecome a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more at discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nSo there was a very very bizarre behavior in the world is sports on friday night and it was in the NBA\nSo the Minnesota timber wolves had their home opener and it's been kind of a strange off season for the Minnesota Tim rules by the way they won the game so congratulations\nTo the Minnesota timber wolves there on the board a big win a holding a just a just a tremendous defensive effort by the Minnesota timber wolves holding the LeBron less Cleveland Cavaliers to a hundred twenty three points\nBut it's been a strange off season in Minnesota and\nYou know the Jimmy butler stuff and not wanting to be there and then calling a practice and there was a he took the third team and they dominated the first team and then I just miraculously there happened to be a sit down interview right afterwards almost like it was all choreographed just typical MBA drama\nAnd so it's been a very very bizarre offseason Jimmy Butler clearly doesn't want to be in Minnesota up you would have signed the extension and there wouldn't have been all this talk and all this friction deadlines and teams that he wants to go to and all the all the stuff that's gone on so home opener\nFriday night and the fans did something that a lot of people expected they boot Jimmy Butler I get it you know you're pissed off of the guy didn't want to be there you boom mic solve a sense in the world um [noise] then they boot Tom tip into the coach I\nGuess that he's making the personnel decisions and you're not happy that he wasn't able to trade Jimmy Butler and it's a bad situation I get all\nThat then they also boot Kevin Love who hasn't been on the team for years but uh they decided they were going to boot Kevin Love also ... and then they came back later and they were giving Jimmy Butler MVP chance before the game\nLet me tell you what that is that's the fast food drive through when you're hammered your order never makes sense none of it makes sense\nYou ever pull into a fast food drive through obviously you weren't driving 'cause you're not that dumb but you're in a new ... or a buddy is driving designated driver\nIf you order cheeseburger it's fine you order a sign of fries\nIt's understandable cheeseburger fries makes all the sense of the world um you also didn't need the jalapeno Poppers the onion rings the chicken sandwich\nAnd shake you didn't need any of that\nYou would never order all that when you were sober it doesn't make any sense of the world it's like you just now noticed the dollar menu when you're rich and you side you know why don't we just get that whole left side I Will go with that a couple of breakfast sandwiches way too much food you're never going to eat at all\nIt's going to the rappers going to be open you're going to pass out and by the time you wake up in the morning the breads going to be stepping stale and they tell you waste of an order it makes no sense whatsoever\nMinnesota timber wolves fans got to the game like they were hammered at a drive through and decide you know we're in a blue that guy and I'm sure it's a store here are going to pull\nHim to a and if you look at the VP chance [laughter] that makes\nSense what are you guys doing Jonah socks Fox Sports radio when we

for a buddy years only to find out now may just on medication hoops right there we go again\nSo Microsoft had to deal with all that but of course he's going to be the scapegoat he gets fired on friday\nArizona was projected to be bad before the season they were projected to be the worst team in the NFL based on over under when totals before the year they were six or six and a half I remember doing a segment on the air\nI remember talking about this that so much of a life I have that so many exciting things have happened since then but I remember the cardinals over under when total right so that on the show you who you're listening to here on Fox Sports radio but I remember doing having a discussion about this thinking man I'd hammer the over are you kidding me\nLike I I'd hammer the over there's still decent pieces on this team\nDavid Johnson and Chandler Jones and the quarterback situation better and Larry Fitzgerald and I I I I still think there's pieces on Patrick Pearson still they're like I think there's pieces on this team\nYou could argue you got to all of famers in Patrick Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald and you could\nYou could make an argument that Chandler Jones is on his way to be in the hall of fame I think he's got the most acts in the NFL the past couple of years\nI think there's there's legitimate town on the team I Would have hammered the over I had no idea they were going to be this bad I had no idea and here's the other thing you didn't hire\nYou didn't know you didn't know what this team was because you never got a chance to watch him but this just goes to show you that when you\nPlay on a standalone stage your flaws get exposed it's why so few singers are comfortable singing aka ...\nIt's ... it's what makes good tar solo so so so difficult because if you watch that one everybody hears it\nI remember playing I was in a band\nFor years and we played a long time ago at this place called the whiskey a go go artist on Sunset Boulevard out here in LA legendary spot all the bands from the eighties went there it's it's like a rock and roll Laura legendary spot there was a a part in one of our songs\nAnd we remember this because it was being videotaped at the whiskey a go go out here in Hollywood there was a part in one of our songs where the guitarist had a little bit of a guitar solo um but we didn't realize that his guitar had gone out of tune\nIn between songs and it wasn't noticeable because all the\nOther instruments were playing and before he really noticed it the song was already going so it's not like we can stop and say hey everybody quit uh we've got to make sure we're in tune and then we'll pick this thing back up you know we're not telling a TV show will get a limited amount of time and were on stage so he doesn't realize that his guitars out of tune until the songs\nGoing and he's got a solo part for about forty seconds in that song\nAll of a sudden it gets to his part and he's standing up there trying not to laugh as he's playing the most awful solo because he's completely out of tune and it's on video and you can see me on stage with my head down because I Am\nAbout to keel over I'm laughing so hard and we're so we would have never known we could have gotten through that whole song could have gotten through it all\nBut because it was a standalone stage and that was his part that's what made it worse\nThat when people screw up the national anthem if there's a band playing you could come through some of the lyrics you forget when you're doing it Super Bowl or\nAre all these other times it that somebody has gone out there it's an awful look the Arizona Cardinals were bad but you wouldn't have noticed that because they'd be piled ... with the much other games all of a sudden standalone stage\nThat pimple on the top of your head now it's in the middle your forehead hair is not covering that up unless you got a unit brow and if you do you got\nDouble the problems\nLike that was no surprise man if you watch any of their football games throughout the course of the year that was no surprise my McCoy getting fired you can make the claim that off and he's got to go what part of that is because now everybody else saw how bad you were\nThat was the reaction to it Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine

feeling good about themselves extra innings a walk up by Cody Ballenger man we're on a roll\nAnd they win the very next game because em obey thought it was a great idea to start a game after a Thirteen inning extravaganza a you know what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and start a this next bad boys two PM ...\nThat makes a lot of sense just like a you know setting up a\nCertain fields in stadiums where fans can reach over into play and take a ball out of the year that makes a lot of sense to but major league baseball there they're brilliant or they've figured this whole thing out so their schedule and makes a ton of sense it's kind of like one major league baseball said uh\nYou know even though the cubs and the brewers and the Dodgers in Rockies they finished tied for first in their divisions\nBut you know the cubs one of their head to head match up and the Dodgers one there had dead matchup against Milwaukee in Colorado so so clearly the solution is\nI'm a one hundred and sixty third game to decide the division which makes sense so major league baseball decided is scheduled this two PM game and so the Milwaukee Brewers came out and they were flat and the Dodgers pulled away late into the Dodgers were up three two and then they got\nTo Milwaukee and the Dodgers got smoked on friday and so now we've got a game seven\nAnd the game seven is awesome\nFor all of us who aren't Dodger fans or who aren't brewer fans I Can't wait for it I don't have a dog in the fight what do I care whatever happens happens I mean personally I Would like to see good things happen to the Dodgers organization because our flagship here at Fox Sports\nRadio am five Seventy LA sports the home of the Dodgers a lot of good people a lot of cool people that I Know and I like over there so I like it when good things happen\nBut from a fan perspective there's nothing like stress free big time sporting events there's really something to do it but if you're a fan of the Dodgers are the brewers your ... right now\nAnd the you know which you can try and avoid it you could try and not think about it you could try and get your mind off it you can do whatever you want to spend time with the family go get a couple of drinks watch comedy special you cannot escape the idea that there is a game that is going to determine your mood\nFor the next several days and you've got nothing to say about it\nNothing to say it's miserable\nAnybody who's been a fan of a team was ever gone to a game seven especially if you're a fan of a team who had somebody on the brink and then the last game six and then you went to a game seven you know exactly what I'm Talking about it is a miserable feeling\nBut us on the outside we get to sit back stress free\nWe just we just get to enjoy baseball game it's one of those things in sports that isn't it's not like anything else Elton life because if you walked by somebody and you knew they were struggling or they were having a hard time with something you stop and you try and alleviate the pain\nLike you do whatever it is to try and help them hey is there anything I can do can get you anything is there anything you do for you here we are to fan bases the Dodgers and the brewers who are miserable in anguish anticipating\nThe potential doom that's going to be presented to one of those two franchises coming up here and less than twenty four hours and you know we're all doing scout and down the hours waiting to watch I it's it's crazy mad but that's what's fun about game sevens\nIt's all on the line you get to sit back so I tell people there's something about stress free there's something about going to do an exhibition game where it doesn't matter you really want to want to care enough\nPlay some money on it but there's something about just being able to enjoy game without having to be so stressed out about it right now up until first pitch it will\nA Dodger fans in brewer fans the entire day Jonah socks Fox Sports

season games but LeBron James with the Lakers or the potential last game of the season for the Los Angeles Dodgers will have a chance to make it to the world series or will be going home\nShould they
