claim\n\nNumber three un stirring here for a good time\nTo get one more helpful\nRelease for taking the Dodgers in the world series is that they have the secret decoder ring if you will now there's no easy road to beat the red Sox but the red Sox do have a kryptonite\nAnd the Dodgers matchup really well with that kryptonite for the rest of us know what I mean the red Sox kryptonite\nThis year had been left handed pitching one of the reasons the Yankees went out and got Jay half was because he was left handed not that he was good but the the people in baseball knew the red Sox weakness was\nLeft handed pitching and Boston and had a six Ninety six winning percentage they one eighty seven of their games against right handed pitching they were just five games above five hundred against left handed starting pitcher\nAnd the Dodgers are stacked the rotation were left handed pictures like quake Kirsch law and he in general you enrich you which is advantageous for LA and you also tossing Walker viewer who's likely better than all those left handed pitcher low he's right handed\nHe's a total stood so the starting 'cause she's pretty solid as long as those guys don't choke at a time you're not supposed to choke\nThen this will go all the way to a game seven I'll take my chances with the Dodgers that's of value play in a seven game world series each team featuring pitchers who have had\nPostseason ... the patient Chris Sale who's like a teenage girl with the bad belly button piercing allegedly a he's got a courier ER I've almost six in his postseason career and who knows what you're going to get in game one\nAnd David prize is the enigma for the red Sox just because he won a playoff game does that mean that this becomes the new normal for David Price\nHe's three and nine where they are able over five in his postseason Nathan of all these been the top picture the red Sox have had this year it has been really good in the playoffs so then the other thing here the rivers the Dodgers have\nIf they can win a game in Boston which is a big if\nIt's a big of a one of these first two but they ... they have the advantage in at Chavez Ravine 'cause the red Sox are either going to have to take one of the top ... players or one of the top defensive players out of the line up\nWith no designated hitter now there's talk of moving ... who has played second base in his past that they could put him at second base in LA but that is risk because the Dodgers have this guy named mania Machado who could take out his ankle or his knee at second base and then move the\nBest we've done [noise] for the post season so you really want to go down there with an\nInexperienced second baseman but someone is going to be changing the bench who wouldn't otherwise be playing in a normal American League setting for the red Sox and it could be that they play Jackie Bradley junior and center and they put\nJeannie Martinez and been intending in the outfield and pets goes to a second but then you're playing an unproven second baseman\nAnd I would think that you would try to hit every ball to ... to make sure that he is battle tested\nIn that situation now the the partying shot on this the wild card\nIf you will for lack of a better term\nFor the Dodgers happens to be\nMany Machado and his ... taught me when I was a kid I used to watch White Sox games on television you pick the click is is Mandy ...\nThis is his final few games as a Dodger he will not be back in Los Angeles that is by mutual decision he will go somewhere else\nOr will we wish him the best you can go on and play in New York or wherever in Philadelphia where every ends up but he's only got a few games left as a Dodger but he's going to go out in style as the most valuable player of the twenty Eighteen\nWorld Series a and there's bad blood this is gonna be the story line that the mainstream baseball media follows is Machado because when he was in Baltimore\nHe got into it with Dusten input draw he actually his slide led to the demise of dust and put royal or there was being ball action between Baltimore and Boston Machado\nWas there so the red Sox have some low achieving for many\nFrom the past and there is legit that this is legit beep this is not you know how much of it is going to be contrived by the media there's something there that's real\nBut the main reason to pick Machado is passed results now pass results do not guaranteed future outcomes\nBut mainly Machado has hit over three hundred with a Nineteen eighty eight O P s in his career against for sale he's batted three forty two against Rick poor cello in his career he's batted almost three hundred against David Price Machado has raped\nAgainst the top pitchers that the red Sox are going to send out there in his Baltimore tenure so if he can play at that level in the world series this is an easy pick if he goes full Frankenstein at Fenway a place he is generally played pretty well that's a good spot\nBut outside of ... yards made him a shot I looked at him he has as many home runs at Fenway Park\nAs he does it any other ballpark other than Camden Yards he has destroyed the red socks over the years and in in particular at Fenway he's got as many home runs in Boston as he does at Dodger Stadium and he was with the Dodgers after the trade that line the rest of the year\nAnd he is not going to hustle so don't expect him to also it doesn't matter the Phillies are going to pay them the Yankees oh Pam somebody like Atlanta will step up and pay him he will break the piggy bank it's going to happen and he'll be rewarded for his lack of effort\n[noise] now in the opposite side of the table the guy that should give\nNight tremors through the Dodgers pitching staff\nIs JD Martinez this is the guy who is going to destroy the Dodgers in this series Martinez has just it just demolished Clinton courage Shaw\nWhen he was with the Diamondbacks briefly and elsewhere Martinez said almost five hundred against Clinton shower with a bunch of home runs and he's done well against review he's done well against rich hill\nOr in his career so he's the guy that is the centerpiece of that Red Sox and he's been the centerpiece all year but he has had great success\nI guess many of the Dodgers pitching so there's the ... that's it I explained it all there is no question you have no questions asked everything was laid out seven game world series much shadows your MVP much discussed of many\nAnd the Dodgers will and the national disgrace that has been Thirty years without winning the world series\nAnd they they will get that done been way too long this year but ... for he's ready to go I'm ready to go up and what does that sure you've been on it\nOr is it actually looks relievers ... says that new Dodger shirt I didn't know that the Dodgers have a new logo\n[laughter] they change their logo so unreal a we have racket Ralph\nWho is here and they use in the buildings are so Ben you're you're rooting against the Boston Red Sox that's on the record that's great\nWell not rooting against you know because you're skewing the numbers to to support your your your skewing any knows what did I say that was incorrect explained to me what I said that's incorrect going well you're pointing out that the difference between the Dodgers and the red Sox was based entirely on Toronto and Baltimore direct yes well rough if you were to take the fact that the giants\nAnd the Padres play in the Dodgers division the difference between the wins by Boston and the wins by the Dodgers over the bottom two teams in seven games in Boston was sixteen wins better this year\nA again Ralph I Know you're trying to be the country and and I appreciate that just having the which of those teams lost over a hundred games the giants the Padres which give me the theme that lost over\nA hundred as a matter of fact the giants had the exact same record as the Toronto blue jays\nGive me the the pot is muscle last like a hundred games like his Baltimore the oil is lost a hundred and Fifteen game so you think the orders are terrible you think those are equal teams are off is that in your little head their usual pi brand head that's how that works\nRound you're the one that put out the numbers and I'm the one that just showed that they don't mean squat well again it's funny when mayor hockey on numbers are going to talk about Manny Machado success at Fenway\nGoing with a Red Sox and he was with the Baltimore Orioles so how successful has he been at Fenway\nSubset Ralph why don't you don't want you to be honest we will be your series on is you're rooting for the Dodgers and that's why you created numbers to support your position do they ... they make these numbers I didn't make no numbers shows those numbers\nAre they incorrect numbers they're flawed numbers how are they flood numbers the red Sox were five games above five hundred years left everybody is that incorrect because the Yankees are not happy they do not shall we say you did they do not show the entire picture\nIt's so the red Sox have again the main routes questioning my uh research here\nNo I'm Watch our integrity my integrity really yes we'll talk shows we have great integrity Ralph how dare you ...\nYeah the red Sox had a ... Ben wants you to lose\n... rough you don't care you're you're like a pottery fan or something like that I don't like anybody oh that's a lie\nWell no one likes you that's true but when it comes to your fandom you do\nNot care that's ally\n... and it's also knowing when dope said oh don't really care it's like when all they're like political pundit say oh I don't I I Am a I have no political affiliation yes you are they're liars those people on TV they say they have no political affiliation liars and people say oh I just want to root for employers don't root for the game I don't really take because\nActually I just root for quality action that's a lot so now you know now you're a phony is what you thought he's in six Dodgers into how 'bout that done\nLike that Ralph sounds about I ... yeah and I regard as the ban now their show on Fox on Fox would take your calls eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox\nEight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine you can be part of the ... and a former Cy Young winner at CERN and then be come\nYou know what the best thing for rich rich when he played on sex and water that hit your head but natural to me to do what I can\nTalk to [laughter] to wake up one the one who were shut the door to cook just outright\nAlready a go go I thank you [laughter] that's why they do\nA ... a coup you pick you hate the red Sox you hate Boston and you hate the Dodgers\nI don't I mean I don't hate the dog I hate the Dodgers because you're a Dodger fan I think you angels ... read off misses a hell of a higher ... everyone wanted bread awesome as you got a good job\n[noise] come on man I think it's going to be a seven game series I'll stop your stealing might predict and I think of the red Sox are going to win it and in ... in ...\nYou got cursed Shaw versus sale in game one I think like you said earlier the\nBig factors ... and the ... going to play in an American league they have an advantage because you have a ... they have a lot of good hitters on the bench and then when the breath to see how the gum the Dodgers stadium it's does does it help them because they have to sit somebody\nYeah if you look at this logically I Would think the red Sox win game one the Dodgers come back and win game too and take David pricing game too soon will be squared up at one one going in the game three\nAnd that's when Walker viewer dealer we'll get to start at Dodger dogs go up to do to oh why not go for all Roberta why not do you want to go okay All right\nThat's the amount of show on Fox will press on a a ... a young enemy combatant we'll get to that\nBut this is an interesting tail will go there with take some calls as well do it all from the studios right now though\nRight over their record Ralph the convenient\nRed Sox fan for the day route for I'm not a Red Sox that's alive [noise] I'll take all the Boston hate the come your\nSending my way to all you know you pick the red Sox I didn't make apparently spinning numbers I just want to see quality action night [noise]\nYes I Do know that that's all I Want to see him we got to see it in some of the last shot in the Lakers first game\nWhat Brian James flamed step back one

years with the Dodgers in about a half a season I think it was with the red Sox\nAnd he was watching the playoffs and he noticed that Craig kimbrell\nWas taping his pitches or so he said and so what

forth Alice course at all my God oh we've\nGot something here Africa Deborah hocus pocus this is the secret and they claim the red Sox they have all of a sudden solved the problem of their closer because Eric gone yeah a and a former Dodger teammate Alice Cora got together and it was ... who identified\nBefore the pitch what pitch kimbro was going to throw based on ah some kind of

Shaw and Chris Sale\nGoing at that I wanted to address the Monday Night game I did watch the Monday Night game I did not feel it was worthy of a mile a monologue because of the complete ineptitude of the giants and the Atlanta Falcons now a lot of people a lot of gamblers\nWere very upset with the outcome of the game because the one thing that you assume was going to happen\nIn Monday Night football with these two people the bad defensive teams you assume this was going to be a shooter and that this game was going to go back and forth and that this total would end up somewhere in the fifty range by the time the game ended that this would just be a attract me\nIn Atlanta and that not only did that not\nBetween these two teams the game went way under way under the total total is fifty two and a half and they were lucky that there was a touchdown with five seconds to go in the game that got at the forty three points\nSo it was it was not even really close to being an over at any point but the giants did get the back door cover with the late touched down there if you're a gambling men you know what I'm Talking about there they were\nAt the beginning of the week when we did Benny and the venue versus the penny there were like a five and a half to five point favorite the game ended up land a favor the falcons rather favorite by five I think it was four and a half it closed at four and a half and that touchdown\nMade it a three point final Atlanta got the win but only a three point spread over the giants but the the guys getting just killed\nIs a Mr Finn Ito Mr done patch termer faith all done who made several questionable\nDecision that every coach likes to say we have this chart where there's a chart in front of us that tells us exactly what to do\nIn game situations on you know if you're in one to go for two and all that and uh sure we're I I Would assume that he had some fiery news conference after the game I've not heard his news conference but I I'm going to assume the position that Schumer was was spitting mad after the game because it was\nIt was interesting would be a word you could use you can use interesting that would be an adjective bizarro world\nBut it doesn't matter they could have Bill Belichick coach the giants and they would still blow that is a bad football team it is a poorly coach football team I'm trying to decide who is the worst coach ... or that guy in in Arizona Wilkes like I it's it's very close it's a toss up\nI spend on a show on Fox well more than ... let's say hello to see we've got\nA wreck get Ralph a who's a for some reason is still here I think and we've got Robert so and coupon theloop totally ignored a monologue you had about the raiders\nDon't you tell them I was more of a cowboy monologue ventilator monologues attributed ... the cowboys were going for\nGetting bars that have been in ... in the world series\nI never get excited about draft picks the reason I don't get upset about draft picks is because most of them are not as good as advertised and if you if you get excited about ... ... it's like being inside of you are going to win a billion dollars in the lottery\nYeah you might we had a discussion about yeah prospects and ... yeah it's I I'm Down don't like I like a proven commodity doesn't mean you get rid of everybody but if your depending it's fool's gold is what it is if you're always depending on draft picks\nAsked the Cleveland Browns who have had draft pick after draft pick in the in the greatest argument against draft picks having tremendous value is the New England patriots who for the last Twenty years\nHave pretty regularly not had any picks and the top ten top Fifteen even top twenty of the NFL Draft\nAnd yet have managed to dominate\nAnd the roster his turned over but you know what Bela Shaq has done and I give them complete credit for this\nWhat he does is he ... hours the roster of teams like buffalo and ah and other bottom feeding teams\nAnd when they have no patience and they give up on players after a couple of years pellets check then goes in and take slows players and is able to get great production out of them and they've already got two or three years experience in the NFL\nAnd it's it's a genius strategy that the Patriot act\nLike they interview everybody pitches interview everybody for the draft and then when these guys actually play they wait until they become available and you get them at a much more reasonable return on investment then you know the draft that you have to give up so much to get\nAnd you heard on the band Malley shell\nDamn right so outlook payment LeBron just missed another foul shot I'm Sorry about that LeBron he just missed another fire shot I didn't know that they could say today oh wait
