American music awards will air I told her name on ABC [noise] hard\nWon by may ... on our radio\nWhen al\nYou want to listen on our our radio I downloaded [noise]\nCourse trending\nDoes Joe Madden keep his job as cubs manage is this a fire up all the fence again that could have gone either way again that could have [noise]\nAnd have gone to the cubs had runners on base you know they didn't get many hits they had opportunities to score runs they didn't so does Joe Biden\nKeep his job you're fired\nThe answer's no Germans out that was just last game as manager of the cubs he's done\nSeal later I ended a couple of reasons why number one was not a hundred percent it's over eighty percent the chance that the cubs will say sigh and Nora ... to Joe Biden the core of the cubs is not going anywhere\nYou can pull out whoever your favorite magician is and they're not going to vanish Chris Bryant Anthony Rizzo the meat and potatoes of ... baseball is going to be back in twenty Eighteen and the\nThe old here's the old line said by many your your cat change no pliers changes manager right Joel Madden\nTalk Anthony ... bat out of a tight game in the eighth inning\nThat alone someone as a fireball fans but the cubs scored two runs in twenty two innings or pressure baseball this we must win baseball you beat the brewers on Monday you don't have to play on Tuesday\nAnd you win on Tuesday you get to play the brewers again and the cubs over to on their home field with the final at bat with the the uh the more high priced players not that that matters into the equation but two runs in twenty two innings the cut off is the last two games\nNine for Seventy one one twenty seven with two extra basis for strike outs thinking that the numbers are out there and I read this earlier that the cubs played a hundred and sixty four games this year they scored one run or fewer\nForty times that is approximately twenty five percent of called baseball ended with one Ron or know runs that's the cubs\nHorrible horrible ...\nAnd so someone has to pay the piper and that's going to be Joe ... now the other thing we mentioned this a couple of weeks ago there is believed to have been a disconnect there was a story planted that Joe Madden is not resonating\nWith the players that his shtick he stick a law as my grandfather said back in the day is not connecting that they've tune him out now I Am of the belief that the manager does very little in modern\nMajor league baseball that has been my position and I maintain that position I don't think I'm wrong in that that it's so much about analytics and setting everything up before the game that your main job as manager is dealing with the media with Joe man is good with an\nA personality right the personalities keeping the the ... away from the other shoe box\nOr in the locker room that's the job and if Joe Madden is having problems\nIn that department then that is a reason to say why we like you and and the players all seem to like him but it's just not he's not connecting with them but more importantly their bats aren't connecting with the baseball players weren't cubs uniform\nOr you're not just your mat and get fired no the second point here Joel Madden resides right there is a mutual partying other ways to go get together you I've seen and you'll man this is how it should play out right because that way Joe Madden can save face it makes sense right he you know he's he's a hero\nForever in Wrigley Field they'll never have to buy another meal on the on the north side of Chicago they love 'em forever for winning the world series\nBut the main reason that the cubs can do this year\nIs because while they're often has touched the patient\nJoel Madden can walk out of Chicago and walk right in the Anaheim there's a safe landing spot for Joe ... so it's like well the cubs agree that it's just not working out but Madden goes into Anaheim and he he was a long time angel\nCoach and scout many many years in the angels organization still has a house\nWith a just a stone's throw away from the big ha so we can go back to Anaheim Stadium he can replace my social who's done and save that morbid franchise\nA but either way either way or we know that the person who is definitely out even in addition to Madden is going to be truly Davis chili Davis has got one of the great names in baseball history the hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs\nHe is going to be sacrificed Joe Madden will likely be kicked out in a heartless cold blooded barbaric way but Chile Davis also ...\n... that is a sure thing is like Alabama beating a directional school in a non conference game by that says the same deal it's the same deal yo as they say are these the ban\nMather showing for thinking about this I gave me that that will bring in Edmond Dallas steamboat Willie\n\n... pub off fence so bad so horrible even if they won this game it doesn't take away from how horrific the pub office has been this year and this that popped up on I Believe it was the state run MLD network the cup I gave that said forty games this year the cubs scored one run or know runs\nThe team they are tied with the Baltimore Orioles\nHow many games did the Baltimore Orioles lose this yo know hundred something\nIt was like a hundred and six hundred oh like a hundred and Fifteen I didn't even realize that many they lost a hundred and fifty that's the costs tied with the Orioles they're off in a\nWhile now and I mean the way that the cubs finished the season living in the playoffs they lose at home back up not high breaker then they lose at home in the wild card I mean this is a a this is the last man is done that's it you're right you're right he does have a software in Miami spot there in Anaheim I'm I I could see that scenario exactly playing\nOut yeah a man and the big beneficiary of all this uh the the brewers and Dodgers because if you look at the the situation of the Rockies or gas going into Milwaukee so the brewers immediately should just pounds the cheese heads should just pounds all over the Rockies in that series\nYeah they were a joy that they were they were ... they were just saying go on keep going keep going on in the world series the golly downriver relax [laughter]\nThere's a great there's a great Dodger story we have to get to it too which is just marvelous it's awesome I like it or the the greatest F you are and they're spinning and it's not an F ... it was just marvelous\nAre clearly listening to the show last night Eddie but what about all the important people well I mean we pointed out I ... down on ... Shaw and or the next day bam\nDean voted the motive Clinton kosher\nWho's and really the Dodgers and he's the number three started the Dodgers thing I have more on that later this is all this is all about the cubs and the\nRockies in the wild card game and you'll be happy to know that was supposed to moon light on the other gig in Boston and I was ready to go at ten o'clock eastern time when that game was in like the top of the fifth oh they were carrying the game yeah they they carry the game so I was standing by and I never got on\nA side will get paid for this hour or so I Will be obsolete so but I'm I'm annoyed because I thought\nI was getting and I feel like I wasted a good amount of\nTime I understand it's like a you know a comedian on one of those late night shows in the ... some some you know superstar goes along and get\nBumped yeah yeah I got bumped bumped I got bumped bumped the bumpy bump that's\nAll right well more more stuff for us yes more more time for us on a much fresher now right I mean it sounds like it it's great I'm ready to go I I Love the demoralizing last you know the better stories losing Lago let's your real quick and Joe ... let's see what Joe mad at it I got a place for you to listen to the Joe ... and\n... what is he going to say about the cub office I gave you all the numbers right you know all the stats about a couple of his one twenty seven in the last two games\nTo last year may say it's twenty four strike out you're the man you're the cobs\nWhat do you have to say\nI I'm not here to denigrate anybody works put in Haiti on everybody cares they just didn't play out this way\nAnd simply we caught the ball we pitch really really well they said the esprit de corps I Can't ask for more so just so that we really up to focus on her the off season yes\nHitting the baseball [laughter] not acting like fecal matter in the playoffs I bought that art it is a ... a lot\nTo discuss it would take your calls eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine\nWere also on Twitter at Bain Mallory Roberta all their coup is in the building is well the\nEntire on alive and yeah you're on asked of of characters will get through all that\nAnd once you see it you cannot see it once you see it you cannot owns the we'll get to that and we will do it next\n[noise] things happened so fast in our world people don't know what what sort of keep up your here's what they're doing to follow us on Twitter Twitter winter winter that Fox Sports radio by forties when you win the no ...\nOh Sean says\nOf its interaction with Chile Davis he said he asked how I knew it was him and I said well your wife said your name and that is a fairly unique game so [laughter]\n[noise] ...\nI've told the story a few times over the years but surely Davis actually save me from getting my ass kicked\nWhen I was a radio reporter when I first got started the business ... years ago\nOr the uh then they were called the Southern California angels they blew like a an ... thing was eleven game lead in August the Seattle Mariners came back one year way back in the day and the angels had this dynasty they had this great line up all of that era of players and\nBut I was a radio string her and I had to get audio all the angels were imploded and they were losing like eight out of nine or ... and they could not find their way it was it was ridiculous\nAnd they ate out of line they win a couple then they lose you know nine out of ten or what it was ... and that's my memory anyway\nAnd uh there was a player who's a he passed away a couple of years ago with Tony Phillips\nWho was a hothead lead officer and a ... and he was the ... the only guy who was it was a Sunday afternoon they're playing like Milwaukee\nMilwaukee was still in the American weeks it was long time ago and Tony Phillips had like two of the three hits for the age of so I had to talk about because I had to get sound from the the losing locker room because the better stories of losing locker room so I approached Tony and uh I asked them any did oblige my interview request\nAnd I then made the fatal flaw of asking him about the angels problems are and some NO NAME pitcher for the brewers that had pitch this marvelous game and Tony was very upset\nOr he was sitting down when I started interviewing he stood up and I'm much bigger than ... all these guys I don't know at this time I'm really really big but I'm also very young\nAnd I'm I'm frightened to death that this you know multi million dollar baseball player is going to do something and I'm powerless right and so Tony Phillips stands up and start yelling and getting in the fighting close right and he's like speeding I and I'm like\nOh I don't know what to do and I can do away with what was his fighting pose as I look clean legs is well like I like his up\nLet me let me show rubber [laughter] be face to face and then he turned like this and this is not something like that seat what he did you see I'm ... now he's on the fence really isn't helping they know about telling you I don't see what ... what am I doing were brought up is ending up ready to fight a no no\nNo no no right leg art in to the plate\nReports about job I knew I was doing a good performance art ... so I I was younger I did yeah we got it on when you face someone in your legs are parallel it was it the the toll was pointed at me like a boxing post you know in the ring or ... or ...\nAnd so anyway I'm like oh boy and I froze guys out crap you know I don't know\nAnd Chile Davis was at another locker and he came over\nAnd and he was a veteran players that to any intervene any save me from a from ... you know Tony\nA man he recipes we should not be kill the dead but Tony had some some issues with the certain uh you know ah substances he he was a big fan of Penn State's white out let's just say so there were there were some ... but I don't know what you know let's just say that before they cleaned up Anaheim\nTony might or might not have ended up in a CD a hotel right near the big a with some things happen but anyway uh it\nWorked out so that's my that's my long\nWe can do that it does he video you've been like\nOh he uh that was not the only to be like that right that's not the only time he yelled at me or the famous when we used to place when I did the bed and Dave show usually goes uh Tony or he got upset because he he came back to the angels up you're going to like the White Sox or something he came back and they interviewed again he I I don't know if your memory or not but he says yelling\nWhen he lost his wings and mother bleeping last at all I care about [laughter]\nThat would be like oh yeah I think that's true it is all we care about [noise] but once you see it you cannot see we'll get to that point your calls lined up we'll do that as well from the guy goes studios but right now any Garcia to fill you in what the latest ...\nThan we start with major league baseball postseason action National League wildcard gain weight nearly five hours in Chicago's Thirteen endings before the Rockies that's the cubs two to one there were tied in one of the thirteenth with backup catcher\nI truly Walters stepped up with two hour delivered an RV I single to bring home the game winning run pitching though is the key for Colorado how thrilling started with six and two thirds shutout innings the bullpen than the largest one run over six the third anything Scott overt struck off the side\nAnd the game I didn't even know the Tony Walters was a backup catcher I had no idea I'm just said that he uh he was behind the plate to get back to a game winning third strike or keep closing their strike a color with the answers to these the brewers in Milwaukee and they don't see us it's starting on Thursday for Chicago\nTo last ... wrote home one of the ... one of the wild card in their season is over American League wildcard game comes up on

you'll be able to play or not against the rams a kid drug will be sentenced until January twenty four\nBased on federal guidelines he could be facing thirty to thirty seven months so\nIn prison so I guess the the way we can break the story down is it that the messenger pigeon took three weeks to get from Seattle to the NFL big office in New York there's a delay there and the messenger did not get to the league of is like what is what why the ... why would you hesitate like I don't [noise]\nI guess we mentioned the loophole right that this wasn't technically illegal there was nobody white

brief illness during a career that spanned nearly Thirty Years' Clancy fan more than two dozen novels a number of which were made into movies and popular video games that you look back at this week in history\n\nIn all\nPass\nWith alcohol\nYou can listen on our for our radio ads [noise] downloaded [noise]\nHigh [noise] it's one thing [noise] you know some some guys some guys will forgive\nTheir uh their girlfriend or their wife if they cheat on him or you know we may may maybe make out with somebody\nBut if they end up hooking up with the entire Green Bay Packers they generally will not go back at ball to run a to fire run leads okay boy to fight run leads you can't forgive that and and there's an old axiom that we have used and it was it came from a manager but I've stolen it\nAnd I've I've taken as my own over the years a do not let a falling star fall on you and there is a legitimate concern even with her shots performance this year\nThat Clinton courage Shaw is a falling star and considering that when he had his elite ability he struggled to consistently have good starts in the playoffs and ... and this is a wide open nationally\nBut this there is a clear path\nFor the Dodgers to win the national league pennant and they're not as good as they were last year I Know a a friend reporter likes to think that they're better than they were last year I don't believe they are as good as they were last year but the the National League is not as good as it was last year there is no carbs you've got to worry about the brewers and the Braves or the Iraqis who the Dodgers have done very well against\nA and certainly Dodger Stadium and they would have home field advantage in that series now the last point\nOn this big story you're the one of the sacred cows Clinton crucial demoted you've got this divide and and it's not talked about that much but it's something to keep an eye on if you care about this kind of stuff because it's it's palace intrigue regarding the Dodgers\nClinton curse shot at age thirty is is gonna be a\nPotentially a free age he can opt out he's got a player options contract\nAt the end of the world series he can say a ...\nTo the Dodgers and he would leave sixty five million dollars on the table now the assumption would be that you would opt out because you're not likely to get a big money contract at age thirty three which is when of course shops in\nHe would they be a free agent at age thirty three ah now there's a lot of dumb executives but who's going to give a thirty three year old pitcher big money you can justify Hayes only thirty one so will give him a four year contract so crucial could get like two extra years of big money iffy ops out the divide is this\nDodger ownership the Guggenheim Partners from what we hear want her schottische they they are doing everything they can to appease Clinton crochet they don't want him to opt out they'd prefer he opt in\nBut if he does opt out they want to keep he's in Port right and ownership wants to sell ... right you're selling the style that you're you're selling sentimentality is what you're selling the the\nThe ... the nerds the uh the crew that's in the front office are like they're cold blooded their heart and soul I wait a minute\nOr we we put all these numbers in and the algorithms spit out you don't sign a curse shy you want him to opt out ... that's a that's a myth for its current shops out that's great but again we go back to that actually do not pay a falling\nStart to not let a falling star fall on you\nAnd so you have this divide between the front office and an ownership and usually what happens is ownership wins ownership because they have the money rather Guggenheim Partners have all the money so that's that's the story would quit and ... ... ... show\nOn Fox\nWe say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat Willie\nShooters Garcia\nRuben usually don't like the baseball nerds from what I understand and yet it seems like you're on their side asking if they had my blessing him have a rare mallard\nBlessing but I'm On a team or you me and re you how do you\nDo seem review that's right you know you had a team does now okay I'm I'm a big supporter going to go out there and take him on that team do you get a pitch bullets me yes right me and Roberta\nTeam are you I'm tired of watching Chris out just choke on the mound during the playoffs\nRodman and why you do about that a minute [laughter] you're saying if he resigns ... let's say ops out and so it's like a four year extension where the Dodgers that's four more years of playoff baseball for her she had to go out and do a high wire act\nWithout a safety net but uh it's I I Can't believe they did I didn't think they could do it I thought there's no way I talked about this we talked about that yesterday they know they're going to start crush on game on the\n... just anticipate is because of his reputation in the fact that they're paying him ... years thirty three million dollars you figure if you're paying thirty three million [noise] you're going to start in game one\nOf a playoff series but that's that is not the case and the officers better this year Big Bend\nIt works out well it works out well because you could ever you start game one if the Dodgers and then\nYou figure you're putting your chance to win that game and the Kurdish ah those Kurdish are like things and

have no set guidelines on that any but I Do have it's been a hallmark I'm Glad you brought that up I have the one month rule I give everyone one month to do and they figure things out and then I kept

the players owner it's more fun to go from there [laughter] ah but yeah I've enjoyed the fact that they're blaming the office ... isn't that amazing stat though about the the Cleveland Browns and the difference a quarterback next as far as protection everyone wants to blame the office of\nWell as you will know as a former off into the lime is right in high school like myself yes of course the quarterback is partially to blame when the curve when they don't make or read quickly enough they'll get rid of the ball\nProperly or if you're the thing that always drives me crazy when I watch football is that you had a pocket that you ... you have as a as an office as long as you're creating a pocket to protect the quarterback and the quarterback or run away from that pocket and you're blocking to protect where you think he's going to you and he runs outside of the parking and the guy that the vendors season and he goes into\nThe quarterback besides the ad lib and that's the office of lines for when they have a ... as strict set of guidelines and I remember that quote from Joe Thomas a couple of years ago he was playing for the browns he said he compared office of climate mushrooms\nRemember they said like I said well I think during the primaries that we consider the he's in his office of mine who says those mushrooms because we get thrown in the corner of a dark room
