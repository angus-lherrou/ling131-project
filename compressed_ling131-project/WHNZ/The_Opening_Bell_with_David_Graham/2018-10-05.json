like have a specific plan in place and when we start to follow a process really eliminates the emotional attachment some money it eliminates the fear of not being able to make a good decision so I Would tell people to explore the process explore the rules and find a way to do better\nThat's awesome man well you know and it's amazing Kristen thanks for your time it's amazing at him because the pedigree of on my tree academy a lot of people we say the sponsor bulls and bears the pedal view that academy is absolutely amazing I mean the whole process that they teach\nIs how to approach the

don't know anybody doing that are very few people\nYou can do the same thing and once you start to understand is Chris referenced it's just the system is falling a set of rules it's like driving a stick shift after time you get ... get used to it because you just go through the repetition and we've seen people from all walks of life that have gone through that repetition in the academy\nAnd transition their life transform their finances and so for a lot of you\nWe get tired of people banging the drum on radio and talk radio about how you should bring your money to them and let them manage it you'll hear those certified financial planners regimented visors tell you that\nWe believe that you can do better yourself so we're telling you learn the skills of doing it yourself now those people are gonna be upset with us for saying that but you know what you don't need them we don't need them and the good thing is is once you learn the skills of short term income or long term wealth or both\nIt can really allow you to get to those goals you said for yourself and most importantly enemies you know it can really really set you and your\nFamily up for the future well and that's exactly an online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears\nThey understand a lot of people out there they want to get into the market\nThey don't know how to begin they don't know how to

on Facebook a check in with us if you ever in the academy you know of the studios of bowls and bears we got a lot going on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making that big social media push to try to get the word out\n... one of the things that we always talked about um bulls embarrasses understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay as a business you know early we're talking about trading for income trading as a business truly setting us up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax deduction or you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as a\nBusiness well let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity comes with people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up as you can run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's a lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars you know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in insurance an inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have successes that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional business now imagine another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you're just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something at\nA lower price at a wholesale price somebody was there to fulfill that older and sell it you never had a housing and tore never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building didn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat's trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I started trading as a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets [noise]\nIt was just amazing to see because I had run small businesses for years and I had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talked to that guy all the time here at bulls and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top of his truck who's going from one job or the other is chasing my good employees that are just trying to stiff him he's got people that aren't showing up for work he's got people that own money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy and then I found them financial markets in this as a business is the dream and when business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for then we see it all the time and so many of you you don't understand that the markets can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously inquire into looking at trading for a business because what's important is the long term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches at most ... deal with you can get those out of the picture and guess what the sky becomes limit\nWell and that's exactly a champion a lot of individuals out there they want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize it business from home and that's what the markets can do for you online training academy\nThe sponsor bulls and bears I teach a class specifically on training as a business now this is a five hundred dollar values taught right at the campus every

see all this stuff about different people and and you know speaking of that you know there's an article here let me get this out because I think people need to hear this um one of the people that has the biggest\nAmount of money so much that it gets close to us\nUnwritten billion dollars in their management um his name is Ken fisheries the founder of the executive and founder and executive chairman a Fisher Investments [noise]\nUm he built this thing I don't know if this is true or not but at this from another associate that he went to high school is Steve Forbes and Malcolm Forbes getting a little column and then from that calm you know as a billionaire as he's very good at marketing and he spent ... hundreds of millions every\nOr marketing uh but that being said he's always been an ardent critic of annuities and in the Arctic or in the article\n[noise] it basically says that um\nHis attitude towards a moot knew what he is probably one of the most identify them than a fireball characteristics and the public sphere\nHe has print ads with his face blaring I hate annuities and you should too you know most recently you know you have a an audio where he says I Would die and go to hell before I was so you know nobody however\nMr fishers company among\nI guess and the largest investment firms in the country was also simultaneously investing and insurance companies\nThat do a significant amount of annuity business and and some of the stakes were quite high specifically Fisher as a management the legal name for Fisher Investments\nHow several million shares of stock in American equity a ... investment life insurance as a holding company uh one of the biggest sellers of indexed annuities and then prudential the parent company of Jackson national life which for years has been a top seller a variable annuities\nA fish restaurant management which manages here it is Ninety six billion for individuals institutions invested in these companies between two thousand thirty in two thousand Fifteen according to filings with the securities Exchange Commission for sure how\nTo two point nine one million shares of American equity stock value that eighty five million and it's at the end of two thousand fourteen and the year in which fishers holding in the insurer was his largest ah that same year\nMr Fisher or through the Harlem in Forbes calling annuities scum bags products so while it's unclear how large the holding was relative to other investors at the time the position today would make him American equities fifth largest investor\nAnd then he positioned himself also with the London based credential that's the parent company of Jackson national and that was even larger when it peaked in two thousand Fifteen he had two point oh eight eight million shares worth a hundred and twenty nine point seven million\nAnd again Jackson national as for years been the industry's overall top seller\nOf individual annuities as well as the number one seller of variable annuities so it's not clear how big fishes is ... position Ross relative to the investors\nUm [noise] you know I guess the question is does he really hit annuities if he hates them so bad why does he have\nSo much money invested in companies that actually selling nowadays and\nYou know Mr Fisher wasn't available for comment from the story but Fisher Investments smokes man's view their newly company investment as a non issue you know saying people that you know invest in everything from tobacco stocks to alcoholic stocks even though they might not smoke or drink that kind of thing\nAnd I guess I guess the issue is when you're\nHearing somebody market in my mind market one thing and then at the other hand do another kind of hypocritical and he's there to make money\nThis is not your opinion this is coming from an article that you read\nThat's right this is exactly get seen all over the Internet right now and you know this this guy is the second largest richest and investment advisor in the country behind financial engines advisors and and you know so yeah this is this is a giant giant company but\nWhen you're when you're going to go advice
