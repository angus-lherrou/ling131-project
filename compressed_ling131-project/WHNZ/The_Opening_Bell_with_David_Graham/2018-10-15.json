{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Brandy Pauline who just spoke to Tampa Bay chapter board member for a F S P and when you when who's the out of the darkness saint Pete walk cheer when to talk about that have been\nComing up in a bit and of course you could find out more a F. S. T. dot org and when you go to the website it's very easy for you to find the local chapter there um let me go to you had to tell us a little bit about your story how you got involved uh in in a a ...\nSo I lost my father to suicide um he was forty six years old and this happened almost ten years ago will be ten years in January\nAnd um he was a veteran he was three years out from being retired and he was having a hard time adjusting to civilian life so he struggled with depression\nAnd he also struggle with alcoholism and what's odd is when he was in the military he never touched alcohol and after he retired he turned to alcohol to medicate his depression\nAnd um it was it was a closet alcoholic we really didn't know was an issue until after the fact\nAnd um he was just going through a lot with being retired and probably had some pie TST that he hadn't dealt with or um and then\n... years ago that wasn't something that we knew nearly as much about the definitely and I mean he was one\nOf those dads who like to do anything and conquer anything so he doesn't want to ask for help or even let us know that he was struggling to 'em and then so he died by suicide and it was a shock like I kind of agree with brandy I felt like we were perfect normal family and won't say perfect but we are normal family\nYou know I had my mom was working my dad was a retired and he was working for the government and the civilian aspect him my brother was in college I had just finished college I was getting ready to get married I mean everything was going great and then all of a sudden I got a phone call thing not\nYou know he die by suicide and thought wow this can't happen to me and so um I got really involved with a support group and it was for people who have lost loved ones to suicide\nAnd that made me feel more normal made me feel like wow this didn't only just happened to me and then through a few years of that and doing some intensive counseling one on one um [noise] excuse me taking um I I take medication for anxiety and depression\nUm just managing all that after a good like four years I started to really get involved with a FSBA and I was ready to turn this tragedy that happened to me into a purpose and so that's what I Love about this organization\nI've been able to speak out about suicide I've been able to educate myself and others about the risk and warning signs and it has just truly brought hope to me personally\nNow is your situation similar to brand is did you see some warning signs looking\nBack now knowing what you know you would have recognized\nLooking back yes [laughter] um but I also was out of the ... I Lived in a different state for my father at the time so I didn't really know what was going on at home\nYeah um and and the work that you do at a a ... tell us a little bit about the kind of the day to day uh involvement that you have with the organization\nSo I'm a teacher as my job I teach kindergarten um but this is my passion and this is where I volunteer\nI'm chapter board chair so we basically are chapter is awesome we have eight board members and we all have our little next that were really great at and I kinda just managed that\nI'm communicating a lot over email with people who are interested in having trains or want to be at our then to reach people to come to our events and I also um do save talked training where I go around and try and people in the community on suicide prevention\nAnd I also do advocacy that's my passion smoker so I go to Tallahassee every year for the state capital day and speak to legislators about suicide prevention legislation and mental health share my story with them briefly and then talk about why this is important to us\nAnd me as a constituent I Need your support on this out in the past we got a bill passed that would not mandate teachers they get training that's what we're going for originally but they didn't like the language of mandate\nBut it would highly encourage school districts to make sure all of their teachers are trained and suicide prevention wasn't incentivized or the only incentive what's to be certified as a suicide say for school\nSo my goal eventually is to get it where this has mandated that all teachers must be required to take\nTraining and suicide prevention and it needs to be\nSo they can spot the warnings architecture exactly and it needs like another level of uh you know awareness\nAnd prevention I mean if you really think about it so again\nI'm number two killer of our youth as suicide and they spend more time at school then they really do at home right so\nThe story you've heard from Hannah as well as myself as if we had known the warning signs we might actually be in a very different situation with so the the value of the individuals that are spending more time with our youth in their own parents is really there\nRight in and let me ask you this this might sound like kind of a dumb question but very rural here to learn a your situation Randy your situation Hannah\nYou had a fourteen year old son you had or forty seven year old ... forty six year old father is it different in terms of the warning signs or how you deal with\nIndividuals like you know a a a teenager compared to a grown adults man is it does that play a role in in all of this\n[noise] I think sorry go ahead [laughter] I think every person displays different warning signs and it's more of like what you know if that person and how their character is um\nSo I I wouldn't big changes yeah the the constant\nReally yet so there there is absolutely I ... a change in their normal behavior\nIs really one of the biggest key indicators no matter ... male female age race I mean that is a huge indicator and how you approach them as actually very consistent over about straightforward with language\nUm so I don't think that changes got out if you're approaching a ten year old which we now report suicide as young as ten\nI'm your word choice might be very different than a forty seven year old veteran\nYeah okay and I also wonder and I don't know if you guys would have the answer to this or or or certain types of people more susceptible whether it's teenagers or veterans or you know your average accountants you know in their mid twenties\nSo the one thing about suicide is it's not biased it affects any age group I mean obviously brandy shared her story with the young young younger ages and sharing her with a ... you know or ages I lost my brother just suicide at the age twenty six there is no bias like suicide just doesn't pick an age group it affects everybody in any way\nAnd it's not it's just one of those things where again it goes back to the warning signs of having that awareness to know what to look for what you know how to handle the situation I'm going to add onto your hands here I'm also a teacher as well to him and I was kind of schools\nAnd Hannah you know making making the point of having that mandated honestly let's be real um for all teachers but also social workers guidance counselors um community leaders in general\nUm there were people in the school system who would come to me knowing that I was experience with a suicide prevention because they were never trained on it now these are people that you rely on and trust you hey you got it you should know how to do this but if they've never been affected or\n... [laughter]\nThat's eight hundred eight zero eight five thousand nine you could look your complimentary consultation online and Graham capital advisors dot com that is Graham capital advisors done a good Monday morning to you David Graham how\nHave to be Monday Jedi happy Monday but it's been a great weekend you know we experienced all four seasons last week that really did we know that we did and supposedly they were going to record high today regular drug and about Ninety two\nAnnounced he did have one good bit of good news is we got raised for Medicare we sure have failed out here as you know is geared we should have a drum roll on that\nUh\nThe tens of millions of us you know retirees are as people that are just taking a Social Security check like like you and I for example we're going to get a whopping two point eight percent percentage boosted our benefits next year because inflation is going\nHigher and higher and higher and higher\nRemember we haven't had inflation in a while so now they're trying to finally start dealing with this but but either way is the\nBiggest increase the baby boomers have ever gotten and is so you know we've had this long decade low stretch of low inflation and cost of living adjustments the infamous cola\nFor two thousand Nineteen is the highest in seven years and amounts to thirty nine bucks a month for the average retired worker or somebody just taking taking Social Security\nBut that is a sign that inflation is a bond as if they're paying eight or nine dollars for cola\nHey Ted there it is you know I mean that's why you got the fed trying to raise rates now you know this cola this affects household budgets for about one in five Americans\nHave Social Security your Social Security beneficiaries you have disabled veterans you have retired federal retirees it's about Seventy million people\nWhen you have Seventy million people think about that Seventy million times thirty nine bucks a month to a lot of money yeah exactly and\nThat's going to have in itself a little ripple on the economy you know we're kidding talking about earlier was what's another thirty nine bucks a month to breakfast yeah to wreck going out in the morning having to breakfast there it is going to go to see see two movies you\nKnow if you don't eat any of the gang if you yeah so it's a bug you get it in the movie for two plus the popcorn and plus the drugs or\nYou know that's why I always make sure that you know your wife has a person with all the soft drinks and the person you don't have to worry about by them in there for ten dollars a week when ... when you pop the last minute each and\nDon't ever drink don't ever bring bottles was that fall over they rattle roll to ah to look unlike most private pensions Social Security\nYou know has has featured inflation protection it that's been going on now for about forty years and people aren't even realizing it but then a fisheries\nGain from compounding since coal has become part of the overall underlying benefit and it's the base for future cost of living increases you know nonetheless many retirees you know say that the annual adjustment is to me here and still doesn't reflect healthcare costs\nYou know especially for people that are older it's always some kind of health issue\nAnd these federal federal low budget hawks you know they take the opposite view saying well according accordingly arguing that the the increases that should be smaller to reflect consumers penny pitching responses when cause to go up\nYou know I I Love this you know you and I have spent an entire lifetime having the government take twenty five cents of every dollar out of our check\nAnd here we are now trying to just get a little bit of that money back and you have people saying well you know you really don't deserve your own money back I don't know what to tell you the\nTail end as any new your money back because they're spending you know people that come into this country is day or two or three years and then fall for Social Security and get it\nSure aid programs to Afghanistan absolutely you know the the colder the estimated average monthly Social Security payments uh for a retired workers will be about one thousand four hundred and sixty one dollars a month next year that's the average the average\nSo it's a little over fourteen hundred bucks\nA month and and think about this to you know you have people almost foreign ten Americans living on that every month for ten a hundred and ... among some of it is unbelievable\nYou know for most retirees to two thousand Nineteen cold all will be the largest increase they've ever gotten um but the question is that you know so many people you get you they have that money coming in the cost of living adjustment it's everybody kind of earmarked for other expenses that they have\nI mean that's just a drop in the bucket you know met a GAP insurance costs the not covered by Medicare they're still going up\nPrescriptions are still going up um you know they they have the Medicare part B premium for outpatient care will still keep going up\nYou know it it is it enough of an increase that it that it takes care of all the increases from the from health care then you throw in rent rent if you're running a place that get get goes up so it goes on and on and on you know but usually traditionally when they do these averages healthcare costs eat up about\nAlmost a third of your income that you're not spending on because as we get older even though we have Medicare and a supplement\nHis oldest extraneous healthcare prescriptions the duck the balls\nAnd in that inevitably is one of the arguments that they use for having\n... you know some form of a universal healthcare\nAnd when they you know when you see the political campaign saying Medicare for everybody ... good luck for that um but the fact is that if you are really already on Medicare and you're not working you get you're getting still nickel and dime to death\nFor your health care coverage in America it's one thing if you're working\nAnd you're paying into a group plan is another thing when you're retired and still being a nickel and dime to death with with increasing health care costs and they're only going up and up and up [noise]\nUm so\nYou know it's it's just about every single thing that you can think of that goes up and it doesn't go down by law\nThe cold is based on a broad index of different consumer prices and advocates for seniors claimed the general index doesn't actually capture the rising costs that they face especially in the health care in house and\nThey want the government just switched to an index that reflects the spending patterns of older people make it a pickle ball to someone that that is actually retired or close to retirement so at this whole coal issues are very\nReal issue older people spend their money in categories that are going up at a higher rate than overall inflation\nAnd it's as simple as that um it's a benefit but it's really a drop in the bucket proportionate\nTo do what we're paying President Trump to his credit has has repeatedly vowed not to touch Social Security or Medicare but the government is running a ... trillion dollar deficits partly as as a result of the infamous Republican tax cut bill\nThat some seemingly surprisingly we want to call it a surprise never really trickle down to anyone but the companies themselves\nSo you're looking at all of this and trying to make sense of all of it\nJust I always tell people to get ready for retirement control your own destiny don't let the government has to do it for you do something you generate your own revenue if you've worked up a a life where you ... do you haven't saved enough no one says you have to retire\nYou know our grandparents never retired\nRetirement came and she came into place after World War two where people would work sixty sixty five years as what if they worked Thirty years at a company and then retire and get a golden parachute and get a golden gold watch\nWell no one says that you have to retire and I and I always tell people this find something you want to do and if you feel you truly haven't saved enough\nOr or it takes is going through a divorce and you'll be amazed how quickly lose a lot of your money is and you know wanting to people today experience that\nShe'll find something that you like to do but also get your little revenue coming in and do a lot of things out there that you can be doing\nHis baritone day Thursday hosted by heart
