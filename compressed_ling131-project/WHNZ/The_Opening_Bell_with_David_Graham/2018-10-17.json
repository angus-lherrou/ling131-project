coach called the coach outline eight seven seven nine zero for trade that they'd seven seven nine zero for trade she at one of the neatest things about the financial markets is a lot of people look at the financial markets as a secondary plays\nTo either part money or put money and they hope for the best and the true professionals trade as a business the true professionals utilize the market for the opportunity whatever the opportunity is as give it to him let's take a moment let's talk about what does it look like\nFor someone to trade as a business well let me take a traditional business say a small business but some of the challenges that people have to start those businesses a lot of times is initial capital outlay\nLisa building you got to rent a facility or read the equipment to houses that facility you got liability insurance you might have employees and staffing payroll and workers' comp and\nYou know inventory there's a lot of there's a lot of things that go into starting a traditional business and a lot of people follow that path because it's the dream I mean you know the American dream land of opportunity go build something right your own tickets have equity work so hard to own something\nAnd they love the opportunity and see a lot of people struggle with a lot of people driving down the road right now you're a small business owner\nYou own your business and your business owns you and I know I've been that guy I've been that person who was a small business owner I was a builder\nI was a framer I did a lot of construction projects and you know what I was always chasing money and chasing clients and trying to get people to sign off on punch list like get paid and so I understand that headache when that traditional process of building a business\nThen you look at the financial markets trading and investing you can start a business on a shoestring you literally can enter the arena with a couple of grant maybe even less than that if you treat and currency is I mean hundreds of dollars I mean it doesn't have to be a big pile of money you have the ability to sell and by\nInstantly so if you understand what a good price to buy isn't a good price the cell is how to buy a wholesale subtle retail gives you a tremendous admission you'd have to leave your house you have\nCustomers that you'd never have to meet that have been willing to buy for me right now or study right now you'd never have to leave your home enough to pay liability insurance you don't have to hire people know worker's comp no staff\nI mean think about that and have the same upside ability to create wealth\nThink about that that's the dream\nAnd see when I get introduced the financial markets as a traitor investor I had no knowledge of the markets I just met a guy was successfully trading I saw his lifestyle it appealed to me I saw that he was no smarter than I was I saw that he had no more skill than I did he just had more experience and learning what to do\nAnd I got excited and was able to start to venture out of this field and many people that's their entry into the arena is it they look at it as a way to start a business without a ton of capital and have the American dream still be able to exist without a lot of traditional headaches that most business have and once you start to understand a real opportunity\nAnd the real power of understanding how to take the money consistently in the financial markets\nMan it can really go to the next level and I've seen it happen a lot of people's lives and for middle is is it could happen to you just a matter of taking the step of moving forward and learning the skills starting the business\nWell neat thing is is a lot of people want to own businesses out there are a lot of people have asked him privately\nIf you had the opportunity to quit your job would you and the answer tends to be asked more often than not\nAnd a lot of people just don't realize what it really takes to get started up in this arena to start a business now ... we're talking about you know there's many business you could start you start a restaurant you get a key asking the ball you could do something you could there's so many different businesses get started when it comes to trade investing a lot of people don't know what it looks like\nAnd the great thing is is that it's the same upset up or to the same potential
