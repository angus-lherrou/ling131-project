know get on the line and you'll see all this stuff about different people and and you know speaking of that you know there's an article here let me get this out is I think people need to hear of this um one of the people that has the biggest\nAmount of money so much and it gets close to a hundred billion dollars on\nTheir management um his name is Ken fisheries the founder of the executive and founder and executive chairman a Fisher Investments [noise]\nUm he built this thing I don't know if this is true or not but that's just one other associate that he went to high school with Steve Forbes and Malcolm Forbes gave it a little column and then from that call 'em you know as a billionaire\nBut she's very good at marketing and he spent ... hundreds of millions every year marketing uh but that he said he's always been an ardent critic of annuities and in the Arctic or in the article\n[noise] it basically says that um his attitude towards the ... knew what he is probably one of the most identify ... than a fireball characteristics and the public sphere\nHe has print ads for his face blaring I hate annuities and you should too you know most recently you know you have a an audio where he says I Would die and go to hell before I Would sell you a newly however\nMr fishers company among I guess and the largest investment firms in the country was also simultaneously investing and insurance companies\nThat do a significant amount of annuity business and and some of the stakes were quite high specifically Fisher as a management the legal name for Fisher Investments\nHeld several million shares of stock in American equity a ... investment life insurance has a holding company I'm One of the biggest sellers of indexed annuities and then prudential the parent company of Jackson national life which for years has been a top seller a variable annuities\nA Fisher Asset Management which manages here it is Ninety six billion for individuals and institutions invested in these

value that eighty five million and it's at the end of two thousand fourteen endearing which fishers holding in the insurer was his largest ah that same year\nMr Fisher or through the column in Forbes calling annuities scum bags products so while it's unclear how large the holding was relative to other investors at the time the position today would make him American equities fifth largest investor\nAnd then he positioned himself also with the London based prudential that's the parent company of Jackson national\nAnd that was even larger wanted peaked in two thousand Fifteen he had two point oh eight eight million sure it's worth a hundred and twenty nine point seven million and again Jackson national has for years been the industry's overall top seller\nOf individual annuities as well as the number one seller of variable annuities so it's not clear how big fishes has been position was relative to the investors [noise] um [noise] you know in I guess the question is does he

but Fisher Investments spokesmen view there are new company investment as a non issue you know saying people that you know invest in everything from tobacco stocks to alcoholic stocks even though they might not smoke or drink that kinda thing\nAnd I guess I guess the issue is when you're\nHearing somebody market in my mind\nMarket one thing and then the other hand do another it's kind of
