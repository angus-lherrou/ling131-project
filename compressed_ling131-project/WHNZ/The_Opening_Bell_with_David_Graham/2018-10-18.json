know there's an article here let me get this out is I think people need to hear this um one of the people that has the biggest\nAmount of money so much that it gets close to a hundred billion dollars under management\nUm his name is Ken fisheries the founder of the executive and founder and executive chairman a Fisher Investments [noise]\nUm he built this thing I don't know if this is true or not but I think that this from another associate that he went to high school is Steve Forbes and Malcolm Forbes gave it a little column and then from that calm you know as a billionaire\nBecause he's very good at marketing and he spent ... hundreds of millions every or marketing\nUh but that being said he's always been an ardent critic of annuities and in the Arctic or in the article\n[noise] it basically says that um his attitude towards ... knew what he is probably one of the most identify than a fireball characteristics in the public sphere\nHas print ads with his face blaring I hate annuities and you should too you know most recently you know you have a an audio where he says I Would die and go to hell before I Would sell you never knew what he however Mr fishers company\nAmong I guess and the largest investment firms in the country was also simultaneously investing and insurance companies\nThat do a significant amount of annuity business\nAnd and some of the stakes were quite high specifically Fisher as a management the legal name for Fisher Investments\nHeld several million shares of stock in American equity a ... investment life insurance as a holding company I'm One of the biggest sellers of indexed annuities and then ... the parent company of Jackson national life which for years has been a top seller a variable annuities\nA fish restaurant management which manages
