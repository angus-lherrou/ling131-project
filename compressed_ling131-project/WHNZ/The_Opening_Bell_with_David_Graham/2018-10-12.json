Petersburg [noise]\nTo ... I was out of it just go have a good time always having a good time with the\nDiverted to head over to Facebook Like as ... radio and of course at any time twenty four seven and a question for the coach called the coach outline eight seven seven nine zero for trade that they'd seven seven nine zero for trade she at one of the neatest things about the financial markets is a lot of people look at the financial markets as a secondary place\nTo either part money or put money and they hope for the best and the true professionals trade as a business the true professionals utilize the market for the opportunity whatever the opportunity is as give it to him let's take a moment\nLet's talk about what does it look like for someone to trade as a\nBusiness well let me take a traditional business say a small business but some of the challenges that people have to start those businesses a lotta times his initial capital outlay\nYou got to Lisa building you got to rent a facility or read the equipment to houses that facility you got liability insurance you might have employees and staff and payroll and workers' comp and\nYou know inventory there's a lot of there's a lot of things that go into starting a traditional business and a lot of people follow that path because it's the dream I mean you know the American dream land of opportunity go build something right your own tickets have equity work so hard to own something\nAnd they love the opportunity and see a lot of people struggle with a lot of people driving down the road right now you're a small business owner\nYou own your business and your business owns you and I know I've been that guy I've been that person who was a small business owner I was a builder\nI was a framer I did a lot of construction projects and you know what I was always chasing money and chasing clients and trying to get people to sign off on punch list like get paid\nAnd so I understand that headache when that traditional process of building a business\nThen you look at the financial markets trading and investing you can sort of business on a shoestring you literally can enter the arena with a couple of grand maybe even less than that if you treat and currency is I mean hundreds of dollars I mean it doesn't have to be a big pile of money you have the ability to sell and by\nInstantly so if you understand what a good price to buy isn't a good price the cell is how to buy a wholesale sort of retail gives you a tremendous advantage you'd have to leave your house you have\nCustomers that you'd never have to meet that have been willing to buy for me right now or ... right now you'd never have to leave your home enough to pay liability insurance you don't have to hire people know worker's comp no staff I mean think about that\nAnd have the same upside ability to create wealth\nThink about that that's the dream\nAnd see when I get introduced the financial markets as a traitor investor I had no knowledge of the markets I just met a guy was successfully trading I saw his lifestyle it appealed to me I saw that he was no smarter than I was I saw that he had no more skill than I did he just had more experience and learning what to do\nAnd I got excited and was able to start to venture on this field and many people that's their entry into the arena is it they look at it as a way to start a business without a ton of capital and have the American dream still be able to exist without a lot of traditional headaches that most business have and once you start to understand a real opportunity\nAnd the real power of understanding how to take the money consistently in the financial markets\nMan it can really go to the next level and I've seen it happen a lot of people's lives for middle is is it could happen to you just a matter of taking the step of moving forward and learn the skill starting the business\nWell neat thing is is a lot of people want to own businesses out there are a lot of people if you ask them privately\nIf you had the opportunity to quit your job would you and the answer tends to be asked more often than not\nAnd a lot of people just don't realize what it really takes to get started up in this arena to start a business you know ... we're talking about you know there's many business you can start you start a restaurant you get a key asking the ball you could do something you could there's so many different business started when it comes to trade investing a lot of people don't know what it looks\nLike and the great thing is is that it's the same upset opportunity\nBook it online it's free Graham capital advisors dot com [noise] David\nThere are a lot of people out there that we should be aware of that are trying to get your money your retirement money and these are not people\nThat are produced Sherry's these are people that are making money for themselves and not too concerned about you as a client no that is so true\nTo you know you see it constantly way up to do is you know get on the line and you'll see all this stuff about different people and and you know speaking of that you know there's an article here let me get this out is I think people need to hear of this um one of the people that has the biggest\nAmount of money so much I think it's close to a hundred billion dollars on their management\nUm his name is Ken fisheries the founder of the executive and founder and executive chairman a Fisher Investments [noise]\nUm he built this thing I don't know if this is true or not but I got this from another associate that he went to high school with Steve Forbes and Malcolm Forbes gave it a little column and then from that call 'em you know as a billionaire\nBut she's very good at marketing and he spent ... hundreds of millions every or marketing uh but that he said he's always been an ardent critic of annuities and in the Arctic or in the article\n[noise] it basically says that um\nHis attitude towards the ... knew what he is probably one of the most identify ... than a fireball characteristics and the public sphere\nHe has print ads with his face blaring I hate annuities and you should too you know most recently you know you have a\nAn audio where he says I Would die and go to hell before I Would sell you know nobody however Mr fishers company\nAmong I guess and the largest investment firms in the country was also simultaneously investing and insurance companies\nThat do a significant amount of annuity business\nAnd and some of the stakes were quite high specifically Fisher as a management the legal name for Fisher Investments\nHeld several million shares of stock in American equity a ... investment life insurance has a holding company I'm One of the biggest sellers of indexed annuities and then ... the parent company of Jackson national life which for years has been a top seller a variable annuities\nA fish restaurant management which manages here it is Ninety six billion for individuals institutions invested in these companies between two thousand Thirteen two thousand Fifteen according to finally is with us secure and Exchange Commission for sure how\nTo two point nine one million shares of American equity stock value that eighty five million and it's at the end of two thousand fourteen and the year in which fishers holding in the insurer was his largest ah that same year\nMr Fisher or through the column in Forbes calling annuities scum bags products so while it's unclear how large the holding was relative to other investors at the time the position today would make him American equities fifth largest investor\nAnd then he positioned himself also with the London based prudential that's the parent company of Jackson national\nAnd that was even larger wanted peaked in two thousand Fifteen he had two point oh eight eight million sure it's worth a hundred and twenty nine point seven million and again Jackson national has for years been the industry's overall top seller\nOf individual annuities as well as the number one seller of variable annuities so it's not clear how big fishes is is it position was relative to the investors\n[noise] um [noise] you know in I guess the question is does he really hit annuities if he hates them so bad\nWhy does he have so much money invested in companies that actually selling nowadays and\nYou know Mr Fisher wasn't available for comment for this story but Fisher Investments spokesmen view there are new company investment as a non issue you know saying people that you know invest in everything from tobacco stocks to alcoholic stocks even though they might not smoke or drink that kind of thing\nAnd I guess I guess the issue is when you're hearing somebody market\nIn my mind market one thing and then the other hand do another it's kind of hypocritical and is there to make money\n[noise] this is not your opinion this is coming from an article that you read\nThat's right this is exactly you'd see it all over
