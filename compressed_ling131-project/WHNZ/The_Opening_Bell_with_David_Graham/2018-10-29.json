ability in the world but he has to do in the here to do in the headlight look when you just see him and and he throws into groups in eight to ... decision making is pathetic terrible\nTerrible diseases or make and let me ask you something makes indicators are pointing out what I was wondering the people about the beginning of the program about like if you think that we've seen the worst yet buckle up\nLook stocks to usually start falling six to twelve months before recession\nAnd and and that means it's time to be really careful to be on the lookout for beer market uh five stocks have accounted for most of the games all over the past year the fang stocks Facebook apple Amazon Netflix alphabet that's the parent company for Google\nOr they're known as the stocks and\nThe VIX indicator effects indicator represents volatility follows what's goes it goes on it it watches the motions of traders and the indicator tracks fear when the indicator moves higher the level of fear in the market is rising um and\nThe the moving average that we that you normally have with this indicator it's it's got its wings day to day and it shows a trend\nAnd it also let's see when the trend changes\nAnd by adding a moving average to the indicator we can spot on emotions change and one indicator moves above it's moving average than we know fears rising and it's a time to sell it for years falling indicator dropped under the moving average and that's a bicycle\nWell the next just crossed above it's moving average that tells us to expect a decline in the index over the next three months\nAnd after a signal like this\nThere was the last time there was a decline of at least ten percent and the U.S and the five hundred of just about Seventy percent of the time and there are a lot of decline so many of them went much farther than that uh the indicator also gives us signals before the beer markets back in like two thousand two thousand eight\nAnd it was one of the few indicators that actually warned us about the October Nineteen eighty seven market crash\nAnd you know apply to the Dow Jones average ... that's the acronym it warned of the crash and even October in Nineteen twenty nine and other historic Baron markets so we know it's a reliable into care\nAnd right now it's telling us to prepare for the worst in the next few coming months is not telling us stocks will drop fifty percent or the financial system is collapsing it simply saying that the risks are very high and ... and the decline of another ten percent is is very very likely\nBut but the decline could be worse than than what we've had since the last last recession so what does that mean if you're getting ready for retirement\nOr listen to what it's telling us and listen to what it's telling us um you know like you started to show you know or the train is leaving the station\nAnd we could very seriously have a a rigorous correction ahead of us um so if you have a portfolio you have to be very very careful on what stocks are going to be holding and if you're getting close to retirement\nThink about this for a moment they are now major hedge funds major banks the big money people they have

stock market\nWell there are a lot of analysts out there there are a lot of economists that are really worried about the outcome of the midterm uh mid term elections on November the six\nBecause the first thing that's going to happen is if the house swings back democratic first thing they're going to do is they're going to be obstruction is there anything President Trump wants to do that impeach him\nHey well again you can also impeach him I said I don't know how far they're going to go with that but they know the Senate is never going to go along with it oh he'll still ... they they don't want to get even for Bill Clinton [noise] you know you know here we go again so\nI think about that so we have all the century and and you know all this going to take something in the mall a report saying anything about anything and then they're going to go do it and then you know unfortunately\nThis is the kind of world that we're living in we have a ... correct amount of division\nBut most analysts are worried about the mid term simply because it's simply going to\nAgain show in highlighting sharp and the political divide that we that exist now in our country and many people have tried to blame all of America social and economic problems on President Trump we've been on President Obama but the truth of the matter is sadly this is science to the trouble that we're having goes back a
