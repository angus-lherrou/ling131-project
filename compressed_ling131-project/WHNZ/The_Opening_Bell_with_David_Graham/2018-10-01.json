head over there like us on Facebook a check in with us if you ever in the academy you know of the studios of ... and get a lot going on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making that big social media push to try to get the word out\n... one of the things that we always talked about um bulls embarrasses understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay as a business you know early we're talking about trading for income trading as a business truly setting us up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax deduction or you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as a business\nWell let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity comes with people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up as you can run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's a lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars you know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in insurance an inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have successes that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional business now imagine another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something at a lower price at a wholesale price somebody was there to fulfill that older and sell it you never had how's inventory never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building\nDidn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat's trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I saw trading as a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets [noise]\nIt was just amazing to see because I had run small businesses for years and I had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talked to that guy all the time here it bulls and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top of his truck was going from one job or the other is chasing my good employees that are trying to stiff him he's got people that are showing up for work he's got people that own money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy and then I found them financial markets and this as a business is the dream and when business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for then we see it all the time and so many of you you don't understand that the market can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously inquire into looking at trading for a business because what's important is the long term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches at most visitors deal with you can get those out of the picture and guess what the sky becomes\nLimit well and that's exactly it champion a lot of individuals out there they want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize it business from home and that's what the markets can do

[noise]\nApple's what I'm saying you know like through life there are a lot of things you need to to think about but our\nGut feelings lead us down a lot of pets to lose us money\nThink of the stock market as as a bandwagon that holds sway over our emotions you know is the mortgage it's if the market is surging greed says hop on it if it's plunging well here says hop off\nThat's not just you and I that's everyone everyone is just you know it's what's inside our guard and\nWhat is telling us to just do it's instinct him in a sense but the bottom line is though that if you want to have a winning formula you need to end up buying stocks that are undervalued versus overvalued\nAnd that has nothing to do with listening to your to your God because your guts gonna say\nWhen times are good Best Buy stocks let's let's make some money when times are bad\nThey think things are going to happen this get out of here and has let's run when things get really bad\nYou stay stay concerned just you don't go back in because of the fact you're afraid of losing again it's just you listen to your good well obviously after two thousand eight we got burned forty fifty percent saying I'm Chris is crazy I'm not doing this anymore guess what it came back\nBut it's just the idea that you can control that when it comes to investing\nIf you had a portfolio equally of stocks and bonds that portfolio after the last crash in two thousand eight when it went down fifty five percent\nAbout a year later you would have a user to two years later if you had fifty fifty percent bonds fifty percent stocks is according to a vanguard analysis within one to two years you would have had your money back and you would have gone down around twenty nine percent\nIf you're a hundred percent invested in stocks and two thousand eight when we took that hit the will to taking your three to four years to get your money back but that's providing you go right back into the market after you experience that downturn\nYou know people don't do that saying I'm not going back and do it might go down similar well who knows when the bottoms out just like now\nWho knows where the highest you know it's been ten years this is a record I stayed all member will\nMake it ten years I mean is that when you look at what's going on now you know we are now in the longest bull market in us history and you know for most people that raises you know I I question should you be taking money off the table\nWell if you have a well constructed financial strategy in your personal circumstances really haven't changed since you started that\nThere's probably no reason why you should do anything at all look you've spent your entire life while you're working bar from Peter to pay Paul pay pay for the the the kids things pay their tuitions\nTry to save some money and then when you did save it\nWith your phone carrier you're right you're right it was called the wealth\nAccumulation but as you're getting close to retirement\nRetirement investing in planning is completely different was now it's called wealth preservation that's something you have not done before now this is one I got\nI have to make the maximum amount out of it to give me a ... some day so I have something to live on besides Social Security and the focus is to never lose it\nBecause now you ... what what are you running out of time time the time it's going to take you to remake what you could lose what you got his what you got you know you got it don't lose it now when you're younger you could take all the risk in the world as you get older it's a whole different ballgame\nAnd retirement investing is something that most people have never done\nAnd you know get quite frankly just ask yourself has your advisor has even explain that to you\nIf he hasn't well then you're going to someone that's an asset gather not someone that is if we do fury you know in the field of a finance besides the first things are going to tell you\nThat if you're in retirement it's a different way of investing you can't keep doing the same thing if you keep doing the same thing buying ATF spy mutual funds guess what happens today you're going to get the same result\nYou know if your head is really hurting I have a suggestion stop hitting the wrong with it [laughter] you'll feel much better your head will feel better with\nFinancing you keep doing the same thing and you're losing money and you're having a stress guess what stop hating the you know you get your head against the wall and you're going to feel better it's just common sense but you have to take the initiative most people don't do that they keep going on\nYou know like the Energizer Bunny and and the whole goal in life is to get peace of mind take distress out of it listen to what's inside you and most people have four one K. plans\nNow since they got rid of tensions that's what people live non for generations and the early eighties the story eliminating pensions and everyone got four one K. plan great\nI I I think I get more questions about four one K. plants than probably any anything else but one of the most important questions that I get asked is about taking money out of a four one K. plant\nAnd just remember this well for one K plan is growing tax deferred what does that mean that means you're getting simple interest compounding interest interest on the money you would have paid in Texas\nBut it's there to give you a pension some day not to be used as a bank to take money whenever you needed money that's that's a whole different kind of an investment whole different kind of way of holding money that's called non qualified money that means just general savings\nAnd if you got lucky at the dog track you put it into bank that's that's not unqualified money get another Harvard and that's not unqualified money but any money that came from a job of any store Seward is usually of usually you know tax\nTax deferred for one case I are raised fourth release four fifty seven ... anything with a foreign it\nAnd and you know it's tax deferred what you need to do is to make sure you understand that difference so don't\nGo near your four one K. awry or if you need money but if you do have an emergency\n... you can start taking money\n[noise] anyone that is withdrawing money from a four one K. planned um you can do it at any time after the age of fifty nine and a half without paying that ten percent really withdrawal penalty but if you ... and you're younger than fifty nine and\nIn addition to the federal and state income tax that you're going to get hit with you have to pay a ten percent early withdrawal penalty for example if you have fifty thousand dollars in in four one K. savings\nAnd that may leave you with just thirty five thousand in cash and after\nTwenty or twenty percent withholding and a ten percent early withdrawal you know you're gonna get clobbered don't do it don't do it don't use your phone K as the bank you know if
