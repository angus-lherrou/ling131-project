founder of the executive and founder and executive chairman a Fisher Investments [noise]\nUm he built this thing I don't know if this is true or not but I got this from another associate that he went to high school with Steve Forbes and knocking forms gave it a little column and then from that call them you know civilian air\nForce he's very good at marketing and he spent ... hundreds of\nMillions every or marketing uh but that he said he's always been an ardent critic of annuities and in the Arctic or in the article\n[noise] it basically says that um his attitude\nTowards the ... knew what he
