got a lot going on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making a big social media push to try to get the word out\n... one of the things that we always talked about um bulls embarrasses understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay as a business you know early we're talking about trading for income trading as a business truly setting us up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax deduction or you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as\nBusiness well let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity comes with people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up is you run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's a lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars you know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in insurance an inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have successes that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional business now imagine another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you're just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something at a lower price at a wholesale price somebody who's there to fulfill that older and sell it you never had a housing mentor he never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building\nDidn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I saw trading as a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets\nIt was just amazing to see because I had run small businesses for years and I had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talked to that guy all the time here at bowls and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top of his truck was going from one job or the other is chasing my good employees that is just trying to stiff him he's got people that aren't showing up for work he's got people that own money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy then I found them financial markets in this as a business is the dream and when business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for then we see it all the time and so many of you you don't understand that the markets can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously inquire into looking at trading for a business because what's important is the long term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches at most visit deal with you can get those out of the picture and guess what the sky becomes\nOne it well and that's exactly it champion a lotta individuals out there that want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize the business from home and that's what the markets can do for you online training academy\nThe sponsor bulls and bears I teach a class specifically on training as a business now
