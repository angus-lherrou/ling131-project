{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Sure uh voices for children's support than advocates for the abuse and neglect it in a band and children in Hillsborough County and we choose to partner with the guardian ad litem program here in Hillsborough County to help\nTo accomplish that mission and you know it's it's hard right now in Hillsborough County um we have more children in foster care than any other county in the state of Florida so a guardian ad litem is a government agency and each guardian ad litem is I'm a signed to a judicial court circuit\nAnd we are a nonprofit that has decided to help raise funds through hundreds like children across borders to help\nFill in the gaps you know we all know that um again not to get political that there is never seems to be enough money especially for a our youth and the state so uh we do our best to try to fill in those gaps and\nFor us we have for programs um to help subside you know to fill in those gaps with them and\nI think my favorite is our children's needs program and I think one thing that people don't understand about children in foster care is that\nThey're they're through no fault of their own though you know they they didn't do anything wrong they were found in a very unsafe environment and removed for their safety\nIf somehow it's as if we're punishing them because we have to\nMove them to a foster care um facility or to foster parent or to a relative and and we try our best to get them what they need 'em but they know there are different they know when they go to school that they are not like their peers and so we try with our children's needs program\nTo filling the gaps so\nUm I was a young man right now he's Seventeen he knows he's not going to be adopted um he's graduated high school early completed his GED he's working at a fast food restaurant and\nWe were just able to buy him a laptop because he just in a row the sea and this is a young man who has been I'm\nA part of the foster care program for about six years and\nThe guardian ad litem who is the uh volunteer child advocate and it's been assigned to his case that we work with sent me a picture and she said I I have never seen him smile this way and you know you're just kind of give those kids a little bit of\nWhat loving parents try to provide and it can be summer camp that can be um a new uniform because they've made the football team it could be tutoring sessions some of these kids go on to college or some of them are put up for adoption some of them are reunited with a parent that knows\nThat they were in a bad relationship and they go through a case plan to make it better\nFor the guardian ad litem program itself is made up of these wonderful volunteer taught advocates there is a staff of about Seventy people here in Hillsborough County and then about seven hundred of these volunteers\nAnd when a child's case comes through um the court system a judge will assign a volunteer guardian ad litem to their case\nThat volunteer becomes it's not a mentor and it's not even a parent but it's just they become the voice of that child and they're able to talk to the teachers and guidance councilors and and other family members and they're not on the side of the parent they're not on the side of\nThe parents families and I'm kind of he said she said of what goes on in life\nBut they're they are to find out what the child what is best for the child and they and they fight for it\nAnd sometimes these cases can take as much as four years of time and these volunteers are amazing and they give their time every month to make sure the child is safe and then if the child needs extra things they contact us and we help\nAs well the guardian ad litem office there is that a team of attorneys that are amazing\nAnd so we were actually we're the only non profit um that funds a guardian ad litem program in the state of Florida to be able to pay for things for that legal team\nYou know sometimes we think about these cases and they go to court and you think will to the child should have the best representation possible in other words or do and I believe that the lawyers do but they don't have the funds to possibly get that expert testimony or a psychological evaluation of the parents to make sure that they're in a stable\nEnvironment um and so we try to fund those items and and sometimes it's surveillance sometimes at paying for depositions\nLittle things like that all adds up and so we try to support that legal team as much as we can so that they can make an a decision and the best interest of the child\nAlong the way like I said we try to keep the children out of the court room I'm the guardian ad litem volunteers their child advocate will go into the courtroom for them so that there aren't there we don't want them to be re introduced to a their parents or as offending party\nAnd um but there's times when the child has to retell the story and when that happens we I have four days very first courthouse facility dog I'm named Tibet who is a beautiful golden retriever lab mix and she and her handler ...\nWho is a full time volunteer um travel between the courthouse and another facility called ... house and they sit with those children and and the children have to share their story\nOr Tibet sits and less and the child recounts and is able to be um smuggled we call them come hug [laughter] with the ... but um you know to that one of one of the most magical things for me is\nUm if any of you and your life have a six year old child you know that it's not really easy to have a six year old sit for an extended period of time um but there was a six year old child who needed to tell a story\nAnd as a the story was being told Tibet\nSat on the floor and the child massage Tibet ear kind of rolling the ear over and over in her little hand I'm sharing what happened for three hours while in the first three hours and I would have been really\nDifficult with algebra sitting there and\nYou just as it is just kinda got into her um frame of mind and she was peaceful and she was able to share everything and and the people were able to ask questions and\nAnd that is that's the gift it's a special guest at a um we partner with a great organization ... called a companion a canine companions for independence and this dog is purpose bred for this so different than a therapy animal um Tibet is is special and\nThat you know she really can sit and and the pet and loved and and it's evidence I'm On the floor you always we call them Tibet sprinkles and we'll see just a\nLittle pilots [laughter] after all the loving and um\nSo we're very proud to have that program as well and I think the last thing that we do and we try to support as much as we can\nIs the recruitment of these volunteer child advocates and we need more of them you know we have seven hundred we have over thirty three hundred children on they have some case where some uh some guardian ad litem volunteers that\nHave as many as eight children that they are trying to help us that's a lot [laughter] it's a big you know some of these children maybe from a family unit ah\nSiblings but they may not be placed together and so it it's a it's a calling I think that if you are an individual who feels like\nYou um are passionate about children and about the rights of children and that you are not intimidated to share your voice in your opinion and and go into a courtroom and share your story which I think any of us that you have a\nA young person in your life you automatically become passionate about them you know and it's so it's it's easy to get caught up in the story to make sure that they're safe because that's what we want is just a safe permanent and loving home at the end of the day I'm\nAs a volunteer guardian ad litem if you're able to help that child down that path\nYou know ... it's very rewarding experience I'm not going to say it's always magical sometimes there are things that happen um but you just do the best you can\nYou seen the renewed interest in the program since we've had some high profile cases in the air\nIs going on line and Graham capital advisors dot com\nIt was a master certified as they plan or one of only two and Florida Man you want to get that peace of mind the jak cameras and I've been talking about for years that peace of mind knowing that you're not paying excessive fees are unnecessary taxes and that your savings are safe from the market crash we\nJust had a little minor correction here a couple of weeks ago\nAnd people were panicking unless you were already a David Graham customer if you're a collection of David Graham you didn't worry at all man you continued golfing you continued watching football on TV you never worried about what your money was doing because you knew it was safe David good morning how are you buddy\nAnd be happy happy Monday do you have a great weekend oh it was great it was so great to just relax and we finally got a touch of the change of seasons\nOne and nice this morning I mean it was like somebody like sixty five degrees when I drove into work this morning\nAt you know I mean here it is we had that record was last week of Ninety three degrees and the same day it was twenty eight degrees and buffalo I Know my daughter left here yesterday and it was it was nice you know was in the late ... high seventies yesterday when she left in the evening\nAnd she gets to Baltimore forty five degrees the culture shock oh boy it's cold you know and we just take it for granted but then again that's why we're down here in the ah\nThe the big story of course this weekend was the lottery I mean we have a lottery right now that it's gonna be worth one point six billion dollars tomorrow\nAnd if there's a late rush of ticket buying you can go up to a to point two\nBillion guesstimate yeah yeah and there probably will be laid rush because when you know I mean a chance to become a billionaire over ... you know and then just a millionaire a billionaire oh my gosh so you you never would get to complete a minute let me let me ask you this if I hit\nThe lottery and I came to you and I said David what do we do with this money what do you recommend\nA twenty four dollar question here look ... lottery let me just say this ... if you want a lottery you and I both know lottery winner is you know winning a large lottery is probably the one of the most exciting things in life that can happen to a person you know their day starts like any other\nBy the time they go to bed there's all their lives have been changed forever\nAnd the lottery winner winters have told me that the one thing that they don't ever warrior go bad again is money\nBut with everything else twice as much and your chances of like this power boy you know what your chances are one in three hundred million million you know but I tell people go for it\nCan't win unless you by Jake can't win unless you buy a ticket I drove around that already bought our tickets ... will likely they'll it takes is the right one what do we buy we bought we bought the lottery we bought the Powerball and we bought the millions of the one that's up to one point six million dollars now they\nGo you know winning the lottery is an amazing things um you know if you think about having if he ever did win out radically different your life you know people fantasize about what what I Do with all this money and yet here we are in the retirement business\nFor his preservation of capital don't lose it and and I really tell people this you know when it's all said and done um\nThat how much do you really need to live on it and I remember when I was a young guy I was driving a cab in Boston in the mid sixties when when I was going to school driving a cab at night and\nLogan Airport um there is raining it's freezing out one night yeah after classes and when in the care blind and all and it's pouring out all of a sudden I see that a guy running to the cab opens the door is it's in the back seat and\nAnd I I started taking off and and I said what are we going to and he says it rich guy and I look in the mirror and various\nCaches clay\nBefore that was before ... lawyer became Ahmed alone\nAnd say oh my God I got the ... you know boxing ship in the world are eyes and then basically ... you know has tried to make conversation now not sure what to say and there is looking in the mirror at me I'm looking at him and he's looking at me making faces making faces at me\nBecause he knows I'm staring at him and he spoofing with me and I and I said to him and then I said well champ you know\nWhen you're going to fight again he's asked has gotten a war with those those little people over there I'm not I'm not gonna I'm getting killed ... people for no reason I don't know and and I'm now as when he was the draft thing and he wasn't fighting and\nAnd then you know and just trying to make conversation with him I I I I said to him I says well what are you going to do with all your money you know what I mean he has this real frowned on his face like the one that Billy Crystal does this frowning and and uh and and he says\nHas can only where one shoot at a time and he's wearing his pin stripe suit because you know the Muslim order in Chicago or whatever is where it was helping them ... monitor things so he looked pretty good and let me tell you some this guy's a big dude\nA real world view is six three and you know his shoulders where you know three foot across either way but it's just the idea that he said uh you know he said I can only where one suit at a time well let me tell you something\nYou have besides death and taxes what are you really have in life you have you have income and you have that if you don't have debt that means you don't have to make a mortgage payment you don't have to make car payments think about this for a second I can spend your money\nAnd he's going to spend the seven eight thousand dollars a month is even six ... five or six possibly how can you spend it if you don't have any debt\nSo think about this you don't really need as much as your thing\nBut so when you win the lottery I can tell you a lot of people do they ultimately find ways of giving it away making you grow for them and um you know you just giving money as a way if he did ever win a lottery\nI think about this for a second if you had a large amount you know twenty thirty million dollars forty million dollars the rule of thumb is you always take the lump sum when we take the lump sum and you pay the taxes immediately pay the fifty percent in taxes\nBut if you win a smaller lottery smaller amount it might be behoove him for you to take the payout simply because of the fact that\nYour taxes and will be much less you're you're not going to get hit\nWith a fifty percent but you can knock it down to ... you know thirty five percent possibly if you go to the four or five hundred thousand dollar payment pending on how much you actually one usually start off at like three hundred thousand\nBut if you're paying thirty five percent of three hundred thousand versus fifty percent there's an argument to be said that take the lump sum if it's a smaller payout just so you can keep more of it without federal taxes taken that extra Fifteen Percent from yeah\nSo the rule of thumb is if you get a big big hit you take the lump sum you pay the taxes smaller lotteries are considered taking the the pay out the annuity part of it simply because the fact that you you'll get to keep more of it and it's an amazing thing when you think about it that\nThat you have the capacity to be tomorrow night this time we have the capacity to be a billionaire so go
