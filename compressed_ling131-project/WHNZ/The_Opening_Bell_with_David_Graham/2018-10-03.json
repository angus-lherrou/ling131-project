[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back the bulls bears have it's a blast over to the head over to Facebook Like is that ... radio see some of the bloopers behind the scenes and some of the educational stuff yeah there's mostly bloopers [laughter] see\nWhat has always made his case like that but you know uh the stuff that doesn't make the production is ... does it is it worth your making the production of as a lot of ... a lot of fun to go watch his head over there like us on Facebook a check in with us if you ever in the academy you know of the studios of ... and ... and get a lot going on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making that big social media push to try to get the word out\n... one of the things that we always talked about um ... and bears is understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay you as a business you know early we're talking about trading for income trading as a business truly setting us up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax reduction or you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as business\nWell let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity comes with people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up as as you can run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's a lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars you know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in ... insurance an inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have successes that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional business now imagine another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you're just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something at a lower price at a wholesale price somebody was there to fulfill that older and sell it you never had a housing mentor he never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building\nDidn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I saw trading as a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets\nIt was just amazing to see because I'd run small businesses for years and I had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talked to that guy all the time here at bulls and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top of his truck who's going from one job or the other is chasing my good employees that are just trying to stiff him he's got people that aren't showing up for work he's got people that own money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy and then I found them financial markets and this as a business is the dream and when business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for then we see it all the time and so many of you you don't understand that the markets can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously Inquirer to looking at trading for a business because what's important is the long term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches at most visit deal with you can get those out of the picture and guess what the sky becomes one it\nWell and that's exactly it champion a lotta individuals out there that want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize the business from home and that's what the markets can do for you online training academy\nThe sponsor bulls and bears I teach a class specifically on training as a business now

accused him of sexual assault I thought she was handle\nMen oh I was pulling syndrome that I wasn't into he couldn't do it all themselves the players didn't get a jobs and it\nDidn't didn't get that hit it you know it's unfortunate I think everyone in the Tampa Bay community was rooting for Chicago\nI think so too I mean everybody loved Joe ... yeah exactly irrational exuberance that's what's happening to the stocks right now and\n... Ted it's just unprecedented really when you look at what is going on down you know at first glance you know the stock market rally on Wall street it probably makes the the running of the bulls look like it's high on some kind of a grass of some sort\nYou know a better metaphor might be that if those are dancing on thin ice\n... [laughter] okay [laughter] was investors are gearing up for one heck of a stock market crash of ... think of it is stocks makeup over fifty percent of all pension fund propose portfolios and America\nRetirement money managers and um you know managing firefighters teachers government workers they have put almost sixty percent of their money in stocks and\nYou know it's you want to know why the Dow Jones has achieved a record high of just shy of twenty seven hundred points are only seven thousand points well there it is still you know it it is a wonder that the same pension funds\nYou think they've been dipping their dipping their toes into these we'd companies and while on a totally separate a RINO you know you have to wonder if some if someone in the Trump Administration has smoked too many of these joins you know you're thinking that sanctioning China\nOver its defense ... your procurement that uh decisions\nIs is any of its business you can't go a ... a country like China that's communist\nAnd deal with them because they don't do deals it's a whole separate culture\nAnd right now they're analysts that are coming in and actually starting to accept the fact that you know what these people are going away Twenty years and they have all their front memo mumble we talked about the thirty one missing billionaires yeah what happened to him yeah and they just disappeared\n... well that Jack was Jack Ma Jack Ma you hear when he came out it was yesterday no gay now he's a spokesman he was an English teacher writing in English teacher that started his own little Amazon and China\nWorks with the government with the government is selling this company going back to teaching English\nBut he's set up a foundation for all of this money then goes to people in China and what does he say he you know he's a front for the government and he says that\nThis is going to last twenty or Thirty years because the Chinese government is not going to back down\nNot going to back down and there are already planning\nOn President Trump walking away from the national debt in America but she's walked away from so many companies that have gone bankrupt they'll say screw you and me the Chinese he says he is going to say there was well you know you're screwed us we're not going to pay you a forget about a trillion dollars of treasury bonds\nI mean this is how the Chinese are thinking\nOkay there's they're thinking that way all you've done it before five times you're surely going to do it does too and so long story short of it is that in itself the even the thought of that could cause a correction or fresh or what have you were going into unknown waters\nAnd you know you can only control what you can control and you always say there's one thing you can control is is not losing your money but when you look this is a funny correlation out there between all the marijuana stocks and the defense stocks\nYou know first you know you take the word ... irrational exuberance I'm In ... that came from the mantle of all the tech stocks\nAnd all the things stocks and um basically there's a flipside to end the safety net that stands between the the total economic collapse in the end and the stock market you could you could see it you know and\nYou could see why you know we have all seen this before\nAnd during the late Nineteen nineties the tech bubble burst into the stock market crash and ended up wiping out some of the most iconic brands of the dot com era you remember pets dot com\nAll these companies just disappeared just like the missing Chinese billionaires\nAnd or the stock market bubble maybe even the worst um there's a company called tool ray\nAnd to re is a perfect example of a resurgence of this irrational exuberance Nate's company that produced revenues of twenty eight million in annual revenue\nOkay that's about what a Starbucks cafe does okay nevertheless just a few months after listening on Wall street at Seventeen dollars a share the stock has\nGained a two hundred percent excuse me a two thousand percent increase now is that three hundred dollars which are\nGay Seventeen dollars to three hundred dollars a year and now it has a market cap of thirty six billion dollars thirty six billion dollars\nOn a company that that may twenty seven million ... what are we missing here um that's more than ...\nWhich would arrest three hundred and forty million daily users so that's when we talk about irrational exuberance there it is\nI mean it's it's just mind boggling where we're going this um things things that could we rush on job ruins a crash the news Tesla seems fitting that Eldon must the CEO of Tesla\nYou know he spoke to a to do a guy on a podcast while he was smoking a joint and indeed Tesla's stock\nThat could that could produce the spark that triggers the next next year is crash this time it's serious even legal marijuana won't keep Tesla investors from having to confront the fact that many critics have pointed out that the electric car company ever since when public back in two thousand ten\nUm that it's now a totally different company and the revenue you said fifty billion dollar capitalization and it hasn't made one dollar when one penny it's on the good faith that people investing in it\nAnd even Musk himself says that that that doesn't make any sense and and he's the one who runs the ... company for crying out loud I'm\nWith them than the timing is everything with so much of this and you know we have this this trade war now going on with China and the midst of stocks making record highs are and remember they how they made record highs are fueled by the tax cuts\nAnd those are like an athlete taking steroids okay the stocks are going up not because companies are making money but it's just the fact\nAll these tax cuts that went into effect did not help Joe the plumber and Joe six pack these people that owned the companies when familiar news to the to multi millionaires to be billionaires and and I always say this only one or two people in America wants to share of stock\nAnd what about the fifty percent of people that haven't been part of this whole process and\nWith with Musk when when they saw him on a podcast smoking a big joint while then of course everyone's throwing rocks at them it's amazing that Jeff Sessions than its have somebody
