I Would put Alice it's you're above oh really\nYeah because he's shown that he can lead a team to victory in in in the play offs but he's yet I'm Alex Schmidt was one of those guys leading Kansas City\nPassed and it'll look right and they were up by like twenty four points in the second half so Alex Smith has taken that next step he\nBut I I I guess my thing was he's not as talented the ... the two guys you name a natural town just pure natural talent but as quarterback\nThe talent is one thing but being able to lead a team is another thing\nSo if I have they are both twenty three years old and you're going to happen for the next ten years you take out some of the ... you know I Would\nTake Andrew Luck I Would I Would make sure I have a problem the gym I Would put pieces together I Will make sure that we gave this kid a dynamic running game in an office of line and you know some rock solid tied into it and like I Would do the things you're supposed to do once you lock in\nYour your um your quarterback\nYou're you're you're the face of your friends are as you do once you have him on a rookie contract then you go out you build your team\nI think the issue as you mentioned it's been a lack of talent at around him and it's similar to another quarterback although he has been able to win a championship and have some more more success and I think he's had more town around them but there are times where we say man can Aaron Rodgers gets them\nCan you know I agree with that more guys whether it be defensively whether it be running game and he's got running backs that's just a you got wide receivers that is running back so I think Aaron Rodgers has a similar case where you say man I Know he's good I Know he's talented but if he could just get some help around it\nBut the difference is Aaron is on that are elite level he might be the best that he's three levels above you know look in in the town of three and no no he's three\nBecause I feel like you get you created some levels at that point [laughter] I added more or less like four or level like more like it was at three and then you've got air Roger that for you to put them in like six\n... ... I Know what I'm saying is in terms of elite right it's only what it right now it's four elite quarterbacks in the NFL\nOkay I'm thinking of three who's the park as we got Brady you ...\nDo you ever been around is it in yeah\nOkay I have been robbing but I don't know if he's quite there anymore in Robert Byrd could throw over seven hundred yards in any moment says the guy who hasn't won his fantasy team does lend you know and it's not even about that it's about big being do look what he did today like he has that pedigree\nRight so I Would agree I Would agree with you that he has more into town\nRight on right on right on point the highlights right there no business that guy ... those type of passes isn't it come on man his ability to ... Matt Ryan into that Ryan that Ryan is\nA step below\n... he he's below he's not elite really good but not All right I'm okay with that\nAh there's a team that is suffering and the raiders did they pay the wrong man\n[noise]\nAt discover we believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to get new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget\nAt the end of your first year will match all the cash back you earned dollar for dollar no caps and no catches because we know if you try us you'll like us and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match cash back match offer only for a new car members limitations apply\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHome in science or helped me find them back home pros in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews the check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife loves most is that Holleman minds are completely free to you do at home at ... dot com boy download the ... to get started\nHelpful\nYou can listen fought our first I ... [noise] download it now [noise]\nI mean it's it's a great situation I've ever had a baby is the more known guy but what\nYou want to be right one a one be bin Laden's burger is going to spread the ball around but you know if you look I I Believe he threw the ball to\nTen different receivers you know sort of some guy who's already been hit it off he caught a pass he threw a pass it with tip that he caught it himself so that counts as a target\nYeah I don't know if he was happy bodies yards do negative one yards and I think he was happy about that\nBut you won't see LeBron different receivers that he targeted including himself I mean to have that type of ability to it's hard to to put a guy you know\n... ... the number one guy when you look at a B a B is going to he's going to demand the double team so that is true that anyone else has to step up and Jew Jew has done a tremendous job in getting that single coverage and taking advantage of the defence the defence gives them\nAs absolutely true there and and that's where you got to give credit to him actually Alex I Do want to go through been talking about James Caan are of course running back we've had a lot of success this year I mean he's run the ball is ... is caught the ball he's got a really good season that's far but been talked about the fact that hey there may be our star running back coming back and living on bill\nJames Frey attack was that that gets guys going you know it it it gets you your stuff that guys are being physical and um it it's a lot of fun to see guys aren't going to quit on place and ... and James I thought was he was a bowling ball today it was all over the place what a great game but you know I Know it's his last game for us so slave I was coming back but I thought you'd want his last one\nNow what does that that's a joke right I mean he's ... well because he he went last game maybe he made last game starting but that doesn't mean that just kind of can't place like Libya and has to run the ball every play\nSo I I Believe it was a little tongue in cheek leaves back they're trying to convince me as if they're going to put them on the plane why do you keep ... Alex now you don't know either\nAnd that's not that it's that he's been gone for so long now you're going to get your value out of a make a run every freaking ball now since he's back okay now will make sure you're back we're gonna make you run every single ball or\nOr the opposite you spy them\nYou say come on back we've been winning some games lately with algae James counters looked like a a starting running back in his league were good without you know and again they're not going to not give lady on the ball the bell bell the ball but what I'm saying is look Connors been great I mean even on the roster\nSo ... yeah so maybe I'm not even on a roster Deb chart or anything so I think it's a little I think I think like that all the websites update you know after last Sunday and Monday rolls around I think I think it all up day that will be my guess\nBut as it still is do you just throw live beyond in there or are in and stop the momentum that the James has had me that a tremendous a year so far running above\nCourting Jillian Alex you do I'm with you look I'm going with a guy that's been play well I'm going with the guy that it seems like the team is getting along with you know and it seems to be working well with a touchdown by the way\nFor the rams and now it looks like a tiger early in the end zone there so now they're up big on the Broncos\nTwenty three a case keep them in the team is not going well for them right now All right ah Alex ... is going to join us next maybe we can as Alex that do you go to a lady on bell or do you keep going to James Caan I Will do that
