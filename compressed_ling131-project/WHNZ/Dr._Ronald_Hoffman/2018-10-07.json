D G um and he he mentioned something that we haven't gotten into but it reminds me of a kind of how you feel about the chargers I think there is another team similar\nAnd that will be the bangles yeah words yeah okay you know we've been here before where they've had some good seasons we been here before we say and he don't really play well we've been here before we say AJ green a is you know one of the top three for receivers in the game\nBut then they all do anything in the postseason were waiting all are waiting for them but part of our job is to discuss what happened earlier to games and again if the from saloncom and Washington with you on Fox football Sunday company live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say fifty percent or more car insurance with a guy go\nGo to a guy called our comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way\nIs easier but\nAs he mentioned twenty four points with the bangles in the fourth quarter\nYeah that was a that was impressive and a red rifle guy to pop in and and but you look at at Cincinnati and like you said no one's talking about it right because we've seen this we read this book before right\nYeah we were we were we weren't in our lives we're doing what you read same book over and over and\nI'm done I already know how it in [laughter] and it's up to them to rewrite the ending of this book but it's also familiar to all of us\nYou know who has the same book that I feel like I've read over and over ... ... yeah I mean it's a Dr seuss cat in the head I got to know what's going on here one fish blue fish redfish some fish okay I Know what's going on here\n... ... to fish redfish redfish intercession ...\nAnd then\nTo fish for fish for how do you have a six a couple of them in the game so um Miami Dolphins when they invested in Ryan than a hill and everyone went huh\nThat was like the Kurt cousins of like eight years ago right where you go maybe work is better\nThan Ryan ten whoever was to to justify the money\nYeah I agree Kurt cousins is better than I intend to heal and it would just to the point where it was just like\nOkay\nAfter your three if we don't see the steps we need to make them a franchise quarterback than we got to start thinking about moving on but then you know you heard in the OJ Cutler comes in and it's\nIt's just you know it's the bagels and the dolphins and that's why we hadn't talked about that game yet to strip the earthly reason again we are talking about because it's costing as exciting and it is uh divisional game and that is the rams and the sea hawks rams just get a ... Gurley a run for about three yard touchdown run there waiting on this\nExtra point because the way these extra points are set up\nThis season you never know a little weight here two seconds to see if it's good it's up you have I made it barely made it and it's good twenty four tight in this game five left for the third or talk girlie again looking looking really good\nAnd it's amazing the way also how they used ... by the way because you forget ... Gurley if you need to you can load up in twenty five thirty times you can\nGo in there at all you can you he's one of those guys we talked about earlier today are not a lot of them in the league he's bilko you can call you get on the twenty five thirty times the game and it gets stronger as defenders get tired and and\nAnd you know and and weaker throughout the course of the games on the fourth quarter he's a big deal he's able to do and accomplish a lot\nThe best the best part about this for the rams they haven't had to use him like that right so as you mentioned later on during the season let's say come we ate and you're like oh we need some teams you know maybe the games are tighter or some of these teams have ah you know you're better off running against and maybe they have explosives ... that's what he's going to be fresh\nAnd he said I you know he's 'cause he's not being use thirty thirty five times just simply running it I mean yeah he gets the ball definitely in the back to that as a receiver but they're not running the ball thirty thirty five times with him beating them down wearing them down so I think he's going to be first second half of the season when they really may decide to start going to have some more\nUm interesting it'd be interesting to see that for sure the writers are down here\nAnd soul\nNo signal yet looks like maybe they were stopped short the one yard line trying to score touched down here against the charges charges up twenty six to three up big on the raiders met tough season right now for the raiders as we mentioned there one in three looks like they're going to want it for and it could have been\nOn five to ... to get robbed last week um\nDo you think about that they're going to have a extremely high draft pick if this continues\nWhat what was the wide open touchdown because it looks like a tight in was wide open on the outside to hurry up got the ball right as the the rough set the ball down in a hike it and they just do it all the way out to the rise with that title is joining us it could be joining us I couldn't see has already Nelson\nWhy how joining Nelson wide open because I Want to see the replay how this happened so again they got down to the one that was not a touchdown\nThey broke the huddle nobody went over to the huddle in yeah just for some reason the best receipts", "show_name": "Dr. Ronald Hoffman", "month": "10", "state": "FL", "day": "07", "station": "WHNZ", "city": "Tampa"}
