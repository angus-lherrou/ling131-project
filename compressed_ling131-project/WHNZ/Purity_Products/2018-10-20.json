it mean to be family family's family ... you can make family family's lot at the bond ...\nWhen al\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I got to get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI leaned in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks [noise] how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nAbout from the table I shook his hand and I said or the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in\nThen I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need this guy did hesitate\nTo kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said\nI can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nCompany that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single called that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't so\nIm anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids to feed but then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one in the story is going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician a heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nThat listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time they have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all credit up and we have to help them out of that predicament I mean for crying out loud [laughter] that's what we do\nWe make furnaces heat pumps and air conditioners last longer we lower energy

I Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm\nIs why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks'\nBusiness people out there what's referral or a new customer worth to you\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this furniture air conditioning problem who do you use for your air conditioner and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we have ever\nHad at that point or you can go play Google roulette of course not you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company they're recommending served them well\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business\nNo look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you\nThat you've considered becoming a regular client and you tell other people about us\nThat's fair right okay\nYou have to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number if you're one of the first five people to text the letters\nH.

of the Tampa Bay area I'm your host Ryan doormen in this episode we're joined by children across borders one voice foundation and voices for children\nAnd with us in Studio we are a couple of gas ... cofounder of children across borders Marianne ... executive director of one voice foundation and\nRun a Kennedy executive director of voices for children the website you can go to to find out more about what we're talking about on the show is children across borders\nDot org thank you all so much for coming in and have you and you let me start review ... tell us a about children across borders before we get into how all three organizations are are connected or tell us a how children across borders got started in in the work that you guys do\nShow 'em so up the way it got started was a some years ago my husband and I were a considering me going back to walk and um [noise]\nI um when did you do something more meaningful and some to give back and so we decided as a entity to start to run across borders which was I'm\nA dual idea of giving back to\nA local community or the country but I'm a in a way where we live and the country if a bug in there and um and so uh that's why the named turned across the borders because um\nThe idea was to help children that will disadvantaged under privileged um ... uh education health shuttered wellness\nAnd a Tupac now like with like minded organizations like the one voice and voices for children I'm and I'm to bring in\nA funds to help these children grew and I'm In doing so education we've had many many different uh put programs in education\nUm health we do can sew and wellness um with um housing we have shelter programs and then when the programs or you know clean drinking water for example\nA but basically so we started this program we started the organization really for me to uh go back to work for\n'em but didn't have a meaningful way yeah and um and it has grown since we started in two thousand nine we got our international codes from the IRS\nAh into does know nine and it'll be ten years next Yale professor um it has grown tremendously we had we started off with full organizations are now we have Fifteen Oh nice nations while a Fifteen programs to countries and over two million raised\nSo um so that's the gist of the organization so a mission really is um bullets to support financial and non financial um uh programs within ...\nUh in these full edits education how shots and wellness or children focus I'm helping our community first nationally our country and then getting back to India where we're from\nOkay great so let me ask you this you started in two thousand nine or two dozen Eighteen now um how is the need grown or a lesson during that time frame\nA you know that's a tough question um I think it's growing and if you ask me and of course India is very different from the United states has you know\nThe need in India is probably ten times more um but the accountability is all of a tough so it's it's it's a tough it's a tough job but the in the United states um it depends education any I think we've come full what's a long ways but we've also have a lot more\nYou know to give 'em in our local community community the amount of finance would be the ... that gets done is so tremendous that there's always a need to give\n'em health as you know has grown tremendously when right issues can so to anything you can think of his that didn't exist you know\nAs an epidemic now didn't exist centuries ago is a big deal now of course it's grown I'm shelter again it just depends like foster homes like you know one voice or I'm studying right now has issues with kids in the street with\nParents in jail or you know so this so it depends on the issue really but I Would say it's grown\nHow do you kind of break that up uh kinda clarify that for us in terms of the local community ah ... the country you're in the United states in India how do you break up a were your resources go and how your programs help people\nSo it's very simple actually um it was give back to your um your community to get back to your country to get back to the world\nAnd so we're ... location and to get back to your community is Tampa so we've got nine programs I'm actually eight in Tampa one in New York they cracked that the United states and then get back to you to the world is India at this point it may grew to other countries but India at this point and if it's six programs that\nThey would the way it comes in is I actually it's only would've mouth\nNothing comes in from the cold um somebody knows somebody that says this person or this organization is doing tremendous\nTremendous job go check it out\nSo that's how I meet a man you know on me to run out\nAnd we sit down and we talk and we took but you know what they'll ... does and what it needs help life\nAnd because we do look snatch the non financial truly is that partnership so they tell me what you know what the need is we sit down with our budget based on how much fundraising we've done that you know how many\nFunds we've we've gone to do with the the couple of years and then we try and fit into a ... program that makes sense everything to flee saying it's all program funded\nAnd specifically so because we want to make it a accountable from start to finish your to your right I Want to make sure it's tangible is that the the funds up you know given to the children and so that ways you know the impacts ... onto the child\nAnd we want to sustain this program so uh and the organization so if the program is doing well wouldn't be open as they should we sustain that and if the nation is doing well itself we sustain the organizations it's a it's an amazing partnership\nBut how do you determine whether or not an organization or\nYou doing well is there a criteria but\nYes so we definitely have criteria and there was an accountability former report\nThat the organization has to fit in on a yo yo basis and that tells me based on that budget based on how many children are impacted how many children you know when the program um there was this older these to allow for that to be accountable\nAnd if there was an issue which sometimes they can be that you know I I made myself very well known that that there is an issue that the ... the money with the funds and not utilize it appropriately then we talk about it a little bit and make sure that they knew that that is on the full\nOf those four areas and for the children not for business expenses are administrative expenses because I'm not in for that I'm I'm raising money isn't getting donors to give me all of this um this money and I want to make sure it's for the child itself\nOr makes perfect sense we're doing our best to debate issue here and we're
