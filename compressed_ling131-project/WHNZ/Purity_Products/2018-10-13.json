hundred six to eight\nSo of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called the Bateman group and they have offices in New York and San Francisco and partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker them they'd had had to set up for the past year but the flack room was called a hash tag resistance and it was a police for workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud\nSo if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it and all\nThat well we're speaking with just cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\n[noise] that's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said he's had to tell his his small team that there really is just no police for political bickering network so he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who pays your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for\nCorporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we'll go from there\nHow much of this uh boils down to gender battles\nWell I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on on all sides of this that there were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think and then we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that I just I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal reporter ship cutter it's twelve minutes

divide conventional wisdom in some cases going against that wisdom actively seem to help them flourish in others to simply didn't hurt the way one might have expected steep psychic at the Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment says either way rival producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nWell I mean this is already in case of you know a movie star war which shot you know in retrospect seems like a no brainer big hit of course Bradley Cooper directing it directly himself as well as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffalo business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd probably a lot of success with the ... and a road shows\nYeah on the line but it's interesting about the film and and about the project is that uh there's really not a lot of reason to think this would work I mean for one from the studios don't really make you got to the movies any more movies for grown ups movies that are in about\nFranchising superheroes um for another was a movie that's been made three times before admittedly last time back in the seventies but with a lot of success before\nYou lose your belt but we make a movie fitting in about a in the past because if you're just going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version I again they bought that will too low series of sort of convention liberate the fine and um you know and then ...\nYou know that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not really making a movie that's already done well in debt that high bar right you do you think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's the thing now as low as or in the last few years maybe more than a decade now that at all it was just ... of course I'm television as well is that you know and I feel this way of the year I think a lot of people do is go see the thing that has come back but if if you bring them back to class\nOr if he don't look like necessarily feel like maybe a beach been kind of\nA ... sort of ... versions of those earlier boots I mainly just does one had that offer for one thing you know again it was back in the mid seventies so a lot of people who have paid a seeing a movie with Barbara Streisand Chris Chris christopherson\nOr you know it was a long time ago and I also think the world is changing the music world that a misspelled document or he was very much about a sort of a Mario Cooper's characters is with our country rocker but when I was a lot of a sort of pop superstar or all the way to becoming that\nThat's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances in the seventies show you know it's hard to disassemble remake it was a remake I think\nA lot to say about it and was informed to a great extent by what's happening right now\nWe're speaking with Stephen ... at the Washington Post ... the business of entertainment he's got a piece\nTitled the seven ways a star is born bucked Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway or we were talking off the air I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of near when I saw the opening weekend box number of of uh like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to\nEntertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oil wealth but put that number perspective because that's not really\nYou know they weren't after like a two hundred million dollar opening weekend\nThat's exactly right I you know I think the numbers are always funny where we get get gotta get inundated every weekend now we're on Monday rather with the box office numbers one the weekend right at the highest title and that's not really ... but sort of\nA state of who should be like anything else or any other financial benchmark\nWe kinda have to cook electric you know comparing it to if you made you know a hundred grand in the stock market or if your share that with that much but we were under fifty thousand or to buy that and that's probably not for the better whereas if you made ten grand of course and I'd always been a thousand that's a pretty good return and similar scenario I mean it's the mid ...\nA movie aimed at grown ups are not meant to be this kind of global assault on the box office but there are ... might be for you after so uh you know the fact that he made forty two point six million when you look at\nYou know how how ... D movies do I look in the beach at the greatest showman which is a musical although he did quite well last year and we started out with eight million and and that's another factor here Gordon\nUh we we tend to have ... ... where the movie industry calls a leg to say you know you have a the Avengers or you have a big superhero movie I can kind of coming up pretty quickly started more than opens in October ... she wants our room and two months out from Christmas scale\nOf this film could play every weekend do if he does anything approaching even a fraction of that are there to have a major hit on their hands and I think they will\nLike Steve Stephens I checked at the Washington Post it is twenty minutes\nNow in front of the hour on this weekend\n[noise]\nWhen the state ranks among the top ten in the country for major new and expanded facilities are that's pure growth [laughter]", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
