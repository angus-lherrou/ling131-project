{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "One left so I've been the message HVAC one and send it to the number three six to six zero\n\nHey let's talk filters for a minute are you buying a cheap filter\nHuh admitted just admitted okay\nWell if you are you might want to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to come ... Lee disassemble your heating and air conditioning system haven't completely clean sanitized disinfected and put it back together and vet\nCan get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay a little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your ... your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through okay if you can hold\nYour filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay [laughter] that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering\nYour air and it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay\nThat's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police did\nFilter that's P pleaded filter look for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down and it's going to cost you\nBetween six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big fan um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouths your system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters\nIt can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock stoppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in\nThe rose they give you a great return on investment okay\nYou know I Can't tell you how many people we talked to on a weekly basis that have allergies or kids with allergies where we go out with a clean up their system possibly pop in a better filter UV light and the system sterilize or or something like that for them to get these calls\nMy kids aren't having the same type of allergy symptoms they were having before and we're not sneezing in the house\nAnd the whole process takes about an hour and a half to two hours to do the tuna\nNow look we've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've got maybe four maybe five of these left to give away at the discounted rate and I want to thank everyone who's

on and we're going to get into that in just a little bit\nBut let's start with the bladder and the urinary tract and many times people are getting up at night here and it it kind of disturbs sleep then\nIt's not terrible but it's aggravating and you don't feel as rested in the morning and it starts fairly innocuous Lee whether you're male or female and often all the body needs is a little more in the way of bio lab and knowledge\nAnd while one of the power houses for delivering about five hundred different ... is our ... floor and it's the best source\nSo that I've found and this of course maybe taking two of these three times a day for a few weeks see if it doesn't hit the spot and work perfectly for you or if so great then after about three or four weeks most people can cut down to one or two per day\nAnd that can be just exactly what you need in terms of these ...\nSometimes the bladder you've gone on a long time with this\nAnd uh the bladder is I'm not happy in fact bio films can form these are sick sticky sugary sex stuck on the mucus membrane like dried music is very hard and the best bet in helping the body\nTo clear this is the active fractions from garlic Allison and of course that's rich in the uh garlic citing product\nSo this may be just what you need is to uh maybe take some bladders support because it's engineered to\nTarget nutrients toward the bladder and to provide all the broad spectrum of needs for the bladder tissue and then uh maybe taking two or three bladder support right along with two or three girl aside and support\nMaybe just what you need

thirty four forty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven let's go right\nTo the phones to this is about Marshall PHD this is help line live let's go to one in Miami and he's got a question about magnesium is linked to blood pressure go ahead and one\nOf the Michael thank you I was going you because\nI had to go um I was string for Iron Man I I like it to enjoy the sport and while the strength and I got my check\n'em long story short I go to the hospital and to be the budget cuts and then after many cats they discovered that have had the crash at that time I watch them they're actually working on a strap and I was training for the sport\nI haven't read anything about my knees you might get annoyed about it and I I got an economic issue my luck I can make it a catchy medication when she got a habit how do I know um if we can wipe it out of high blood pressure like I got kind I don't know how to create\nWhat because I was like listen when I was looking to cash no way to show when like me should liberals\nAre no it won't and the reason is that um blood tests the magnesium are pretty much useless because I'm magnesium is held in the blood by adrenaline\nAnd in my opinion it's unlikely that the magnesium was the problem or it's more likely that you sweat very heavily you depleted salt you ate food that may have had bugs in it\nAnd it got carte blanche to the circulatory tree that's the most common phenomena that links us to a issues with blood pressure's so\nCould it be magnesium yeah but it'd be real hard to tell you could go in a good drugstore now stick your arm in there and see what your blood pressure is no cause no obligation\nTo get an idea of where you are now what I see over and over again with athletes like you is you sweat very heavily and you're not paying attention to salt now most Americans in my opinion eat too much salt but athletes especially enduring Seth leads anybody doing anything and Durant\nOften deplete salt so the way you can test this one is when you break a sweat you'll reach over to the upper outer part of your arm and taste the perspiration\nIt should tea you taste slightly salty not anybody else you if it doesn't you need to pick a teaspoon of salt like air derived sea salt or better yet are pink on for two or three days until you break the sweat and you can taste it then I Would cut back and\nI monitor that so I always have a slightly salty taste\nNow you have plenty of hydrogen Laura casket and no little bug can get past your stomach okay now if you're still want to support healthy blood pressure and when you go and check your blood pressure you may want to go on something like cardio PJ how old are you know how much the way\nI Am forty five now where a hundred and eighty pounds\nYou

also of course we wanted to touch on the lungs and the lungs are our giant mucus membranes that of course\nThey actually in Chinese medicine the backup to your large intestines so why not digesting well\nWe can expect jump to be dumped into the lungs and all manner of problems can arise with the lungs and in almost every case what we have to start with is to improve digestion when we promote the best health digestion\nWe can greatly reduce the load on the lungs when we get vitamin D levels to the ideal maybe sixty to a hundred ... a leader in the blood just about no one who's wearing clothing\nHas a really ideal vitamin D three level and it's been shown to be involved in literally all of the immune compounds the body makes it's been shown to be very critical to the intestinal lining\nThe integrity of the lining to the health of the lungs and so much more so than jumping on R D three gold and maybe using six to ten drops a day if you're under forty usually can absorb this really well\nIf you're over forty than it might be a good idea to put those six to ten drops into a half ounces of water and they had two or three or four drops of Lyman that's an essential oil of

five eight eight Seventy five Seventy six it's go right ahead to the phones let's go to Richard in Boulder, Colorado on he's bloating and wants to track down to the source of his intestinal gas are you there Richard\nYes they abducting taking my call you will come hold a man or even how much do you weigh forty three about one Seventy eight\nThe odds are that the intestinal gas now is from either the gall bladder or your stomach is not able to produce enough hydro Cora gas it and those are the two culprits normally with intestinal gas does the gas you have to have older\nYes boy does it ever\nOkay well that is going to tell you the fats and proteins are being are rotting and so we now highly suspect age see oh so do you have loading almost immediately after you eat\nThe things I notice if I'm doing liquids for example I'm the raw milk here I don't really seem to have anything like that or else\nOkay we're gonna stop or say raw food does not require any digestive enzymes so that no no need for each sale or anything so you've got to exclude those we've got to deal with the cooked food okay yeah\nSo so that would have happened had I been taking ac out maybe two or three and an actor there mhm I'm immediately after eating and then if I remember I was trying to take it ends up I don't use your and then as I get asked about\nThat probably the problem let me tell you why [laughter] well I'm not here to knock anybody else's product but normally when you buy detain hide record it'll contain perhaps and\nThe catalyst that make it work in the stomach\nWe know that when you mix perhaps in with hydrogen gas it the hydrogen or a gas would slowly destroys the pipes and so we put the ... in digest so you need to take a couple of our diet just at the start of the meal now

[laughter]\nProtocol then if you like the first\nOne or two died just at the start of a meal even if you forget and take it at the end works almost as good in the end you would take a couple of
