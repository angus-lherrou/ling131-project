America gets half ounce per pound a body weight of water per day and that's kind of the minimum so let's say you were a hundred and fifty pounds you'd need Seventy five ounces of water a day it's a little\nBut less than three chords and unfortunately a by not getting that water it's very very hard and the kidney the other problems for the kidneys are really it shares this with the brain is getting way too much refined oil which is almost always omega six\nAnd then there by having a inadequate amount of omega three fatty acids and in particular the end chain form of omega three that's so

medicine to be the power of a man or woman\nSo one of the things that I Would encourage you to do is begin some moderate exercise that may mean just a twenty minute brisk walk daily with no glasses out in sunlight that would be a wonderful start\nAnd then from that begins some moderate stretching exercises as far as the bruises go\nThe first thing I Would do is get on some kidney support\nAnd your age and wait about three meals the other thing I Would do is make sure you're not eating any cooked food without taking digestive support like one of them died just you would need about two of those at the start of the main meal\nAt the end of the meal about two or even three detained ...\nAnd if you're really smart one hydro ... acid activated we called HDL activated and now you're
