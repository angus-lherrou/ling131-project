things that are being done around the world\nSo first of all when we talk about this ... what is the job of this arid well it's to regulate oxygen uptake of every cell in your body so it's really important player\nAnd it desperately needs iodine anti ever seen and we'll talk a little bit about each of these the iodine is a big deal we have many sections of our country where there's very little iodine\nAnd some people joke that it's called the ... belt because the thyroid may in large when it doesn't have adequate iodine or I don't find anything funny in that and uh when we see what's been done worldwide we realized that\nThat rate is very very important in many many women as they get older and some men find that they're low inside rocks in and actually take some sort of a drug to support\nThe rocks in production and this issue we particularly uh doing a lot of testing feel that there's more to know their than\nThan we're currently using to help people first of all I Would

synthetic forms of iodine which will meet\nThe needs of the fat red but uh in our testing is concerned that they may not meet the needs of the rats in the ... and so you may be setting the stage for
