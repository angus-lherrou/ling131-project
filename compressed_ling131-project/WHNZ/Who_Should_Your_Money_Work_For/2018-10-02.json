back to a special radio presentation how to make money on the markets fall my name is\nJohn from the John ... show and today my special guest as Larry Jacobs in director of instructor development and top instructor at online trading academy Larry let's get right into it\nTell us why online trading academies patented core trading strategy is so important and so unique because many people right now they don't really have an education and how to invest in the market so let's talk about why oh TAs curriculum is so important well it's like\nPlaying any game without any rules\nThe one thing that we noticed was a lot of students that come in I don't really understand the market they've never even looked at a price chart in fact I've actually traveled to some of the top business schools and universities and don't even look at charts and they're teaching investment classes ... its mind blowing because one of those things I think our students really take away is\nThis looks really hard and how can people learn how to do this when they come to our classes and they start looking at shorts and they start to realize\nAnybody could do this the most amazing aha moment I've got and has been when they actually go back to the year two thousand and eight they can actually see the moment they should have gotten out of the markets\nAnd right they're they're like oh my God I've learned something that I now can use over and over again even if I think it's setting up that way I can protect myself\nThat's the key is understanding what these charts you're saying\nBut a lot of people get intimidated when they look at a sharp but again I referenced the GPS in your car the GPS is keeping track of what direction your vehicle is moving in educated investors used price charge to decide what price they want to buy and sell\nAnd the reason why the roller coaster action\nIn the stock market is seen on a price chart it's because the big banks are constantly buying and selling that's why it is so important for you to buy when the big banks by and for you to sell when the big bang cell and price charts is a way that the average investor can look\nFor portfolio and make an educated decision one to bind self\nYeah you know people think it's really hard there's a lot of math involved well someone once told me don't have to be smart to trade I Love that show [laughter] but but the reality here it's it's really not that hard\nIt's like anything else in life there are people who started their jobs in the first day and they learned how to create careers same thing when it comes to trading once you understand the rules of the game it's easy\nIn fact you know if everyone thought it was going to take this long time to patent Darkhorse strategy and\nThought I'm going to take years in reality it only took ... months the reason is that we're actually teaching things for our students that most people don't know we've had market makers from Wall street come to our classes I mean there's a way to really look and understand\nPrice action on a chart most importantly where to sell and where to buy and once you're able to do that it's almost like that old adage give Amanda Fish sheets for a day teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime we're teaching our students\nHow to fish and it's in a way that's very very easy very methodical very rural base\nAnd a lot of our students come out of our classes just amazed why they couldn't have done this earlier and are now taking their kids to class which I Love I think it's great get educated when you're younger and imagine what you can accomplish in your later life\nAnd these price charts once again they're available on your smartphone\nYour laptop your tablet and that's the power of technology helping\nEducated investors profit in the market now many years ago these price charts were not readily available but thanks a technology and the Internet now everyone is on the same level playing field\nIt's yours if you want it it's yours if you want to get educated so instead of losing money or instead of listening to your financial advisor to stay in the market as the market's going down you can be proactive and begin to profit as it is going down\nNow that is a game changer for many people listening to the show right now\nA mansion if you could have profited in two thousand one of the market crash\nImagine if you could have profit in one of the market crashed\nIn two thousand and eight instead many of us lost a lot of money because you didn't know how to do it\nYour financial advisor is not going to teach you how to do this because if they did you would fire them\nBecause you wouldn't need them anymore so that's the reason why the average investor is left in the dark\nBecause the more educated you get the less help you're going to need which means your financial adviser is not going to make as much money so right now I'm giving away too free passes to the next\nHalf day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as how the financial markets really work and also the video\nHad her attire with more money than you
