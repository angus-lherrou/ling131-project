something folks a lot of people out there pitching annuities to you you need an annuity it's a fixed income product it's a pension is what it is essentially creating your own pension and that I knew that gives you a fixed rate of return for a significant amount of time which is nice and a lot of people want that but here's the problem\nThe upfront cost the loads the commission on the front and a lotta times anywhere from four to ten percent so if you put a hundred thousand dollar nudey anywhere from ... goes to that guy that woman that license professor who just sold you went to the new ... understand that\nNow here's the other thing a lot of times is a term in other words if you want to liquidate your money you get liquidity out of that position you can't because you have to pay a penalty you have to pay a surrender charge up front that takes money off the bottom line as well and then as early redemption fees and a lot of other things that come into play and I'm not saying there's never a need for these I'm saying there oversold\nAnd Boulder bay as we believe that you can create that same annuity the exact same thing that that license personal going to say because they're representing Wall Street because they have a license and they were sponsored by our institution so you're letting some institution manage your money and they're competing for the same way that you and are competing for there's a divergence of interest right there\nBut what happens is some Wall Street firms now going to manage your money\nAnd the person who's actually making the decisions is Sonia what's in their inventory so for Newt he's in the image where they can sell it to you they get paid a large commission for that\nWe had ... to tell you that you can create that same annuity that they're selling you yourself\nWith the same products that they use in the financial markets because we can use those same products we have access to those you realize you can create a bond fund\nIn other words a fund that can give you a five or six protect return with very low risk and not pay any loads or upfront commissions and literally be able to create that yourself and get the same returns that you need to get out of an annuity without having to pay all those high fees and more importantly having full liquidity in your position you need a cash out you can't\nThere's so many things out there and we're trying to separate ourselves because we don't want to manage your money is not what this is about this is about you learning to manage your own money you learn how to self direct you will and if you learn the skills it allows you to make better returns for less cost think of that\nAnd that's what we're really hear about and that's why if we don't tell you this no money managers going to tell you that you should put your money and self directed they got to tell you put it on a management with me with us course they are because they have a vested interest in your participation\nBe careful folks you can learn the skills of self directing is not a complicated process you have to go through a learning curve but it's available and what I Love a sponsor\nThey teach people how to do it more importantly learn it somewhere learn how to self directing make better decisions yourself because ultimately if you don't get the returns you want and you don't hit those retirement goals\nAnd you have no say in the decision where are you then a lot of people are worried about run out of money that is a real risk in this country and that's the problem that a lot of people are facing\nWill share of you know a lot of individuals they think they don't have enough time they don't think they're smart enough they think you know they don't have enough money that it's you know they should be focusing on it and people make reasons and they make excuses all the time either don't miserable money and realistically you know how much time as they can take somebody six to ten hours a month I have students that I might try to get him but I personally coach to manage their wealth and six to ten hours a month\nThey don't have to where they get the same returns or better returns\nThat all those products available out there and he has a beautiful thing they can make money when the market goes down to the problem with a lot of those money managers that they put you in some sort of a position where if the market was up to make money the mark goes down you give it back\nAnd if it doesn't go up dramatically enough the fees that they're charging you take up the profitability that you do get so got a plan in place where you can make money regardless of direction more importantly\nYou'd have to pay all those fees and ultimately get those returns you want and what's great about that as the increase probability lowers costs that's a no brainer that's why self directing is becoming so prevalent\nIn so many people looking for a chance to learn how to do that exactly in our sponsor online training academy they teach a class specifically on self directing\nNow whether or not you have a four one K. and Iran maybe have some cash in a in a trading investing
