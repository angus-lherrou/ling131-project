[noise] download it now\nThe CBS News on the hour sponsored by zoom video conferencing\nGet a hold of that money and more importantly champ I've met people in two thousand nine two thousand ten they were retired in two thousand six to ... thousand eight captured forty percent of their nest egg and they went back to work\nAnd that's a travesty because think about that you work your whole life you build a nest egg and see that four one K. again it's a savings account here's the difference folks a pension was until you died\nAnd the companies would support you till you died it was half salary most science fifty percent of your income but it was there until you die and then we started out living the money and outliving the ability for them to carry us and so the pensions are gone\nVirtually gone and so four one K. steps in which was originally a savings account\nHelping you to have a forced savings position where you could\nPut money aside for the future finite amount of money but you'd have the capital intact no matter what happened because it wasn't a very low risk negligible risk almost a a savings account if you would lower return but the capital would stay intact and other you contribute it would be there but the problem with the four one K. is\nIt's managed by Wall Street it tracks the performance of Wall Street and you have the full risk of owning Wall Street and that was not how it was set up and so not only is it a finite amount it's got all this risk in a market that's\nOverpriced and overvalued and we see just we see the reckoning come in and you need to get ready the key is if you learn the skills of self directing think about this thing about if you could manage your own nest egg\nNot pay somebody else and made money regardless of direction if it went up you can make money went down to make money then moving to make money because those are the ways Wall Street functions\nAnd what's great about that is that many of the students of our cat um me and many of the list is the bulls and bears are starting to understand they need to do something they need to control that money and you speak of all these people that have money and a four one K. and yet they live paycheck to paycheck and so they got this bulk of money maybe it's a couple of hundred grand which isn't enough to ever let them retire on\nAnd they can't even get at is even if they want to do when they might be in their fifties and sixties and they might need liquid ... they might find it up as soon as they want to get that money out and their hands are tied you'd have to pay a penalty and fees and some of them won't even let you out that's your money\nTo savings account it was never meant to be an investment account and it was never meant to be speculated on Wall street\nAnd that's the problem and think about this folks how many people do know who all wealthy because of their four one K. they built well I'm Talking millions and millions of dollars in a four one K. it's virtually nonexistent\nAnd so people are trying to have just enough money to make until they die as a finite amount it's got full market risk of Wall Street and you're paying somebody the management and you'll and whether you're it goes up or down you pay them\nAnd you opted into that think about that\nWe're here to tell you that uses a better plan a better way you can learn the skills of self directing that but you could take control of that retirement bucket and do better yourself we've seen it's we know exist and we've been talking about it for a long time and guess what everybody listen to us as smart enough to take over that money and be able to learn the skills of self directing that bucket of money and and who cares more\nAbout your money than you and that's the whole point I mean if you're out there and you're the person listening you this and you have capital in a retirement account but yet every single month there's not enough money and you seem like you're struggling with your family you gotta ask yourself is that money that's going into their retirement account is the best place\nTo go right and what's the trade off so you so when you retire you got a big pile of money but it's not enough to watch anyway and you could take control of that money now and use it and do a better job in Wall Street will do because you can learn the skills of self directing exactly and that's why our sponsor\nOnline training academy they understand individuals' are out there they don't understand how they can handle their own four one K. they don't understand what they can and can't do that four one K. they're living paycheck to paycheck and they're put money into it but yet there's almost more month and money and that's why they have a class specifically on self directing getting a hold of the resources that you have\nThat you could actually manage yourself a lot of people don't realize that they can do this and they're also smart enough to do this and that's where they have a

behind the scenes well it's\nGreat because we've got a lot of Facebook Live stuff that's been posted now and you just get to really get into what we're all about bowls and bears which is you're smart enough you can make money regardless of direction of the market Wall Street lies we think that there's a lot of things out there that you can do better yourself if you manage and self directing money you'd like to know your money we talk about that also I Know your money that's a\nKey part is known your money champ I mean one of the things a lot of individuals don't understand is the money that they have sitting aside at a checking account or a savings account everybody has a rainy day fund or a slush fund or the emergency fund\nAnd a lot of people don't realize that money that's just sitting in a bank can be used for income and a lot of people want to utilize the market and they don't understand how they can have consistency more importantly they don't understand that they can do something a couple of hours a week on a part time basis and trade for income chip let's take a moment talked\nThat while I referenced earlier session imagine if you could make money regardless of direction of the market and we can do that individually we can do with stocks we with futures encourage these options there's so many ways that we can play in the financial markets\nAnd more importantly there's things that we can use that allow us to use the leverage in that process which we will give me a good return with a little bit of capital\nAnd understand something folks and people always talk about risk and risk management and we're big proponents of managing risk one of the most important aspects of being successful long term whether you're talking about managing your own nest egg self directing or trading for income as risk management\nAnd so paramount to that is understanding that there's ways I can manage risk and still get good returns without a big pile of money and some of those things are futures and it's amazing how\nI was an orientation I might trade academy just recently and we asked around the room how many have retreated and virtually every hand\nThat said they treated before they traded stocks and there's nothing wrong with that equities but they're very capital intensive they takes a lot of money that control woman on them you know so there's other instruments like futures encourage these where we can take advantage of ... just like we can and stocks we don't have to have all that capital and we're all that\nApple tied up in our positions and so it was a real eye opener for a lot of people because when we look at the size of some of these global markets stock markets relatively small the futures market on a global scale and the currency markets immense\nAnd so for a lot of people when they begin to realize that\nThe market could provide them an income in their spare time probably Seventy percent of the students have online trade academy have full time jobs and careers outside of treating an investing and they do is another stream income\nAnd so for a lot of people it's just basically a way for them to make extra money and they can do it in their home now the key thing and ultimately what's going to help you be successful in this process as you've got to learn how to make good decisions what is a good trade what is a good opportunity and so a skill set is built overtime and having a plan and places paramount\nBut once you start to get that down it's not a really complex system you can start to make money consistently and we see people at the academy that\nTheir stay at home moms are school teachers and they supplement their income with a nice return every week simply by utilizing the market for short term income and it's not hard process people think you have to be some sort of guru brilliant or a technician or shortest or mathematician to be successful it's really just seeing a picture\nAnd when people start to understand that and they can see that picture\nAnd what's it's built around and just following the strategy of what that picture tells us they can be successful and we see it over and over again people utilizing the market for short term income when\nYou know champ I mean a lot of people don't understand that it doesn't require a lot of time doesn't require you know the ... the knowledge is just a skill that you got to learn and you always say this is a skill building process and want someone to have that skill\nNo one can take it from now the problem is is the average American when they trade they don't have consistency and if someone's going to trade for income where they can count on to pay either their mortgage or to pay a car payment they need to have that consistent\nWell not consistency come as a repetition and time and more importantly\nHow to manage risk and so one of the key elements and people always ask me what they hear us on bowls and bears they say what do you do you know they said what does online treaty came to sponsor and I tell people they teach people how to lose money the right way\nAnd they say why did you did you teach people how to lose money I said the right way because in order for you to make any money in the financial markets you have to take risk that'd be a huge risk but you have to be willing to take on some risk\nBut when you're wrong you get back on very little amount when you're right you made more that's the key to long term success and if you could do that with a small amount of capital in a currency counter futures account and you can learn a skill set from the ground up over three to nine months learning curve and then you could literally go into the markets daily weekly and get paid\nThat's life changing for people and that's what the opportunity is and people get confused or think that training takes way too much or I have to be way too smart and that's the lie of Wall Street we believe ... anybody to listen to us can be successful you just gotta learn the skill\nAbsolutely and that's why the sponsor bulls and bears online training academy as a class specifically on trading for income now this is the class how right at the campus at the five hundred dollar value we only have a few seats to give away if you want to utilize the market as a second stream income or mainstreaming comes this is the opportunity for you whether your brand new to the markets you been in the markets if you're looking for that consistency\nPick up the phone we're going to take callers ten to twenty
