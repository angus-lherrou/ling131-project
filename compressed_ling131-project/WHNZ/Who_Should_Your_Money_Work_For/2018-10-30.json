National Institute of mental health suggested the fluoride damaged teeth could uh the damage she could be linked to psychological and behavioral problems problems a flawed may also play a role in some protein digestion and protein and tolerance issues its report it\nSo they're issues on both sides of this debate or Diana how are you a dentist or ... or what\nI like Ike Janice and also an instructor for dental hiking\nI see and you don't you don't ... I Know my dentist they want to ... or you can go in and they can put some fluoride on your teeth to right\nCorrect yeah\nAnd that's it and putting topical Florida and has a terrific choice the same as the other caller mentioned that was very true is boy if we would all just eat less sugar and brush our teeth more and so on this is all true but where the\nReally a huge benefit for the fluoride in the water is it is proven that the lower socioeconomic\nUh grew that doesn't um have or that oral hiking and that would be perfect if they did but they don't\nThis is where we see that they're the biggest results in the floor I the ... I Am as you know we put a\nPediatrician put fluoride we get floor eye drops for instance as babies and we give to our own yeah um and that's very beneficial is the teeth are forming the other thing I

around this weekend ask yourself wait a minute how is it possible you can make money when something goes down in value well you need to understand that the market allows all of us the opportunity\nTo place a trade or to invest in any direction the market goes in\nSo if you know the market's going down you could place in order to profit as it's going down now how many of you listening right now know how to do that and imagine if you knew how to do that in two thousand and you knew how to do that in two thousand and eight about how that would have changed your life\nThink about how that would have changed the value of your investments and your account\nAnd that's why is so important to understand how to make money when the market goes down and that's why we're having a special half day investing class\nSo you can see what it's all about because so many people listening right now they're relying on a financial advisor and let's face it your financial advisor doesn't teach you anything\nThat's the problem so right now I'm giving away too free passes\nTo the next half day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as how the financial markets really work and also the video\nHad to retire with more money than you need something that should be everyone's objective so call now for the free

[noise]\nWelcome back to a special radio presentation how to make money on the markets fall [noise] my name is\nJohn from the John on Jeff show and today my special guest as Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor at online trading academy Larry let's get right into it\nTell us why online trading academies patented core trading strategy is so important and so unique because many people right now they don't really have an education and how to invest in the market so let's talk about why oh TAs curriculum is so important well\nIt's like playing any game without any rules the one thing that we noticed was a lot of students that come in I don't really understand the market they've never even looked at a price chart in fact I've actually traveled to some of the top business schools and universities and don't even look at charts and they're teaching investment classes\n... its mind blowing because one of the things I think our students really take away is\nThis looks really hard and how can people learn how to do this when they come through our classes and they start looking at charts and they start to realize\nAnybody could do this the most amazing aha moment I've got and has been when they actually go back to the year two thousand and eight they can actually see the moment they should have gotten out of the markets\nAnd right they're they're like oh my God I've learned something that I now can use over and over again even if I think it's setting up that way I can protect myself\nAnd that's the key is understanding what these charts or sane\nBut a lot of people get intimidated when they look at a sharp but again I referenced the GPS in your car the GPS is keeping track of what direction your vehicle is moving in educated investors used price charts to decide at what price they want to buy and sell\nAnd the reason why the roller coaster action\nIn the stock market is seen on a price chart it's because the big banks are constantly buying and selling\nThat's why it is so important for you to buy when the big banks by and for you to sell when the big bang cell and price charts is a way that the average investor can look at their portfolio and make an educated decision one to bind self\nYeah you know people think it's really hard there's a lot of math involved well somebody once told me you don't have to be smart to trade I Love that show [laughter] but but the reality here it's it's really not that hard it's like anything else in life there are people who started their jobs and the first day and they learned how to create careers\nSame thing when it comes to trading once you understand the rules of the game it's easy\nIn fact you know it's everyone thought it was going to take this long time to pat and dark horse strategy\nAnd thought it was ... years in reality it only took ... months the reason is that we're actually teaching things for our students that most people don't know we've had market makers from Wall street come to our classes I mean there's a way to really look at understand\nPrice action on a chart most importantly where to sell and where to buy and once you're able to do that it's almost like that old adage you have a man a fish sheets for a day teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime we're teaching our students\nHow to fish and it's in a way that's very very easy very methodical very rural base and a lot of our students come out of our classes just amazed why they couldn't have done this earlier and are now taking their kids to class which I Love I think it's great get educated when you're younger and imagine what you can accomplish in your later life\nAnd these price charts once again they're available on your smartphone\nYour laptop your tablet and that's the power of technology helping\nEducated investors profit in the market\nNow many years ago these price charts were not readily available but thanks that technology and the Internet now everyone is on the same level playing field\nIt's yours if you want it it's yours if you want to get educated so instead of losing money or instead of listening to your financial advisor to stay in the market as the market's going down you could be proactive and begin to profit as it is going down\nNow that is a game changer for many people listening to the show\nRight now I'm managing if you could have profited in two thousand and one of the market crash\nImagine if you could have profit in what the market crashed in two thousand and eight instead\nMany of us\nLost a lot of money because you didn't know how to do it\nYour financial advisor is not going to teach you how to do this because if they did you would fire them\nBecause you wouldn't need them anymore so that's the reason why the average investor is left in the dark because the more educated you get the less help you're going to need which means your financial adviser is not going to make as much money so right now I'm giving away too free passes\nTo the next half day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as how the financial markets really work and also the video\nHad her attire with more money than you need something that should be everyone's objective so call now for the free tickets the half\nDay investing class plus she'll get the free Wall
