[noise]\nI so if you got to buy a hundred shares that will cost about twelve grand and so what's important to understand is that as the market started to fall or we started losing the technology sector because this stock sits in the technology sector is an opportunity to make money when it fell\nAnd so short short selling would have been a really good opportunity for if you understood what to do and so clack Kaylee sea in early September trading at a hundred and twenty bucks this year and now here's the thing that a lot of people get confused on\nHow can I make money selling something if they don't already own it in other words how can I sell ... if I don't if you buy at the store with\nWell that's the beautiful thing about the financial markets that are broken will allow us to sell shares of their inventory into the market before price falls with the goal of us than buying it back and giving it back to the broker after price falls so let me give an example on ...\nLet's just say um September eighth of tens of right around that time you decided to use the clock was going to fall in price and you went to the markets and you said I Want to sell a hundred she has a clock\nNow it's a hundred and twenty bucks or share so your broker would basically say okay we have inventory that you can sell and we'll let you utilize our shares of clock to sell into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share so what we're doing is we're going into our trading platform or executing a short sale\nAnd what that does that sells a hundred shares of crack into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share on our behalf\nNot understand we don't own the stock broker owns stock they're allowing us to utilize their shares to sell into the market at the market price which was a hundred and twenty so we do that now with considered short the stock now here's what happens\nWe believe prices gonna fall well here seven weeks later clocks at Ninety and it's it's actually happened so we're using a real world example it clock at Ninety you decided at night and you're going to buy it back so when you go into the market and buy it back because you Ninety bucks this year to buy it back when you sold that you took it a hundred and twenty\nWhen you bought it back because you're Ninety\nNow the moment you bought it back to share that came out he broke his mentor originally now when you buy back immediately go back and you're broke his inventory in other words they're made whole with their shares of clock they got their stock back\nNow what did you do well you sold at a hundred and twenty and seven weeks later you bought it at Ninety think about that you bought low in Seoul high you just did it in reverse order that's the beautiful thing about the markets we can do that\nIt's a real strategy skull shorting short selling and that's why we're talking about we bend the drum every week you need to understand how to make money regardless of direction and because of that you just made thirty bucks a share on stock that fell that you've never owned think about that\nSo in a hundred shares you made three grand on a thousand Jews you made thirty grand\nThink about

Wall Street teaches the masses and we're here to break that down show you the real Wall Street show you how institutions approached the markets and more importantly how you can profit regardless of what's happening exactly\nAnd you know a champ one of the big things right now is a lot of people are concerned you know this is reminding me of the market in two thousand seven I met a bunch of

handles all that by the cuts slices places and then we'd ... rate is good but now you'll see the real reality when you go to the faces exactly\nDon't forget to check that out she had one of the things that you know it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWorking out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... raise the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really to self directed self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough demand your own money 'cause Wall Street hasn't convinced of that and they they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money into management you gonna pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nAnd the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA crafted their those trust you have your phone K they they wrote the charter they wrote the prospect is\nAnd you pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not the only guaranteed return for one case the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the Lord's you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money chip it's not free money because now you're gonna have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you've got to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money one direction\nThink about that you bought that you ... you were all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're going to hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self right when you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key it's long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them one day when do you want to retire and their answers now said well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's just there's working\nWell the average American is way short financially of ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem is and the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s manage diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students at all like you to get him that's been six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that if you can make one percent among one of them are goes up down decided we can do that consistently over time\nYou put that a compound and calculator it gets powerful and the problem is is that many people can't make one percent of ... the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price of the market and these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing a learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people we're seeing this Adam\nAre coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die the Math Doesn't work and I need to change the formula and you know what that former means no change in that formula means\nSelf directing taking control that bucket and making the decision to self 'cause who cares more about your money than you you should be in control of it you should be making those decisions and ultimately", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Who Should Your Money Work For", "city": "Tampa", "day": "26"}
