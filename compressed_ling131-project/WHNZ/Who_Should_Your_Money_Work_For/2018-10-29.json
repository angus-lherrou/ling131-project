[laughter] what is the end of the family oriented and earlier in the end of ... which became the one eight hundred I don't know but the ... different venues or but I I thought good marketing right so you know an Anthony\nI'll say this I have a a lot of friends that you know and I I wasn't exactly sure about what six men does and now now I totally get it because I have friends that that this is\nA yearly trip for them to go with their band or on a cruise I won't mention the band in case it's not what six men but but the ... that is what they do that as their plan that is their vacation so obviously ... you've got those guys hook but what are you currently dealing with so many channels to reach\nA prospect that that aren't aware of these these\nEvents yeah\nIt's a good question I mean if if we can get you on once we've been so fortunate to to pour a lot of intention into the on board experience we've had about fifty five percent guest retention so you know there's a\nNice aren't rising it at all I mean even a fan of the band you get a chance to hang with the band or on the cruise ship certain drink with a band that sounds really good the day was definitely has a requirement of ending any of these [laughter]\nUh yeah I mean it's just it really is it's you know I I go on a bunch of member a year and I watch it from through a different lens because you know they're serving the gas not being a guess but it really is a blast and it's it's it's something that they\nCan't get on land rights or to go back to that I'm only arena experienced used by a hundred dollar ticket a you could buy that ticket that same day you're you know and that conversation you're just fighting for the consumers where they got to do that night and then you know fifty to a hundred dollars is different than two thousand four thousand dollar so\nThat peace is is it's really different but if we can get you on we've got about a fifty five percent chance that you'll come back\nIf we really blow you away we're hoping that you then\nBring friends and family that word of mouth is huge to grow our business so retention and word of mouth or where the majority of our guests come from um [noise] in regards to marketing and we look at owned earned and pay channels the one that has the most impact is when the artists themselves\nUm centered via their channels because if you're a fan of cash a or Melissa Etheridge kiss your kid rock\nThe guest that we're serving as more than likely on their Facebook page on their email fan club goes to their website as seen them live so when an email comes out from cash is saying hey\nWhy aren't other Wednesday's always honors or social media hey I'm going on a cruise you guys want to come with me that's that's obviously going to mean a lot more than if you were just blindly sending out an email you know an invite from the artists themselves yeah it's the\nMost compelling message is very personal you know you're talking to catch the fans in that conversation I'm so that is something that we work closely with the artist management teams to to ensure that there's a campaign that's directly through the artist channel then we try and look at what other artist or on the bill so you know\nUsing a maybe kiss as an example or or kid rock or whatever there's but there's another\nSupporting lineup of\nTen to twelve to Fifteen bands so also have those artists push out because they have fans that want to say all of them right so a lot of that going on 'em\nAnd then we're using digital and social marketing team here that is on Facebook I'm doing organic Poston and search results just to try and ensure somebody's searching for you know catch the tickets\nOr catch them or she might pick them up that way yeah which is again you're leaning and our our best prospects as somebody whose party raised their hands and said I have some interest in three eleven or a train or kiss or kid rock [noise] it's\nVery difficult to convert somebody as a casual fan into a four day vacation at this year\nAt the last three eleven I'll say that's my friends they may have gone like twelve years in a row they so they can happen they appreciate you jumping on a call\nNow and I think you guys often much congratulations on which I\nThink's Mets they take it All right so listen up team we found out a little bit more I mean a DJ or you're gonna be the first one to try to hit them up for um for some free tickets on one of the next uh cruises or is that going to\nBe absolutely I'm Glad to have the bio in front of me you didn't even need to see how the chance to answer for crying out loud thing on a DJ did you say than by any ... always about me anyway I Would be pretty happy with Chris ... who would you want to see who would you want to who who many many that he mentioned there who did you like he is Mac ... absolutely love cash than\nWell listen you you know when you go on vacation obviously it's important to have a good time but when you get home\nThe last thing you want is to have your car broken down or a flat tire or anything else like that and my my correct here's this how's my transition their DJ Hamilton it's very good very smooth so listen or coming up with this next year and it should be on the line uh we've got a fax around with Dell tires of Iraq are you there\nYes I Am I doing we're doing good man next for joining us on the podcast\nUm this is normally where I tell everybody about the brand but DJ has been given me a hard time today I think he prefers really hear my voice or less so a ... a little bit about Palin and how you ended up over there\nSure are built tier is a a leading a supplier of tires and out of services were headquartered in Detroit a service or Michigan Indiana Ohio and then expanding rather rapidly we are\nA when you take a look at the total revenue per unit were actually the third largest provider of tires and services and the United states\nI had been working with Dell tier for about three years as a business communications consultant and they asked me to join as their first him at the company\n... and so how uh how did you decide that that was in fact kind of what you wanted to do and uh uh is is it basically just you were like hey you look at being first there's nowhere to go but up\n[laughter] they're a little bit about that here but uh you know in in all in all reality the interesting part about his most people in marketing are being hired to solve problems and they have to fix things and what's interesting at bell tier as I inherited an opportunity\nFor nothing is broken I inherited an opportunity where there's a lot of potential growth a lot of potential things we can do\nUh to maximize and grow the business so it was it was a great opportunity for me in terms of being able to deploy what I've been learning in working on for the last twenty plus years\nI'm In a category that's probably not as up to date as many other categories are but it's feeling a lot of pressure from technology and the bargain marketplace like a lot of other categories so the great news of the fundamental Isabel tire now they've been found for nine years\nAnd I wasn't being brought in to be the unicorn that could solve all the things with magic you know a marketing fairy dust it was literally to come in and say we got something good going how can we make it better\n... in what is the wings that you see place on mobile advertising\nBut one of the time that it's critical it's it's not just mobile advertising its mobile engagement even it's literally in our category and specific like everybody else you know the first thing that a consumer reaches for is that mobile device\nAnd there are broken down on the side of the road to if you've got a flat tire that's the first thing you're doing right in first grade [laughter]\nExactly and and let's face it here's the other part that's interesting about our category nobody ever wants to buy tires gets their car fifth is called a grudge purchases if I asked you guys today\nCongratulations you get to spend a thousand dollars I can imagine you think of a thousand things other than tires or other than fixing your car you'd rather be doing with that money and so mobile played it even more important role we actually like to think of ourselves as\nYou've had a crummy moment you're having something that's interrupting your day and we have the opportunity to make life a little bit better for you how do we leverage then how do we do that and that all starts with reaching you through your mobile device so\nMobile obviously very important but do you see other marketing channels or that that are in your plans of this year ... or was that you wish you knew more about\nYou know the the critical one that I think is most important that people don't even think of as a child as a channel but it really is it's about a consumer data\nAnd yeah and people misunderstand consumer data particularly marketers and what they need to do with it\nIt's really about understanding everything you possibly can about your customers so you can identify the right product\nThe right opportunity how to engage them and give them the right\nA bit of information and sometimes that transactional and sometimes that's not transactional but building that relationship particularly at our category where it's at garage purchase and the life cycle between a needs as can be quite large times of the dollar amount required can be substantial\nSylvie that tell us a little bit uh as as we put her rap on this tell us a little bit about um what is the footprint look like for you guys with bell is it I'm a is a growing is it that you've got kind of the expansion that you need to and how does that how does that play into kind of your marketing plans as as you yourself look into twenty Nineteen for the brand\nYou you know we're in a fortunate position whereas most retail is shrinking and or consolidating were actually growing um we're we're opening new markets all the time we are going to be opening twenty two new stores in Indianapolis in the next Eighteen months\nAnd then after that there are other markets there were already for and about to be entering the uh the the exciting part of the challenges while we might be known in Michigan for over nine years they don't know us here in Indianapolis or indeed\nBut but it is a we've got the most recognized and trusted brand in in the business so we obviously leverage that but the importance or is that we talked to and spend a lot of time with is the actual contractor the person that actually puts the roof on the house and making sure that\nOwns ... provides to them a great value proposition permit training perspective how to be a better business person out of selling the home had to close more jobs that's where we spend a lot of our time\nRight now being in the home improvement industry you guys definitely do you have quite a few competitors when when you say is the one thing that really makes ... see now in the home improvement industry\nIt's it's definitely the brand and the recognition of the brand um people way before me it owns Corning invested in natural Brandon did TB advertising when we were big bank and big pink insulation and we also have this um [noise]\nI guess he's a spokesperson the pink panther you might know him um he still does registration and and then we did we did a deal with uh MGM Studios about twenty five plus years ago\nWhere the Panthers become the face of our companies are the combination of the brand the pink panther having a recognizable\nSpokes cap uh is is something that had a front in the marketplace in fact our contractors to contractors are in the corner contract network love using the pink panther on their trucks they use it on their marketing materials that give away a little dolls when they go into the house I mean that they use it as a way to break the ice with a homeowner\nYou certainly do have a brand and listen we appreciate the time I told you we keep this or a nice and short and sweet my friend Bryan who's your hockey game oh my God sports really\nI I

organizations\nThat represent the best of the Tampa Bay area I'm your host Ryan Gorman in this episode we're joined by stop soldier suicide with us in Studio yeah Rachel land an advocate for a stop soldiers suicide and on the phone we have the total the chief program officer how we're both of you\nKnow getting ... they use them I\nKeep our you great I'm doing great as well Ryan thank you\nThanks so much for being here this is an important topic Rachel you were here last year we talked about uh the organization and the race that you have coming out before we get to the event itself which will spend some time on a let me start with stuff\nOf soldiers suicide and the great work the disorganization does recently just a couple of weeks ago we had on a the American foundation for suicide prevention so the topic we've covered quite a bit lately because it's been in the news so much lately unfortunately\nUm let me start with the basic overview it's pretty much self explanatory based on the title but a little bit more about what stumped soldiers suicide is all about showing 'em\nWell first I stopped soldiers suicide is uh the first a veteran founded in lead nationally um organization ... aims to preventing military related suicides I'm Keith do you want to take this one\nYeah keep it tell us a little bit about how it got started and how you got to where you are today\nSure um well it was started by um a three military ah folks who are friends and they saw you know after they um a mustard out or from\nActive duty and back to the states they saw you know an alarming and unacceptable\nA number of their their friends and colleagues that you know we're in the military and losing their lives the suicide and decided that it was something that they felt passionate enough about\nUh to form this organization and work on that problem and try to our mission is to see a day when our military uh brothers and sisters are no greater risk for suicide than the average civilian\nYeah because veterans are at greater risk correct in an active duty members as well\nYeah absolutely so you know our veterans are significantly higher or you know risk than uh you know the average American you know at least fifty percent higher and\nAnd maybe even a more than that depending on um you know what steps you look at so it's a you know it's ... suicides public health hazard epidemic\nAnd the United states and when you look at the rates of a military suicide if it's just something that um you know really needs to be addressed and it needs to be addressed the you know at a national level\nKey pounded you wind up getting involved with the organization personally [noise] well\nI actually came out from Wyoming I had been doing doing suicide prevention for roughly Fifteen Years\nAnd led the state of Wyoming suicide prevention efforts are at department of health before I transitioned to a nonprofit that was doing all the prevention and the state of Wyoming and when we lost our our funding earlier this year was looking to see you know what made sense for me [noise]\nUh and got hooked up with a a Nick and Brian who are two of the founders and was absolutely committed and sold on this program and moved out to North Carolina and I'm loving every minute of it so\nYou know you've been dealing with this issue for quite a while like you just mentioned or is it worse now than when you first started Fifteen Years ago\n[noise] well I mean I I think what we've seen is a steady increase of of rates across the country so for ... you know it's gotten incrementally worse from year to year despite um the efforts and the funding that have been a you know put toward the effort\nSo um you know there's there's a piece of it which is you know a kind of a national level I issue but then when you look at at the growing number of a veteran suicides in and military suicides um you know that's even more disturbing and problematic I think\nAnd let me ask you how the organization is set up obviously we're doing doing a run here which we're going to get you in just a bit um to benefit the organization but how how does the organization work is just a national organization with local chapters tell us a little bit about the structure\nSure so there's a couple of components\nOf the work that we do what stopped soldiers suicide of one of them in the piece that's been in place um you know for a since the founding of the organization eight years ago is a what we call a resource center which essentially you know takes\nAny veteran any active military or family member who has a a need 'em and we hooked him up with an individualized case plan\nOur case management plan and provide them with you know access to whatever resources they may need if they're a homeless veteran you know we try to work on that problem with them if it's a\nA veteran that that needs the connection because of a mental health condition or substance abuse problem we work with them to try to find a provider that um that is in their area that would be\nA suitable a good match for them so it doesn't matter what the problem is uh we work on it and we do it in a way that\nIt leads to our knowledge no other organization does which is to provide those folks with individualized one on one a case manager management for up to two years and with with numerous follow up to call backs to make sure they're doing okay during that period of time\nAnd how critical is that both the personalized care and the follow ups\nWell we think it's absolutely critical I'm\nOne of the [noise] one of the things we see is that veterans in an active military are coming to us from other providers or systems where they're not getting any personalized attention or there's you know huge waiting in line um that doesn't exist with us we get back to folks\nRight away and uh and begin to provide them with the resources they need you know tailored to whatever their needs are I'm immediately and so in that way I think we are different and it's also important\nBecause you know as we get veterans who are at greater risk than even the average veteran because of whatever circumstance they may be in that follow up\nThat connection you know really kind of provides them with the safety net over that period of time to make sure that somebody is watching out for them somebody cares somebody is there if they need them and you know that kind of personal involvement in personal touch is we think really critical to empower invest\nAnd improving um whatever their circumstances maybe over the long run\nThis is best of the bay with us we have ... soldiers suicide in Studio racial land and an advocate for the organization and on the phone with us the total achieved program officer\nThese stop soldiers suicide veterans' day five ... honoring a surgeon Erik land and is coming up uh it's going to be on November eleventh and um\nThe website if you wanna find out more about the run itself
