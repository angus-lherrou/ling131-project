we'd ... rate has got to get ... you'll see the real reality when you go to the ... exactly\nDon't forget to check that out she had one of the things that you know it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWorking out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really the self directed self manage well the\nProblem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough to manage your own money 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that and they they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money into management you gonna pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nIn the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA craft there those trust you have your phone K they they wrote the charter they wrote that prospect is\nAnd you pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not\nThe only guaranteed return for one case the fees that you pay and here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the Lord's you\nWith the match the company match so when you signed up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money champ it's not free money because now you're gonna have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you're going to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money in one direction\nThink about that you bought that you you you went all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're gonna hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self directly you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key it's long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask him Wendy when do you want to retire and their answers now said well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing they're just there's working\nWell the average American is way short financially I've ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem is the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s managed diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students at all like ... to get him that spent six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that if you can make one percent among one of them are goes up down and said we can do that consistently over time you put that a compound in calculator it gets powerful\nAnd the problem is is that many people can't make one percent among because the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price of the market and these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing a learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people we're seeing this Adam\nAre coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die the Math Doesn't work and I need to change the formula and you know that former means no change in that formula means\nSelf directing taking control that bucket and making the decisions yourself 'cause who cares more about your money then you you should be in control of it you should be making those decisions ultimately you could hit those long term goals if you get the consistency and that kind of ... monthly return that\nWe're focused on and that's key the long term goal that long term goals are gonna separate you from the
