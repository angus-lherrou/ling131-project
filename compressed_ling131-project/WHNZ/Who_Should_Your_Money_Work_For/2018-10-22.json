that conversation ... and you know we're probably a probably a follower fast follower as an industry\nAre probably not set in the world on fire from leading things but we're certainly I I think we're [noise]\nWe're certainly adapting and adjusting and more of our mix from a marketing spin becomes digital every every year\nAnd so you used or to boot right do they have senators have you on ... on the\nList to understand who your customer is in some ways because again you brought the fact that you know you go and you hire a builder\nUm and that bill there may use whatever the manufacturers that they work with so um how is it for you guys 'cause I feel like it's been a consumer facing brand in many ways but you bring up a good point that it may also be you know very much a business to business and so how do you how do you navigate those two completely different targets in in some ways\nI mean we we refer to it as a beat to beat a C company so I mean there was a consumer aspect which is the homeowner I mean they they ultimately write the check to put a roof on [noise]\nUm for for us but I mean the influence your is clearly the contractor a lot of the times they make the choice of the actual product that goes on there and sometimes it can be the the choice for my okay my roof leaking I just want a new one view looked like a\nPerson that's going to do this show up on time and do all the things you're supposed to do and so I'll just choose you um and and that's the ultimately that the choice that are but I don't want to make so it's it it traditionally has been a low involvement type category until it's high involvement which is a marketer [noise]\nUm the conversations I have internally here or can we create demand it I I think in our business we can't necessarily well if I had enough money I'm sure I'm sure that someone could marketer but\nUm but I don't think that's the right or why that we'd be rebuilding so what we look for is one of the instances that actually\nWhen consumers are in the market they either gotta weaken the roof there's a storm their house is older I how do we actually market to them and then how do we tell them that you mentioned the the brand we've invested in the brand we're probably the only Brandon roofing that people can recognize them that you're not probably not saying much [laughter]\nBut but it is a we've got the most recognized and trusted brand in in the business so we obviously leverage that but the importance here is that we talked to and spend a lot of time with is the actual contractor the person that actually puts the roof on the house and making sure that owns corny provides to them a great value proposition prima training perspective how to be a better business person out of selling a home how to close more jobs\nWhere we spend a lot of our time right so being in the home improvement industry then definitely do have quite a few competitors when when you see the one thing that really makes ... see now in the home improvement industry\nIt's it's definitely the brand and a recognition of the brand um people way before me you know in Corning invested in the actual brand and did TV advertising when we were big bank and big pink insulation we also have this um [noise]\nI guess he's a spokesperson the pink panther you might know him he's still got a brand recognition and and then we did we did a deal with uh MGM Studios about twenty five plus years ago\nWhere the Panthers become the face of our company so the combination of the brand the pink panther having a recognizable\nSpokes cap uh is is something that makes us different in the marketplace in fact our contractors to contractors are in no one's going to contract to network love using the pink panther on their trucks they use it on their marketing materials that give away a little ... when they go into the house I mean did they use it as a way to break the ice with a homeowner\nYou certainly do

were in the automotive aside for quite some time do you mind spending just a minute kind of telling us about your your time working for\nSure and I was born and raised in metro Detroit\nAnd uh after graduating from Michigan State I started working at Chrysler that agency and a wonderful Seventeen your career they're suffering quite I wouldn't be BDO and then I had the chance to join Chrysler now FEMA uh when they ... came over and took ownership of a crisis or enough yet ...\nAnd I spent seven years there I was the marketing director for the for an so over the course of seven years there were five vehicles marketplace did a few Superbowl camping\nAnd had a great time a building a brand and dealer network and sixteen months ago I got the pleasure of being asked to come over and services the marketing officer at Quicken Loans and beautiful downtown district\nAnd it seems like you really are changing to some extent kind of a you know you've got a legacy branding quicken and so a lot of people probably just feel like\nI'm well that's that perhaps some of the previous marketing for it's been a little bit old fashioned you certainly kind of turn that on a on a tip from everything I've seen so talked with a tiny bit just about about how you plan to to kind of approach things and how you done so over the last sixteen months\nYeah so I mean the the brand the brand itself and Quicken Loans as a thirty two year old a ... year old Brandon we introduce rocket mortgages the online solution you know with our products three years ago when the super bowl and you know for the last few years we've been primarily focusing on the rocket mortgage\nOr rocket mortgage Fran and for us it's it's real simple that you know I think at the end of the day where uh you know we're not where it's been a tech company while doing mortgages and were disruptor in the marketplace\nSo I think it's really important from a creativity and messaging standpoint\nTo continuously do something that stands out in the marketplace in a sea of saying that I mean if you work in certain categories early fall into being very say\nUh you know I'm a big advocate of when we see ideas we liked to push it you want to be remembered for something you could spend all the money in the world but if your brand your message the creativity behind is forget them all I'm going to be ... is going to be tough to be a in a hold of a good share my for a client of\nDefinitely in case the ... and I must say that you're one of the more active CNN I seen on social media you know at least some great content went to the lab space\nTell you I appreciate that a lot of people you know I don't have a ton of time to do it so I don't think I'm sitting on my social media platforms you know I really enjoy\n'em you know I utilize Facebook and Instagram more to share my mom my Casey story I'm a father of two young kids and you know I have the trials and tribulations of any father trying to raise to get\n'em ... really I Love

legacy that's been built so I just want you to utilizing social media to share more about myself personally\nBut also in the right places you know what we're doing a you know at a professional level\nYou know that your dad your father of two and and and that part of your life seems to be really important to you I I'm the same DJ is the same actually as well father to him is not a father to that part is you cannot relate to but um you know having spent time in this industry it's tricky because it's it's never a nine to five\nJob it's it's never one of those things where you you know you punch a clock and then you could do to leave right away there's nothing wrong with a with people that kind of work in that field but I talked to was a little bit about how just as industry itself is kind of impact that\nThat father who what are some of the the good things about it and wonder maybe some of the things that I'm a ... that are a little more challenging about if you don't mind\nYou know I think at the at the beginning technology plays a huge role in it\nIt wasn't too long ago where you know you can get on a plane and that flight from Detroit ballet was about four or five hours of your ah you know the for about four or five hours a day now the question of how long until you're on line and we can keep a you know communications going or whatever it might be but you know I also look at the use of technology in that\nIt allows me you know and this is not a nine to five is not a nine to five or industry out of work for a nine to five organization companies are not\nA but yet I eat a light technology also to my advantage so if there is one of the opportunities I'm a big family and you know family first\nBy kind of ... says I use technology to my advantage that I'm able to make sure I can make the kids' soccer games that can attend those recital\n'em knowing that I'm not too far away from work and I can easily you know catch up on anything um I Am missing his organization or Quicken Loans and races that so you know and along the way to I Love the use of the technology um and to be able to keep up on everything that's going on in the marketplace you know

radio studios here in Tampa this is best\nOf debate highlighting the people and organizations that represent the best of the Tampa Bay area I'm your host Ryan doormen in this episode we're joined by children across borders one voice foundation and voices for children and with us in Studio we are a couple of gas\n... co founder of children across borders Marianne ... executive director of one voice foundation and\nRun a Kennedy executive director of voices for children the website you can go to to find out more about what we're talking about on the show is children across borders\nDot org thank you so much for coming in and you and you let me start with you ... tell us a about children across borders before we get into how all three organizations are are connected or tell us a how children across borders got started in in the work that you guys do\nShow 'em so up the way it got started was a ... some years ago my husband and I were considering me going back to walk and um [noise]\nI ah when did you do something more meaningful and some to give back and so we decided as a entity to start touring across borders which was I'm\nA dual idea of giving back to\nA local community or the country but I'm a in a way we live and the country if a bug in there and um and so uh that's why the name children across the borders because um\nThe idea was to help children that will disadvantaged under privileged um ... uh education health shots when bonus\nAnd a Tupac now like with like minded organizations like the one voice and voices for children I'm and I'm to bring in\nA funds to help these children grew and um and done so education we've got many many different uh put programs in education\nUm how do we do can sew and wellness um with um housing we have shelter programs and then when the programs or you know teen drinking water for example\nAh but basically so we started this program we started the organization really for me to uh go back to work\nUm letting them a meaningful way yeah and um and it has grown since we started in two thousand nine we go to international quote from the IRS\nAh into does know nine and it'll be ten years next year prefer um it has grown tremendously we had we started off with full organizations are now we have Fifteen ... while ah Fifteen programs to countries and over two million raised\nSo um so that's the gist of the organization so a mission really is um boats to support financial and non financial um uh programs within ... patients\nAre in these four areas education health and wellness or children focus I'm helping out community first nationally our country and then getting back to India where we're from\nOkay great so let me ask you this you started in two thousand nine or in two thousand Eighteen now um how is the need grown or lessen during that time for him\n[noise] ah you know that's a tough question um I think it's grew and if you ask me and of course India is very different from the United states has you know the need in India is probably ten next times more um but the accountability is all of a tough\nSo it's it's it's a tough it's a tough job but the in the United states um it depends educationally I think we've come full what's a long ways but we've also have a lot more you know to give 'em in our local community community\nThe amount of philosophy that does that gets done is so tremendous that it's always a need to give\n'em health as you know has grown tremendously when right issues from cancer to anything you can think of his that didn't exist you know\nAs an epidemic now didn't exist centuries ago is a big deal now of course it's grown I'm shelter again it just depends like foster homes like you know one voice or I'm studying right now has issues with kids in the street but\nParents in jail or you know so this so it depends on the issue really but I Would say it's grown\nHow do you kind of break that up a kind of clarify that for us in terms of the local community ah ... the country here in the United states and in India how do you break up a were your resources go and how your programs help people\nSo it's very simple actually um it was give back to your um your community to get back to your country get back to the world\nAnd so we're a global ... a global cooperation and to get back to your community is Tampa so we've got nine programs I'm actually eight in Tampa one in New York they cracked that the United states\nAnd then get back to you or to the world is India at this point it may grew to other countries but India at this point have you with six programs that they would the way it comes in is I actually it's only word of mouth\nNothing comes in from the cold um somebody knows somebody that says this person or this organization is doing tremendous\nTremendous job go check it out\nSo that's how I meet them area and you know on me to run out\nAnd we sit down and we talk and we took but you know what they can I say she does and what it needs help lights and because we do books announcement on financial it truly is that partnership so they tell me what you know what the need is we sit down with our budget based on how much fundraising we've done that you know how many\nPhones we've we've gone to do with the the couple of years and then we try and fit into a sudden program that makes sense everything truthfully saying it's all program funded\nAnd specifically so because we want to make it a accountable from start to finish your to your right I Want to make sure it's tangible so that the the funds up you know given to the children and so that ways you know the impacts made ... onto the child\nAnd we want to sustain this program so uh and the organization so if the program is doing why wouldn't the organization we sustain that and if the nation is doing well itself we sustain the organizations it's a it's an amazing partnership\nAnd how do you determine whether or not an organization or program used doing well is there a criteria but\nYes so we definitely have criteria and there was an accountability former report\nThat the organization has to fill in on a hill basis and that tells me based on that budget based on how many children are impacted how many children you know when the program um there's there's all of these ... allow for that to be accountable\nAnd if there was an issue which sometimes that can be there you know I made myself very well known that that there is an issue that the ... the money with the funds and not utilize it appropriately right then we talk about it a little bit and make sure that they knew that that is only for", "show_name": "Who Should Your Money Work For", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "22"}
