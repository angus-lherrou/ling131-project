possible you can make money when something goes down in value well you need to understand that the market allows all of us the opportunity\nTo place a trade or to invest in any direction the market goes in\nSo if you know the market's going down you could place in order to profit as it's going down now how many of you listening right now know how to do that and imagine if you knew how to do that in two thousand and you knew how to do that in two thousand and eight about how that would have changed your life\nI think about how that would have changed the value of your investments and your account\nAnd that's why it is so important to understand how to make money when the market goes down and that's why we're having a special half day investing class\nSo you can see what it's all about because so many people listening right now they're relying on a financial advisor and let's face it your financial advisor doesn't teach you anything\nThat's the problem so right now I'm giving away too free passes\nTo the next half day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as\nHow the financial markets really work and also the video had to retire with more money than you need something that should be everyone's objective so call now for the free tickets the half\nDay investing class plus she'll get the free Wall Street insiders get but you need to do it now why because there's a limited supply Tampa Bay area listeners call now a four four three nine zero eighty seven twenty three\nThat's a four four three nine zero trade T. R. A. D.\nH. four four three nine zero eighty seven twenty three or register now at free O T a class\nDot com my special guesses Larry Jacobson director of instructor development and top instructor at online training academy and Larry let's talk about why once again it is so important to understand\nHow to make money when the market falls because we know the market will go into a correction but many people listening right now I don't know what to do when it does begin to\nCrash look to me it's like a car analogy right now and you're talking about going short and being able to sell to me it's like going in reverse with the car\nMarket is going up market comes down and you want to have the ability to go in reverse imagine your car if you could never go backwards you had to drive around in a circle\nWell that's exactly what the industry wants you to do a lot of people don't realize that you have strategies out there that you could do within your Ira accounts that allow you to be able to take advantage when the markets go down you can short the markets\nThere are other type of strategies it's just important to educate yourselves and in fact John I'll give you an example which I thought was really funny a student of mine once asked she came to me all upset\nShe said you know I went to my broker and I told him that was going online training academy and the brokers said why would you do that\nYou know and and she said well I wouldn't want to trade options I Want to learn a trade futures ... myself and the broker looked at her and said you realize there no option options and there's no future and futures I would've looked at him and said does that mean go broke with a broker [laughter]\nAnd so many people do because they don't have\nThat education but I think Larry one of the biggest things when it comes to retirement accounts a lot of people think they cannot touch\nTheir the money or the investments that they have in their retirement account because they assume and think that if they sell it is a withdrawal but really you're just going to cash which is a position that everyone could go to in order to save their money or protect themselves when the market\nDoes go down absolutely I mean locking in profits and selling is natural especially at a time when you believe there's going to be a correction now of course we don't have a crystal ball\nBut we can kind of presumed that we haven't seen any type of major correction in the market in a while and as you might be thinking the election coming up might be preventing that are holding that back but at some point\nI don't want to be fooled again after two thousand after two thousand eight I Want to have a strategy\nThat allows me to protect my future and I know if you're somebody like myself I don't have another six years to wait if I'm older right now\nAnd everybody out there who's ready to retire imagine right now that you would lose another fifty percent of everything you believed you were going to live on only to find out that it's going to take another six to seven years to make that back who's got that kinda time John\nAnd that's a great point because folks you cannot afford to lose half of your savings or your retirement because as you get older you need to number one protect\nYour profits so when you come to our free half day investing class in my opinion you don't have to be an active trader\nBut I think this class could help all of you decide when to get out of the market because part of being a successful investor is avoiding catastrophic losses so right now I'm giving away too free passes to our next\nHalf day investing class plus you'll also get this powerful video it's called how to make money when the market falls now when you see this video it will help you better understand how you could profit when the market goes down so instead of losing money you could be making money now think about how that\nCould have changed your life in two thousand or back in two thousand and eight when the market crash\nThe point is you don't have to ride the market all the way down like you did in two thousand and two thousand a name so right now I'm giving away too free passes\nTo the next half day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as how the financial markets really work and also the video\nHad to retire with more money than you need something that should be everyone's objective so call now from the free tickets that half\nDay investing class plus she'll get the free Wall Street insiders get but you need to do it now why because there's a limited supply Tampa Bay area listeners call now a four four three nine zero eighty seven twenty three\nThat's eight four four three nine zero trade\nT.

H. and Z dot com\n[noise] we'll come back to a special radio presentation how to make money when the markets fall my name is\nJohn from the John on Jeff show and today my special guest as Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development and top instructor at online trading academy Larry let's get right into it\nTell us why online trading academies patented core trading strategy is so important and so unique because many people right now they don't really have an education and how to invest in the market so let's talk about why oh TAs curriculum is so important well\nIt's like playing any game without any rules the one thing that we noticed was a lot of students that come in\nI don't really understand the market they've never even looked at a price chart in fact I've actually traveled to some of the top business schools and universities and don't even look at charts and they're teaching investment classes ... its mind blowing because one of those things I think our students really take away is\nThis looks really hard and how can people learn how to do this when they come through our classes and they start looking at charts and they start to realize\nAnybody could do this the most amazing aha moment I've got and has been when they actually go back to the year two thousand and eight they can actually\nSee the moment they should have gotten out of the markets and right they're they're like oh my God I've learned something that I now can use over and over again even if I think it's setting up that way I can protect myself\nAnd that's the key is understanding what these charts you're saying\nBut a lot of people get intimidated when they look at a sharp but again I referenced the GPS in your car the GPS is keeping track of what direction your vehicle is moving in educated investors used price charge to decide at what price they want to buy and sell and the reason why the roller coaster action\nIn the stock market is seen on a price chart it's because the big banks are constantly buying and selling that's why it is so important for you to buy when the big bang\nIt's by and for you to sell when the big bang cell and price charts is a way that the average investor can look at their portfolio and make an educated decision when to bind self\nYeah you know people think it's really hard there's a lot of math involved well someone once told me don't have to be smart to trade I Love that show [laughter] but but the reality here it's it's really not that hard it's like anything else in life there are people who started their jobs and the first day and they learned how to create careers\nSame thing when it comes to trading once you understand the rules of the game it's easy\nIn fact you know if everyone thought it was going to take this long time to pat and dark horse strategy\nAnd thought I'm going to take years in reality it only took ... months the reason is that we're actually teaching things for our students that most people don't know we've had market makers from Wall street come to our classes I mean there's a way to really look and understand\nPrice action on a chart most importantly where to sell and where to buy and once you're able to do that it's almost like that old adage give Amanda Fish sheets for a day teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime we're teaching our students\nHow to fish and it's in a way that's very very easy very methodical very rural base and a lot of our students come out of our classes just amazed why they couldn't have done this earlier and are now taking their kids to class which I Love I think it's great get educated when you're younger and imagine what you can accomplish in your later life\nAnd these price charts once again there are available on your smartphone\nYour laptop your tablet and that's the power of technology helping\nEducated investors profit in the market now many years ago these price charts were not readily available but thanks to technology and the Internet now everyone is on the same level playing field\nIt's yours if you want it it's yours if you want to get educated so instead of losing money or instead of listening to your financial advisor to stay in the market as the market's going down you could be proactive and begin to profit as it is going down\nNow that is a game changer for many people listening to the show right now I'm managing if you could have profited in two thousand and one of the market crash\nImagine if you could have profited what the market crashed and two thousand and eight instead many of us lost a lot of money because you didn't know how to do it\nYour financial advisor is not going to teach you how to do this because if they did you would fire them\nBecause you wouldn't need them anymore so that's the reason why the average investor is left in the dark because the more educated you get the less help you're going to need which means your financial adviser is not going to make as much money so right now I'm giving away free passes\nTo the next half day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as how the financial markets really work and also the video\nHad her attire with more money than you need something that should be everyone subjective so call now for the free tickets that half\nDay investing
