special radio presentation how to make money when the market fall ... name is John from the John I'm Jeff show and today my special guest as Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor and online training academy flowery it seems like every week\nThere's a large financial bank that is being fined hundreds of millions of dollars for misleading investors and a lot of our listeners are getting their financial advice from these very banks\nThat are being fined hundreds of millions of dollars let's talk about what the average person needs to do right now because these banks are are getting away with\nThis you need to educate yourself John I mean\nIt it's not going to stop it just continues to seem seep out of the economy\nOr give me an example we saw a major SEC probe on bank of America wind up paying four hundred and Fifteen million dollars very recently we actually saw Deutsche Bank still getting probe of the mortgage backed securities and the sad part is\nThese fines are nothing I mean you talk about millions of dollars\nThey exchanged trillions of dollars in fact recently the whistle blower on the Deutsche Bank actually was awarded to believe it or not like eight million dollars and we represent a Fifteen Percent of the fine that Deutsche Bank had to pay so they're more than happy to pay these small little finds in exchange\nFor making lots of money the sad part is with the advent of technology and it continues to get more advanced you're getting robbed by people you don't even see anymore and we are all the time about people getting scams on the Internet or getting scanned by our banks and we don't even realize it\nA lot of people go into their local bank and the first thing that the uh the bank want you to do is sit down because they want to talk to you\nAbout investing your money with the bank and let's face it Lowry the advice that these individuals are giving their clients is not the best interest of the client they're there to to make a sale\nTo make a huge profit and often these big banks will tell the average investor to buy when in fact the big bank is selling against them let's talk about that\nThe NASDAQ is down almost a full ... percent down Seventy three points in the U.S and the U.S down fourteen point that's a half percent\nHas bro is making what's called meaningful organizational changes which

but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save huge money\nLife changing money if you switch to medical care for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month I think what you could do that with\nDiabetes high blood pressure high anxiety meds everyone's on them

the world around I don't feel like I look like anybody else or feel like anybody else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me in the very beginning\nThat you are part of a revolution can make\nFamily family's lot time\n[noise] welcome back to a special radio presentation how to make money on the markets fall [noise] my name is\nJohn from the John on Jeff show and today my special guest is Larry Jacobs then director of instructor development and top instructor at online trading academy Larry let's get right into it\nTell us why online trading academies patented core trading strategy is so important and so unique because many people right now they don't really have an education and how to invest in the markets so let's talk about why oh TAs curriculum is so important well\nIt's like playing any game without any rules the one thing that we noticed was a lot of students that come in\nI don't really understand the market they've never even looked at a price chart in fact I've actually traveled to some of the top business schools and universities and don't even look at charts and they're teaching investment classes ... its mind blowing because one of the things I think our students really take away is\nThis looks really hard and how can people learn how to do this when they come through our classes and they start looking at charts and they start to realize\nAnybody could do this the most amazing aha moment I've got and has been when they actually go back to the year two thousand and eight they can actually see the moment they should have gotten out of the markets\nAnd right they're they're like oh my God I've learned something that I now can use over and over again even if I think it's setting up that way I can protect myself\nAnd that's the key is understanding what these charts or sane\nBut a lot of people get intimidated when they look at a sharp but again I referenced the GPS in your car the GPS is keeping track of what direction your vehicle is moving in educated investors used price charts to decide at what price they want to buy and sell\nAnd the reason why the roller coaster action\nIn the stock market is seen on a price chart it's because the big banks are constantly buying and selling\nThat's why it is so important for you to buy when the big banks by and for you to sell when the big bang cell and price charts is a way that the average investor can look at their portfolio and make an educated decision one to bind self\nYeah you know people think it's really hard there's a lot of math involved well someone once told me don't have to be smart to trade I Love that show [laughter] but but the reality here it's it's really not that hard\nIt's like anything else in life there are people who started their jobs in the first day and they learned how to create careers same thing when it comes to trading once you understand the rules of the game it's easy\nIn fact you know if everyone thought it was going to take this long time to patent Darkhorse strategy\nAnd thought it was a take years in reality it only took ... months the reason is that we're actually teaching things for our students that most people don't know we've had market makers from Wall street come to our classes I mean there's a way to really look and understand\nPrice action on a chart most importantly where to sell in where to buy and once you're able to do that it's almost like that old adage you have a man a fish sheets for a day teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime we're teaching our students\nHow to fish and it's in a way that's very very easy very methodical very rule base and a lot of our students come out of our classes just amazed why they couldn't have done this earlier and are now taking their kids to class which I Love I think it's great get educated when you're younger and imagine what you can accomplish in your later life\nAnd these price charts once again they're available on your smartphone\nYour laptop your tablet and that's the power of technology helping\nEducated investors profit in the market\nNow many years ago these price charts were not readily available but thanks to technology and the Internet now everyone is on the same level playing field\nIt's yours if you want it it's yours if you want to get educated so instead of losing money or instead of listening to your financial advisor to stay in the market as the market's going down you could be proactive and begin to profit as it is going down\nNow that is a game changer for many people listening to the show right now\nA managing if you could have profited in two thousand when the market crash\nImagine if you could have profit in what the market crashed\nIn two thousand and eight instead many of us lost a lot of money because you didn't know how to do it\nYour financial advisor is not going to teach you how to do this because if they did you would fire them\nBecause you wouldn't need them anymore so that's the reason why the average investor is left in the dark because the more educated you get the less help you're going to need which means your financial adviser is not going to make as much money so right now I'm giving away too free passes\nTo the next half day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as how the financial markets really work and also the video\nHad her attire with more money than you need something that should be everyone's objective so call now for the free tickets that half\nDay
