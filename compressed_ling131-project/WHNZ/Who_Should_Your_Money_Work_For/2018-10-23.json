their financial advice from these very banks that are being fined hundreds of millions of dollars let's talk about what the average person needs to do right now because these banks are are getting away with this you need\nTo educate yourself John I mean it it's not going to stop it just continues to seem seep out of the economy\nOr give me an example we saw a major SEC probe on bank of America wind up paying four hundred and Fifteen million dollars very recently we actually saw Deutsche Bank still getting probe over the mortgage backed securities and the sad part is\nThese fines are nothing I mean you're talking about millions of dollars\nThey exchanged trillions of dollars in fact recently the whistle blower on the Deutsche Bank\nActually was awarded to believe it or not like eight million dollars that we represent a Fifteen Percent of the fine that Deutsche Bank had to pay so they're more than happy to pay these small little finds in exchange\nFor making lots of money the sad part is with the advent of technology and it continues to get more advance you're getting robbed by people you don't even see anymore and we are all the time about people getting scams on the Internet or getting scanned by our banks and we don't even realize it\nA lot of people go into their local bank and the first thing that the uh the bank wants you to do is sit down because they want to talk to you\nAbout investing your money with the bank and let's face it Larry the advice that these individuals are giving their clients is not the best interest of the client they're there to to make a

special guest as Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor at online trading academy Larry let's get right into it\nTell us why online trading academies patented core trading strategy is so important and so unique because many people right now they don't really have an education and how to invest in the markets so let's talk about why oh TAs curriculum is so important\nWell it's like playing any game without any rules the one thing that we noticed was a lot of students that come in do only understand the market they've never even looked at a price chart in fact I've actually traveled to some of the top business schools and universities\nAnd don't even look at charts and they're teaching investment classes ... its mind blowing because one of the things I think our students really take away is\nThis looks really hard and how can people learn how to do this\nWhen they come through our classes and they start looking at shorts and they start to realize\nAnybody could do this the most amazing aha moment I've got and has been when they actually go back to the year two thousand and eight they can actually see the moment they should have gotten out of the markets\nAnd right they're they're like oh my God I've learned something that I now can use over and over again even if I think it's setting up that way I can protect myself\nAnd that's the key is understanding what these charts or sane\nBut a lot of people get intimidated when they look at a sharp but again I referenced the GPS in your car the GPS is keeping track of what direction your vehicle is moving in educated investors used price charts to decide at what price they want to buy and sell\nAnd the reason why the roller coaster action in the stock market is seen on a price chart is because the big banks are constantly buying and selling that's\nWhy it is so important for you to buy when the big banks by and for you to sell when the big bang cell and price charts is a way that the average investor can look at their portfolio and make an educated decision when the mind self you\nKnow people think it's really hard there's a lot of math involved well someone once told me you don't have to be smart to trade I Love that show [laughter] but but the reality here it's it's really not that hard\nIt's like anything else in life there are people who started their jobs in the first day and they learned how to create careers same thing when it comes to trading once you understand the rules of the game it's easy\nIn fact you know if everyone thought it was gonna take this long time to pat and dark horse strategy\nAnd thought I'm going to take years in reality it only took ... months the reason is that we're actually teaching things for our students that most people don't know we've had market makers from Wall street come to our classes I mean there's a way to really look at understand\nPrice action on a chart most importantly where to sell and where to buy and once you're able to do that it's almost like that old adage you have a man a fish sheets for a day teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime we're teaching our students\nHow to fish and it's in a way that's very very easy very methodical very rural base\nAnd a lot of our students come out of our classes just amazed why they couldn't have done this earlier and are now taking their kids to class which I Love I think it's great get educated when you're younger and imagine what you can accomplish in your later life\nAnd these price charts once again they're available on your smartphone\nYour laptop your tablet and that's the power of technology helping educated investors profit in the market now many years ago these price charts were not readily available but thanks a technology and the Internet now everyone is on the same level playing field\nIt's yours if you want it it's yours if you want to get educated so instead of losing money or instead of listening to your financial advisor to stay in the market as the market's going down you could be proactive\nAnd begin to profit as it is going down now that is a game changer for many people listening to the show right now a\nManaging if you could have profited in two thousand and one of the market crash\nImagine if you could have profit in what the market crashed\nIn two thousand and eight instead many of us lost a lot of money because you didn't know how to do it\nYour financial advisor is not going to teach you how to do this because if they did you would fire them\nBecause you wouldn't need them anymore so that's the reason why the average investor is left in the dark\nBecause the more educated you get the less help you're going to need which means your financial advisor is not going to make as much money so right now I'm giving away too free passes to the next\nHalf day investing workshop and if you call right now all also throw in the wall street insider kid now this is loaded with videos such as\nHow the
