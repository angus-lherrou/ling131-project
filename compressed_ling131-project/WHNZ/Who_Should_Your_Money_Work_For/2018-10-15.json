thank you so much for joining us today\nThank you for having me hey chat actually just going to be for questions do you are you familiar with the term sea sweet\nI Am familiar with the harm C suite DJ constantly ribs me about the fact that the that\nThere's a word for executive professionals and it's called the seats we might say well is there to see in his title I mean it's ridiculous mockery so okay fine so\nThere isn't there is a sea in the ... he was the sweet very sweet answer\nAll right so first question out of the way a production well I'm going to ask you three more Chad uh there's no right or wrong answers or just keeping in mind that many of our listeners or come from both the client and agencies side so first question\nUm maybe actually just first tell us a few highlights about how you came to crunch\nSure I I've been with crunch now for um coming up on on two years this uh this fall and my experience it's all been on the the client side a and I was fortunate enough to kind of um [noise] learn\nThe craft of marketing at Proctor and gamble a working in Fiji in the in the beauty care category early on in my career and\nAh after about a decade opinion gee I moved into the travel and hospitality business a spending time as married international star would have tells resorts and then\nWorking in the theme park a business with Walt Disney parks and resorts and um [noise] you know I look at those two different groupings of business where you've got kind of classic marketing\nAnd then you've got a the service industry or among some of the best uh in their category\nUh and then putting those two things together a maid having to crunch really a natural fit for me and\nUh just prior to coming you're coming to crunch I was chief marketing officer asked a friend or violence with ... which is one of the largest they spot brands in the country and the bringing beauty wellness hospitality travel entertainment and it fits what's the crunch fitness brands are about which sounds a little crazy\nYeah you put it all together I'm going to go backwards for just a second which is your your time at the energy or did you have to live in Cincinnati is part of that\nOr early in my career I did live in Cincinnati but the majority of my time at Proctor I was in Baltimore, Maryland\nWere there um US headquarters for the color cosmetics business\nSo I grew up in Cincinnati I feel like details used to say there's nothing good came out of Cincinnati so now at least one of ... something good came out of their zero onto up\nKind of all of your past experience um and in some ways it it kind of just strangely enough seemed to kind of strategically aligned with the\nUh what's your position in some ways over a crunch so a brand that's been um you know well known out in the marketplace certainly for many years and it seems like really over the last a couple of years or they've had a bit of a resurgence and certainly some some new growth and I think some of that may come\nEven some some new owners of the brand I Am I right am I right with that and maybe if I if I'm if I'm not tell us a little bit more about\nUm either how crunches has a really kind of stepped into um the brand itself and maybe what are some of the challenges that ... that you faced and she came on board\nYeah no I I think you're anchoring sites are are pretty spot on you know crunch we're coming up on our thirtieth birthday next year we were founded Nineteen eighty nine in the East Village of New York city and\nYou know I Would say for about the first Twenty years we were a a relatively small premium price brand and you know four to five kind of major metro Marcus and\nAnd we were always known for our no judgments philosophy and really known as the brand that makes ...\nOn your all about fusing entertainment and fitness together\nBecause you know we we have an insight or about a category which is that one most people find gyms to be intimidating life and so we try to create this culture of no judgments to make sure that it's welcoming\nAnd inviting an inclusive for anyone regardless of their fitness level or lifestyle their age\nGender race ethnicity the other inside his that quite frankly working out thanks\nAnd it's hard to stay motivated and the founders of crunch really a understood that that consumer inside and they built a brand around the\nThe belief that if you can deliver an experience that's fun and entertaining you're going to you're not like it and people continue to do the things that they like and so we try to strip strip away the boredom which we try to strip strip away the\nThe the things that can make working out at a gym Dole out we know working out hard getting to the gym and being in that environment shouldn't be one of them we want the actual work out to be tough and challenging we don't want anything else to be challenged and so I think those are the real insights about our business and\nEverything you said there is absolutely true in in in what we're seeing in in people you know it it's it's it's about getting them to the gym my wife for instance a big fan of crunch she she she's a member of here and uh she she goes three days a week and loved it mud\n... if you have those people out there that they need the motivation to come and how do you market to them how do you find them Chad\nYes that that's a good question and you know one of the and and we're certainly not the only ones to do it in fact it's a pretty common uh it's pretty common practice in the industry you know we're we're an industry based on free trials and so certainly as we think about\nUh the marketing funnel if you will we you know we want to fill the top ... tough and the vet funnel\nWith as many qualified leads as possible and so you know we certainly take advantage of the data we have available to us we we know who are members are you know where they live a and so we're we're pretty smart about uh looking at\nOld school direct mail looking at carrier roots looking at were members are today a and going into those neighborhoods in those markets because businesses pretty hyper local uh in terms of uh I remember roles we we do lots of look like marketing on social media and other other additional channels\nAre and and oftentimes the terrorists that we put out there for a presidential prospects is the ability to come try us out for three five seven days\nAnd we believe that if we can get you to come in and maybe get into work out what to you're going to fall in love with the brand you're gonna fall in love with her you know are\nAren't entertaining experience or are fantastic for fitness instructors are are excellent personal trainers that you're going to want to join but it's not what we're gonna come back we're going to reach out you know over email I Will probably hit you up with some remarketing\nI'm going to try to get you to come back to the gym but we we do believe that um you know certainly our messaging is all\nIn our in our creative strategy is all around a fun you can get at a crunch and the diversity of what we have to offer we think that's part of being fun\nIs offering multiple options under one roof\nA which is certainly different than maybe with the category of fitness yeah um but again we think the proof is putting\nIn the community is really going to South Korea is a great as well we always love or a scene that stuff out there and a digital definitely plane apart and do you guys have got some great street teams out there to the time she had\nA jet You're welcome
