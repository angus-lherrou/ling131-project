the family members to try to provide that um you know their military spouse or son or or even father or mother depending I you know gets to help that they have\nRacial talk a little bit about the family aspect of all of this you know obviously as a spouse and then uh you know the family and how they're affected by both the the the PBS the issue and then obviously after\nA suicide takes place\nOf course I'm well of course without saying much is that there's a lot of grief yeah there's a lot of grief also before suicide whereas with the DSD it kind of makes the withdrawn it you're\nYou're in with yourself you know some things that you've done before that you absolutely love just an appealing anymore it's like a depression yeah so and I think people are more aware and more um\nOr they can recognize depression a little bit easier than PDF sea so even kind of related to that um so sometimes you kind of feel like you've lost that person before you even awesome\nYeah I was going to I was going to follow up and ask you about that in terms of the dynamic there or you know ... again that must be hard for you to relate to what they're going through just like anybody else who hasn't been through what a veteran has has been through so that's\nGot to be I'm sure you want to help and you want to understand but it could be difficult\nVery very and I think that's I stopped soldiers suicide is a great outlet because it's an organization that you know you can speak to another military wife that is going through the same thing you can connect you with these resources that they that worked for them or their husband or their ... or\n... one of their loved ones what works for them it's it's just like a community and\nYou're helping each other out which is really really special\nAnd and when did you really discover stop soldiers suicide how long was it after a or the suicide of a surgeon landed took place that you discovered this organization and the work that they were doing\nI discovered it probably about three or four months after okay yeah\nAnd and tell us a little bit about that initial interaction and how you started to get involved\nSo for my grieving a\nTechnique is always kind of to focus on other things\nAnd whether that may be right or wrong that's what I Do yeah so I Want it to poor my heart into helping other people that was going through the same struggle that I was going through and also help people that have children because I have a air can I have two beautiful daughters um\nWho are now seven and four so they were um\nThree and Fifteen months when he passed\nSo the questions and ah the confusion in or sadness I wanted to make sure that no other family would have to go through them well I went through on it and I still go on a daily basis at my daughter's so I was researching and I came across a sub soldier suicides website\nAnd I contacted them and I said how can I get involved\nAnd I saw that they were doing a program called run for life\nAnd I ended up participating in different ah five caves and then just heading out cards um two people that say hey you know what not soldier suicides during this let's collect donations and so I ended up getting like a team together and we would run racist together and it got to a point where we kind of stopped and we said\nWhy don't we do our own race is crazy why are we paying him ... why are we paying people to go do this thing that we should be doing rice so on I'm\nA ... and two thousand and sixteen that's when I I really started focusing on doing this sergeant Eric land and five K. and I wanted to do it in a place where he really loved and we always loved to go\nOut in downtown ... and ... and have drinks and eat and that was a big\nFamily area for us as well as when we're just dating sure so we um I decided to have to race into need and and\nUh that's when it kind of started from there\nSo when was the first a race honoring sergeant land\nIt was actually on his one year anniversary on July thirtieth of two thousand six teams\nWell can I just say first of all thank you so much for sharing all the personal details of what you went through I'm sure it's not easy but that that's incredible just not even a year later you're putting together a race honoring him I mean that really\nUh that's that's really commendable thank you I'm so let's talk about the race this year and what you plan and kind of you know tell us how it's grown over the past couple of years\nAnd it's ... it has grown and it's becoming it's becoming really something I like to have it focused not so much just on the race but also as a family get together we\nHave a bounce house for the kids we have faced thinning we have a balloon animals it's a great event where it's kind of like a festival afterwards we're celebrating his life were celebrating the great man that Eric was and we're doing it in a place that he loves and with uh people that love him\nAnd again it's going to be a November eleventh correct at eight thirty AM on veterans' day on Veterans Day and it's going to be at the uh the hail activity\nCenter Pinellas Trail yes and people could find out more at\nThe Holland G. R. P. dot com again this is best of debate I'm your host Ryan Gorman a in Studio with me Rachel Lyndon and on the phone we have ... cheap program officer for ... soldiers suicide\nAnd keep talk a little bit about the runs obviously this is the only one that you guys do this is the one that we do here in the Tampa Bay area but tell us a little bit about how these runs take place across the country and and just the community that you're building each time you knew one\nRight so you know first up you know from the bottom of all of our hearts we are profoundly grateful for um\nYou know folks like Rachel and and the work that they do and and you're right in noting\nThat you know the fact that that Rachel put this together within a year is is remarkable um you know these folks are part of our community they're part of our family um you know and and you know they they are the grassroots effort that\nYou know it's not only about you know raising money to support the work that we do or the work that's being done in communities\nIt's about getting the message out there and making sure that everybody knows not only that you know this is a terrible problem but there are ways to to deal with it\nAnd there are ways to to solve the problem but it takes a you know it takes a community so\nUm you know these races and and other events that go on all over the country are really essential in building that community and then you know really moving forward to a day where you know hopefully we won't see this is such a critical public health problem\nAnd Rachel at the the run itself um the people who attend\nYou notice that there are more veterans and their families coming out or does that consist of uh individuals who have lost somebody in their family to suicide or like yourself I talk a little bit about who comes out to these events and and and again the growth that you've seen and what you're hoping for this year\nUm get ... I Would I Would say it's it doesn't even make a\nPopulation of people so you have a lot of people that have um served they come out and just to support us that we have people that are just locals and demeaning and the Tampa Bay area\nThat they hated the great cause I left the military I Love my freedom I Love that I'm safe I Need to come out and support them\nAnd we I also which is very nice and an end surprising that sometimes I'll get um a handful of people that will come up and get themselves and say hey I served\nWith your husband oh wow and that that's when it gets really heartfelt for sure and and how many people\nThat you guys have last year we had you on last year before the run we have an idea of of of what the total was we\nHad um close to three hundred plus the ... we were trying to aim for a little higher every year you want me out I'll hire cars right and then it's not just\nThe race itself I'm you guys have a a post race kind of gathering yet and and I'm sure some of the stories ... ... and some of the moments that take place during the gathering after the race was over pretty incredible it is I have [noise]\n\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by June video conferencing\nAbout from the table I shook his hand and I said Sarah the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in then I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate to kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said I can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids to feed\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys I told stories\nIn interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one of the story is going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician a heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nThat listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time they have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all crowded up and we have to help them out of bad predicament I mean for crying out loud [laughter] that's what we do\nWe make furnaces heat pumps and air conditioners last longer we lower energy bills we give you cleaner fresher error we increase Airflow we make systems run quieter and cost you less money to own\nNot we're not going to try to sell you something you don't need okay\nNow look in about two to three minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines just be one of the first five people\nTo text a message to the number three six to six zero okay you've got to do is put in the message HVAC one and I'm going to do your entire system both heating and cooling not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F.
