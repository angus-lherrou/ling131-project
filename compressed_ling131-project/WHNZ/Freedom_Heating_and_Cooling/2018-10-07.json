{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Kind of explain a how all of that works within your organization yeah of course so we don't like you're you're you're working with the local families I mean you're certainly in contact with them absolutely but the main focus is on on the trials\nYeah so we focus specifically on clinical trials and within that we are only find what we term patient affecting which means they're either out at trial now or they can be within six to twelve months\nUm we when we started the organization we had been a benefited from a lot of the groups who do kind of the make a wish style um you know will will introduce you to a hockey player without any that Disney World these kinds of things I'm ... and we felt like that area was pretty well taken care of\nThat here in the Tampa Bay or and yeah all of them we've had on the do great work\nThey do great work and I think our thought was that's covered and none of those added an hour to my son's life\nUh and that's really the the guiding thought that we have is how can we make a difference so that no family has to fill this hole that that Robin and I have now in so many other families that we have this this this um intimacy with tragedy that we carry\nAnd so we really focused on those clinical trials and I think a big difference between us and a lot of the other groups that that uh do clinical trials as we found researchers who we knew could make a difference very quickly for families who are going through treatment right now\nUm and we know those people we we we share dinner with those people we have phone calls and emails often with our researchers\nAre to make sure that this is making a difference now you know we don't fund this pie in the sky Twenty years from now this may or may not have an effect on what we're doing is and what we're funding is having real effect on kids who are fighting cancer right now\nAnd that's always been a drive in principle for for how we operate beat and be a and we've we've seen some really incredible results just one paper that was published earlier this um this month\nOr just last week actually showed a kid's on one of the trials that were funding a at two years a Ninety seven percent survival rate 'em so some of those kids may have relapsed I'm ... and that means that\nUh but they were still alive you know so we can continue to treat and find a better options and that's compared to a close to eighty percent with the last um best option that we had which is just a couple of years ago was published so this is a huge jump\nBefore you started beating be and you guys came together and he started funding all\nThese clinical trials what was the the clinical trial landscape for neural Blackstone or was there one or ... was it a pretty uh boy did a area of research\nWhen my son relapsed which was in August of two thousand ten um they essentially told us pick a trial and they knew of two um one was not even something that they would treat they were just trying to figure out the correct dose for a drug\nUh and then the other one was a clinical trial that you know maybe had some hope\nI'm there really wasn't much in the way of options out there um and kids who relapse had a single digit survival rate so it was it was essentially a death sentence and that is what happened to my son as a\nUm today now eight years later I'm you know there's a there's a significant jump up for the kids who are on our clinical trials and even within relapse where it used to be that single digit cure rate um survival rate we're now seeing thirty to forty percent survival\nIt is for kids that are on the trials were funding which is you know you say forty percent to a ... a versus two um that's that's a lot of hope and and that is the kind of thing that we're doing so there's a lot of work left to to drive that to standard of care to get things FDA approved to make sure that you don't have to know about an inch or a clinical trial to get this treatment\nIf it works we'd like you to just be able to walk into any hospital and they say oh no less DOMA yeah we know how to deal with that or you're going to be alright\nAnd clearly the researchers must be excited about this I mean it's given them a chance to do something I'm sure they want it to do and that's that is find a way to help families dealing with is a disease and it sounds like a ... based on the results that you're saying you've got some pretty good research is working for you\nAbsolutely yeah our our ah our lead researcher Dr shoulder doctor just showed her out of Grand Rapids Michigan I always say she's a medical rock star or she really knows what she's doing and now there's you know thirty or forty different principal investigators at all these different institutions who are who are part of that as well but\nUm yeah it's it's a unique partnership in that um it's not just us writing a check a and handing that off once a year we are involved with our research team I'm frequently we count them friends are and and I think that combined effort of passionate parents applicators are advocates\nAnd really brilliant researchers has shown a a real difference in survival rates and that's unique among a lot of different different disease groups\nAnd tell me about the expansion outside of ... what exactly has that entailed and how did that come about\nYeah the the research consortium had\nA big focus on what's called precision medicine energy no mix where you take a sample of kids tumor and run it through a a computer algorithm and they say hey because we know the how the human genome works now we can see this is what's wrong with this tumor and and actually we know this drug over here works with that\nCould almost tailor it to the tumor in the individual yeah and and you exactly so what happens is is you could have a kid now who's being treated for ... or um you know a T. R. T. or any of these different childhood cancers with an Alzheimer's drug or an osteoporosis drug or some random drug that was never used in cancer\nBecause now we understand the genetics a little bit better and that you know mix we can say\nA here's how we're going to treat this kid and see the tumor actually shrinking see this actually work with something that you never would have treated a kid with a decade ago and so our hope within that is that we could eventually move away from what I call the kitchen sink chemo where you're just blasting kids with this poison send you a million hoping that it kills\nThe cancer faster than the one size fits all yeah and and it doesn't you know you you look at kids or any cancer patient who sunken eyes and the bond heads at the side effects of chemo not cancer at rice um and so that's something that we're moving away from it as we focused on that side that you know mix\nUm we started to realize that this was a ... not just in in their ... but in any solid mass pediatric cancer and so now we have\nA hundreds of tumor samples that have come through and we're starting to say\nUh you know this drug actually is working on this other cancer maybe we should start a clinical trial around that and see if this actually could work or an ad in Beijing I have heard of that before that is incredible incredible\nYeah I can only imagine in the hope that must be bringing to not only you guys but but some of the families who were actively dealing with this right now um\nYeah it's a paradigm shift in in how Gallagher's treated\nLet me ask you this in terms of the organization itself you've got people listening right now who are maybe hearing this and and it's kind of touching them in a way that they want to help whether it's volunteering are\nDonating of course we're going to get to the party in a moment that's one way they can do it and not everybody likes to get dressed up in fancy all the weight room [laughter] but um how can people be a part of beat and be and and offer their support\nYeah obviously the the the party is a great way to come out and meet us and and see the people that are uh involved here locally that uh I think that's a great way to do it um you can also check out our website and our Facebook we're usually most communicative on Facebook so it's just Facebook dot com slash beat him be you can search beat him beyond\nUm you know Twitter Instagram as well but Facebook seems to be the best place to kind of catch up with what we're doing and I think really just following us there and and finding out what it is that's going on a lot of people just you know they see a saint Jude commercial and they think oh childhood cancers taking care of\nA but the reality is that there are still multiple cancers within the child or cancer world\nUm that we are losing our kids to and and so knowing that being aware seeing the stories will make you more aware of that and then as we do things in the Tampa Bay area you can you know come out to be a part of that I'm so we we love just people following along and and knowing what's going on\nWe're talking to beat and be and Thirteen ugly men here our best to demand your host Ryan Gorman in the studio with me\n... executive director of beating being David ... president of Thirteen ugly men the two websites beat and be dot org and Thirteen ugly men dot coms or David now that we've talked to Kyle about this tremendous organization and the great work they're doing obviously a great organization too hot [noise]\n\nBS news on the hour sponsored by zoom video conferencing\nTo kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said\nI can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I'd bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids to feed\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one of the story is going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician a heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nThat listen we go out to customers houses all the time they have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all crowded up and we have to help them out of that predicament I mean for crying out loud [laughter] that's what we do\nWe make furnaces heat pumps and air conditioners last longer we lower energy bills we give you cleaner fresher error we increase Airflow we make systems run quieter and cost you less money to own\nNot we're not going to try to sell you something you don't need\nOkay\nNow look in about two to three minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines just be one of the first five people to text a message

I Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks'\nBusiness people out there what's referral or a new customer worth to you\nIf your furnace or your air conditioner goes out and you call a friend or relative and you say hey I've got this furniture air conditioning problem who do you use for your air conditioner and they say you got a call freedom heating and cooling they did the best maintenance we have ever had\nAt that point or you can go play Google roulette of course not you're going to take the advice of your friend or your neighbor or your church buddy or your relatives because the company they're recommending served them well\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business\n\nNo look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you\nThat you consider becoming a regular client and you tell other people about us\nThat's fair right okay\nYou have to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number\nIf you're one of the first five people to text the letters H.
