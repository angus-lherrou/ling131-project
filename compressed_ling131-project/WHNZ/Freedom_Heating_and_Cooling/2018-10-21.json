{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Um and maybe it'll reduce divorce rates I Know it will reduce financial strife\nSo to me um this could change the whole course of this journey just being able to have\nA safe environment for your child to be for school\nAnd let me ask you in terms of staffing that particular school because it's such a unique concert eyes are gonna be a combination of teachers and are they going to be doctors nurses things like\nThat there will be they will be Hillsborough County teachers and we would have a nurse on staff have doctors are and it's a non medical it would be um Hillsborough County schools has defined it as I always have to stop to get this right it's a satellite hospital homebound program or Italy in Hillsborough County our children are Cohen rolled\nIn the hospital homebound program which means the teacher comes to your home\nBut when you look at that program and it's a great program but it's twenty minutes maybe three or four times a week and we have these amazing qualified teachers who are in the car\nYou know they're trying to cover Carolyn in Plant City really you know I'd rather see them you know you build it and they'll come we'll give you the building you give us the teacher will will supply the kids and and to me it's a win win for everybody you know it makes the quality of education less resentment for the disease you know they can't play football they can't do this they can't they should be able to go to school\nRight right and once we can go to school I'm sure it'll help being around fellow avenue on at the same thing or their support the best\nWe're doing best of the ... on your host run in ... so we're joined by children across borders one voice foundation of voices for children with me in Studio you were just hearing from Marion ... executive director of one voice foundation we also have ... a share a meal except\nCofounder of children across borders and older and you are on a Kennedy the executive director of voices for children run a tell us a little bit about your organization how it got started and how you became involved sure\nVoices for children's support than advocates for the abuse and neglect it in a band and children in Hillsborough County and we choose to partner with the guardian ad litem program here in Hillsborough County to help\nTo accomplish that mission and you know it's it's hard right now in Hillsborough County and we have more children in foster care than any other county in the state of Florida so a guardian ad litem is a government agency and each guardian ad litem as um as signed to a judicial court circuit\nAnd we are a nonprofit that has decided to help raise funds through hundreds like children across borders to help\nFill in the gaps you know we all know that um again not to get political that there is never seems to be enough money especially for our youth and the state so we do our best to try to fill in those gaps and\nFor us we have for programs um to help subside you know to fill in those gaps with them and I think my favorite is our children's needs program and I think one thing that\nPeople don't understand about children in foster care is that\nThey're they're through no fault of their own though you know they they didn't do anything wrong they were found in a very unsafe environment and removed for their safety if somehow it's as if we're punishing them because we have to move them to a foster care\nUm facility or to foster parent or to a relative and and we try our best to get them what they need 'em but they know they're different they know when they go to school that they are not like their peers and so we try with our children's needs program\nTo filling the gaps so um I was a young man right now he's Seventeen he knows he's not going to be adopted um he's graduated high school early completed his GED he's working at a fast food restaurant and\nWe were just able to buy him a laptop because he just in a while the sea and this is a young man who has been um [noise]\nA part of the foster care program for about six years and\nThe guardian ad litem who is the uh volunteer child out of the cat and it's been assigned to his case that we work with sent me a picture and she said I I have never seen him smile is way and you know you're just kind of give those kids a little bit of\nWhat loving parents try to provide and it can be summer camp that can be um a new uniform because they've made the football team it could be tutoring sessions some of these kids are going to college I some of them are put up for adoption\nSome of them are reunited with a parent that knows\nThat they were in a bad relationship and they go through a case plan to make it better\nFor the guardian ad litem program itself is made up of these wonderful volunteer child advocates there is a staff of about Seventy people here in Hillsborough County and then about seven hundred of these volunteers and when a child's case comes through um\nThe court system a judge will assign a volunteer guardian ad litem to their case\nThat volunteer becomes it's not a mentor and it's not even a parent but it's just they become the voice of that child and they're able to talk to teachers and guidance councilors and and other family members and they're not on the side of the parent they're not on the side of\nThe parents families and I'm kind of he said she said of what goes on in life but they're they are to find out what the child what is best for the child and they and they fight for it and sometimes these cases can take as much as four years of time and these volunteers are\nAmazing and they give their time every month to make sure the child is safe and then if the child needs extra things they contact us and we help\nAs well the guardian ad litem stares at a team of attorneys that are amazing\nAnd so we were actually we're the only non profit um that funds a guardian ad litem program in the state of Florida to be able to\nPay for things to that legal team now sometimes we think about these cases and they go to court and you think well the the child should have the best representation possible and that was also and I believe that the lawyers do but they don't have the funds to passively get that expert testimony or a psychological evaluation at the parents to make sure that they're in a stable\nEnvironment and and so we try to fund those items and and sometimes it's surveillance some time to paying for depositions\nMiddle things like that all that up and so we try to support that legal team as much as we can say that if they can make an a decision and the best interest child\nAlong the way like I said we try to keep the children out of the court room and the guardian ad litem volunteers that child advocate will go into the courtroom for them so that there aren't there we don't want them to be re introduced to add that parents or offending party\nAnd um but there's times when a child ... tell their story and when that happens to me I have four days very first court house facility dog named Tibet who is a beautiful golden retriever lab mix and she and her handler ...\nWho is a full time volunteer um travel between the courthouse and another facility called ... house and they sit with his children and and the children have to share their story\nAt Tibet fits and less and the child recounts and it's able to the um ... we call them come hug [laughter] with the ... but um you know to that but it's one of the most magical things for me is\nAnd if any of you and your life I have a six year old child you know that it's not really easy to have a six year old set for an extended period of time um but there was a six year old child who needed to tell a story and as\nA story was being told Tibet\nSat on the floor and\nThe child massage Tibet ear kind of rolling the ear over and over and her little hand I'm\nSharing what happened for three hours wow three three and that would have been really difficult without ... sitting there\nAnd you just said it's just kind of got into her um frame of mind and she was peaceful and she was able to share everything and and the people were able to ask questions and\nAnd that is that's the gift it's a special gift we partner with a great organization or Atlanta called a companion a canine companions for independence and this dog is purpose bred for this so different than a therapy animal and Tibet is is special and\nThat you know she really can set and and the pet and loved and and it's evidence on on the floor you always we call them Tibet sprinklers and you'll see just a little\nPilot [laughter] after all the loving and giving 'em\nAnd so we're very proud to have that program as well and I think the last thing that we do and we try to support as much as we can [noise]\n\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI leaned in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks [noise] how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nA student from the table I shook his hand and I said these are the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in then I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate to kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said I can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I'd bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys I told stories\nIn interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over to break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one in the story is going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nThat listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time that have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all crowded up and we have to help them out of that predicament I mean for crying out loud [laughter] that's what we do\nSo we make furnaces heat pumps and air conditioners last longer we lower energy bills we give you cleaner fresher error we increase Airflow we make systems run quieter and cost you less money to own\nNot we're not going to try to sell you something you don't need\nOkay\nNow look in about two
