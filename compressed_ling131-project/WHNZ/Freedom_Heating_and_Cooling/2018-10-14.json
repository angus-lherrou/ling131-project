{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Now is your situation similar to brand needs to do you see some warning signs looking back now knowing what you know you would have recognized\nLooking back yes [laughter] um but I also was out of the ... I Lived in a different state for my father at the time so it didn't really know what was going on at home\nYeah um and and the work that you do that they up is ... tell us a little bit about the kind of the day to day uh involvement that you have with the organization\nSo I'm a teacher at my job I teach kindergarten um but this is my passion and this is where I volunteer\nI'm chapter board chair so we basically our chapters us and we have eight board members and we all have our little next that were really great at and I kinda just manage that\nI'm communicating a lot over email with people who are interested in having trains or want to be at our event to reach out to people to come to our events and I also um do save talked ratings where I go around and try and people in the community on suicide prevention\nAnd I also do advocacy that's my passion smoker so I go to Tallahassee every year for the state capital day and speak to legislators about suicide prevention legislation and mental health share my story with them briefly and then talk about why this is important to us\nAnd to me as a constituent I Need your support on this out in the past we got a bill passed that would not mandate teachers to get training that's what we're going for originally but they didn't like the language of mandate but it would\nHighly encourage school districts to make sure all of their teachers are trained in suicide prevention wasn't incentivize are the only incentive what's to be certified as a suicide say for school\nSo my goal eventually is to get it where this has mandated that all teachers must be required to take\nTraining and suicide prevention and it needs to be\nSo they can spot the warnings architecture\nExactly and it needs like another level of uh you know awareness and prevention\nI mean if you really think about it so again\nI'm number two killer of our youth as suicide\nAnd they spend more time at school then they really do at home right so\n... story you've heard from him as well as myself as if we had known the warning signs we might actually be in a very different situation directly so the the value of the individuals that are spending more time with our youth in their own parents is really there\nRight in and let me ask you this this might sound like kind of a dumb question but they were all year to learn a your situation Randy your situation Hannah you had a fourteen year old son you had to have forty seven year old ... forty six year old father\nIs different in terms of the warning signs or how you deal with individuals like you know a a teenager compared to a grown adult man is it does that play a role in in all of this\n[noise] I think starting on [laughter] I think every person displays different warning signs and it's more of like what you know if that person and how their character is um so\nI Would I mean big changes yes there's the constant really\nYet that so there there's absolutely a change in their normal behavior\nIs really one of the biggest key indicators no matter male female age race I mean that is a huge indicator and how you approach them it's actually very consistent okay about straightforward with language\nUm so I don't think that changes now if you're approaching a ten year old which we now report suicide as young as Ken\nI'm your word choice might be very different than a forty seven year old veteran\nYeah okay and I also wonder and I don't know if you're going to be answered it is or or or certain types of people more susceptible whether rich teenagers or veteran ... or you know your average accountants you know in their mid twenties\nSo the one thing about suicide is it's not biased it affects any age group I mean obviously brandy share their story what the young young younger ages Hannah sharing her with a ... ... you know older ages I lost my brother do suicide at the age twenty six there's no bias like suicide just doesn't pick an age group it affects everybody in any way\nAnd it's not it's just one of the things where again it goes back to the warning signs and having that awareness to know what to look for what you know how to handle the situation I'm going to add on to you and as you're I'm also a teacher as well do in ... county schools\nAnd and you know making making a big point of having that mandated honestly let's be real\nUm for all teachers but also social workers guidance counsellors um community leaders in general um there were people in the school system who would come to me knowing that I was experience\nWith a suicide prevention because they were never trained on it now these are people that you rely on and trust you hey you're got his company you should know how to do this but if they've never been affected or been had like training in general they're not going to know what to do and especially with the school system with the rise of\n... percent it as a rates and younger age groups in high school and even college students which is insane\nUm it's just one of the things we're our purpose as if in general is really\nReally to advocate to make people aware and to just prevent suicide in general\nWe're talking to are we one now on best\nOf debate of course in Studio with us the American foundation for suicide prevention you can find out more a F. S. P. dot org switch we told you about your personal story\nUh so I lost my brother and a two thousand six oh about twelve years now twelve years of November um ... it's one of the situation that I was completely unaware because at that time my family and I were living in the state of Florida and he was living in Missouri by himself and\nGrowing up with my brother um just one of those really motivated people I mean just outgoing trying to thrive in life and as time went on as we're living in Florida being separated my brother actually came down to visit us at one point\nAnd it was just strictly just for a vacation from what we're told and next you know the next month he took his own life unfortunately and um since two thousand six it's I've really\nI was a loss I mean everybody was in one is one of the biggest stigma in Asian community is is that you don't talk about suicide\nIt's just a one of those things where like in almost brings dishonor to your family and so for quite a while it was just one of those things that was never spoke about at home\nSo suffering in silence was literally suffering in silence and so it took me quite a while to find out where\nOr how I can start reading or morning or finding hope and that's when I came across a thespian with doing um the out of the darkness lock\n'em oddly enough all our former board chair Jason Thompkins\nI'm having to be one of my Starbucks customers and so I happen to see 'em out one of these suicide prevention at events randomly at a concert and I'm like hey we can you tell me more about this he's like yeah I lost my mom and November two thousand six I'm like oh weird I lost my brother in November of next tell me more about it\nAnd since getting connected with Jason he literally open doors jewel where I Know that I can actually find help and healing and hope through this dark time in my life and\nBecause of that I've invested in my life besides teaching into the passion of suicide prevention and trying to be involved as much as I can\nTalk a little bit about the under the darkness a sheep you walk coming up we're again we're talking to the American foundation for suicide prevention the Tampa chapter ... orange Tampa Bay chapter board chair and building bachelor\nA an ulcer brandy Pauline Tampa Bay chapter board member and we when are we just should be out of the darkest saint Pete walk cheer 'em ... what does this have been designed to accomplish and and what are you hoping to show people or if they go out and agenda\nSo the out of the darkness walk in general is really just a key many walk for awareness of the whole purpose of the walk and not you bring up will bring to light about suicide to let people know that there is it's positive positive like you all for it let's be like [noise]\n\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by June video conferencing\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview\nI Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I got to get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question\nI asked him I leaned in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks [noise] how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nAbout from the table I shook his hand and I said or the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in then I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate to kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said I can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys I told stories\nIn interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems like crossing wires over\nTo break them and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked and chances are pretty good that a technician like the one of the story it's going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nThat listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time that have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all credit up and we have to help them out in that predicament I mean for crying out loud [laughter] that's what we do\nWe make furnaces heat pumps an air conditioners last longer we lower energy bills we give you cleaner fresher error we increase Airflow we make systems run quieter and cost you less money to own\nA we're not going to try to sell you something you don't need okay\nNow look in about two to three minutes
