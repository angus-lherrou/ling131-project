been horrible this summer\nThank goodness dry hot weather wet weather over and some we'd she slowed down I'm thinking Dr whether I'm happy to have it in fact if you are just going to fade away and you won't have to control them until next year I'll tell you\nOne one of them it happens to be the basket grass many of us see that out there are creeping across the ground the ... with me today we'll talk about it many gardeners kind of like this one because it forms a ground cover but it gets into the shrubs and flowering plants just kind of creeps along the surface of the ground comes up and\nSo but it will be fading away very quickly and that probably makes it less of a desirable ground cover\nIt also invades the turf or does it look like when like I said I have a sample with us and we'll talk about it or you know what do you do about the we ... you must control the sooner or later you're you're you're going to get out of control and you're going to have control them and uh also some of the weeds loved the cooler weather\nOr they were here during the summer and those some of those will fade out some of the year round but then we have what we call the winner re weeds also\nAnyway

S.\nArlen Canada or England I'm going to say us this time Joni Canada okay Canada fights [laughter]\nNineteen twenty seven\n... Atlanta Journal or and they came up with anything I Know but that's what it was married\nNow and so uh I I guess it just kind of caught on what can I tell you\nOkay I brought some weeds in the day and a here's the theory\nThat I feel you don't have to worry about you won't have control now unless you want to\nOne of them's basket grass that when they're Brian has the little critical leaf to it and and that's what I brought them most of OK okay All right and the other one I brought a most birds and believe it or not just ... it probably won't produce it now 'cause I pulled it up the yesterday\nBut uh it's a point set a relative\nOr is that there has to have a I'm a warm conditions the one I didn't bring in is called Alexander grass it looks like St Augustine\nAnd it grows or the you know flat like St Augustine but it dies out in the wintertime so all three of those are going to die out so if you're home and listening get up on the Internet you can find pictures just put in basket grass\nOr that is some of the best looking corn seems especially popcorn\nIt is popcorn and a first time we've grown and out there and a garden that might have something to do with it but I've been given a regular fertilizer and they're making sure that it has plenty of irrigation\nYeah well look great that's for sure and nice and tall looks like his form in the ears very well you had sweet potatoes or you had a much different squash a butternut squash is what I saw and the some tomatoes things of that nature and then you're putting in all the cool season vegetables\nYeah there was this uh what are the way it feels right now after this front came through a kind of over ... and vegetable [laughter] try to get the cool season vegetables in the crowd\nYeah I have to tell our listeners that you had grown sort of the best transplants I've seen I mean those are tough and durable I think you said they were started in September\nSeptember twentieth ah about five weeks old and that this is the best crop I've turned out this year\nYeah this is what that neither do and we were doing a little TV tape or for orange t._v. on how to um put transplants on the ground but those are tough endure boy especially with all the hot weather they had to go through it or is this amazing\nWell part of the greenhouse and there has a cooling system and uh I make sure that it runs during the daytime uh soon as it gets about Seventy five degrees inside there the ... come on so it starts to cool right away\nThat keeps them more compact now there's lots of things that grows at this time right\nOh yeah a lot of things to grow a I like the cool season or the plants aren't nearly as challenging as in warm season there's cabbage is and all the relatives ah including kale broccoli cauliflower collards coal robbing muster Chinese cabbage and Brussels sprouts they're all from the same\nPlant basically uh they've just been selectively bred to give you all those other neat vegetables in the garden and then you've got a letter says I've got Romain growing out there right now I've got a ... type lettuce also growing haven't grown any leaf lettuce is yet and butter crunch lettuce or will be put out in the garden very shortly\nAnd then we got all the root vegetables like pizza\nAnd I consider a Swiss chard in that family root vegetables even though it doesn't make roots it is a beat yeah uh that was Brad specifically to make leaves and then there's turnips carrots and radishes so there's a lot to do and a vegetable garden and I guess I\nI'll Try English peas again this year and I've got strawberries grown and I'll be getting mine is and so\nYeah my English peas are up by the way and they looked at all but it's good that I got I'm right in on the on the edge of this coup was arriving so they say look pretty good now or any of these easier to grow or do you have some favorites\nA couple that are easy to grow I think at least one I Know there's really easy to grow and that's radishes um\nYeah I usually makes a few radish seeds when I'm putting my carrot seeds out to help me see where the rows of carrots are because of radishes pop up just on a couple of days and my favorites I really liked Romain lettuce I like broccoli variety called gypsy and I like the Swiss chard bright lights because of the colored as the garden\nYeah isn't that neat nice to have some color in the gardener now the radishes or one for kids young and old I mean if you're impatient Gardner you got to plant radishes\nYou have to plant radishes a you put the seeds out in a couple of days you'll see them sprouting and in a month you'll have him on the table if you're gonna wait that long\n[laughter] you know that's one of the first seeds I agree with my parents had me so ready seeds because they knew I see him come up very quickly and in a month or less I I'd be eating them and you know I'm really not a big ... fan but when I was a kid uh we put them in Salt water and we ate him\nYes we can do that um they don't want to plan out too many at one time though there's so much you can take out of that snappy pap pepper tasting ball that you get out of him\nAnd I found that the key to getting the ball the farmers to have the full sun um any shade at all will give you a whole lot of ... a top growth and you won't get many uh balls to form\nYou know how long do we have the plant these cool season corrupt\nUh we've got up until the end of February so we've got almost five months to grow them and you can re grow radishes for instance every thirty days you can plant a new batch radishes if you want\nYeah it's got a long season for so uh you know you have plenty of time and still get the gardens are saying uh now yeah that's true yeah what are we at his transplants\nA boy that's a ... almost all of them you can add is transplants broccoli cauliflower cabbage we used yesterday and the show\nA brussel sprouts um onions will be transplants at this time of year he won't be able to find sets that will grow very well here strawberries will be buried rooted transplants and I usually buy those from a\nA a ... market over in Plant City so I make sure I got the right type that will grow during our seasons\nAnd uh it just might be too late right now for you to start your own transplant so uh unfortunately uh you could try and have some that Joe plan out maybe five or six weeks from now but hopefully you've got enough time on the end of the season they'll reach maturity so\nI just go ahead and go for it and see what happens\nYeah ... you know here's a little bit different I think we still have time I I think we're okay on that they're a I'm going to skip down a little bit will do onions another time cars going to run out of time or what what general care due to cool season crops need\nA generally their same care that you get the ... and crops you need plenty of sunlight six or more hours a day water close by us to keep the garden bed monitoring moist\nAnd fertilizer and you want to put it on a frequent basis a usually about every three weeks a light application don't overdo the fertilizer unless you're growing or things that you want leaves for the more fertilizer the more leaves you'll probably get\nBut that means you'll probably have more bugs to a crawl around on your plants too so you want to\nKeep after the bugs to try to get them out of the guard and while they're small and be ready for a cold snap from time to time and protect the plants\nThat's always going to ask you what happens if we get a frost er freeze\nWhile most of these crops can handle a free a false alight frost pretty well but if we know that it freezes coming we want to go out and probably put some water in the ground and get some heat in the ground the day before the phrase is supposed to get here and put her row cover or toss she tore\nA some kind of a much fabric material over the top of the plants an anchor him down with bricks are boards are just so you can trap some of the heat under a couple of degrees that protection is about all you really need and you can save your crop that way\nNo sound like a good idea about some classes I Know you have one today\nYes I've got one today I'm teaching for the city of Orlando we're talking about composting a Florida for a new landscape is coming up as well as turf tips in shade alternatives and I'll be talking about coal protection and holiday plant care if you can believe it\nYeah I I expect to see the first point said at the garden center very soon\nIt's going to be there very soon and I may be there as early as next weekend when we set our clocks back\nYeah ah so ah around Halloween is when they show up a pre registrations require so you know who's coming they they can call the office at four Seventy five four Ninety two hundred or they can go up on line and get the information Orange County extension right\nRight and um we've got plenty of room just let us know that you're coming\nOkay sounds good at a very much hey thank you for helping out yesterday garden looks great no matter what you say\nThank you I appreciate that and I enjoyed the the pictures you okay have a great\nDay or he goes down the garden path right now you've got to teach a class today and of course we're going to take a break ... coming up she can talk about spider webs are and of course we'd love to have your call or taps\nEven Texas up to three six eight oh or you can call us at one eight eight eight four or five five to nine six seven that's one simple eight forty five lawns one simply forty five lawns on time a kind of extension agent marriages with the University of Florida and as as far as an entertainment networks\n\nAlways say the right thing I sure do [noise] in
