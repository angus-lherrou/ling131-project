federal judiciary and now after Justice Kennedy retired it the way the ideological breakdown works on the court he actually\nIs sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh comes to this court after this\nBrutal political fight or you know in some\nInflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and the whole process just isn't that sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for the chief will be to to try to steer the court drew the meeting or pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another part of somebody you know\nHow do you steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\nWell I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruined it doesn't it's not so sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court's role little bit\nThere have been other times you know an an issue that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so [noise] you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court\nAnd there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have a choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is the case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear\nThe you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example meat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal

go through the confirmation process they have some disability for a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar\nSort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable member of the court for the public\nOff the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time any any way some of the\nGuys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so\nYou know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm takes very bold dances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction and you know people

sessions which just basically traveling\nThe country and beyond a talking about things like violent crime and terrorism and as time has gone on that has become more apparent including when it is actually run inside that is traveling to the international cheat the association conference\nIn Orlando with Trump or that it's something that would be very close to a session heart\nAs somebody who is a big fan of local law enforcement that his in France for the G ... summit so it just kind of an interesting little reality for both of them\nWell these are the conservatives are pleased with what sessions has done\nUm I think they would normally be pleased with what sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set a session like Trump is for stepping aside from the Russia investigation at for you know just allowing Mueller's investigation to progress as\nIt has so I think in any other sort of environment session too is you know prioritize immigration and violent crime\nThat you know drug policies um you know we'll be getting credit from conservative but that's not necessarily happening at the time\nWhen I say you were speaking with

burst onto the scene after that but I think that's still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think\nRight now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the midterm story right now is about you know whether Trump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to resign on their own accord so it's just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAh all yes for both for all of them and the president they get you know our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get along fairly well at Rosenstein has\nDone a pretty good job of you know keeping the present appeasing the president and such a way that he's been able to keep his job and continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president is totally true rated for that little bit different\nWhen you said a of Mr

on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean catching is recused from that so you know he's not getting briefed he's not getting a you know updates about the

really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues we have Rick tripled in this piece of people\nWent to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault um once you had to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political debates we're getting too heated of a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something that really couldn't be avoided that work\nGoodness I I mean it did it caused enough friction where somebody might want to quit or pushing and shoving or yelling\n[noise] well we heard a talk to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had a her tone as a group of men in front of her work locking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to\nWere suddenly redirect the conversations their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated

course we're going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made a point that we don't we don't have a third place for these discussions anymore\nThat there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time\nSo of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling

have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room and if it didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees

some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens is we determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open

journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall Brent what's up here\nJohn Roberts is the man in the middle of the Supreme Court both a literally and figuratively so you know he he leads to court he's the face of the federal judiciary and now after Justice Kennedy retired it the way the ideological breakdown works on the court he actually\nIs sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so he has a he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court could do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh comes to this court after this\nBrutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and the whole process just as not to sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for the chief\nWill be to to try to steer the court drew the meeting or pretty rough partisan times without also just looking like another part of somebody you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean it was rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him dear it\n[laughter] well I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll\nKind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not the sweeping so that's one way to to minimize the court throw little bit there have been other times you know an an issue that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so [noise] you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court\nAnd there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some big legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is the case where the court has almost entirely discretionary ... meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear so you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn\nRoe v Wade for example meat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean uh two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now with all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nFrom when they go through the confirmation process they have something to do this for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat as Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar\nSort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable member of the court for the public\nOff the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time any any way some of this\nDies down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so\nYou know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kavanaugh takes very bold stances in cases\nYou know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he finds ways to moderate in the end to forge common ground with you know with a cross section of people

cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly unpack and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas that trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAn accident and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depression and so it's really important to learn\nHow to set boundaries and center yourself and realize that you are not that your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's and I had done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the compassion neurons in the brain where I'm now a path to that's why it's such\nAn interesting ... standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons to compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on her feet teased scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle here on mirror neurons get activated that much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know is going to affect you because you're an impasse had to begin to set those boundaries\nWell

usually rife with political discussion have closely felt the impact\nOf the Kavanaugh debates Wall Street journal reporter ship cutter has been sampling workplaces ... says the stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice have made this moment notably personal chip what have you found\nPolitics have really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example ah that that they weren't having really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues\nWe have examples in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault um one CEO how to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the amount of political debates we're getting too heated to a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something that really couldn't be avoided at work\nGoodness I I mean it did it caused enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\n[laughter] well we heard I talked to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had a her tone as a group of men in front\nOf her we're talking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to were suddenly redirect conversations their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work that\nThat that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right ... at at work avoid religion politics things like that\nIt is I think for a long time this is politics have stayed out of work for a number of people are told us that they don't but it's it's no wonder ... that you you do bring him home to the office that the issues that you're you're discussing outside of work of course we're going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made a point that we don't we really don't have a third\nPlace for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time\nSo of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of pre counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called the Bateman group and they have offices in New York and San Francisco and partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I found interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slack room that had had to set up for the past year the flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers they're\nReally engaged in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room and if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it you know about\nThat while we speak with your cutter Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the Kavanaugh affect political debates shake up the workplace I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said he's had to tell his his small team but there really is just no please for political bickering network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that [noise]\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see what happens is we determine how they respond I'd want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city":
