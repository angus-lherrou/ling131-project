little cooler than I expected\nA sixty eight at my house but here's some temperatures around the state Tallahassee fifty eight\nGainesville you thinking will be warmer wouldn't you\nFifty seven degrees now are are good friends up our listeners\nAre frequently write me and say they're colder than Tallahassee sometimes a several degrees colder\nI I think uh that uh one is written they said they've had a fifty three already so in his backyard you know I knew to get a new monitor move I don't know [laughter] maybe it's a little Christmas present yeah maybe yeah or or areas sixty eight Melbourne Seventy three and Lakeland sixty six uh I Would figure\nThat no Lakeland with these women snowboard but but not the only way cool weather feeling like fall energized yeah ready to go the only problem is we had this big thing come across the state called hurricane Michael ... thanks kind of like snuck up out of nowhere you didn't get much warning and it got big very fast\nI thought that when people told us when we went in the Caribbean was no problem and get some rain and then about\nIt yeah I had a gory to their home\nOr almost five adult overnight yeah to point or something like that from five now you showed me a picture of air station in Panama City yeah was it looked like\nA guy that tower I guess in that location we don't have that here but I guess the tower and that location is there at the building they broadcast from and that thing just guy twisted up and ripped the ground which on our high those things are quite quite high fifty feet a hundred feet\nYeah and that that wasn't ground zero Mexico beach was ground zero and Panama city's not that far away now but still that must have taken a heck of a when to stop all that\nLike some of the pictures like that train and then that entire along you know train that got knocked over\nYeah that's amazing no I did see one story where a gentleman\nUh was on Arlen and he built a house to withstand a hundred and fifty five ... mile an hour winds uh-huh and he\n... you'll stay there and and evidently everything's okay wow this is amazing I did hear from Beverly one of our listeners are from Tallahassee and uh she said she never seen her oak trees go up and down so far so much to do some ... we're going to take this call right now because his re in Tallahassee\nAnd he's going to have some information for re good morning to you\nHey Tom good morning\nYeah I'm Glad I'm Glad you did oh okay I Hope anyway\nI Am so so lucky I\nLive about twelve miles south of Tallahassee and Crawford bill I still without power but that's okay ah I had I bought a brand new chainsaw a day before the storm hit the big three hunter a model\nStitch spill chainsaw I have a lot of neighbors and around corporate bill there are a lot of trees that are down my question is if I'm going to go out\nAnd harvest down trees are live out the best for firewood\nYeah live oak is as might be good for firewood and the oaks will do but live oak is nice and then to burns well gives off a lot of heat so that that should be good yeah her regretfully now this is the time you can go out and get all the fire wouldn't start stack and it's\nAh so ah yeah ah so what have you noticed a ... or the roads being cleared and things like that OK\nCrawford bills done quite well uh [noise]\nThey had a for water crushed at highway Ninety eight on the ... river it's happened before but I've never seen it uh I had not been down to saint marks yet ... down to the chat with a plan not to because they tell us to stay off the road so I'm sure in off the road\nShe'll do know that says if the you know uh most of the crop for most of Crawford bill or larger for setting or fifty has power restored but oh that's good or service there are some spots like myself that don't have it but that's okay you know we we have to be thankful for what we had\nYeah well when you're about where we were about a year ago when the hurricane came through here we were without power for three days ironically the people in back of it is right directly back of his were without power for six days it just the way the power comes in I guess sir yeah\nAnd so I think yeah yeah one thing I Do uh\nAbout two hours after the storm I Won in Tallahassee the roads were clear I made it all the way up to ten so I may I was able to drive twenty miles north now you did okay and I have and I happened to get on the interstate trying to get back to highway Ninety\nAnd uh the streets were all over the interstate wow on the on the outside lanes ... hit on by but\nUh that's where I came back home state but [laughter]\nI don't blame you and that's now can you get food and gas and things like that\nIf you had a Wal Mart opened up for a day after and clown and they ... they had the closed because of their generator clerk\nAt a gas station and they run out of the cats but there'll be ACT UP with gas within Fifteen hours so good now I'm lucky if there was a a a way to help the people are Panama City in that area\nWe would do that you know that state troopers their cones to stay off the roads to let emergency equipment\nYou know there's a lot of how well there's a lot of help her get there\nAnd now that you that you really can't get into the county because they're not letting people it's a I guess you could help by donation I was ready I had I prefer just tarps chainsaw water but anybody I can help I Will\nNow well I've been monitoring everything with a Tallahassee one hundred point seven or listening to press than Scott especially in less than two yeah and the other announcers enter their also I'm sure we're off the air or is this morning as they help others and I appreciate that\nUh but take care of yourself thanks for calling in and the you know I guess you have to make lemonade out of lemons and harvest it wouldn't have it available yeah\nYeah and ... you know you are on the radio here\nWe are a good thing I did in the morning I tuned in this morning are well very good well I appreciate them doing that forests and let her show I'm well thank you very much you have a great gardening day\nTheir egos and we appreciate the call coming in and I have a few thoughts here we'll get to the ... after a while uh in the first thing I thought was you know take care of yourself your family and your home first don't worry about your plans\nThe plan to roll back some of them may have to be planted back but the plan to grow back ... a year ago we lost a big tree in the backyard and uh it it was devastating just like it is a in the Tallahassee area but not like it was in Panama City Mexico beach in places like that\nAh so I told the tree company they call\nI called in the day after the storm and uh they really didn't realize how bad it was it called the banks and you know to me off where we can get out and I said take care of others first take care of people who had the trees when they're home or things like that don't worry about us and we didn't get it taken down for about for about a month and that was fine\nAnd and I was thinking you know this is a waste of my time and I so I'm going to try him I put them out and put them in the ... the yard and I figured this morning they are saying you\nReally are ah hopefully it'll hold up for a couple more days and then uh looks like we're going back and do more seasonable whether\nIf we can get down to the lower temperatures at night in a high temperature day that that's just fine how's your hardest doing by the way\nOh not too bad I'm been harvesting a summer squash already got a couple of winter squash you're almost ready to harvest a yard long beans are coming in pretty well and won't be too long I Hope that I'll start getting tomatoes but ah I haven't I I've only got a couple of them starting to change color right now so I've got a couple more weeks yet\nAnd that's what I have to now I Want to find out when is going to be the showing of the movies if you get the popcorn\n[laughter] oh I guess it'll probably be the day after we get the popcorn off the hook up to the corners task now and the silks are showing up\nOkay well you're on the way yeah so what about\nWhat three more weeks I think some after\nThat yeah at least probably don't don't schedule the movie yet huh okay well let's talk about strawberries today and say you know right now is the time the plant I'm ready if you're going to do it\nIf you're going to do it this is the time for us in central Florida or in Florida in general\nOf the strawberries are the people are so used to finding in the ... catalog just don't do well for us here so we grow strawberries in the wintertime when it's cooler and when a night of the daytime ... shorter than other times of the year\nAnd the summer humidity we have we don't want to fight all that we have a lot of problems are just draw on the other ones so yup it's time to start growing strawberries\nOkay so we knew when CG or do we have certain variety is to look for\nUh we do start new ones each year and this year's variety looks like it's going to be sensation you might still be able to find some a festival or winter fast from previous years but I'm\nSensation is what we want and you're not likely to find them and see catalog you're gonna have to buy 'em at either the local garden center big box stores will carry it or make a trip over to Plant City like I Do to buy them\nYeah now ... ... the varieties change all the time I remember there was one called sweet Charlie but now now sensation is the sensation right\nYes and sweet Charlie was a standard for a long way very great tasting strawberry and like I say once in a while you can still find them but they're not as popular as they used to be a reason we have new varieties every year we're trying to stay ahead of diseases that attacked the strawberries\nYeah what kind of saw preparation do we need something special\nNothing special compared to what you normally do for\nAnd the other vegetable garden a clean the garden area out remove all the weeds in any residue from previous crops at compost of course in the work that into the soil about a three inch layer killed in the top six inches will do wonders farm\nUh if you want to add a pre plant fertilizer put it out a day or two ahead of time about one pound of a six six six fertilizer for every ten feet of roe uh strawberries really grow best in locations they get at least eight hours of sunlight today\nAnd if you can't find that spot just find the sunny a spot you can uh the specially for sun in the morning and early afternoon and then of course check yourself ... should be somewhere between five and a half and six and a half like any other vegetable garden\nYeah now the strawberries that we're going to get her going to come in they're rude right and yeah they're\nGoing to come and Barrett route hum you could possibly find plugs but bear route seems to be the most popular right now so when you plant them take care that you don't damage the roots\nAre and make sure the roots are covered with soil and then there's something called a crown where all the green stuff comes out of and the berries will venture would come out of that area as well you don't want to cover that crown was soil it'll rot out if you do keep the crown and that is a ...\nA leaves in the stands as clean as you can know soil on them\nNow we're talking with ed throws a Orange County University of Florida extension agent and we're talking strawberries today a lot of people are interested in him and so what kind of care do we need to give the crop\nOil um the ... crops come in or they're going to be fairly dry so you want to get him in the ground and then water them quite frequently uh you want to water I'm actually in the middle of the day I'm for the first couple of weeks\nYou'll notice when they start the look better they'll start to stand up right on their own they'll start getting new green grove\nAnd then you can back off on the water ... to an ass needed a you want to fertilize regularly with a balanced fertilizer or six six six ten ten ten twenty twenty twenty whatever you happen to have and then a hand pick weeds and just be ready for insects like caterpillars aphids the rip spider mites\nBoy the spider my is really love strawberries and occasionally it gets slugs and snails and I'm so you'll have trouble with birds and rabbits stealing the fruit but uh you can try burden heading to help keep those a fruit in the garden\nOh that's a good uh you know we don't have time to talk about hydroponic but it's another way of doing it and uh I I Will talk about that another time but you know how long will we get strawberries\nA well you should be able to pick the first strawberries and about Ninety Days so if you plan on now you should be getting strawberries around January and then you should be continuously harvesting strawberries through about April or may\nWow that's kinda nice uh and uh what are we doing the plants when they're done I mean they're going to finish up sooner or later\nWell eventually they will finish up above that will stay green in the garden and you'll also noticed that you'll get brown spots on the leaves a few leaving there too long but like all of our crops in the vegetable garden once they're done get the garden a cleaned up get the plants out of the garden\nAnd of course they won't produce strawberries are on a regular basis throughout the summer anyway\nYeah so unlike our northern neighbors we treat diseases and you'll probably pull him out every year rather than just a a continual keeping growing\nYes you do and that's quite interesting ah with our strawberries are we actually grow them in Canada as a as a small plants and they shipped back from ... we send them to Canada they grow them in the lower light levels and their greenhouses then they ship 'em back in time to plant\nHow 'bout that had a class has\nA tropical fruit in the home and garden a lot of people interested in tropical fruit that's on Thursday night or we have another Florida friendly landscaping class and we've got some turf tips in shade alternatives or three popular classes coming up sort of like\nOK they can register online or they can get up on the Orange County extension a website and get the information I had to register but didn't give you a call at four O. seven to find four Ninety two hundred or they could just stop by and say Hi to you\nSure we'd be glad to see it and get you register for class and we can have an opportunity to learn something together\nYeah it's kind of important to register ahead so you know how many people who prepare for\nYes it is and I've had unfortunately had to cancel a class most recently of bothered me a lot but I only have three people register for the class and um it it's kind of tough to open the doors for that\nYeah well now you have such great turnout to others and you know that happens sometimes especially during the hot weather\nYeah I've got a matter of fact I'm here teaching a class today and we'd be expecting a fifty people to show how\nHow 'bout that well that and you have a great class today and we appreciate you being with us\nWell Tom I enjoyed it and I hope everybody gets a chance to pick up a few strawberries to put it in the garden that'd be kinda fun yeah fresh strawberries thanks and fresh strawberries from your garden a how neat that would be um\nI don't know whether it's still worth it but they're kind of fun to grow to be able to go out there and get a handful bring him on in uh when I go to the store and get the Florida strawberries I don't know but you might want to give any time can be fun we come back we got Joni are we still got a ... we've got more we've gotten your calls I guess\nIn text messages in Texas a two three six said oh I'm trying to come and this is talk and entertainment networks [noise]", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal",
