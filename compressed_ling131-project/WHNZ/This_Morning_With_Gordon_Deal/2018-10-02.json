continue to pile up into the court comes back in late September and has\nWhat's called the long conference and they go through and look at a whole bunch of requests to add new cases to the docket and you can normally count on them adding you know ten twelve or so cases it leads to this year they only added a it was five\nSo they're definitely baby steps right now are the court tries to to see how this is all going to shake out\nOne of the cases that will draw a lot of attention\nAs of right now there there aren't really cases are that are the same how profile his last term and we had the

from being prosecuted twice for the same crime\nHow that should work when you have but at the federal government in the state government looking to do the charges when there are a lot of important cases but nothing that rises to the level of the public visibility of that sort of cases we saw the in the last term\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall is pieces called Supreme Court opens new term without ninth justice in place or what is the case of the moose hunter that is the Supreme Court\n[noise] so that's more interesting cases we have I mean

you know in the courtroom I hear about one percent of the cases that disaster here and [noise]\nAnd for most people if the court you know if they get their case to the court I mean it's like hitting

when when he was here a couple of years ago so after a lower court\nRuled against him a second time he came back and said hey can you can you hear my case again and rule on this one term for all and the court said yes and so his case is one of the ones that we have a ending here for the fall\nAnd just to be clear ... because the court right now is operating with just eight justices a new justice

about the millions of tons of garbage in the patch the ocean cleanup project\nHas sent out a giant floating trash collector to try to scoop it up it's a daunting task because all the patch includes about one point eight ... trillion pieces of trash\nAnd waste eighty eight thousand tons the equivalent of five hundred jumbo jets and while many scientists say it's great that people are trying to clean up the patch others say most of our efforts should instead go towards stopping the out of control flow of plastic garbage into the ocean\nIt's a story by ... writes science writer at USA Today Doyle tells about the patch it's about like\nSolid mass it's not like a it's not like a thing you can necessarily see from an airplane or from space\nBecause a lot of it is just under the surface and it's also a lot of little a lot of it it's broken down into rather small pieces so\nWhen you think of it it's not like you can't walk on edge and you can't like a you know it's not this blob of something that's like a ... a solid by any stretch it's kind of spread out over an area about twice the size of Texas\nGoodness gracious to do um currents play a role in sort of keeping it altogether as in weather patterns things like that\nIt's mainly ocean currents that's the main thing that keeps the thing's going or a ... they're called jai ours is just the scientific term and that's just a kind of a circular pattern swirling around the ocean and it it eventually it's kinda like in the bath tub it circles around and around there all the stuff kind of collects in one area\nAnd that's what's happened here that that it's a a ... that's kind of goes around much of that part of the Pacific\nJust ends up circling together did this one mass and as I said there's other ... in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic ocean and ah so this is this is one of several around the world around\nWho's responsible for ... for all this mess\nAnd yeah it's all humans it's a you know there was obviously no plastic before the fifties or Nineteen fifties and so basically it's just a it's just all of us around the world um and dumping plastic not disposing of properly\nAllowing it to just slow out into the ocean I'm this particular patch or it's probably mainly uh from Asia or they they they they seem to think that most of the ocean trash is from China\nIndonesia the Philippines and that's that's kind of been the source for a lot of it the U.S is is somewhat of a contributor it's not we're not completely blameless but we are overall doing a better job than some of the some of the developing countries around\nThe world so that that is that wind up in there if if if let's say a China is to blame for a good chunk of this are they actually dumping it in the ocean or they can't process what they have were being sense\nWell yea for quite a while they were happily accepting garbage a plastic garbage from around the world you know ... other countries didn't know what to do with it and so we are other countries would ship it to China and that that was something that was well no we was shipped them our garbage and our plastic\nAnd for whatever reason we didn't no one really seemed to you know see no evil well you know it's we've ship it there we didn't really know what they did with it well you know could very well be they were just dumping into the ocean\nAh we we don't know because we don't really ... track that but they have actually China has stopped accepting trash from other parts of the world as over the last couple of years so that that will no longer be a a dumping ground for this plastic\nUh so where where other countries are going to have to figure out what to do with it a rather than just dumping it a China\nWe're speaking with Doyle rice science reporter at USA Today has ... where did the trash in the great Pacific garbage patch come from\nAnd how do we stop it you quoted somebody in the stories that are ... there were these wonderful cleanup efforts going on but that's a waste of time largely we need to spend more time figuring out how to keep this up out of the ocean\nWas just mentioning that this is a pig to the\nTo the ocean clean up project which
