rain and it wasn't quite as hot as it has been don't you know that every time we go way the weather moderate bill here I was up there thinking boy they're down here suffering with any four Ninety five maybe\nGoing up but it wasn't like that I guess ... or you know this is matter when you leave the house it's you know not hot no Seventy one yeah yeah I Wonder\nHow so that was kind of neat uh what Julian either up north of course in Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts for a few days ... uh and we saw the lowest I think we saw was fifty degrees ... ... ... what you had jackets on well yeah I Know that from their ... and two days\nWe're kind of rainy kind of wet but then when we went to the primary fair cleared off one of the best days I think we have the ... that's true yeah yeah so very nice anyway a\nThat was a great we want to resolve the all American selections and I'll tell you more about that and just a little bit uh but we were happy to be back and forth you know that little chill that you have up there\nI mean it's nothing like the Florida warmth has happened to be back in Florida as sure yes uh Columbus Day weekend [noise] does that mean anything special going on\nHaven't heard anything Johnny [laughter] now Brian I thought you were supposed to provide in Idaho and you know it's interesting\nHere Columbus Day weekend is not very big uh-huh but if you go up north where we were staying as in that area that is a big weekend for everybody there in fact a motel that we stay yet I'll give them a of a plug the Mariner Mariner is or is it right motel\nOr they were bringing an extra people for that weekend just to be able to clean the ruins and everything along because this is the last farewell I guess to summer\nAnd it's a after that a week after I think they closed down people up there on the motels and most of them pose posing the sidewalks and go to bed for all of the week in season yeah for for seven months in turn the lights on sale [laughter] and the other thing that we learn there\nIs they have a hard time getting help at this for this year\nUh there's jobs open everywhere and the the prices of people are paying for laborers and things like that\nAnd so they they've had a hard time and\nUh the where we were at the maintenance man had I guess got another job so they were\nLooking he'd been there seven years but anyway uh so that they were pulling their friends and relatives [laughter] and everybody to help them for Columbus Day weekend and said big where people just come in and spend time there [noise]\nOkay what is Columbus Day mean to us a well Brian Jodie and I were talking about a little bit\nAnd uh Columbus of course a made a number of all ages to the new world uh fourteen Ninety two fourteen Ninety three fourteen Ninety eight and then there was one more I think he made for voyages total but on the second one I think his biggest discovery as far as you and I were concerned as the pineapple ha\nHa they discovered that a in fourteen Ninety three a wide loop Guadalupe that's the ... uh and uh the Native Americans at that time were already cultivating a pineapple\nAnd making selections of sorts and so he took it back to Spain queen Isabel as well one of her favorites and I guess they groom\nUnder greenhouse conditions there probably are so\nSo anyway the pineapple ... but he discovered under plants also and I just don't have the list the ones that discovered there so that was all kind of neat\nOkay Joni do you remember the flowers that we saw when we were up north about the purple asked or remember those journey and I had this at this really neat mountain we like to go up all ... you you might figure Brian it was a little more\nYou know that okay that has good sized to it and we go up to the top of it there we have some soup ... anybody who knows who Mac red foliage on that\nBut the asteroids were blooming this mountain um mount ... ... a ... a was a ski area at one time for about Twenty years yeah I guess Jody skied on it oh yeah [laughter]\n... gear leadership is trying to you don't do much of that in Florida so that put them out as a declaration that went to do was having an out as decorations I never skied\nA do did you if you hadn't done snow skiing now here now now I mean either you're telling you order skied also right oh yeah now so she says oh yeah by his thing to do in ... uh but anyway we saw Asperger's goldenrod moms Sal via an marigolds\nAnd then we saw good tree fall color and actually as we were traveling up to the ... air\nThey kind of get deep their colors that was maples ... ensue Mac yeah all out maybe some ash also\nOut there a ... fare and uh we didn't go our normal day and you know I don't think I'm going to do and seniors next time we were going to go seniors day this year 'cause Joni is old enough to get into the fair for you in trouble down\nAgain ah it's really a great deal to fry Barry fair on seniors day because parking is free fair mission is free is the only trouble lose your bumper to bumper with everybody how everybody came yeah so on when we had to go Wednesday this year so it was less people open I'm here I'm going to pay for it next year and\nAnd Bob I've got to write one now too [laughter] and that will be on Juliet I think\nAnd I'm sure that they're doing fine need to stake him get 'em up keep them up straight\nBut or corn has it's typical problem the worms are getting into the ... year so I did spray that was spun no said last night I knew there was a few and left town\nThere's more now that I'm back in town so I finally broke down I was waiting for the wall you know the ... paper was Joanie talked about last week I think it was will come in and feed on those uh but uh they they didn't make it this time so I went and put the spin those sit on I Know it will take care of it for me\nTo spend those citizen veil and the fertile alone or in a bona fide and southern a products a bona fide it's a oh I forget the name of the product now or a dead bugs somebody's that boat but uh it's it's really caught any\nOf the other thing we have trouble and has a pepper plants I Know that uh other gardeners have contacted me about this to where the tips of the plants the leaves start to ... and everything kind of\nUm get snarled looking at the top and the plant just doesn't grow very well that is due to an era fight might and you spell that\nE. R. I. O. P. H. Y. I. D.\nEra fide might so if you're peppers are not looking good they're not growing the leaves are getting all cream cold then it's an Arab five Mike that's a problem and on peppers and they get on our planes too I mean you'll see him some time on Craig models\nAnd uh uh uh other plants so ah if you had them what I use insecticide also you need something or Nemo would do it also\nYou need a might decide these ... are so small I I think there is somewhere around one one hundred and twenty fifth of an inch in size very small\nSo air five nights on peppers are those in the main problems in in the garden as were there five nights are an insecticide of soap or Nemo should be able to help you out there without any problems\nOkay uh let's answer or um [noise]\nA text messages here if you want to Texas to three six Saito says my selling the mountains wiped out by those caterpillars lead by those black butterflies totally killed them or how can it prevent this next year\nYou know it it it's interesting that you have to decide whether you want the butterflies or ... whatever one may be doing this or they have ... on line also and you have a couple of options you can go through and pick them off by hand or you can use a product such as their aside\nA which is the bt product bacillus ... or you can use a product containing spin hosted\nUm so anyway if you have that type of problem there a snow on 'em with those caterpillars if people don't know snowing them out and that has a very colorful ... leaves on it so\nI'm a ... and you know pink and white and green but if you have those problems and you don't want the caterpillars feed on them then you use the third side and spend dosage or spend those one or the other\nA couple of ... I was thinking no last wall Hi ms coming up during our number two\nAnd he's going to be talking about we control and what am I thought was thoughts was that the weeds change out at this time of the year will start to see new types of weeds come in and some of them are edible and the journey and I've always said that if you eat the weeds in your landscape you won't have 'em any more and [laughter]\nAll of them are probably tasty but one that will be coming up pretty soon we'll be chickweed it is a little very green color a leaf we with little white flowers on it and it's actually a carnation relative because the flowers are paying\nA the ... what looked like individual pedals are actually one paddle with two portions to it and they have a lot of those little pedals with two porches but anyway chickweed is totally edible and from Peggy lenses book here which I was usually\nCook it I I I did not get a chance to eat chickweed when I took a living off the land\nA and that was a good while ago with Tony ... and uh but he brought in all different kinds of things for us to eat but he had this er here this cooked up leaves are very tender I'm Peggy land says that a little solve some butter bacon bits er vinegar\nAnd you can enjoy that where you can just add to your salads is a possibility\nI actually had a friend of mine called me up on times do you have any chickweed and she wanted it so she could get the seeds from it so she could start growing it\nSo Chiquita will be coming up it's a cool season annual type flower dies out in the springtime and the other one that's out there is Florida that need that will be coming up\nIn Florida ... the other is often called the wild radish because when you dig down into the leaves I mean to the ground or the leaves are Longate kinda scalloped when you dig down into the ground you'll find these white of O'Connor's grub looking things actually\nAre they called radishes it gives us a better way to put it\nUp but here's what you do like tree wash 'em off real good I've eaten this one here if you don't wash them off very good you get the sand in them and you've got to go through and are you clean the saying out of your teeth I guess you clean you teach at the same time and you're eating them but they have a radish labor to um soldiers that are kind of neat to white and color\nThe plane has to grow a little while uh for the new radishes the form and they will be the better sweeter ones or to get so far to bet knee a chick we too wild\nAnimals is what we talk about that just a little bit there okay let's go to a bill in Georgetown bill good morning to yeah\nGood morning sir yet but I Love that for it but it has a real nice flavor to it but like you say if you try to try to grow a cat I mean you just they disappear on your\n... I Know you just have to find them are kind of let them grow as a weed and your landscape for a wild flower however you want to call it but but it has a nice little taste is a crust taste to it it\nDoes I actually prefer over rashes 'cause it doesn't have a bitter flavor to\nYeah that's what some say and and uh you can cook I'm also but I eat them fresh and Chris is fine\nBut I don't know how you find them in quantity I mean if you do at one time that you're not going to because if you try to bring them home a grown cat\nYeah it's a it's a tough one and it has its own little environment like to grow and it's amazing you know when you don't want them or you don't like them is going to grow in your yard\nExactly a another flower that uh that I like that I Would love to have grown is the truth of the a blazing star out of that growing up and fields and stuff around here but I bring it home and they have like you say it has its own particular environment and you can't grow it\nThat's the way it is with lots of wildflowers I'll be honest with you and then now you're rightly actress is one of them are so but it's it's pretty it's attractive or does grill\nUm whatever happened to bark Tobar fest I miss it\nYou know I have not heard anything about that and the last year I think they did have something but uh they had not contacted me about it so I had no idea\nFar I missed the plant failing at all and I'm just going down the and the gardens there was a it was a nice day and I thought it was very successful and I thought it would be continuing\nYeah well you know they they've been doing a lot of construction revamping and that might have been part of the problem is oh it is an ongoing project for um for a couple of years so I don't know maybe somebody from buck power and give us a call and tell us and let us know\nAnd what other no I'm the I have a bird that come back in the in the autumn and a cat for it to come back for the winter\nOh really okay so that could be spending time with your house\nOh yeah oh yeah and in my garden if I'm not careful\n[laughter] there you go hey we got to run okay ... do you have a great gardening day per se 'cause update their from him also\nA great we'll get to you and just a little bit here and when we come back we're going to take a break but if you want to give us a call you certainly can one probably forty five lawns one eighty four or five five six seven during the sexes to three six Johnny comes up to\nTom Tom's cabin as far as talking entertainment networks\nA pretty common problem in our area is black and green stuff on outdoor surfaces described it off and it comes right back", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "07"}
