landfall so yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and ... the to give you a perspective on that\nOr they're only been three or continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in\nUh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across

mourning mourning jobs and just how bad was Michael\n... morning Gordon yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the U.S still tend to either hold serve\nOr the week and a little bit of the approach land but Michael Woods intensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning it was I was making it for [noise]\nSo yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and ... the to give you a perspective on that or they're only been three a continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was a ... this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... ... ... north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened hereby rain\n[noise] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is now just over a year or go to Georgia and spread it all of its rainy into a parts of the Carolinas\nThe Appalachians and or over the next twenty four hours it'll just blew up pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nIn the southeast Virginia and spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a sell these New England they produce or the inch rain or so on its northern plank you to a New York city Philadelphia\nBut fortunately by friday or this thing will finally be able to see will be done with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\nWell that's true you know uh you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage a of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans\nIt didn't hit Tampa or they need Houston ... or so it's a it's a relatively lower population swat in the ... still hit very hard but ah I guess if there was a small solace or leave it certainly as far as the the the the overall damaged figure from this\nOf hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nYeah why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that that shouldn't be the case you to Florida as good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\n[noise] yeah I mean they're part of it as part of it is due to becoming so intense so ah so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensifying that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this but you just quit\nWatches out a good forty eight hours ahead of time and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance but uh I think the intensity and ferocity of it uh you know I I personally did not expect the borderline get five later today so I think that may have been a factor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks well\nYou know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left the typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems on the central eastern Atlantic not to worry about it was the dean\nA there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay buried in Central America and that could be a flood threat so you don't see any us threats\nOver the next week or so but again the hurricane seasons don't go into November we still could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November I mean that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for about the last", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning
