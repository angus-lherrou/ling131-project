H. E. Z. tonight from seven to ten [noise]\nTotal access to the world\nYou are listening to America's\nWith us as the mid term elections approach America's electronic voting systems are more vulnerable than ever what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times Kim what kind of security do we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to band aids security there were really not and I'm much a different shape than we weren't together sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aids by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's that ... prior to that extent it reached out to states and it I'm offered scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um the service like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe jets will do the remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability that are none of our own ways that we know about that um all kinds of bats are valuable\nAnd it will tell the states where it sounds a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch to them\nSo they did that to a few states before um the shit out of the ... and then they've done that to more states more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet they think this tend to not getting at the core ...\nThey're supposedly not connected to the ... not getting at the voting machines at all it's not looking at the core vulnerabilities there and it's not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system to sit in a county headquarters\nUh there used to program that voting machines and they're also used to calculate the votes so these are actually the most critical and not the Internet they think this them\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence or are you saying there are there some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our elections isn't the hackers for let's going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want letters to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produced paper trail\nOn and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't those\nWho is you point out there's really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\n[laughter] um yes so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine for um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems uh the problem is is that um states the county election officials are not looking at that paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cybersecurity journalists also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times entitled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\n[noise] oh we got vulnerable because of the reactions to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nIn that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad you that that took you know the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington is she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballot that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cybersecurity

thought\nWould never defaults and repackage them into securities to make them seem risk lists with time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg in chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use it\nWe've got to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in prices they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we it's individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well I'm an Asian countries so maybe fewer people need homes\nBut also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who could buy a house I and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess those that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing and so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted\nYou don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business [laughter]\nThose are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise] sure you have your ... there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nBut people want is to not start the next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Coogler Facebook the level of new business is being formed is actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nWe're speaking with Greg it chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or are they related\nI think it helps explain why the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat is to say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate and fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects are less likely to you got to bust into recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off [laughter]\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer\nAnd I think those are the circumstances by about which the risk of start to grow\nAnd if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis but you know risque but kinda like goes away to sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill encounter the barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now\nSome of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like heavily indebted companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you some sense still have risk out there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\n... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can send us on Facebook you can follow us on Twitter

senior writer at the Weekly Standard who says her comments bring up the debate about voting by mail versus showing up in a private booth in a place like a school Eric step is up\nIt's one of those things where to the extend it happens at all it's a threat to you know basic democracy and we have a system\nWorks where you can't have that that kind of anecdote happen at all everybody's got a perfect privacy when they're in the voting booth\nDon't have perfect privacy when they're voting by mail so why would you want to switch from the voting booth to voting by mail that convenience factor to me is not outweigh the risk of even one person being denied their on extra vote ...\nMrs Clinton I think made it sound like women are weak and powerless at times when it was of this stuff\nYou know there may be some abusive or men out there who take it out on on the women in their lives if they don't vote the way they want\nAnd ah to the extent that that happens even if it's just a few instances it's protecting against by going to the ballot box um and as as for\nThe general notion that women are too weak to stand up for themselves so I think you're you're spot on that most women in our lives um I have a a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that

she was not making the claim that vote by mail is responsible [noise]\nUm but I didn't connect the dots in the sense that\nIf there are any women who are being pressured to vote one way or another the

Rachel what are you hearing\nI talked to a bunch of workers on who you know expressed on you know\nFor ... Strasse elite problem you know lots of lots of issues around they're they're scheduled on worker advocacy groups are definitely pushing for that um but it you know it's unclear if these policies can really talk all of workers scheduling problem\nOr just think I Wonder if some of them might complain they\nCould to get robbed of overtime hours for example of something changed\nThat much is a concern but I just think that some of the laws are not really necessarily directed at\nThe end of the biggest pain point that employee that we come from talking to them and on and so one thing is that a lot of workers are worried about not getting enough hours on because you're making an hourly wage so if you're not getting enough hours you might not have enough money one week for your rent or your car or food\nAnd ... do try to give workers more our some of them have stipulation that say that employers have to go to current employees and offer them more hours before hiring additional employees\nUm it's unclear if I'm at the laws are really making a big difference in terms of total number of hours for workers\nRight so who who's doing what I Know you're given McDonald's McDonald's example\nThey talk to a McDonald's franchisee in Oregon um where the law going into effect in July on and he talked about kind of how hard it's been for his store managers\nUm a lot of extra time for paperwork she has an all come to the head off at now for a multi hour session where they make their schedules together\nOn a lot of stress in terms of what do I do if a worker called out check\nUm [noise] a lot of stress around what do I do if they get to the at the end of someone shift I used to just like kind of\n... they would say and they would say and I would pay them for that time but now if they stay more than a half hour over that's considered a schedule changed and I have to pay an additional fee in addition to just their hourly wage that they would be earning [laughter] just a lot more for managers to think about\nOh we're speaking with Wall Street journal management reporter Rachel finds that she's got a piece titled new laws aimed to make work hours more predictable does the uh if some of these laws go into effect it does the size of the business matter the number of employees\nYes on there really aimed at bigger businesses so it depends on the law but a lot of them are like over five hundred employees or you have to have a certain number of locations in the United states so we're not really talking about small businesses here\nSo the status of some of them like you mentioned a New York city to the whole state of Oregon or does this seem to have bipartisan support or is it not gotten that far yet\n[laughter] I mean we're definitely things crop up in the areas where we tend to see more progressive legislation especially workplace legislation pop up somewhere like Seattle where they've already had a big minimum wage crush on you know area that we're we're seeing kind of knew paid sick leave laws\nOn like I said New York Seattle San Francisco Emeryville, California um these are definitely cropping up and and more kind of liberal outpost\nAnd then you you gave an example to of a gap that has gone through with this what I think experience maybe some growing pains but results have been favorable\nTo I mean there are a lot of companies that are just doing this of their own accord whether they see the writing on the wall that this legislation is coming whether they think it's the right thing to do for workers\nUm whether they think they're some a recruitment retention benefits for that and some companies are kind of coming out of this before the law's impact them and to back\nOn had kind of a big pilot study where they implemented scheduling change it\nAnd all their stores and then try to that group that kind of went even further and they they did the positive results they saw an increase in sales and and productivity\nOn and so yes like some of the growing pains that we see from the Donald franchisee for example you know hopefully that will ease with time and they're all you know people say there will be positive benefits\nHere's

are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg hip chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\n... uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk letter was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in price they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's an regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example like it used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes and it's expensive so far it's more like a million and there are several reasons for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand of the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing and so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted\nYou don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your bagels here in your ... there but it really kind of the exception you know ... it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nBut people want is to not start next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook level of new business is being formed does actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially a people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nOr speaking with Greg it cheap economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or they're not related\nI think it helps explain why the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bold mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat is to say everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people ... and fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that some of the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects you're less likely to hit a bust in a recession [laughter] now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off [laughter]\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer\nAnd I think those are the circumstances by about which the rich start to grow\nAnd if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risque but kinda like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill ever encountered a barrier tried to find a way around it and ... and we happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like heavily indebted companies\nThose are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you some sense still have risk out there is just informed that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence

senior writer at the Weekly Standard who says her comments bring up the debate about voting by mail versus showing up in a private booth in a place like a school Eric set this up\nIt's one of those things where to the extend it happens at all it's a threat to you know basic democracy\nAnd we have a system that works where you can't have that ... that kind of anecdote happen at all\nEverybody's got a perfect privacy when they're in the voting booth people don't have perfect privacy when they're voting by mail so why would you want to switch from the voting booth to voting by mail it convenience factor to me does not outweigh the risk of even one person being denied their honest vote and\nMrs Clinton I think made it sound like women or weaken powerless at times when it was of this stuff\nYou know there may be some abusive or men out there who take it out on on the women in their lives if they don't vote the way they want\nAnd ah to the extent that that happens even if it's just a few instances it's protecting against by going to the ballot box um and as as for\nThe general notion that women are too weak to stand up for themselves so I think you're you're spot on that most women in our lives um I have a a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that the argument for the mail in ballots or this is it's an effort to get more participation\n[noise] well you know it's actually been an effort in in large part to get more participation because of making it convenient but in particular I'm making it\nMore convenient for liberal voters um this has been a quest by the left to get a ... vote by mail because so much of their effort to turn on turning out the vote\nAnd they can go and make sure everybody gets their mail in ballot and take a lot of times when when there's a polling on a given day at a given polling place there's only so many bands you can send out to get people to the voting booth [noise]\nUm but vote by mail gives you the opportunity to get more usually I'm liberal constituencies to vote\nFor him to turn out the vote a there is more important to Democrats aren't there more register democratic voters\n... turning out the vote one way or another generally helps um democratic candidates I'm In part because a lot of what the B I'm democratic candidates rely on our get out the vote effort\nUm and there's only so much you can do when there's one voting day but\nIf you have a month or two months of voting by mail\nI'm available you can turn out a lot more of the voters who will be discouraged to vote by inconvenience so the more convenient you can make it more likely you are to get voters to turn out who are otherwise it deterred by inconvenient\n... just a a I don't I don't think I've heard pushback on this with regards to these comments from Mrs Clinton is is this is like a

is she was not making the claim that vote by mail is responsible [noise]\nUm but I didn't connect the dots in the sense that\nIf there are any women who are being pressured to vote one way or another the only way they could possibly be actually pressured is if they don't have the secrecy of the ballot box available to them and combine that with the growth of vote by mail and I think that there's a

getting enough hours on because you're making an hourly wage so if you're not getting enough hours you might not have enough money one week for your rent or your car or food\nAnd ... do try to give
