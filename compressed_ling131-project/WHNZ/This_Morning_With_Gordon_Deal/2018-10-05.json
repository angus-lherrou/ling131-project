the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factor so Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nOr in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races were pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee has been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling underway and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so that has at least for the time being\nBeen a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their\nDesire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous pulling the Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans on Republicans in a lot of cases seem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nRight so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on ...\nOr a big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Brett Kavanaugh her Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nA who are now in the upper single digits or in terms of his lead and the polling average is a you know that was a race it's been closed since been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely to vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen a I think we've seen also ah the school has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill\nA declared fairly early that she was going to vote against Kavanaugh she didn't vote for Gore such a Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls still there was a recent CNN poll that did have her up three\nBut in the point averages he's clinging to have a very narrow lead and this could be a a race for its influence to but by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with the Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a very political process and it's become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections were Democrats are already pretty energized because they just like President Trump they dislike what Republicans are doing a Washington there seems to them like another power grab a bite narrow Republican majority is\nAt a at a president that was the popular vote\nFor Republicans would mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump to the first place was rewarded conservative judges who cared about who was controlling the Supreme Court but didn't want to be in school we didn't see that particular to go to a liberal Anthony Kennedy she go to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and toys sixteen and so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term election so it really is something that energizes both sides to a certain extent\nWith Jim Jim mantle

you know are in this new moment where social media is ubiquitous and people can Google you you make a bad show to take a picture you shouldn't have taken at a party that can come up\nA years later and

know that's ridiculous you know give these people a chance\nThat you can be rehabilitated people make mistakes and so now you can't ask that question um until you're ready to offer the person a job and the thinking is by that time he's got a sense of what they have to offer you met them you've gotten to know them a little bit like seven\nAnd so you might be um you know you might give them a little bit more leeway\nIn looking at their path and their attorneys that you know often will write letters on behalf of of client saying you know this person said you know a good guy or a good woman
