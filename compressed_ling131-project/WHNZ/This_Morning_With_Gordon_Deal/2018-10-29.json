S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise]\nUm you know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when the uh you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious that\nThinking about is is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed regularly wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts and so\nYou know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without a some sort of specific reason\nI'm obviously you know I'm sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's awesome in le ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming you get a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seem like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that that technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise] um and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS\nAnd FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think um I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far or sent to the the mail to the post postal service and so\nUm you know the service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know there's just a value is just so significant\nThat it's tough to stop it and that is wild and mentally I'm you know the less than the last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities to stop these also the private and private companies are I think it will really taking a close eye on these types of packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a Ted Kaczynski [noise] you know it's like Eighteen years to track down how where he was of course in those packages for of course spread out over a much longer period of time in the ones we're talking about here but I Do think that you know

by the justices may not answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happens with abortion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways they can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding\nEt cetera and then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they I'm I'm allowed them but in more cases than not they strike them down based on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent so those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do\nAs much as they possibly can in these cases his swat them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we are going to let that stand so that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah in other words the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those\nAnd the cases it takes her either important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts those are the federal appeals courts the level right below the Supreme Court\nAh and they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue\nAnd one or two or three Supreme Court ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this so a lot of these cases coming to the court on abortion now do not reflect those kinds of circuits splits the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they're directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court to simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled can stand Supreme Court just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court\nAnd might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything that might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today's Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well please\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another let's say because it's often the case\nThat anti abortion plaintiffs are those bringing the case or want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want us a a a twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw a certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken buckets of particular reasons like the sex or or or the disability if the fetus the court the Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting\nBecause it basically has to because the lower courts are\n... of course ledge because legislatures in courts and don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts and that doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took a on the subject of the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know\nHarassing people outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and seven it had to do with partial birth abortion\nAnd then in two thousand and six tea and just a couple of years ago it had to do with the Texas law that was restricting clinics restricting providers\nThanks

S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise]\nUm you know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about is is that they're just dropping this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight it's actually that's what's happening and I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts in so [noise] you know for the handlers at the shipping companies\nWhat they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without a some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that's put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened it's suddenly ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing or you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS\nAnd FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think um I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail through the post the postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went through a screener to begin with um then you know there's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the last and last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities stop these also the private and private companies are I think it will really ticket ... these types of facts just\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know ... you know it's like Eighteen years to track down or where he was of course in those packages were of course spread out over a much longer period of time than the ones we're talking about here but I Do think that you know it's getting

around the country I'm the chief from being at the Republican incumbent in a district there is retiring [noise] um and so you've got a battle between a long time Republican in the state law or almost became a governor a few years ago\nAnd a brand new political candidate first time a candidate who is a pediatrician from the area and it's where she would play on districts across the country where there are these suburban women voters who are ... that risk of losing and the thing about this district in particular I Try to Seattle is\nIs a GOP when we use those voters at a faster clip then um\nThe district was recently redrawn and faster than rural voters can keep up with the Republican\nI'm so there is a bit of that but also the Republicans in the suburbs I'm voting for Barbara updates like heart before and if they can keep them in the fold then that's where the Democrats have a problem in this district\n... let me come above polling indicated that things are right now\nThere's internal polling on both sides that show that it's just it's just a couple times so both sides are convinced that it's going to come down to turn out and you see that playing out across the country where\nUm it's really about who can mobilize the voters are the most and we're seeing in polls that a national polls that Democrats are more energized than Republicans um and that's kind of trend cycle\nTired so uh the Democrat who's running your who's the pediatrician that's uh this is Kim Schrier\nThat is ... okay so her she's been really hitting hard on healthcare stuff\nThat's right I mean she uses it as a direct appeal to people who are nervous about their health care costs that seeing their costs to go up\nUm and ah who have pre existing conditions I'm and she feels from directly as a pediatrician in their community um she's got a thousand patients that are in that district\nUm she feels from after type ... diabetic herself as someone who has a preexisting condition [noise]\nUm and uh he's got his power for pledged to support that provision of Obamacare but it's a very direct appeal um that uh Democrats in Washington state and in the capital believe make her buried a compelling candidate\nAnd speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Joshua ... and his piece is called outside Seattle ... election battle between the countryside and new ... the eighth district there the Republican Dino Rossi his his issue is what do you think he's been driving in particular\nTaxes he's actually one of the Republican from they passed the expo last year\nThey thought that it was going to be the number one issue on the campaign trail and below the actually because the district the avalanche of feels that he\nCan actually be on message on this and he has tried to be and that is number one thing now in canvassing with some of his tears and that is the thing that they push that on his fires that has a stump speeches\nUm and the the\nThe power of this district is will that be enough to keep 'em some of these Republicans in the fold or will they reflect to send a check on Donald Trump to wash\nCars this is a long held Republican district\nIt has was drawn in the Nineteen eighties after the sense of um in Nineteen eighty and it has never sent a Democrat to Washington or um but even though it has that can keep it in congressional races tend to vote Democrat for president Hillary Clinton the Donald Trump there by about three\nAnd a mistrial or you said is getting support actually from Seattle orange juice and not have voters right\nRight it's really interesting I was trying I was out there and I was trying to talk to people that live in a person who lived in a district and they kept telling me they were from Seattle and that's common um you see that in other races where people um even sometimes cross state lines forget it to get into it because they volunteer and money [noise]\nUm so this is just another example of that where people in Seattle you know their districts are reliably democratic and if they want to be a part of the blue wave\nOf what they think will be a blue wave I keep hearing about it on TV and the closest way they can get probably ... to go to the swing district which is the only pops up or if I'm ready to buy a cook book report in Washington state so there's a lot of the house\nIs Joshua that's Wall Street

reliably\nConservative Supreme Court or knocking on the buildings bronze doors but after he historically partisan confirmation by the justice is made on answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard wool says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happened to the ocean is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways that can be restrictions on the timing or the method where the funding\nEt cetera and then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they I'm I'm allowed them but in more cases than not they strike them down based on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent so those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do\nAs much as they possibly can and these cases has swat them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand [noise] so that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those\nAnd the cases it takes a writer important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts should the federal appeals court for the lover right below the Supreme Court [noise]\nUh and they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts in those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue\nAnd one or two or three Supreme Court ruled in another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases come into court on abortion now you're not a reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they're directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courtship rules can stand report just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides\nAnd the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year he doesn't want to do anything it might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today's Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well pleased\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another [laughter] let's say because it's often the case\nThat anti abortion plaintiffs are those bringing the case or want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want to ... a a a twenty week limit on abortion or we want to outlaw a certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken cuts of particular reasons like sex or or or the disability if the fetus the court the Supreme Court only gets involved that says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting\nBecause it basically has to because the lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts\nAnd that doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took a on this subject to the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know\nHarassing people outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth abortion and then in two thousand and six teen just a couple of years ago it had to do with a Texas law that was restricting clinics and restricting providers\nRich USA today's
