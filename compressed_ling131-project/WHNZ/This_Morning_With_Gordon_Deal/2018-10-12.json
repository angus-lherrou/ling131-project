... thanks for joining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura could just do the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher and it's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I covered with all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful or slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nI'm with that said though I think we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense of it but it has been in the past\nAnd I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw a huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think buyers are already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura or the high rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost nobody anymore was a strong incentive tree flab [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual or if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing\nUp price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more expensive markets um but I went to some of these hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more about price productions\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high\nUm but I Do think for a virus that just got exhausted I'm far from a bidding war Roseanne cash buyers and the real frenzy that we've had in the market that\nHas really cold and so I think for buyers want a little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices download a bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nFortunate the program has brought you buy Brooklyn and did you know

C. [noise] and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical a situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [noise]\nAnd um so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story and fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits at some of these districts initially going into it to save money or say wow you know what it really does help for the kids get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know there are noticing fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you were shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know at some of these districts they had already met the minimum\nUh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already feet in the hours that there is just basically add in time at the end of that day\nThat each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\nYes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nKnow how many days you're in school they just want you you know the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals a day to the nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during that a school day period\nSo a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts are use for day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's all you know outlets don't take kind of a mini vacation if they want to you know get away for an extended

joining\nUs this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura could just do the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nFor point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is [noise] uh at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places in New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even\nOr a more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's eight pains threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the fix for than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful or slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nWith that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense of it but it has been in the past\nAnd I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw a huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think a buyer they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura or the high rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below a where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had more or less a strong incentive to find out\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing\nUp price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more expensive markets um but I went to somebody hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a\nNew York we're seeing or hearing more and more about price productions\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high\nUm but I Do think for a virus that just got exhausted I'm far from a bidding war Roseanne cash buyers and the real frenzy that we've had in the market that\nHas really cold and so I think for buyers who want a little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices downward a bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nFortunate the program is brought you buy Brooklyn and did you know the Brooklyn in sheets or name the

state\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that\nUm their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of ... workers are used to doing that\nThat has kind of shifted into the you know non ... regular payments cycles um you know every day workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't the top and for me\nSo that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and it was kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nOr do you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of\nThe national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that doesn't benefit for their workers some of these companies um are you know that that allow you to outsource both are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often\nSo we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nNext to Maria Maria ... of marketwatch thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWere shot at Los Alamos in dollars

really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural

attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story and fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money are saying wow you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know there are noticing fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they

school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in
