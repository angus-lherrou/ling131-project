there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon ... unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected are an essential adjusted\nBut project it back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment at our country and we've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so [noise] uh the economy continues to grow a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are

economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress cause I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nUh well for one that's of average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about how ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is\nI said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good places well with it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector you're working on so [noise]\nUm for the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that a ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world\nAh and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left [noise]\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does that extend to another words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nAh but I

oh ... yeah exactly and so there's a whole bunch of different stuff like that and the system so the question is can we find a way\nTo remove duplication of regular regulations that don't really matter that are insignificant [noise] and then you get rid of those regulations and you just allow it to make it easier for companies to sell things a back and forth across the border\nUh this thing it's been kind of you know that that whole thing starts in stops all over the years hasn't really done much for the last couple of years because there was a new government can't ... the U.S [noise] so the idea is you know out of conference this fall to try to jumpstart the process and get you know businesses rain gauge the government channel what do we do it\nRegulations that have basically a costing our economy money ... ...\n... we're speaking with Alex Panetta from political he's the editor of political pro Canada has written a piece in titled behind the scenes with Trump and Trudeau\nHow they made a nice uh you represent a couple of times too like digs in public speeches at each other across the border could that actually hamper things or is that something that's starting to\nTone down now how do you see it\nWell okay so here's the thing I think that President Trump deserves a lot of credit for some of the things she got an agreement you've got things but frankly a rock Obama would have liked but at what cost right because what you've done is essentially Neal publicly beat up on a smaller country next door\nA tugging the little things and in the meantime so the President Trump's approval rating of St Paul's that put it as low as ... percent getter\nWhen you're when you're allowed him to say\nThere's a lot you can do or that other country and the other countries will be happy to do with you I Can't really ask them any favors\nAnd so you know take this compound it around the world so the steel tariffs you know you is this big stick to try to get changes it might work it really might work but on the other hand it might also in second eyes every single country in the world and make you make them less likely to help you or do things with you a going forward [noise]\nSo that's the ... right so the you know Obama's approach to Trans Pacific partnership for instance was using the chart\nTry to gently bring countries along to the U. S. fold get some buying an agreement on this is how we should do trade and this is how we should deal with state owned enterprises that we do to deal with data protections and to try to eventually get China to join that sort of international order\nTrump's approaches I what I'm ... out on you until you get what I Want and the Chinese are going to do to [laughter]\nIt might work I don't know we'll

says this internal tension carries risk Stephanie what are we seeing\nWhat actually what you've seen is as the mid term elections get closer and closer in November that Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken off five more than even the supporters of it expected like they were they taught us that something more for the twenty twenty\nPresidential elections and it kind of emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policies such as Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrats\nCrash especially in conservative states that are like well if we do this\nWe could alienate some of our more kind\nOf a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle and the debate is playing out right now boy who supports this\nAh well I'm ... this is obviously the idea was first I'm kind of brought forward by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really at their Medicare for all that is that single payer\nHas now at this point I garnered um sixteen or actually Fifteen correspond church because Al Franken drunk or on there and um they are now Medicare

example who ran who didn't fully come out in support of Medicare for all you see people like I'm In West Virginia\nWho are they a mansion who is um you know taking a much more cautious approach a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do is fix the Affordable CARE Act and build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm debating with the bathwater\n... speaking with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour ... some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan itself play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that's a good question when you when the parents go out and ask\nPeople voters about Medicare for all the support a strikingly high around Seventy percent but yeah that Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interests that brings Sanders plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think up single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all is an even among the Democrats\nThere is widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare as we want the option even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind

behind\nThe numbers of the latest jobs report from the government the unemployment rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at bank rate dot com ... what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to the air and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nWe believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially full employment in our country and I've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so [noise] uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would have expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the are hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with more cameras senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report um\nDoes the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kind of waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nUh well for one a that's an average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about how ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as for informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is\nI said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well with it when it comes to looking for jobs there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector you're working on so [noise]\nUm for the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer but it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend another words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years\nOr does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impacts of the tax cut begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably twenty twenty

Wall Street journal NBC News poll rated young people and Hispanics as the Democrats least interested in voting in next month's midterm elections here's Wall Street journal national political reporter

Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that are as we know from twenty sixteen and past election\nTend not to show up in numbers proportionate to their share of the population really admit trouble elections when turnout a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so ah the ... campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what

of evidence hurting our data to show that that is going to be the case\nAnd it was the interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than we are in fact one of the country I think in twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of touch with Spanish for the Republican compared to twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are surely gerrymandered too many Democrats as possible in them and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for local races\nOr you know and so that the

he'll tell you that nobody's going to ask for their God and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having it at all to hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the county is that\nIt is that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C is campaigning and uh in February when I was down there he was

participated horror because there's been a little reason to court because Texas has been so Republican uh one of the things that he says on the campaign trails that he doesn't believe that Texas has a red state but it's a non voting state or you can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is his house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so
