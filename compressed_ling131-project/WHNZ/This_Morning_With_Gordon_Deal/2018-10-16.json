Conan record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive\nAnd uh you know one thing that Senator Cruz says not rely on in the past but that he was able to rely on and get help with was the establishment kind of coming in and and helping them out you know the vice president raising money or the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down in campaign for him\nOr so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the quintessential outsider candidate gotta get some help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the rates and make it to you know give him an edge down there and check the\n... and how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nInteresting with what I think you'd probably see from Ted Cruz's supporters his hardcore supporters as they would argue that you know through the conservatives firebrand but he always was a guy he's still you know he has been abandoned his values one of one of the folks that I talked to from Texas to tell me it's actually\nYou know Ted Cruz is changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate you'd see a collapse on his support uh and that's not really what's happening is that he's just not helping the more collaborative of a bomb thrower at a you know it's benefited him and and I don't think he lost supporters because of that\nOne of the uh as you said the pieces campaign wobble earlier this year uh why is that what it would have Mr O'Rourke do for his part is one of the Senate campaign\nI think the thing about that orchids he taught us money and he basically out of the ... um you know he only crazy amounts of money he was holding these rallies that\nYou know thousands of people who were going to and and he he kind of sparked sort of a little bit of a movement um and he was on TV before entering the without bending Ted Cruz MTV and not very surprising a Democrat can be outstanding and outrage in at a Republican in Texas especially wanted as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so\nI just started a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement what's real and packed and I I think his campaign and how the compact just kicked into high gear towards\nThe end of summer and going into the fall kind of realizing that they ate the challenge and and you know they they step it up and call in shows that that Ted Cruz of weeding pretty clear he's not running away with it but he's got a healthy pretty safely\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to take it and the gear they were ... thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter well that is just an absolute record\nFor speaking with James Oregon Senate campaign reporter for Politico who's written a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz stand it down some of the sharp edges on his personality I could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act high profile Republican tide turkey on the attack\nAnd you remember famously Ted Cruz shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got to the Senate you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really use any sort of an outside\nPressure force on Republicans in fact the capital to force their head and he did exactly force their hands to the chagrin of his colleagues and and folks in the capital and to the the new time around in twenty Seventeen he was you know meeting with Republican senator working very closely with his colleague he wasn't there and\nBombed up that he tried to get a and you know they were unsuccessful but they were unsuccessful you know not because of Senator Cruz because it involves a bomb the way that he had previously and\nYou were quoted a Republican consultant in your story who said something to the effect of that a federal federal Rourke had become like Ted Cruz of this election almost like he was taking a page from cruises playbook\nIn a sense it's it's funny you know until you get some pushback from Republicans and you've heard of that are working outside or because he's been in politics are more than a decade in and out of the house I'm honored and but he's he's running this kind of campaign against you know the average met again politics as usual against the way things are usually done in Washington\nSo he he's

keeping up the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions are competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores [noise]\nUh but it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of employers will the high cost base it would have been hard for them to survive in this very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what are the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now that they sort of live in fear\nI think so I'm In the stores have not been a popular anyway so they've been an actor but ... encouraging those places will be we developed a maybe from the store maybe for other purposes of\nGyms and restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise]\nUm so ... even Amazon Amazon started to open stores though so that's purpose will be the least space will be repurposed but it's going to be a big drag them a lot of them they currently have a total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to this this is probably liquidate the mall for about eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's\nMoney answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well they're doing a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk up I Know exactly what it says no cashiers whatsoever so [noise]\nUm and they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it ... but they're doing a much more strategic way a much more limited inventory in select locations fears just got too big and had too much of a jury of too many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\nThe products are good and and yeah so I think you're going to fail incredible low prices for appliances electronics and clothes and all the things that fears office yes I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is good tech sales away from other traditional retailers\nWill probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from other for your stores\nWill we still know the Sears brand than a year five years and no\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example ... fears are bought that for four hundred million dollars um they've got somewhere but most of the brands have been sold out so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear over to our\nNext Jordan Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man\n\nMore of a program is brought to you by lights dream if you have a

twenty people\nThe American Red Cross continues its we're providing emergency shelter and supplies to residents displaced\nWe're joined now live by Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross skill six days after explain what your folks are dealing with their\nWell\nFirst of all Gordon thanks so much for having me on the show and and a half to say our hearts go out to the people that were impacted by hurricane Michael it's really quite extraordinary storm and uh it's very difficult on the ground\nUm homes are gone schools there on business they're gone a power is still coming back a bet a lot of people are without\nUm communication towers came down there still debris and some of the road so it's a challenging environment and we're doing what ever we possibly can\nTo help people out um we have about Thirteen hundred volunteers in the affected area and they're twenty three shelters that are open with about Fifteen hundred people living in them um there were ten thousand people AT T coil\nBut we also have um at Seventy five emergency response vehicles and they're driving around the affected area and giving people hot meals and um water and lots of hug and so far we've already served about a hundred twenty five thousand meals and snacks so\nIt's a big operation um are volunteers are amazing I never uh never get used to have generous they are just going to the gym made me\nFeel for how long they'll be there at this point\nWell we cannot leave until the last person in a shelter plays poker and of course we have um a number of people\nThat are employees and volunteers that live in the impacted area because we're in about three thousand counties across the country\nSo um they never leave they they don't pack up and go home because they are home and um you know we we just stay until people find a place you go we still have about ... people in shelters in the Carolinas from Hurricane Florence\n... is that right yeah yeah\nAnd so you know this is a difficult period I I think generally speaking like stories now starting to get told right the media begins to pull away from affected areas as they start to focus on other breaking news or does this become more difficult for the volunteers\n[noise] well um it becomes more difficult really for everyone um because\nUh you know we need health and we always need volunteers um you know those those um Thirteen hundred volunteers that I talked about they work two or three weeks shit for\nUm twelve hours a day seven days a week so they go home we have to refresh unlike new volunteers so it can it it does become a bit discouraging when people think they've been forgotten not only the ears but the people impacted\nAnd of course everything the American Red Cross does\nIs because the ... the American public whether they're giving us financial gifts or a donating their time to volunteer and I'm sadly Gordon um we had a a cancel a lot of blood drive\nBetween a Hurricane Florence and hurricane Michael because a lot of them were scheduled in those areas\nAnd um we were looking at a bit of a blood shortage right now that we're also encouraging people to donate blood if they're willing to give the gift of life\n... speaking this morning with Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross what's the what's the greatest need at this point is that the blood is it a more volunteers money\nUm yes yet and yet\nUm you know what we're really focusing on is providing food shelter water um we're helping people figure out how to navigate through this you know some people\nJust barely got out of their homes and they need their a prescription to treat till they might have lost their\nTheir eye glasses so the red cross does all that and um we really could use help as you said um\nYou know if people want to donate blood or if they want to become Red Cross volunteers and by the way they don't have to volunteer in a big disaster like I just described how we respond to sixty four

six weeks there was some concern that Senator Cruz is facing a little bit of trouble from federal ... you know the the massive democratic superstar Conan\nRecord sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive\nAnd ah you know one thing that Senator Cruz says not rely on in the past but that he was able to rely on and get help with was the party establishment kind of coming in and and helping them out you know the vice president raising money or the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down to campaign for him [noise]\nAh so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the quintessential outsider candidate gotta get help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the race and make it to you know give him an edge on that in

know he's the conservatives are banned but he always was got he still hasn't abandoned his values one of one of the folks that I talked to from Texas comments actually\nYou know Ted Cruz the changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate you'd see a collapse of his support uh and that's not really what happened and it's more that he's just relying on helping the more collaborative he's from a bomb thrower and that uh you know it's benefited him and I don't think he lost supporters because of that\nOne of the ah as you said the pieces campaign ... earlier this year or ... why is that what to do what Mr O'Rourke do for his part is for the Senate campaign\nI think the thing about the federal workers he taught us money and he basically out of the ...\nUm you know he only crazy amounts of money he was holding these rallies that\nYou know thousands of people who were going to and and he he kind of sparked sort of a little bit of a movement um and he was on TV before entering the without bending and cruise on TV and not very surprising a Democrat could be outstanding and outrage in at a Republican and pack that they want it as ... elements Ted Cruz and and so\nI just started a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement was real impact and I think his campaign and not looking from Texas kicked into high gear\nTowards the end of summer and going into the fall kind of realized that they were challenging and you know they step it up and call in shows that that Ted Cruz if we didn't pretty clear he's not running away with it but he's got a healthy or he said lead\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to take it and again they were ... thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter while at is just an absolute record\nFor St James Oregon Senate campaign reporter for political news wrote a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz sand it down some of the sharp edges on his personality by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act Republicans by turkey on it for a pack\nAnd your number famously Ted Cruz shut down the government over Obamacare when he starts ... you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really sort of outside\nPressure force on Republicans in fact the capital to force their

first news this morning with all the\nExtra\nSpending time with is the country's largest retailer at one point Sears has filed for bankruptcy around\nSince Eighteen eighty six\nIt's been around right don't end by the great recession and more recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now watch here's Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead well\nIt's going to be a big downer for the holiday season or they're going to be liquidating lots of stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores and then all the merchandise is able to get a dumped on the market right in the middle of a holiday season\nThey have about Seventy thousand workers good number of those will be laid off just kind of what happened earlier this year with Toys R us just got off the presses the whole retail market\nSo with Sears bill lessons here or what they missed out going on line with\nThe way through high yeah they took on a huge amount of that they had five point six billion dollars in that are on Monday they have a hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment they couldn't make which is what kind of spurred\nA the a chapter eleven filing um they had too many assets the SARS all all the stores all over the place that would not kept up well\nPeople just didn't go to theaters anymore and they they lost to Amazon but they lost of other places as well yeah Home Depot\nAnd various other people took their their market share has been around for a hundred and twenty five years I mean they had a real run at its peak the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share and two thousand seven down to panic so yeah so it it was one of the great American companies that just didn't keep up with the times\nWhat what could have saved them as they say I don't know it's starting in the eighties maybe they were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively or keeping up the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions are competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores [noise]\nUh but it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of employers all the high cost space it would've been hard for them to survive with is very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what's the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now that they sort of live in fear\nI think so I mean the stories of not popular anyway so they've been an actor but an addendum to encourage those places will be we developed\nA maybe the store maybe for other purposes I mean there's gyms and restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise]\nUm so ... even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be the space will be repurposed but it's going to be a big drag on a lot of malls I'm currently have a total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to the holidays is probably liquidate them off about eight hundred and twenty large stores\nOr that will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's money answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well they're doing a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk out but I Know exactly what it says no cashiers whatsoever so\nUm and they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it is an irony but they're doing is much more strategic way with much more limited inventory in select vocation fears just got too big and that too much of a jury and too many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\n[noise] yeah I mean the products are good and and yeah so I think you're going to say when credible low prices for appliances electronics and clothes and all things have fears office yeah so I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is going to take cells away from other traditional retailers\nWill probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from all the stores\nWill we still know the Sears brand than a year or five years now\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example ... fears are bought that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some brands but most of the brands have been sold out so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear\nThis audio is for your review for ...

road so it's a challenging environment and we're doing what ever we possibly can\nTo help people out um we have about Thirteen hundred volunteers in the affected area and they're twenty three shelters that are open with about Fifteen hundred people living in them\nAnd there were ten thousand people at AT T while\nWe also have um\nAt Seventy five emergency response vehicles and they're driving around the affected area and giving people\nA hot meal than um water and lots of hug and so far we've already served about a hundred twenty five thousand meals will snack so\nIt's a big operation um are volunteers hair amazing I never uh never get used to have generous they are I just and it can make me\nAny feel for how long they'll be there at this point\nWell we cannot leave until the last
