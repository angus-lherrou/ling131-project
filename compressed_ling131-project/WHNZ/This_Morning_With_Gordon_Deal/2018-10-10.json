an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump\nThere's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president as an avid watcher of Fox News and particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening sometimes references Lou Dobbs from over at the Fox business channel and so the general public notice this\nUntil have lobbyists and DC and lobbyist had found that in effect give way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV programs so that's what we're seeing happening more and more\nWild looks like a fern what example whose airing what\nWill we took a look at the story now because there is a big fight that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are savoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been\nUm advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and then groups and also oppose that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same programs\nAs you know to be influenced by them\nWhat we can see is that he does sometimes directly after an ad up pops up on TALK on this happened to win a group of a\nUS Steel workers with advertising during Fox and friends in March you know as the ad came up the president started talking about the issue suggesting that he had seen the ad\nUm and then sort of on the other side here if you remember to last year billionaire Tom's tire who's constantly and fights with the president has started an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted that and tweeted about it right away\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong viewership um during this administration\nThe viewership has raised and and and so have the ad rates [laughter] and ah we've actually seen some ...\nYou know noticed that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know\nOut in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads and maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president\nHas expressed a dislike for programs on on those two channels [laughter] there's there's no debate that at least\nThey're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him\nWell that ah that sounds\nI guess along the lines of what the guy Kevin ... from the group need to impeach how he feels like you just suspect that the president's watching and knows he can targeting with with like a little elbow and the ribs gone to bed\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting here the president has been\nA very disparaging of Saturday Night live as a show that's not funny any longer and one that he says he doesn't watch but there's some

are\nOf the possibility of voting in Georgia it's increased dramatically in Kabul digits way higher than the population has increased over the last two years\nSo as one observer or expert in your story said just because there's an increase in registration for a particular group that does not equal turn out all the time\nOr exactly so but now the battle becomes turnout so talking to various experts that I spoke to regarding\nThese bill they say look what's what's it just moves hurdle so we'd have more people registered to vote so they're allowed to vote now it's up to the parties which should be to engage voters and get them to the polls so\nThat's certainly what both parties here are doing ah regarding the governor's race in Georgia which is huge Syrian tanks and all the polls indicate extremely close\n... speaking with Wall Street journal reporter camera in McWhorter about his piece entitled Georgia's motor voter Dr boosts eligible voters in groups leaning democratic I saw the tightest together now because we have this very closely watched in what appears to be highly intense battle for the governorship in Georgia\nSo Stacey Abrams is an African American woman running

in and out of state\nThey are both uh a hammering each other whenever possible [laughter]\nAnd they are both I'm scrambling to get voters to the polls the this will play and you know if Stacey Abrams can bring a for example more African American voters to the polls which according to primary she did do that and in in the Democratic primary\nIf those people show up and enough numbers and Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans who are um who tend to lean democratic come to the polls are the Republicans could have a real tough time and ah they they were very aware of that though I mean and

miles south of Panama City Beach Florida is a solid category for hurricane\nAnd I I have to say this is a bit surreal is a meteorologist washing this\nOr we go look back into the historical record there has not been a category for landfall along this part of the Florida Panhandle or the Big Bend Florida you know we're bands of ... bay you any historical records dating to them Mitt nineteenth century so what we're seeing today is truly an unprecedented event\nWas it a surprise that a jump to a category for\nWell you know I'd have to admit uh looking at this last week we were expecting at least a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico but uh you know I I have to be honest I was not expecting a category for landfall\nUm you know it's just basically been such very onerous Gulf of Mexico water temperatures in just some ... some optimal wins a law that allows the such rapid rising motion in the Iowa the hurricane and\nIt's just taken off in the Gulf of Mexico far beyond what I expected\nRound so landfall time would be roughly what middle middle of the afternoon\nIt looks it looks like the eye of a a a Michael should make landfall in the early afternoon hours somewhere between Panama City beach in Appalachia cola Florida\nAnd you can kind of think of this as kind of a somewhat larger version of hurricane Charlie if you remember fourteen years ago Charlie ran like a ... through a southwest in central Florida as a category four\nSo unfortunately the ah this is going to drive a massive storm surge possibly nine to Thirteen feet above ground level I mean can you imagine night at Thirteen feet of water outside your front door a so you know really if anybody's\nStill along the Florida Gulf Coast they only of hours left to get away if they if they've been

it's moving the good news is moving quickly but again it to the ferociously intense storm unfortunately for the Gulf Coast\nSeems so a bizarre the kind of the historical perspective you gave before about this type of storm not hitting the Florida Panhandle in so long or ever but I like listen I'm up in New Jersey so I think Gulf of Mexico I think hurricanes big storms I'm bud bud why I guess not

there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president as an avid watcher of Fox News and particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um during Hannity in the evening ...\nLittle ... come over at the Fox business channel until the general public notice this until head lobbyist empty and lobbyist\nHad found that in effect give away to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his tape it to the program so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild like ... like a ... what example whose airing what\nDon't we took a look at the story now because there is a big fight that's been going on over there now and so groups that are savoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been\nUm advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and then groups and also oppose that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same programs\nAs you know to be influenced by them\nWhat we can see if he can gauge sometimes directly after an ad that pops up on TALK on this happened when a group of\nUS Steel workers this advertising during boxing fan in March you know as the ad came up and the president started talking about the issue suggesting that he had seen the ad um\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember last year billionaire Tom tire who constantly and fight with the president can get started and impeachment movement I'm kind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted that and tweeted about it right away\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you went to do the ad revenue for these programs that are Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the program some south has really strong viewership um during this administration viewership has written and and still have the ad rates and we've actually seen some ... ...\nEmail noted that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not\nOnly to reach the audience of wind that perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads and maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategist also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president has expressed dislike for programs on on\nThose two channels [laughter] there's there's no debate at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may be some types of advertising and and death flag it to him well\nAh that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin Mac from that group need to impeach how he feels like he just suspects at the president's watching and knows he can targeting what's with like a little elbow and the ribs kind of add\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting the president has been\nVery disparaging of Saturday Night live as a show that's not funny any longer and one that

Wednesday since\nGeorgians went to the polls in twenty sixteen more than half a million voters have been registered including an increase in the voting ranks of women and minorities groups that tend to lean democratic\nMuch of that increase is the result of a change to driver's license forms and acted two years ago in which new applicants and renewables are automatically registered to vote unless they expressly opt out more from Wall Street Journal reporter Cameron McWhorter in Atlanta Campbell is going on\nWell it's a very strange thing because Republicans as a rule don't like these motor voter bills which are bills which ... which are passing several states which allow people when they go to\nRegister or re read or we knew their driver's license they automatically get registered to vote unless they opt out let's say purposely chose to opt out and so what it's done in those states is going to\nA lot more registration and it's been fought by a lot of Republicans who consider it a a a way to that that could be misuse of this you know where people who are driver's licenses but aren't necessarily said as soon as\nSomehow end up voting a at a could cause problems so that has been the case in Georgia but about two years ago\nOr the department of drivers services here just made this little change in the document on the advice of their attorney general and I can't get a real straight answer as to why they did it and but\nWhat it did was it basically created a motor voter situation in Georgia without passing a bill and so the result is\nThe scene registrations go through the roof here way more than any a\nA voter Dr efforts by democratic leaning groups or anything I mean registrations are way up among all groups African Americans or Asians Hispanics white people to a lesser extent I mean it's really brought out a lot of new voters\nBend the Republican governors signed off on it right\n[laughter] right and again that everyone gets very skittish where I started closely as to why they did that but the uh the Democrats and meanwhile the Democrats are\nAre somewhat skittish about it because they want to talk about voter suppression that's Sarah one of their talking points and the truth of the matter is if you look at the raw numbers of people who are\nAbout the possibility of voting in Georgia it's increased dramatically in Kabul digits way higher than the population has increased in the last two years\nSo as one observer or expert in your story said just because there's an increase in registration for a particular group that does not equal turn out all the time\nOr exactly so but now the battle becomes turnout so talking to various experts that I spoke to regarding\nThese bill they say look what's what's it just moves a hurdle so we'd have more and more people registered to vote so they're allowed to vote now it's up to the parties which should be to engage voters and get them to the polls so\nAnd that's certainly what both parties here are doing ah regarding the governor's race in Georgia which is huge Syrian tanks and all the polls indicate extremely close\n... speaking with Wall Street journal reporter camera in McWhorter about his piece entitled Georgia's motor voter Dr boosts eligible voters in groups leaning democratic I saw the tightest together now because we have this very closely watched in what appears to be highly intense battle for the governorship in Georgia\n[noise] right so Stacey Abrams is an African American woman running on the Democratic ticket she is the ah she would be the first African American woman to ever be governor in ... in any anywhere in the states where she will\nUh Brian Kemp who is a stalwart Republican the secretary of state or who is I'm just trying to keep up\nA a dominant Republican dominance of or the governorship in Georgia and try to carry on the legacy of previous governors like Nathan Deal who is now leading who's very pro business but also very conservative and anyway and so\nThese two candidates are really clashing they are ready to both raising tons of money in and out of state\nThey are both uh a hammering each other whenever possible [laughter]\nAnd they are both I'm scrambling to get voters to the polls the this will play and you know if Stacey Abrams can bring a for example more African American voters to the polls which it according to primary she did do that in the in the in the Democratic primary if those people show up\nAnd enough numbers and Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans who are um who tend to lean democratic come to the polls are the
