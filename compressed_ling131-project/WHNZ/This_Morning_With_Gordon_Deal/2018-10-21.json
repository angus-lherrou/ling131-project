Ninety degree weather and grime\nWell they say what are they St tomorrow at least in central Florida we're going to have a low in the upper sixties\nYeah that's where I Am sixty nine and sadly I'm going to go in the sixties just to say that we're in the ... I I'm\nGoing to say sixties I I've seen sixty seven months here already so I'm looking for a continuation or as as I've looked at it I'm going up on line to various areas northern Florida seventies the highest in the seventies\nOr central Florida and South Florida eighties somewhere around there mid eighties\nActually today Key West is going to be cooler than we are wow amazing how often they are cooler they're going to be eighty eight today I think we're hitting for Ninety\nSomewhere around there Ninety ones around there you know but after today it looks like a ... are gone maybe till spring will will say we can only hope anyway\nA National Weather services predicting no place cooler than normal come winter that'd be kind of neat some areas or even warmer a Farley Florida as likely weather winter than normal\nWinter while they're there's snow prediction so with just ... then we got snow so Johnny snow about three feet of it three I think that's where [laughter] mangy every year she predicts they warm weather or wine or a ...\nAnd her um I work at ... can thank her for that the last year [laughter] ah but the old farmers' almanac if you read ... brought this and the other a couple of weeks ago they say warm and dry ... or ... ... yeah so the weather service says warm and wet\nMan you know war is one of the relative terms what's warm is thirty two degrees warm in some areas it probably is yeah uh but anyway uh so old farmers' almanac says warm and dry National Weather service says warm and wet\nAnd we'll see but they're they're saying Warner or in most areas so we'll see what happens there are but I'm going to find out what Mother Nature says okay so you all can help me out with this year\nOkay here's some of the things that the signs of a harsh winter we have to see if they're out there okay okay I already mentioned acorns unusual abundance of acorns huh what do you think as we have more than normal while I'm hit me yesterday\nJust writing down the road do it but you know we actually we stopped or Nathan oak tree so with the traffic light and all of a sudden acorn comes out and just smacks me\nDid you look up and see if any if Johnny's friend or a year [laughter]\nHey hey we're probably throw in hands full that day in\nAnd one of only one of them hit me I don't know I I think there's been at least as many and maybe more of a corn if you drive down the road you look underneath the oak trees and see all the ... vote from a core a dust or flower or whatever you want to call it\nA that's been ground up by tires staying on the road so I think maybe there's a at least as many maybe more I don't know\nOh I like this one here but let's see if we've had this uh situation I Will put that on hold Joni so that uh so that you can stay with us there there you go your whole joined the program is going to be funny I think ah [laughter]\nOkay now here's one I'd really like to see if you've seen this happening woodpecker sharing trees [laughter]\nHow much of that that have you seen I've not seen that no what is sharing and yet I I have no idea how the different whole [laughter] I've not seen one would pick her brain the trees near as good as I don't know if you don't get out the Brian is going to have to check this one out because it is in charge of the blackout mhm okay [laughter]\nThick hair on the night and they ... it means back of the cows neck\nSo what are the black how so how do we know I Know will opt jak [laughter]\nWhen the ... in the Green River right now we're way to eat a lot of people might not know what the green room is is the waiting room before he come into the main studio here so ah so you can check on the cows yourself I mean just go out and pet them most of them are fairly friendly\nA must see spider spinning larger than usual webs huh\nAnd entering the house in great numbers so now the only thing I've seen coming into the cockroaches mhm now when I went out to morning and it was in ... we feed the birds that was a little dish we bringing nighttime there was one sitting right in there well and you know I missed the soccer [laughter]\nHad to swat setting Brian and quick they they are yeah I think ... uh yeah in some countries struggling okay here's another one I haven't seen is but I'm I'm willing to look bless you I'm willing to look for ... gathering sticks\nThis is all prediction that building a house I I I ... shelter probably it's going to have a cold because they want to go with brick because that would not drink them okay uh squirrels gathering nuts earlier to fortify their nest for hard winter [noise]\nUm I I I don't know I I I met and you can see some squirrels here lately I don't know and a fairy tales were as you just went oh raccoons with thick tales out a ... but you know I haven't checked the raccoons that much here lately but\nYeah I guess they did the town in the west set it up it's it's actually the horticultural a group of that particular garden club of people that are interested in doing their finger so a little bit\nAnd um what I did was in the front yard I gave them a an area to look at and go find something that was going America didn't belong there\nAnd of course I sent home during the day as I said there should be just as any is there and there they found all sorts of acorns dollar we camp for growing some ... skunk by basket we crab grass all sorts of wonderful things growing it shouldn't be about about a normal yard garden to just like everybody\nElse ... now let's face it you had them over and you need to get some weeding done ... and so that's you set up this little contest so so we'd all go out there and pull the weeds and get it cleaned up for you\nAnd my mother was smart [laughter] now what did they do in the backyard\nIn the back yard we did a little bit different I gave them a list and they ... it was kind of a\nThis should have seen the faces when I read the list to him [laughter]\nThat was about fifty five items on the list yeah and uh sent them out there to go uh go find them and uh the reason I did that with my life to\nWhere the class I like to get them back into to the fall the garden not just to see the roses or something like that but give it back and you get the different nuances of things that are going on so scavenger hunt and getting them big back into the back behind the other Bush is a fine thanks I find that to be a good way to do it but I guess I had a pretty good time\nWhen we all had a good time you know I think the one plant to almost nobody knew was the lucky nuts that are toxic only end or did you have growing there and we don't see that one very often\nNo not too often and and I was surprised I wasn't right with the group when we all found that so I don't know whether you had the point that out sooner or somebody else did but uh yeah that's a beautiful yellow flowering Bush but as you said is quite toxic\nYeah if you eat one in your survive you're lucky that's what's lucky about it a listening now that you are telling all of us that you know it it does it hasn't been the best fall for vegetables and I tend to agree with you uh so what's been happening\nBut you know I think the problem started Tom and in my world last spring you know it it got hot too so they got wet and it stayed wet\nReal wet and real hot and I think just that much right there with out of a break all the way through the summer kind of set us up you know it\nWe've got a fungus and things like that going in abundance very wasn't quite always that much in the past or the last couple of years has been real good to plant a an early fall crop this year if you find them early fall crop you might as well just because someone you're in July [laughter]\nYeah hot out there you were ahead of me I have to laugh because you really pushing ahead of me and and I started after\nYou and even I mean I'd lost two tomato plants already Haiti Haiti Mitt that uh we're talking with Bob ... University of Florida in Seminole county master gardener now is anything doing well\n\nWell I think that my Juliet tomatoes\nAre doing well yeah that's right yeah you were offering them\nA gift and quite well yeah um let's see what else but the ... I had a problem with the ... but he supported cultural spray on that got rid of the mice since and they're coming along that fact I've got four or five left over from last season even but they're all looking pretty good\nSweet sweet potatoes oh good\nGrief potatoes are coming along it they they I think they need about a hundred days I just let us tennis squarely for them it's it's that's all I can say that whether it's been really squarely yeah and if we start to get into a real Cole session that that could be a interesting as well\nIt might save us yeah what's not doing well\nEverything else [laughter]\nWell you know I think the bean had a tough start maybe the corn but looks like it's starting to come around\nThe corner and come around but I had to take really good care of that I've had to add nitrogen and I've had some iron and I put some more black cow in there or you know and I'm not sure it is just not prolific as it has been in the past I expect to see six date but uh socks out there and right now I've got a yellow ing five five foot shocks\nYeah is it ten a tough time yes it has no so what will you be planting now\nWell I think you covered it pretty well on your list I Know you've got to talk about next hour or so I'll go to a deep but most of the fall crops I'll take a look at them but you know I'm going to hold off another week I don't believe it's going to say this or the school that they're talking about you know they say down in the sixties or seventies maybe eighty but\nBut you know and the wait time I think I'm I've got to treat it like it's almost first September fifteenth of September so again because you know we're going to get some days where the temperatures stay below eighty five and that's what the plans need to to plowing the fruit so you know maybe we're just running a couple of months a lake later this you\nKnow believe me we will not see Ninety again I I really believe that um look down the pike down here and I think the mid eighties and high sixties for a while so well\nI'm going to I'm going to bet you a dollar we'd salad on that\n[laughter] dollar we'd sound thank you very much and that's what people are eating out of your front yard yesterday by the way [laughter] so uh how about the ah tropical like bananas your banana planning look good\nAll the bananas are doing quite well I've got a I've got bunches of fruit on a three and a different trees course when you got a dozen trees that doesn't sound like very many\nBut ah yeah they're they're doing okay they look All right if we get a little cold snap here that may be just what they need to a call on a little bit better than what they are the other a fruit trees are growing nicely to teach the pair that are not ... percent man\nA white ... they're all coming along quite well they're they're healthy and scream and nice so maybe some day\nStar fruits flowering\nSharp fruit is doing well that was killed back of all I should say killed back it was a frozen back really low to the ground and I cut it back to about a foot high and now it's back up about ... what'd you say about the age and fail and flowering is\nThat all the flowers no flowers yeah but now you know I suppose it does get cold what happens now we're in this transition second I think two thousand Eighteen it just got to be kind of a nine year\nYeah well you're you're ... look good I'm ah horseradish tree\nWas harvested marine done Dr beliefs another round them up and got those in charge so we use those we put about tablespoons of that in most of all of us salads on eggs and things like that every day\nYeah let explains why how you are a [laughter] no just about gardening uh but anyway so what is your advice to Gardner's when the weather is not a cooperate like this\nWell you know ... my theory about gardening is I'm not doing it to support myself or to or to feed myself if I was I had to\nBe very skinny [noise] uh I don't think it's just fun you know so when things happen that that aren't supposed to personally I just kind of stand back and say well that happened why you know and maybe if I can avoid it next year maybe I had bad seeds are\nAll sorts of things you can kind of think about ... just enjoy the gardening experience and yeah sometimes it's gonna be productive and sometimes not so productive\nBut but it's always fun and just plant the next crop get ready for the next go around\nThat's right don't look back and and just keep on plug it\nYeah and and you knew store a lot of the things that you grow I Margie freezes a lot of things so so you're not going to start I'm not worried about you\n[laughter] well I Know where you live\nYeah there you go hey Bob thank you very much we appreciate very much you have a great gardening day\nWell you'll have a great day too and that's all your listeners a reverse some of the stuff we talked about here is is more central Florida orient as far as vegetables to the guys down south to the guys the fortunate here maybe having a totally different experience\nThey're going to be keeping cooler and having fun bottle got run thank you very much Bob ... University of Florida in Seminole county moved to know you're always happy to have more this break that yesterday to the people had a great time from the uh a\nSweet little loop so garden gloves and\nThe scavenger hunt work very well we all learn some different things all the way things grow in Florida oh let's see we got Joni coming up like a tiny waiting in St Augustine and we'll go ahead no help you also we'll be right back on topic come and this is talk in entertainment networks\n[noise]\nA pretty common problem in our area is black and green stuff on outdoor surfaces described it off and it comes right back you need something that will keep it clean wedding forget it keeps surfaces clean for a year or more just spray it on and leave it\nLike cleaning easier pick up a bottle of winning forget today at Wal Mart case do best or visit wetting forget dot com to find a store and they are you\n[noise] Floridians love boating with family and friends exploring our states amazing waterways but even experienced voters can lose sight of the risks of passengers standing or sending an improper location", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "21"}
