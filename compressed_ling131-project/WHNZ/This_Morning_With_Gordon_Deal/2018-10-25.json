to try to run veterans are in the mid ... uh this year and to define folks who could walk that tight rope of being bullet proof on national security issues while also being bona fide of their progressive but the good progressive background\nI mean a lot of times that the G O P the Republicans are the ones who are sort of align themselves with a party of a as a party a flag in country and patriotism\nBut there's a both ah both an up and coming crop of recently elected congressional veterans who are sort of shutting the framework to to bring other vets in and then there's a few dozen veterans running\nOn the on the Democratic side or the vets are seemingly\nWilling to do this\nSo this has been a who's been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party upset that veterans have been a habit of crushing parties say you were were interested in running a and shape time the Democratic party has a has a number of different things that's putting in place\nTo to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat in the house of representatives who have\nWorked together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role in the party and uh have have really come out to support so a veterans who are coming up behind them and the system\nIs that right is that number correct that there is a hundred and

that treadmill when you're running sometimes the the iconography of a of of learning as a patriot the background and experience of being in the military or can can can issue warn people into being one trick pony so that the military service can\nBecome the the some of their fellow parts and right now that's that's a strategy that that some folks are using if they're if they aren't veterans themselves in the running against veterans to say hey look yeah well you know like\nWe we appreciate we appreciate the person service but you know there's there's other ...\nAnd in this very partisan environment a polarized election cycle [noise]\nUm there there are there are observers who are saying but you know the end of the day you need to have the best fit for the best for the congressional

covers veterans issues and what have you found\nThe Democrats' strategy to try to run the veterans are in the mid term is a this year and a defined folks who could walk that tight rope of being proof on national security issues while also being bona fide of their progress is a good record background\nI mean a lot of times the the ... the Republicans are the ones who who are sort of aligned themselves with the party of the flag and country of patriotism but there's a book to open up and coming crop of recently elected congressional veterans who are\nSort of shutting the framework to to bring other vets in and then there's a few dozen veterans running on the on the Democratic side or the vets are seemingly\nWilling to do this\nYeah so this has been a who's been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party have said that veterans have been a habit of crunchy party said we're we're interested in running a and the same time the Democratic party has a has a number of different things that's putting in place\nTo to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat to be in the house of representatives to put together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role in the party and a half have really come out to support solar veterans were coming up behind them and the system\nIs that right is that

veterans from from both parties and independent to cetera as well as a new new candidates is all incumbents running so there's a lot of veterans that are out there for this mid term a midterm season\nWhile we're speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Ben ... covers veterans issues he's written a piece about how Democrats are trying to win with help from military veteran candidates\nUm there was one analyst or expert or observer and your story you said a military service doesn't necessarily translate to the best candidate for office which seems obvious but what was the point there\nRight well the point there is that ah with with any military veteran running sometimes the the iconography is a form of learning as a patriot the background and experience of being in the military\nOr can can can issue warn people into being one trick pony so that the military service\nCan become the the summer there are several parts and right now that's that's a strategy that that some folks are using if they're if they aren't veterans themselves in the running against ... to say hey look yeah well you know like\nWe we appreciate we appreciate the person service but you know there's there's other qualification for work\nAnd in this very partisan environment a ... election cycle [noise]\nUm there there are there are observers who are saying but you know the end of the day you need to have the best fit for the best for the congressional district and how close are they going to are they going to shoot at a party line and in some ways that can come back in her folks who are pledging to be independent voices\nYou know maybe they don't have to they don't have the the bona fides that are needed to say they're going to work with work with their particular party in a year when voters oftentimes are are looking for people to align with them politically it's rather vote for him\nYeah I Know it was anecdotal but I think there was one woman in your story you said that was a while she was choosing a particular veteran because he seemed willing to compromise with the other party\nWell the the the one woman I spoke with that I think illustrates all you know talking to a number of different people said hey I'm really I don't like the partisanship that that that's happening in the country I don't like the direction we've gone I Wish people would talk across the aisle\nBut at the end of the day I Want to make sure my party when so there there there are a lot of voters that I've that I've spoken with to have that\nHave that um have that opinion you know I wouldn't want people to work together and yet I stole my party to win because I think my party is the one that's going to work with the other party\nThat's going to be nice but persuasive since most
