so they have to hold on there and find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together [laughter]\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bell weather states that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a huge there's a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin I'll want her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and\nIf she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the ballot speak to join the important for the Democrats second one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat and other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a

Holmes the house Judiciary Committee here's Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard Eric what's up here\nRight now we've got a whole crush of people being called before congressional committees to testify about the FBI and the Jay's actions before the two thousand sixteen election\nThese are investigations that have been going on for a while but now all of a sudden there's a time pressure on getting people to come in and testify\nBefore those committees and it all comes down to the mid term elections which is there's an expectation that probably you know Republicans have a three out of for a chance of losing this should be ah the house\nA majority this year and what\nThey lose if they lose a majority of the crucial thing in investigations is it's up to the chairman of the house committee issue subpoenas sort of on his or her own um say so and so you you meet the subpoena power to force people to come in and talk\nTo give testimony and in the Senate the chairman of a Senate committee needs the agreement of the ranking member of the other party to issue a subpoena so you don't have the same kind of power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose the house they really lose that power to force people to come in to testify\nWow so the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigations have to see the way to the end\n[noise] um the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes than the power over what the majority puts out as a report changes immediately and show\n'em power of having a congressional um leadership\nBoth in the big picture and in each individual committee I'm really determines what that committee does it's it's not like with the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with whose investigation regardless of who's in power and Congress\nAre we're speaking with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will affect Congress's investigations are what are the Democrats in the house say they'll probe shifts they gained the majority after November\nWell you know you've got in the house intelligence committee instead of death and Noone as you'll have it being run by Adam Schiff said he's made it very clear that he will be [noise]\nI'm pursuing allegations of money laundering from the Trump Organization so that's what his focus will be [noise] and uh you'll have over in the house oversight committee I'm Alive Cummings will be in charge there\nAnd a Jerrold Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those are the three committees that have been primarily looking at a investigations a shift has made it clear that um\nIs money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side that any investigation into abuses by the FBI and the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election um those will disappear from the house side\nWhat Republicans hold the house then what happens [noise]\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only have kind of new life but they'll have a a new energy that will come from\nHaving been racing to get 'em witnesses before the committee's [laughter] you know the things had been moving along at a store to steady pace with everything else going on in the house and so all of a sudden they have a lot more time at their disposal but they've done a bunch of

fire drill and one security Joe a month a including locked ends and evacuations just as a you know as a precaution I and I hadn't really thought about how hard that would be to fulfill for some of the schools that serve some of the\nMost disabled children and that so I watched an evacuation 'til at one of the schools it's called the Phoenix center and not leave which is just west of New York city [noise]\nAnd this was interested to see how hard the staff work to keep the students come and get them out of the building\nUm you know school shootings you know there are obviously way too many of them but they're still\nRare I mean it is unlikely that this school will be a target it but at the state law to practice and so they do and they take it very seriously and um [noise] you know it's it's a lot of work when you have students who have severe autism Down syndrome or their behavioral challenges some of them are [noise]\nA seizure disorders or medical issues and um they they work hard\nTo to to do what they need to do a lot of these students have one on one aids so when the when the alarm sound the AIDS you know each goes to his or her student and they walk out together\nUh some of them and neat and oxygen tanks or I'm sort of items to calm them down like blankets fitted spinners some of them have these things called social story which are like um [noise]\nAlmost like

worst how would a first responders\nHelp out given some of the disability or fears like overwhelming fears of some of these students may have\n[noise] well I I think that the school has a relationship with the police department in town and so that you know police officers know while you know the kind of students that attend\nA digital that I didn't have first responders there but um you know with such a high step to student ratio I I think that the\nUh you know the staff would be largely in charge of the students and the first responders I imagine would be\nInstructing the staff but I I that's a good question and some of these students are are very I'm\nTerrified by noises and they're they're really crave consistency so something like a drill that gets them outside of what they're used to can be hard for some of them yet\nTo that point I I think you mentioned there was one student whose daughter froze when he got a doorway and didn't necessarily want to go outside of the time\nRight and some of the male staffer ... where I used to him doing that it's it's happened before so they very quickly kind of came over to him and scoop their arms under his as armpits and kind of lifted him up a little bit to get its feet to start going again and helped him get to the evacuation site\nAnd another girl who are really hates the noise she's about Fifteen she began to cry and kind of hit

history does not favor\nThe political party of the president during off year elections with a look at three bill whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side Jerry set this up\nWell so for Democrats to win control the Senate and the Republicans have only a\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep a seats\nAnd turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats the Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there and find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether state that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not and it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going to recently read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there's a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin I'll want her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and\nIf she holds on it'll be because she's Claire McCaskill kind of an institution in Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the ballot speak hugely important for the Democrats second one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat and other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights very very uh ... a heavily funded from both sides\nAnd the wild card there all of a sudden is hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen is leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him if people think the rescue effort has had been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need to hold onto that when if they're going to have a chance and third is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... Arizona is kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way ah in any election\nUh and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the\nDemocratic side in a year of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if Democrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total\nOne of those is probably gonna have to beers on him so that seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury Siamese\nBut an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\nIt that's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm\nEither going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think and certainly in in Florida there's a big question about a ... who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voters suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities those are two groups of voters to simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance in a presidential election so\nThey're you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but you know it's easy as in three weeks before the election and actually showing up on election day or two different things\nWhen Jerry it's Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry side it is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas purse news [noise]\nNothing small and not your your passion your hours your reputation ...\nMakes Jason's Wall Street journal sports writer Jason gay it is twelve minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news [noise]\nLook into any great business whether it's a manufacturing\nOr a hotel a store\nLooking to each and every one of them and you'll find\nThe same thing a great\nPeople grown us we believe that great businesses are powered by great people and with criminals workforce solutions we'll help you find them gates and engage them learn more increments dot com crash into the workforce\nInnovation works this flu season one\nLove ...
