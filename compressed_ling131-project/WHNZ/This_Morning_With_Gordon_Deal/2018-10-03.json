their spending on the elections and other political activity a new report by the center for political accountability\nStudies annual political spending policies as it would be five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers are either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related use to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing here\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern and in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom\nTo swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always at ... they've always got a lot of money in Washington and in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is\nWhat this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you talked about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates but they can support candidates and other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party\nA you know the Democratic Republican governors or accept that basically support uh getting\nGovernors one party or the other or if they're similar groups for attorney general run for state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little Richard of a company as large public companies are saying we don't want to use money I'm going to war\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political

tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies\nHave been in the ass ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a how and where and when they spend ... and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example they used that published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their report too much uh informative than they used to be a fewer companies now in part because of new company is joining they asked me if I'd hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah ah to display the political scandal reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies\nStay in the index it turns out that larger companies and companies that have been an index longer tend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies you referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was the mayor did they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what their restrictions are on a on the political spending in talking to me they said their position that changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like five or six floors or twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language but Adam ... versions of their annual political suspended report\nUm other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of this they don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or and they tell their trade associations not to use the funds for a a lecture activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization that Center for political accountability but then also uh some\nShow us or shoulder advocates have put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to uh you know Asher older tape much tell the company to produce a political

Wednesday\nNothing's ever settled in politics right polling is a good guide to the state of play in electoral contests but specific polling ... can have\nSignificant ripple effects that is why Philip bump at the Washington Post says it seems clear that the fight for the Senate will be the more hotly contested partisan battle next month when we go to the polls fill up a lot of data you're crunching what do you have\n[noise] right yeah it's very Beautiful Mind so the upshot is that the Democrats have always based not they'll climb this election cycle there are because six years ago\nThe length of the Senate term was two thousand twelve in which the Democrats did well with ... there are a lot of Democrats now have to defend featured they hold against Republican challengers in a midterm election year so we have a lot of it is already sort of in a structural imbalance against the Democrats but\nAt the moment it seems like they're forty nine races\nIn which the Democrats either aren't up for reelection or have elite in polling and fifty races in which the Republican due to hold the seat or apple even going and then there's one ... Tennessee it's essentially tied so the upshot is could go either way\n... [noise] how about a ebbs and flows as I don't know particular issues come to the forefront in any given week does that does that happening\nNot really I mean it was so we've seen for example recent polling in North Dakota which shows the Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble that's not surprising it's North Dakota it's a very red state uh there's been some indication or or or I should say some some\nWere arguing that a high camp is suffering from support for Kavanaugh that ... that she wasn't immediately on board with a supporting Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has been pointing to as a reason that she's a falling behind there but it is a state that the Democrats have consistently had trouble in any way so I'm not sure that's really the case\nThe main thing that we're seeing is partisanship\nThat in states where there are a a where Hillary Clinton won for example Democrats and you will in states that Donald Trump won\nA the motives and do well there are some outliers like West Virginia where Joe Manchin still maintains a lead a despite the fact that he's a Democrat in a very red state but as a general rule no it doesn't seem to be swayed by ships\nAnd we're speaking with Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post she's written a piece in Delaware the fight for the Senate stands right now um\nHow much could things change over the course of the next month there was starting to get really locked in here\nTo some extent I mean we were starting to see where races are starting to separate to some extent and what that means is that parties will then stop putting money in those races which means that those races will become even more soundly whatever color they were training and the first place I guess we're going to see some of that\nReally this is going to come down to a handful maybe five Senate seats on election night which will determine control the Senate I think the house pretty likely to to go to the Democrats at this point in time but the Senate continues to be a big question mark\n... what were those that's a Jew ... five thirty eight crunching numbers than they about uh the odds of one party claiming the house and the Senate\nThey did yeah and so those numbers change a lot depending on what polls they get in but essentially it is the Republicans have about a one in ... chance of holding the house the Democrats have about a one in five chance of taking the Senate\nOkay so you were to it like the some of the gubernatorial races correct any any notable similarities\nRemarkable about the gubernatorial races is that if you look for example the Senate map and look at the state of pulling there there's a lot of sort of politically areas where the Democrat and Republican or wanting sort of even if you look at the map though there are a lot of states where there is an incumbent Republican governor who is usually going to win re election right\nSo you look at a state like a Maryland or Larry Hogan is very popular looks like he's not going to have too much trouble running for reelection even though it's a blue state and there are a lot of reasons for this one of course is the fact that the Democrats have a map on the side so you're going to see 'em a few were ... great voices they're simply because there aren't a lot of\nYou know strong popular Republicans are up for re election\nBut another too is that there's obviously a big difference between state and federal and so people in Maryland is like Donald Trump but like the job Larry Hogan is doing an organ and other Republican governors that represent blue states\nActually came out and said hey let's let's put the brakes on his Kavanaugh nomination which is a sort of thing that you can do\nThe governor you can't do the Republican Senate\nLike Philip bump at the Washington Post\n... ... by our friends at Harry's up in a Harry's\nUser for years now my favorite part is this leak candle in the close comfortable shave you get each time my son was a teenager now uses Harry's my father's a user that's three generations of my family\nFor a limited time only new customers can save big on a Harry's shapes that with the code deal at Harry's dot com get a five bleed razor waited handle shaved Jill and trouble cover for just three bucks and free shipping\nHarry's bought a world class blade factory in Germany where they grind steel into sharp durable blades and they stand behind the quality of their products to if you don't love your shave let them know they'll give you a full refund\nFor a limited time only Harry such a special offer for listeners of our program new customers get five dollars off of ... from Harry's with the code deal at Harry's dot com that's H.

notable for the record breaking levels of flu illness and hospitalization rates throughout the country tragically there were also one hundred eighty flu related pediatric debts\nReminder of just how serious blue can be as the new flu season approaches time for a review on how best to protect ourselves we're joined by Dr Bill Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville working with the CDC doctor what should we know\n... there's going to be a flu season that's the thing we should all know more severe less severe but it will be here who is nasty which means now it's time to get vaccinated let's all rolled up\nOur sleeves the recommendations are so simple we don't have to think about if you're older than six months of age yep\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't want to spread the virus this nasty virus to anybody at work\nIn in your family at home and your house of worship don't be graded spread or\nGet vaccinated [laughter] how difficult is it to create the corrective vaccines these days\nWhere we have lots of options there's the standard flu vaccine and for people age sixty five an older this is important because they get more serious complications there are actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them one is called simply the high dose\nAnd the other has a fancy name called the ... vaccine that just means there's an immune stimulant in it\nThe pharmacies and doctors' offices almost all have one for the other and that's great for people age sixty five and older and Medicare will pay for it you don't have to worry about that Mm\nI'm do vaccines make it more difficult to battle the flu strains\nVaccines don't make it more difficult in fact they are the single best thing we have available to combat the flu and we want to ... emphasize people age sixty five an older\nThose younger than a sixty five we have an underlying illness such as diabetes lung disease heart disease or immuno compromised and a special shout out\nTo women who are pregnant and back flu vaccine is safe it protects the pregnant woman\nWomen who are pregnant when they get to have a very high rate of complications have we don't want that\nAnd then there's a bonus the protection they make actually passes a cross the placenta gets into the newborn baby and provides protection to the new baby after its Bork well so that's a bonus\nYeah we're speaking with Dr Schaffner infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville they're working with the CDC as we head into flu season with some tips on preventing flu or any read on what these this season is going to be like the worst than last year uh not as bad\n[laughter] but read is that there will be a flu season the odds that or a crystal ball is clouding that's why we just say let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I don't try to anticipate there's this guy that was a good one [noise]\nJust go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection that flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains were those three or four vaccine to very get the one that's in your doctor's office or that the pharmacist brick bats\nWhat about the what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what's you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading others\nYeah so it's it's very simple the CDC has a take three approach get vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people are coughing and sneezing and if you should get sick\nWait call your health care provider because they may prescribe an anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the illness they get less likely you get complications and make it less likely you'll spread its voters so that's a comprehensive approach\nDr Schaffner infectious disease

adults in the U.S consumed eleven percent of their total calories from fast food\nAccording to a National Center for Health Statistics data breach that was published in twenty Thirteen the study also found there was a connection with fast food and family income the more you earn the more likely you are\nTo have eaten fast food forty eight percent of men and thirty nine percent of women say they

policies as it would be five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers are either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related use to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing your\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern and in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom to swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always paid ... they've always got a lot of money in Washington\nIn state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWell so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates and other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party [noise] ah you know the Democratic Republican governors or accept that basically support uh getting\nGovernors one party or the other [noise] or they're similar groups for attorney general run for state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little Richard of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money number one or more of these areas\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase a backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produced this report the center for political accountability has a way of looking at best that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies\nHave been in the ass ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a how and where and when they spend ... and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example they used it published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their report too much uh informative than they used to be um fewer companies now in part because of new company is joining they asked me five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah ah to display the political spending reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies\nStay in the index it turns out that larger companies and companies have been an index longer tend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies reference to Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was a mayor do they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what their restrictions are on a on the political spending in talking to me they said their position that changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like Fargo and she fours or five twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language but I've had in previous versions of their annual political spending report\nUm other companies by the way it is about ten companies that say they don't do any of this they don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or and they told their trade associations not to use it as fun for a a lecture activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does that some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization that Center for political accountability but then also uh some\nShareholder activists or shoulder advocates have put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals\nTo uh you know asked shareholders hey let's tell the company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances companies either seeing how those votes go overtime\nOr just on their own initiative go to the investor and said look what's hash out at the city you remove this project proposal and we agree that some sort of political spending a disclosure\nAnd he's to tail

for a review on how best to protect ourselves we're joined by Dr Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville working with the CDC doctor what should we know\nThere's going to be a flu season that's the important thing we should all know\nMore severe less severe but it will be here flu is nasty which means vow it's time to get vaccinated let's all rolled up our sleeves the recommendations are so simple we don't have to think about um if you're older than six months of age yep\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't want to spread the virus this nasty virus ... anybody at work\nIn in your family at home and your house of worship don't be graded spread or\nGet vaccinated [laughter] how difficult is it to create the corrective vaccines these days\nWhere we have lots of options there's the standard flu vaccine and for people age sixty five an older this is important because they get more serious complications there are actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them one is called simply the high dose\nAnd the other has a fancy name called the ... vaccine that just means there's an immune stimulant in it\nThe pharmacies and doctors' offices almost all have one for the other and that's great for people age sixty five an older and Medicare will pay for it you don't have to worry about that Mm\nI'm do vaccines make it more difficult to battle the flu strains\nVaccines don't make it more difficult in fact they are the single best thing we have available to combat the flu and we want to ... emphasize people age sixty five an older\nThose younger than eight sixty five we have an underlying illness such as diabetes lung disease heart disease or immuno compromised and a special shout out\nTo women who are pregnant and back flu vaccine is safe it protects the pregnant woman\nWomen who are pregnant when they get to have a very high rate of complications and we don't want that\nAnd then there's a bonus the protection they make actually passes or cross the placenta gets into the newborn baby and provides protection to the new baby after its Bork well so that's a bonus\nYeah we're speaking with Dr Bill Schaffner infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville they're working with the CDC is we had a flu season with some tips on preventing flu or any read on what these the season is going to be like it was worse than last year or not as bad\n[laughter] but read is that there will be a flu season the on that or crystal ball it's cloudy and that's why we just say let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I Would have tried to anticipate there's there's got to be a bad one\nJust go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection that flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains where those three or four vaccine to very get the one that's in your doctor's office or that the pharmacist for about ...\nWhat about uh what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what's a you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading others\nYeah so it's it's very simple the CDC has a take three approach get vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people coughing and sneezing and if he should get sick don't\nWait call your health care provider because they may prescribe an anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the illness they get less likely you get complications and\nMake it less likely you'll spread it to others so that's a comprehensive approach\nDoctor bill Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in
