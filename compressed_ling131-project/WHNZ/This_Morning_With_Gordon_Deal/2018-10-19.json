Newman this piece is called why Trump is going soft on Saudi Arabia and he points to reasons like Iran and oil um how easy would it be by the way a for Saudi Arabia to tinker with the price of oil\nI think it would be very easy and I think that's the problem so the Saudis have said very clearly that are there any sanctions on us\nWe are going to respond with what they said that words were greater action and you know I think they're clearly referring to a oil prices so they had ... people in Saudi Arabia sugar speaking on behalf of the ruling family they're saying you know we can ... oil prices right now west Texas crude is around Seventy dollars\nA day are saying we could easily just restrict supply and prices go up to eighty dollars a hundred dollars um you know the Saudis are are still the biggest oil producer in the world and they could\nOr they could easily rich restricts supply enough to push oil prices almost as high as they want to so would they do that um I you know I [laughter]\n... it's hard it is really kind of head scratching because it's a little bit hard to see this outbreak of sort of oil or petroleum warfare to a ... and all these countries really do need each other I mean the the shot Saudi Arabia the United states\nUh United States does me Saudi oil even though we produce a lot more of our own oil they used to so I you know as we've seen that so many times that so many different ways\nI mean middle Middle Eastern politics it's so complicated ah in in large part because of who sells oil and who needs Boyle\nThinks records Yahoo Finance columnist written Newman based in New York ...\nOf the program is brought to buy Brooklyn Brooklyn in sheets named the winner of the festival on line vetting category like good housekeeping Brooklyn\nFastest growing betting brand in the world over twenty thousand five star reviews Brooklyn and was started by a husband and wife team who didn't think it should be so difficult and expensive to get quality sheets at home their mission brings five star hotel quality sheets to everyday life\nThere luxury sheets without the luxury markup Brooklyn and sheets don't just feel great but they also look rate to we've got them in my house\nOne thing immediately noticeable by the way how close they are in the hot weather\nBrooklyn sheets are the best and most comfortable sheets and right now Brooklyn in dot com is giving an exclusive offer\nJust for our listeners get twenty dollars off and free shipping\nWhen you use the promo code deal at Brooklyn in dot com Brooklyn is so short you'll love your new sheets that they offer a risk free sixty night satisfaction guarantee plus a lifetime warranty on all of the sheets and governors\nUm you know it makes me think I don't really even have time for the Powerball which is like a measly three hundred and forty five million I Can't I Can't even be bothered\nNo right when there's eight hundred and sixty eight million on the table and what do you do what the what we're doing this ... you're not doing it that you actually just destroy the determining look at you know when people start playing these big lotteries and a lot of people wait until it's like a hundred million or something before they even go in so I'm guessing you're not alone\nWith Katie Katie Hill editor at ... dot com the drawing for tonight's mega million jackpot is the record nine hundred Seventy million dollars you're lumped some cash payout by the way would be a measly five hundred forty eight million tomorrow's Powerball jackpot is four hundred thirty million\nIt's thirty minutes now after the hour on this morning Americas first news [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWere shot at loves thousand dollars Texan nationwide gee worst films the two hundred two hundred and you'll get a tax confirming entry plus I aren't radio in standard data message rates apply in this nation wide contest that's bill to do laundry do laundry\nOn alert I Need your aid breaking primaries now reading when a day he had killed herself and her children three weeks after her husband mysteriously died twist the husbands decently they did that to his wife he collect a hundred and forty four thousand life insurance New York uber driver or beer premier allegedly kidnapped\nA female customer a soldier in the backseat leaves her on the highway fifty miles from home and charges or a thousand but he's been charged with felony and senior treasury official now me Edward allegedly leak suspicious activity reports about Paul Manafort and other targets that Robert Mueller's investigation she's in hot water\nHis ... release users to where they experienced relief from muscle cramps ... with their works really fast acting bone proven to prevent it really put an leg painting grant yet there were released today and the pain relief violate your pharmacy or\nAt their worst released dot com ask your pharmacist for therapy works really well ...

campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbents who currently serve with him a handful are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidates specifically like the person trying to take his seat because he's retiring\nWould keep this trying to schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always had a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read a lot from lots of money for the party he's raised over seven eight million dollars on them for the party with a lot of that going to keep these candidates safer attempt to keep these candidates have cuts heat certainly doesn't need it he's not running again\nAnd keep an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of\nJust you know basically like a ... a day on multiple districts and it just go kind of on his final spent that we remember he's retiring and it would really help is like to see if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nJeez are so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members then as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his ...\nYeah I thought this was really interesting as well I've spent\nThe last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and did that for a been a thorn in his head of trick conservative fire rate\nMembers of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually send legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen votes in order to pass\nAnything and they can do right now on their\nOwn um but they need to buy in from the frame ... because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they sort of voting bloc and they've done that and they've threatened to do that and so they have sort of forced Ryan\nAnd his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is it was sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus is not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the whole thing getting what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races\nSo to speak with allies are Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is it in the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates but what kind of messaging well he does or does it change from Canada to kind of the\nWorld from Canada to candidate what he'll do will change from candidate to Canada in some places that might be like a business tore or you know a rally in some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off Republican leadership\nOn the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package that was signed into under President Trump but Republican there's a lot of their names on these tons and tons of tiny little bells all grouped together is a lot\nOf vulnerable Republicans have their names on those bills so he'll be campaigning on all that but the message basically being you're better off under Republican leadership and Democrats\nThey say are going further and further can\nOr how will he use President Trump if at all\nBut I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist she said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our money elsewhere rent payments that none of them are counted out\nBut these districts where the Democrat\nIs making a big strong place it's probably not just tricks to align yourself really closely with the president in last year doing an event with just the Republican base but right sort of more of a moderating force he obviously with the vice presidential candidate Mitt Romney and\nSo he comes in he doesn't illicit really strong feelings from either side of people might not like his agenda that he's not as controversial because President Trump so it seems that they're hoping he'll go in and kind of be able to soften the Republican Party image and actually stay on message about the economy
