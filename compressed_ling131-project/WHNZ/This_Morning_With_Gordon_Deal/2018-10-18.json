Idaho Nebraska in Utah\nThat ... the main threats as a saying that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people up to earn enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um [noise] this is an issue one reason it's still I'm practically and as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in these states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country one argument for why that's happening by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voter say we want this then there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen grumpy Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece in total myth germs healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nIt potentially to their Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho has worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a form with healthcare reporters that he thinks if these initiatives these ballot initiatives in these states passed that it it could have started trend for the rest of the states that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the only thing that's going on\nIs some states that haven't expanded Medicaid interpreted states have been asking the Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as ah imposing work requirements and that's another issue that play some states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example it in um Kentucky smoker\nYeah you've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about and it's just because the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have the say in it there's in the state legislatures are due to but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\nThat do to a lot like tying to I guess the federal government money would be guaranteed that would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the arguments that are opponents of I'm expanding Medicaid I'm One of the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee you can't guarantee the states that that funding will be there forever [noise]\nUm so they and their their argument is that if states get dependent on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion than states you're going to be on their own\n...

Americans are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... ... what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending for various reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in what is otherwise a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years\nUm but it's a reversal of the trend where you'd see where as the economy got better and better each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that\nDownward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nYou referenced it in a couple of your remarks there but this is a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth in household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up at the last few years that was initially when we started looking at this oh five or five years or so ago\nThat was the top ... and people limited they're spending was because their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that as a income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case where that was the reason people were holding back and instead people were saying well I'm holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin\nA couple of other things that that bear watching the percentage of Americans a point to too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment\nThat better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up\nBut that the higher debt burdens coupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people out there are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we even an assault economy there's there's there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back as soon as the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year\nA lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows I even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow and we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nYou know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and the little inclination to save more as the reason falling back\nSkew younger so ... and particularly the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend and they're also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um similar trend there\nAre most inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to save more money\nBut that's where it changes sad baby boomers those are the sandwich generation\nA couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back on their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter]\nBut when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce\nStagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is a recession hanging over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say ... what the Generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this\nIn a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about\nIn the past ... millennials have a greater inclination toward saving a they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations\nAnd I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand and the case of voter millennials or\nShe uh the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in

Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nWhere there are two issues than us direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care isn't some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah there there are some of the states that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and this time um because because the governors and state legislatures there haven't done it\nBut are trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that that that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expand Medicaid to people the way of Obamacare intended\nTo do these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's there's some been some pushback from state officials in some other states\nAnd one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative includes a way to pay for the state's share of expansion the federal government pays her most of the costs of the state does have some ... a portion of the costs and in Maine which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe governor there has refused to go along in part because the funding issue so in Utah they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock\nBy including a funding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative from\nHow similar or the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in Idaho Nebraska and Utah\n... the main thrust of the thing is that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people up to earn enough to hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um this is an issue one reason it's still um percolating as an issue in state that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly rural hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country one argument for why that has happened by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public official Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voters say we want this then there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece titled midterms healthcare is a key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level\nOr could this be a trend we're state legislatures are addressing this\nIt potentially so there are Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho has worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a form with health care reporters that he thinks if these\nInitiatives he felt initiatives and these states passed that it it could start a trend for the rest of the states that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs some states that haven't expanded Medicaid ... conservative states they've been asking the Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as ah imposing work requirements and that's another issue that play some states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example in um Kentucky okay\nYou know you've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact that the ... and it's just because the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have a say in it there's in the state legislatures are due to but

back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great right what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending a buffer buried reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in yeah what does the otherwise a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years\nUm but we did to reverse the trend where you'd see where\nThe economy got better and better each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nNew represented in the ... remarks there but this was a solid economy right to wages are creeping up ah the the tax cuts for more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\n[noise] you know it's interesting you mentioned the growth of household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up of the last few years that was initially a well we started looking at this show five or five years or so ago\nThat was the topic of the people limited they're spending was because their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that\nAs a income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case where that was the reason people holding back and instead people were saying well I'm holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin\nA couple of other things that that they're watching the percentage of Americans to point to too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years now the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment\nThat better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up\nBut that the higher debt burdens coupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we even in a solid economy there there there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back to you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we see last year\nA lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nAnd we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending\nHow about my generation what's that break down\nYou know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and inclination to save more as the reason falling back\nSkew younger so ... and particularly the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend and also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nUh most inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to save more money\nBut that's what changes have baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back on their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter]\nBut when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is a recession hanging over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say\nI don't know what the the Generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nCertainly with millennials I we've seen this
