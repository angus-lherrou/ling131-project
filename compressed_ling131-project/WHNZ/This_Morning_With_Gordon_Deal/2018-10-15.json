you are listening to America's first this morning with the\nBudget can be with us from in the Monday on\nElection night the focus will be on whether Democrats will live up to expectations of winning back the house and can defy the odds to take control of the Senate but for some smoke signals about President Trump's reelection chances\nTo swing state governor races will offer tantalizing clues about the public's tolerance for progressive is when the alternative is electing Kennedy to emulate the attitude of the president so says Josh cross harp politics editor at National Journal Josh how do you see it\nWhen you want to look at how a twenty twenty presidential election might shape up\nIt's really instructive to look at the sort of left or right governor's race is taking place in swing diverse backgrounds and I'm Talking about Florida\nGeorgia and even Arizona to a to a lesser extent where you have you know in in the in the Florida race you've got a Bernie Sanders candidate running against the Trump endorsed Republican at the airport is one of the most a bellwether state for the country and the rate is extremely close\nIf someone like Andrew Gillum ... will be the first African American governor of Florida\nIf if if if he win that race and he's a very progressive candidate he would send a message to Democrats in twenty twenty book we can win the electoral college we can win the presidency with a very liberal candidate against against President Trump or there's a path with a victory\nEven nominate someone who is a little bit outside the mainstream ...\nMm So is the same thing true in Georgia where you've got Stacey Adams running\nThe Abrams yeah Georgia is a a another great example where you have two candidates claimed to to the bases are ... you know and then the primary especially with talking about how she wanted to build a new coalition of voters in Georgia and not just relying on sort of the swing\nSuburban Atlanta voter that off and make up the difference enclosed Georgia election she wanted to get new are largely African American voters took a poll and create a new electorate or to help Democrats win the big bad for big gamble\nShe definitely has the windows are backing that good democratic year but she's running neck and neck with the Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp\nWho was again a Trump indoors candidate someone who's very very conservative especially on social and cultural issues and uh you know there's also a big battle over over voting rights than in the state where I'm you know he he at secretary of state camp when after Abrams for something to organize\nAnd trying to get new voters registered to vote in the future so again this is a polarized electorate leopards is right and the state that is the lead legal Republican but it's one of those days democratic they compete in in years to come\nWith Josh cross our politics editor at National Journal these pieces called battle of the bases will set the tone for twenty twenty you point out in the story too about the risk of running left\nYeah I mean the conventional wisdom and I I I buy the conventional wisdom is that when you go to carnival after going to alienate those swing moderate voters a typical he makes a difference in in competitive elections that Democrats are betting on it I I can understand why what what area of the cases they think this is\nSuch a good democratic environment there's such you know here ... anti Trump anger\nEspecially among suburban voters\nThat it may not matter who Democrats nominate they might be able to nominate someone who is a little bit\nTo the left are but the suburban voters are so so uh you know\nHow such a problem with President Trump they look at the Republican Party and wonder where it's going and let me just wrote strict Democratic Party ... let me just vote on a strict party ticket and the Democrats so environment and if you want to have a candidate that's going to be a little more productive than normal this is the type of political environment Democrats would work with a would achieve that goal\nThat gets to I Believe your point about this competing culture clashes you call it in the Trump era\nYeah I mean the middle of this uh you know the the time for centuries the timer moderation is is that here and twenty teens which Trump is rallying his base Democrats are playing to the resistance\nI there's not much room for someone like you didn't like I still rather that there was a former Democratic governor in Tennessee you're trying to run to the middle or he's finding that it's hard to to to the center of the people who want to take sides on the left ...\nExplain what's happening in Arizona then that's a somewhat similar maybe to Florida in Georgia\nYeah this is a race to see the Republican incumbent can't not as Trump be as to do other Republican so it's a little bit different but again running against the uh his guy with David Garcia will be the first Hispanic governor in Arizona and in it over forty years and go see it again I'm especially immigration which is a very\nTouchy issue in Arizona where their voters are much more conservative on border security

economic shy staying with employment employment base in those cities and can be very stable and growing she'll rushing growing population growing employment ... cycle in terms of people are willing to work there\nWhat we're observing and the economy is lead singer such a tight labor market were ... unemployment rate uh jobs ... people not the other way around show when jobs are chosen people ... you'd find a lot of real estate investment opportunity that's what the common thread oh gosh ... virtually all of them\nSo you mentioned the younger folks looking at these smaller type cities is that because they might be more affordable in addition to having jobs\nYeah no question and the ability going extends not only to young people who want to work there and start careers and start families jobs or Ford among terms of dealing there's as many cities are considerably more affordable\nThan their big surely counterparts and in terms of retirees are empty nesters some of them when they figure
