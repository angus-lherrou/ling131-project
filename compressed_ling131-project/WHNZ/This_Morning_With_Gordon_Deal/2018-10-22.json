respect you are listening to America's worst news this morning we're going to be\nWith us walking into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorite to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular were races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here has become closer than than people expect that they would\nAnd we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that [laughter] so maybe forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent for districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfied with the president can\nTalk to one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people and becoming very competitive and that's the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler [noise]\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as to the highest performing Democrat who it's a woman named ... she's a political science professor\nSo it's an unusual race there in that um this hasn't been considered you know one of the ... district but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points [noise] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight race well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with uh the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender\nGap and and it reveals that women are\nShow more of a preference for a democratic controlled house and are often more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out but\nIf that is indeed the case it looks like women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blowout for hitting their draw to\nSpeak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tighten as mid term elections near to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes said this is an interesting way I'm going with all its definitely being outraged by Carolyn a boy do who is also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that\nUm are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats\nAnd ah so does you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seating a democratic incumbent I'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise]\nUh and then the second ... Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter] um this is a little bit\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be um [noise] a little bit more of a stretch their\nChristina it's Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson\nWants to buy you know was not mark making the lottery\nThe centerpiece of your retirement plan despite to lotteries current size right but you know what is Martin\nGoing to zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon do hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new zip recruiter finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies skins thousands of resumes then identifies people with the right skills\nEducation and experience for your job and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast that's wise dip recruiter is rated number one by employers in the U.S in just reading comes from hiring sites on trust pilot\nWith over one thousand reviews and right now our listeners tries recruiter for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter\nLater in their career and you know there was one survey that said thirty seven percent of women inside a woman who want to be a top executive should actually have children earlier about the same amount forty one percent said waiting it's better\nUm and so there's kind of you know two schools of thought I'm not either battery children earlier when you eat your self earlier in your career and then\nYou know when they're a little bit older you can really you know leaning speaking and really extend your career on or you know some people feel that waiting a little bit longer than having your baby when you're a little more established it's better um but it also so much depends on\nYou know what your company maternity policy is and all those kinds of things so um you know it's obviously a very individual decision\nMakes Maria marketwatch personal finance reporter Murray Hill among you thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news\n\n\n[noise]\nAbout the w._b. carry business graduate programs on line jak crowd to seven nine six four or five that's P R O U D to seven nine six four or five\nFrom the surgeon general Skinner thermometer weather center Tampa Bay forecast mostly sunny and breezy within above average ... eighty six tonight mostly clear low sixty eight tomorrow partly cloudy with just a tempers that range in eighty five or news weather in traffic anytime soon in news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nThis report is Roger you buy true car looking to buy a car online shopping can be confusing not anymore which roof I swim through car now you can do the exact like twenty people\nLet's talk nutrition weekdays nine to eleven on twelve fifty W H ...\n\n\n\nReading the world to your door every Morning America first this morning with your\nThree of us will come in the Monday October\nTwenty two Gordon Deal Jennifer ... some of our top stories headlines migrants caravan crosses from Guatemala into southern Mexico Russia warns about the U.S backing out of a nuclear arms treaty\nTreasury secretary in Saudi Arabia in the midst of controversy over the death of a journalist in sports chiefs quarterback Patrick more homes now has twenty two touchdown passes in his first aid game that's a record and why statistically it may be\nThe best Red Sox World Series deem that story and about twenty minutes\nPresident Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve complicated series of\nAlready challenging decisions facing the central bank more from Wall Street Journal economics reporter ... ... ... what's up here\nThat what the president has been saying about the Federal Reserve it\nReally doesn't have a reason for them [noise] us presidents have criticized the fed before George H W.

into Monday there's an influx\nOf young mostly democratic women in their twenties and thirties running for office this year one fifth of the female Democratic House candidates are under forty\nA sort of them are women of color hundreds more are running for state legislature Wall Street journal national political reporter Janet Hook says the diverse crop of young candidates marks a departure from an older generation of women with ambition who tend to to postpone political careers until their families were established Janet what's up here\nYou know there's been a lot of attention paid during this election cycle to the record number of women overall they're running for office but within that\nUm there's this really interesting trend of there being more younger women running I'm sort of under forty women in their twenties and thirties\nUm and it's interesting to me because there's been a kind of a career pattern for women in politics I'm In the past\nIt's much like like the clear pattern in in in other um line of work where women would tend to wait until their children are grown before they take the plunge into politics and the classic case of this with Nancy Pelosi had five kids\nDidn't run for office until the I'm the youngest one was sixteen\nI'm and she was forty seven by then by the time she started her political career\nUm and I think what we've seen in twenty Eighteen a wave of women running signs that women are also are a little bit less willing to wait that there's a sense of urgency among democratic women who are running there's a sense of urgency\nAbout running you know we need to be part of the movement to also part of a broader idea that women can start their careers and their families at the same time\nYeah so what ... what happens if a I'm a ... what we might consider a significant number of them when I look at what kind of message I guess get sent\n[noise] well I mean it's been broadly among Democrats a real clamoring for kind of generational change I mean there have been a lot of complaints that the leadership in Congress being all baby boomers and older uh so I think that it would kind of contribute to a sense of\nOf a movement powered um they also I think women in general and young women in particular bring more focus and attention to a\nWomen's issues you know the treatment of women family issues um and you know I talked to a political scientist who is actually kind of studied the style of leadership that women have brought to Congress and they she concluded that with more women in Congress and more with younger women\nThat there might actually be more collaborative approach to decision making\nYou know I thought was interesting too is the one line in your story about how some of these young women are already making a difference to federal election commission ruled the campaign funds can be used to pay childcare expenses\nRight my story actually features a woman who's running for\nThe house in New York on Long Island\nHer name is Lou been Gretchen Shirley and she's thirty seven years old and she was thinking about running for the house and kind of reluctant at first because she had a one year old and a three year old\nShe went ahead and um started running and was kind of relying on her mom for for childcare help and just when the pace of the campaign got too much she really felt like she needed to hire outside help didn't have a lotta money she petitioned the FCC to see if she could use campaign tons to pay for childcare\nAnd lo and behold they issued this ruling that said you could and it was kind of a landmark that says\nI'm basically kind of recognizing the reality of when parents run for\nOffice that if they have children I'm part of the campaign has to be finding a way to take care of the kids\nWith Janet Hook national political reporter at the wall Street Journal she's got a piece entitled young women aren't waiting to seek political power I use it to their mobilizing not just as candidates but also as voters I guess that probably goes hand in hand but explain some of the numbers [noise]\nWell um the there's a democratic um data analytics firm called target smart that analyzes voter rolls and\nIt looked at um twenty five states that had held primaries to look at the turnout of voters in and they broke it down by different categories and one of the categories that they looked at was the difference between a younger voters voters and older voters by you know kind of looking at turnout by age group and what they found was\nHas always been the case younger voters um their turnout rate is lower than older voters as we know you know older older voters really turn out in large numbers\nThings done at the wall Street Journal national political reporter

store unsuspecting online customers law enforcement authorities in several major a major markets have noticed a flurry of reason steps\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan booming who's been researching this made them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible\nAirbag that this is a kind that has existed for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of their hounded as well our I'm being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat everybody can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases it's when they break into the vehicle the they basically cared out of the steering wheel and then they sell it on the black market\nAnd it's in connection with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the airbag or is tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens when you need to get your bag replaced do you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop get to replace their um some people ever going to get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to\nMaybe more disreputable a type of repair shop and that's where a lot of these types airbags end up being sold if you actually go on ... for example you search for this you will see their airbags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships something you're not going to end up actually buying a\nUser airbag or something but there is a market for these safe\nShe saw it and the reason that at Honda is because they are popular vehicles and just happen to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's long wait targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact that there ... there\nBut it doesn't make much sense to me is white only because in talking to the police and various markets um you know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on the show you know it does you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with\nThe actual specific airbag ... actors or something being exactly what it is I'm\nProbably the the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nYeah so at the the ... what uses a nice ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out of their work\nExactly they somehow gain access to the ethical and then they basically a use a knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes [laughter] um I I went to some incidents where either they hit a dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night\nShow you know it's it's definitely um there's not a difficult thing to think about this is like you know as a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars\nAt the bottom was worth so there was a big incentive for the season you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the Dakota one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up suddenly and said that there's also gone up well\nWe're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in Seattle police the flurry of Honda airbags deaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\n[noise] but if you've ever took ... you probably consider here number one is please say in a park or vehicle near a street light or near a parking lot late that can help because these aren't going to choose a vehicle that threatened or the light that copy the make them easy to spot\nUm secondly I hadn't thought of this you can try not to park near a big vehicles that are maybe a structure\nThat the view so but when the the kind of hide behind the big SUV Arabic truck that's one thing to consider\nIt didn't last sounds kind of old fashioned but you can always join the

are listening to America's worst news this morning Gordon\nWith us walk them into one day in a year where Democrats are considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain this\nTo what I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than than people expected they would\nAnd we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge amount [laughter]\nSo maybe a forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent so districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have to come to satisfied with the president can\nParts of one of them was like in ... in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're at the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats garnered more votes than congressman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as did the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor\nSo it's an unusual waste there in that um that hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn longest campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight race well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with uh the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet so probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender\nGap and and it reveals that women are\nShowing more of a preference for a democratic controlled house\nAnd are also more energized vote this year so you know it's a truism of mid term that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blow out for him there\nDraw to speak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tightened as mid term elections near our to dump south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman Rob a little\n[noise] yes this is an interesting race um would all is definitely being outweighed by Carole and a boy do who is also a professor she's at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that\nUm are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats\nAnd uh so do you know they can see that Republicans feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in democratic incumbent I'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise]\nUh and then the second ... Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and has a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada um at this is a little bit [laughter]\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be I'm a little bit more of a stretch their\nChristina it's Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson\nWants to buy for you know was not more making the lottery\nThe centerpiece over your retirement

basically said like the rate of teen pregnancies from like Nineteen Seventy or the seventies has been cut in half from then to today that about ... yes\nYes that's true it's a way way down um and yeah that again the education part really um plays a role and I'm abortions are actually falling as well so it's not just that\nUm you know there are more abortions happening it's um that there's actually a decline in sexual activity I'm In a rise in birth control so it's um you know think including methods like you know having inter eater and devices and things like that so it's you know there's also more methods of birth control that are available\nFor speaking with marketwatch personal finance reporter Murray Hill ammonia she's written a piece instead of more American women are having babies later it's dumb are still conflicted about it as you mentioned a there was a question or a survey that looked\nAt kind of the best way to get ahead and ... ... your professional life been having

different but um yeah there have been sort of mixed results on\nUm you know if people should you know quote unquote should have children earlier or later in their career and you know there was one survey that said thirty seven percent of women that a woman who want to be a top executive should actually have children earlier\nAbout the same amount forty one percent said waiting it's better\nUm and so there's kind of you know two schools of thought on that either that or children earlier when you read your self earlier in your career and then\nUm you know when there are a little bit older you can really you know leaning speak and and really extend your career or you know some people feel that waiting a little bit longer than having a baby when\nYou're a little more established shifts

complicated series of them\nAlready challenging decisions facing the central bank more from Wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick tomorrow's Nick what's up here\nYeah what the president has been saying about the Federal Reserve\nReally doesn't have a reason for them [noise] us presidents have criticized the fed before George H W. Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last president to do it [noise] it's not unusual for the president [noise]\nUm you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do do it again it has not happened since Nineteen Ninety two [noise] what is unusual for the president\nTo say things in quite the manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been [noise] I'm kind of a different in many respects the president enough of another example he's saying things about the fact that he's blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gotten crazy [noise]\nUm he said that they were his biggest threat um and that's not something that we're really used to seeing Wright's\nRight so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[noise] that's what he said I'm a ... part of this is also laying the groundwork to blame the fed a if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets [laughter]\nAnd you know even though there's some speculation there [noise] about why he's doing this [laughter]\nIf you look at the ... the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people [noise] uh sit on the fed board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of dead presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA vote every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's doing is just to kind of a\nRunning public criticism of the central bank and you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the fed says presidents or criticism isn't going to change how they operate [noise] it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else a as per usual when the president does something like this he started the discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n[noise] ... exactly right um [noise] people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is to end but rather than Trump is um probably elevating that debate and saying look the unemployment rate slow\n[noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as as a flak disappears in the economy because you don't want to have inflation but when President Trump is saying here as well worth the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates that we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nWe're speaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter his piece is called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be catering to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\n[noise] that's right the question isn't very um difficult right now the you know most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates so the decisions they have to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case a year from now let's say a year from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing to fall [noise] but inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do\nAnd so the question is on a close call or you don't have as much conviction\nAbout the policy pass through the president's criticisms get in your head at all and there are some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you um identify as the other side which says look if markets begin to question the credibility\nAnd that's even worse and so it might actually stiffen their backs a

interesting story I I was\nSurprised to see that Honda's our susceptible\nAirbag that this is a crime that has\nExisted for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of their hunted as well our I'm being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases it's where they break into the vehicle the they basically tiered out of the\nSteering wheel and then they sell it on the black market\nAnd in connection with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the airbag or is this tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens when you need to get your bag replaced the a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop either place there um some people ever going to get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to\nMaybe more disreputable a type of repair shop and that's where a lot of these cuts airbags ended up being sold if you actually go on E. bay for example in the search for that you will see their airbags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealer something you're not going to end up accidently buying a\nUser airbag or something but there is a market for these days\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happen to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nI definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda Civic\nWade targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular\nBut it doesn't make much sense to me is why only because in talking to the police\nAnd various markets um you know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this show you know it does you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific Arabic conductors or something and exactly what it is\nProbably the the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nSo it is the phone what uses a knife and kinda strips away the covering the Centre part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nExactly they somehow gain access to the ethical and then they\nBasically a user knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes I to some incidents where either they hit dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night show you know it's it's definitely um there's not a difficult thing to think about it this is like\nYou know doing a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars [laughter]\nThat's about ... worth so there's a big incentive for the ... and you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so me and said that there's also gone up\nWell we're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece of metal police the flurry of Honda airbags deaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\nA few different set of ... you probably consider here number one is we say you know it could be a cool you're a street light or near a parking lot late that can help because the these aren't going to choose a vehicle that threatened or the late that copy the make them easy to spot\nAnd secondly I hadn't thought this you can try not to park near a big vehicles that are maybe a structure\nThat the view so that when the the kind of hide behind that big SUV or big truck\nThat the one thing to consider and unless the sounds kind of old fashioned but you can always join the club if you think you're you know in a market where you are really susceptible to this\nIs
