{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Growing up with my brother um just one of those really motivated people I mean just outgoing trying to thrive in life and as time went on as we're living in Florida being separated my brother actually came down to visit us at one point\nAnd it was just strictly just for vacation for what we're told\nAnd next you know the next month he took his own life unfortunately and um since two thousand six it's I've really I was a loss I mean everybody was and one is one of the biggest stigma and Asian community is is that you don't talk about suicide\nAged ... a one of those things where like in almost brings dishonor to your family and so for quite a while it was just one of those things that was never spoke about at home\nSo suffering in silence was literally suffering in silence and so it took me quite a while to find out where\nOr how I can start reading or morning or finding hope and that's when I came across a thespian with doing um the out of the darkness lock 'em oddly enough all our former board chair Jason Thompkins\nI'm having to be one of my Starbucks customers and so I happen to see them at one of these suicide prevention of events randomly at a concert and I'm like hey what can you tell me more about this he's like yeah I lost my mom and November two thousand six I'm like oh weird\nI lost my brother in November of next tell me more about it and since getting connected with Jason he literally open doors to where I Know that I can actually find held and healing and hope through this dark time in my life and\nBecause of that I've invested in my life besides teaching into the passion of suicide prevention and trying to be involved as much as I can\nLet's talk a little bit about the under the darkness a cp ... coming up you know again we're talking to the American foundation for suicide prevention the Tampa chapter way of hand the giants Tampa Bay chapter board chair and building bass or\nA an also brandy Pauline Tampa Bay chapter board member and when are we just said the out of the darkness saint Pete walk cheer 'em what does this event designed to accomplish and and what are you hoping to show people if they go out and attend\nSo the outer darkness lock in general is really just accumulate offer awareness of the whole purpose of the walk and not you bring up will bring to light about suicide to let people know that there's it's positive positive like the old for it and let's be like\nIf one of those things where we want people to know that their connections that can be made\n'em that there's other people who you can relate to you you know I neither one of any of our board members here you know handle off her dad\nI'm bringing lost her son I lost my brother we can't connect on my level and out of darkness as one of those great opportunities for people to come and relate to each other and there's people who come in teams and you know they make posters and and you just kind of ... strike up a conversation and say you know like here's my connection with you we're sorry for your loss but\nWe know that we're in this together it's because I've been fortunate that but we know that we can rely on each other and we were really a small knit community and I'm sure has of the situation I'm so out of darkness in general really the focus of positivity bringing hope healing and celebrating the lives of our loved ones that we've lost I'm fortunate to suicide\nAnd and working people find out more about the walk itself ... or join and be a part of it\nSo we actually have three walks in our Tampa Bay chapter this ah October ... is the the the walk a it's at South Park in downtown St Pete from eighty eight thirty AM to twelve PM then we have one on October twenty seventh and Haskell county\nUh from nine AM to twelve PM and then I Walk in Tampa on December eighth\nFrom nine ... nine AM to twelve PM um all of this information can like you said found on if they see that or if you just go onto the website and just like a community chapters a local chapters equip them a Tampa Bay chapter actually gives you a link for all of our band for walks and even survivor they on that website itself and if I can\nWhen you don't have to be impacted by suicide to join one of these locks locks really about empowerment and joining together as a community to prevent suicide\nAnd so if you support that cause if he'd been impacted if you if you suffer from mental health issues everybody as well and that these flocks\nSo you know mental health suicide it feels like we know more about these kinds of things PBS the um from what you guys are seeing kind of on the front lines being a part of this organization or are we making a dent when it comes to helping or is it still a big appeal climb\nSo suicides in our country as a temp leading cause of death and it's the only leading cause of death that has continued to rise because\nWe have not been paying attention to it as a society until recently it's been in public issue\nAnd we are making changes I think locally definitely and we did we went to Washington DC in June and we made changes for a\nNational suicide prevention national suicide prevention hotline improvement act we advocate for legislation for that\nThat would give the I'm the one eight hundred two seven three talk number actual three digit number okay that's a good idea and it would kind of help with the stigma and just like if you have a physical crisis you would call nine one one mental health crisis you call that three digit number and also improves funding for the hotline as well so it's wonderful we got that\nPass 'em but we still have a lot more to do\nOn the verge of change right now they are really is I think there's a new that occurring there's been a lot of national ... local ... so this really is the time and it really starts with education so once you educate yourself and you become an advocate that's really how we drive prevention\nAnd there isn't there the\n... out there that where there is I Believe that a suicide attempt actually happens every second of the day while I'm while we have forty one death\nSo the good news is not every suicide is successful if you had attempted suicide you can still need a very productive life and just because you've had one suicide attempt doesn't necessarily mean that person is going to have another or be quote unquote doomed so I think\nThe more you can prevent the successful led hats show them more successful you'll be in the end\nAnd how can people get involved in other ways outside of the walk or are there other things that you guys are looking for it a S P in terms of volunteers or donations things like that\nWell on a really simple level on titan touched a little bit on advocacy if you want to be kind of a field advocate is what it's called if you go to the FSB website there is a link for become an advocate and you enter your information that's a really quick process and basically anytime there's any legislation that comes out\nOr whether it be at the state level or federal level you get an ... and it literally takes a minute when you do it and it generates an email that that gets sent to your legislators\nAnd let's see now hey I support this legislation and please vote for it okay so that's just a very basic you want to stay behind a computer way to get involved um brainy do you until you want to touch more on some other ways to get involved yeah absolutely so and it actually\nMentioned before I'm In ... he has a lot to education as is the biggest key and one of the biggest things that we try to get to many of all this is actually taking the training\nWe offer to the top trainings which every single one of the thinking here and it's one of the things that literally opens up our eyes it gives us the signs and symptoms to look for and how to speak with a person had a guide them to resources that will help them with their struggles and suicide in general general\nAnd I'm sure of all that a lot of that information is on the website\nIt's on ... they're linked out to our walk stairs links out to the education ... there's a a contact us if you want to host an education where you know you're in a church or something along those lines and you want us to come we will come and then there's also a a peace around those that have been impacted by suicide can can go out and\nFind resources the website is A. S. S.\nP. dot org again a F. S. P. dot org and when you go there it's very easy to find the Tampa chapter Hannah giants brandy Pauline and we went from the American foundation for suicide prevention thank you so much for coming in\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find your loan them and why\nToday in orange\nThe more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... flew it\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so\nIt's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you is a listener there well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule pat it's big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down\nSo that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted a laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but we proved that it's orally absorbed\nAnd more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as we think of it\nNow bill you said there recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ha you're such a breakthrough in what exactly can do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time\nAnd that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects olive ourselves\nBegins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose\nThe substance the scaffolding those the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we being getting to wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know tons of daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water and of course I Want everyone to think of having something like\nLike a jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue costs ... sulfate is a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores\nPeople ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it well it took Thirteen Years for all the costs of me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are going to take this through the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patient\nNow you've written a great deal about the role of highly want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue how does each a work in the joints and the connective tissue is\nIt's a natural cushioning age and pat we're talking to about between the bones it also surrounds the nerves there's a sigh addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these\nAre going to need a special cushioning that ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you it work miracles for him why\nBecause purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called Hydrox that's taken from olives now pat you notice you can put a bowl of olives on your table in a year later come back\nAnd except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there they didn't shrivel up and waste away due to fungal contamination so there's something very strong and all is we've known it for a long time\nDr Roberta Korea an Italian researchers now here in this country doing some research on hide Roxy tier is all\nExtracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules do that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so we began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives\nInto ... new ha joined for a meal you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nThey just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a doctor ... saying\nHe looks like a man that's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe his level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula\nNow this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean and it's all safe all natural its purity age a joint formula and pat\nMost of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for it you might say radio commercials they don't buy stuff off the radio they just

again to help\nMy brothers have your host marks the most so glad you could join us today is a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counterintuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging you needed longevity the holy grail of medical research and what did they find\nOut of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was spiritual yes ... all the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nYesterday says that's just half\nThe story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent as an institution in New York radio host these old highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a long time product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that your freshman welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch them as long as it's also nominate on those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today well first of\nAll it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically Reza ... is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when ... first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seem to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to keep the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and here's what really got them interested\nA Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor ends\nWas even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity\nAnd an even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they call the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level but capitalism changes your\nAbility to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard now this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening in all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years under co Q. formulas but now that your co enzyme Q. ten would you say is just as important as reservists role especially your heart healthy and you also see some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs ... ... what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what our co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell ... is the new trend that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten in your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart needs co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right at your heart muscle your brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we all of this energy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "CATS Roundtable",
