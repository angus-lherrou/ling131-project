{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "A hundreds of tumor samples that have come through and we're starting to say\nUh you know this drug actually is working on this other cancer maybe we should start a clinical trial around that and see if this actually could work or an amazing\nAnd I have heard of that before that is incredible uh an incredible yeah I can only imagine in the hope that must be bringing to not only you guys but but some of the families who were actively dealing with this right now um\nYeah it's a paradigm shift in how to answer is treated\nLet me ask you this in terms of the organization itself you've got people listening right now who are maybe hearing this and and it's kind of touching them in a way that they want to help whether it's volunteering are donating of course we're going to get to the party in a moment that's one way they can do it and not everybody likes to get dressed up in fancy Halloween costumes [laughter]\nBut um how can people be a part of beat and be and and offer their support\nYeah obviously the the the party is a great way to come out and meet us and and see the people that are uh involved here locally that uh I think that's a great way to do it [noise] um you can also check out our website and our Facebook we're usually most communicative on Facebook so it's just Facebook dot com slash beat him be concerts beat and be on\nUm you know Twitter Instagram as well but Facebook seems to be the best place to kind of catch up with what we're doing and I think really just following us there and and finding out what it is that's going on a lot of people just you know they see a saint Jude commercial and they think oh childhood cancers taking care of\nA but the reality is that there are still multiple cancers within the childhood cancer world\nUm that we are losing our kids to and and so knowing that being aware seeing the stories will make you more aware of that and then as we do things in the Tampa Bay area you can you know come out to be a part of that I'm so we we love just people following along and and knowing what's going on\nWe're talking to beat and be and Thirteen ugly man here invested bam your host rank or many in the studio with me\n... executive director of beat in being David ... president of Thirteen ugly man the two websites beat and be dot org and Thirteen ugly men dot coms or David now that we've talked to Kyle about this tremendous organization and the great work they're doing obviously a great organization to highlight for your Halloween party\nI can see why you guys decided to go with them\nI'm tell us a little bit about your interaction with beat him be up to this point the relationship that you guys have built\nAbsolutely as I mentioned uh you know I Believe in application came a few years ago and typically you know we review financials and review the board and this is one guy you know [laughter]\nYou know who's speaking on behalf of it and\nYou know we we just like you guys mentioned there's plenty of\nOf children's support for cancer there is up you know the children's Cancer Center the have the same bond yeah and even ... things and it's so easy to write a check for 'em because you know instantaneously but\nYou really have to hear the story yeah and you have to hear the story from Kyle and I think that's a problem with that group is there a third of our guys and we don't have enough time to get that in the meeting in ... or um so when you hear it and it never went away usually when we get an application\nAnd after the year where we picked a four and we're kind of moving onto the next year this never went away and that kind of speaks to a little bit of Kyle and probably how Jordan and his initial meeting felt about it\nAnd uh you know from that point on\nWe made a point every time we were talking about ... we got to get beat envy we gotta we gotta get these guys involved in one of our events and\nAt this one came up and we wanted to make sure it was one of our events that it was the most successful which is Halloween every year we're making at least twenty five thousand dollars to donate back so we're already committed they are already promising that we're going to do that so how do we make it further well we have an event and we have sponsorships that can help us pushed that\nIn our relationship um we did go you know some of our group was fortunate enough to go to their big gala gala at ah the armature works and um we actually met one of the other families and they you know personally came up and talk to us and what our donation means as\nAs you mentioned two options wanting to well these donations that hopefully not only if you go to our event ... go to and check out beat him being donate directly to it we're providing another option this is not a a vacation to Orlando is a chance to save somebody's life and that speaks ... there's a\nLot of organizations that are that are doing great work and helping people deal with their situation which is very very important and and we had them on all the time and we are all the stories are what you guys are focused on a beat him\nIs is changing the game really a which is very unique and and I'm sure a David once you heard that beat and be did a live band karaoke party\nHas to be a legit organization and I have an idea like that of course that is right up on a real I mean and what kind of each other and actually I live in a yeah I mean you can go to a black\nTie affair yeah again an organization whose creative like that and doing crave things outside of the box I mean that's what we're all about I mean All right and then our our strictly rotted box where we're not a charity\nThat is just like ran out and we're not one who just throwing a a step of and we're going oh you already getting people to run out of power and oh by the way everything you're doing is going to help somebody who needs\nAnd and Halloween is usually a memorable nights ah so what can we expect to add this Halloween party this year what are you guys have planned\nWell you know ... have you met either are or chair for the Halloween and um last year was pretty impressive or do the fact of this I'm a projection lighting\nA I don't know if you've got around them you know anywhere in the world projection lighting is something that these major cities are putting on monument buildings and able to\nMake you know for us make Halloween graphics throughout ... within our party sure um said that obviously is something fun and if you went last year you'll you'll know it\nWas like what people put in their houses for Christmas only like a hundred thousand times\nBetter than we can put anything on weight with anything on your house you can I ask them to make it make human\nBeings walk through it and ... and ... you know and it's all mixed up with a DJ Fresh used a DJ of the uh the the raise\n'em and and very well known he he makes the crowd you know

creative person until I go to a Halloween party and I'm like yeah I'm not that that money you look at the pictures and you're like I didn't even see that person because now you're at a party with over

P. A. N.

Jason let's get to ingredient number two because there's so many got three super pill does something that no other fish oil product can do it actually lowers cholesterol\nTalk about these plants ... explain how this works and why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one\nCompound one ingredient that stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown\nTo significantly lower\nLDL cholesterol and again LDL is the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol right and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in as little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level safely\nAnd naturally absolutely no side effects\nVery effective they've known about plants they're off since the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten trucks so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to that and that and work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver\nPlants that rolls block the absorption of cholesterol\nIn the intestines plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my field into thinking that the plants they're all or actually the cholesterol particles so that might steal pick up the plants they're off instead\nAnd the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles instead just get pass through your intestines the point is if you're on that and you can take Lance they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually have been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants they're all to deliver the benefits as shown in the study that's something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that laws on the label\nMay only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for\nPurity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow Jason was talking about the third ingredient in the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all over the world tell us about co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what is what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found in every single cell and your body and they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you leave the euro\nUnfortunately as you age you lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten one word should come to mind pat\nEnergy you cannot make energy without co enzyme Q. ten ... is the\nCritical energy component of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy the fishing so co enzyme Q. ten delivers a whole ton Napoli of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams\nA perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure it's great for your gums coincide Q. ten supports immune function\nIt supports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti accident in fact one of the most powerful anti accident ever discovered they're actually taking a look now at Cohen's on Q. ten in its role in exercise and muscle performance\nOne other interesting no coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where\nOne study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled death and his little was ten weeks or so when used tactically a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and\nSo the three and one product we're talking about these three amazing agree to an extremely safe for a long term used for short term use in any dosage I Know a lot of people out there listening they're thinking is this safe should I take it to my doctor there may be no three safer ingredients than the three we're talking about today\nNow Jason as if the super bill wasn't enough with the co Q. ten for energy the plant sterile for controlling cholesterol and the fish oil for just about everything else purity is putting together an offer you said people can't refuse tell me about this great double free offer you got going on right now today to get people started\nThat's Wright Patt

I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that green tea Kirk human from to recruit\nAnd ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human different spiritual why did you want to combine to read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other worst you quote a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food\nDerived so it's kind of like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resveratrol in one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal in July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood unify on you recap\nSome of these headlines of chill me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't actually\nWind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body\nFrom premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies\nProduce more of its own super protective compound called glue to ... so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue the thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on your list and by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula will be offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the ... which is spelled C.
