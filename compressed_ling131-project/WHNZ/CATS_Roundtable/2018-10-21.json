{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Along the way like I said we try to keep the children out of the court room I'm the guardian ad litem volunteers that child advocate will go into the courtroom for them so that they aren't there we don't want them to be re introduced to a their parents or offending party\nAnd um but there's times when the child has to retell the story and when that happens we I have four days very first court house facility dog I'm named Tibet who is a beautiful golden retriever lab mix\nAnd she and her handler Brenda ...\nWho is a full time volunteer um travel between the courthouse and another facility called ... house and they sit with those children and and the children have to share their story\nOr Tibet sits and less and the child recounts and is able to be um smuggled we called them come hug [laughter] with the ...\nBut um you know to that one of one of the most magical things for me is um if any of you and your life have a six year old child you know that it's really easy to have a six year old sit for an extended period of time um but there was a six year old child who needed to tell a story and as\nA the story was being told Tibet sat on the floor and child massage Tibet ear kind of rolling the ear over and over in her little hand I'm\nSharing what happened for three hours while in the first three hours and I would have been really difficult without sort of sitting there and yes I Am ... and it just is it it's just kind of got into her um frame of mind and she was peaceful and she was able to share everything and and the people were able to ask questions and\nAnd that is that's the gift it's a special guest at a um we partner with a great organization or a land do called a companion a canine companions for independence and this dog is purpose bred for this so different than a therapy animal\nUm Tibet is is special and that you know she really can set and and the pet and loved and and it's evidence I'm On the floor you always we call them Tibet sprinkles and he'll see just a little pilots\n[laughter] after all the loving and um\nSo we're very proud to have that program as well and I think the last thing that we do and we try to support as much as we can is the recruitment of these\nVolunteer child advocates and we need more of them you know we have seven hundred we have over thirty three hundred children and they have some case where some uh some guardian ad litem volunteers that have as many as eight children that they are trying to help a lot of you that's a lot [laughter] it's a big you know some of these children maybe from a family unit\nAh siblings but they may not be placed together and so it it's a it's a calling I think that if you are an individual who feels like\nYou um are passionate about children and about the rights of children and that you are not intimidated to share your voice in your opinion and and go into a courtroom and share your\nThe story which I think any of that you have a a young person in your life you automatically become passionate about them you know and it's so it's it's easy to get caught up in a story to make sure that they're safe because that's what we want to just a safe\nPermanent and letting home and at the end of the day I'm as a volunteer guardian ad litem each you're able to help that child down that path\nYou know ... it's very rewarding experience I'm not going to say it's always magical sometimes there are things that happen and you just you the best you can\nHave you seen a renewed interest in the program since we've had some high profile cases in the area that are brought the foster care system into into the news or have you seen more people interested in ah helping out in that way\nWe do in fact you can go on to the guardian ad litem website and sign up for information session and leave it suggest that anyone that's interested do that first and we are finding that we are filling the seats thirty people at a time where maybe it was Fifteen people at a time I'm were also finding that you know I think some people think that volunteer work is just for those that maybe are retired\nNavy and a stay at home mom and the kids are at school and his hours but that's not the case of guardian ad litem a it's a whole range of professions a whole range of individuals\nAnd I'll get my special applied we need more men they're men out there that doesn't matter if you are working full time job hits the corporation if you have ten hours a month to dedicate to a child\nWe need you we need you because there are a lot of times when these young boys in the system need a male role model to look up\nTo absolutely yeah that makes a lot of sense we're doing the best of the bay on your host Ryan gourmet with me in Studio we're joined by children across borders one voice foundation\nAnd voices for children in Studio with me you were just listening to run a Kennedy executive director of voices for children also we have ... children across borders and Marion ... executive director of one voice foundation so a show me let me go back to you\nHow did you initially find out about these different organizations that you work and partner with\nA it took a lot of ...
