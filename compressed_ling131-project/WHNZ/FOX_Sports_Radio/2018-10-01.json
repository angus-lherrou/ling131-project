the level you have you go back to that play the faithful play\nShe was flip flopping\nAt the time he was making the decision to what's my evidence that he was flip flopping the coach of the cold is Frank right was so confident that he was going to go for it then why did he wasted time out to draw the Texans offsite\nRight if you're gonna go for just go for it why would you do the hard count tried to drop them off says it makes no sense because that meant even if the colds at converted the Fort downplay\nThey did not have that time out and that that puts their chances of winning even further down on the the odds of probability of winning and you know the court said through this three outcomes to any game right you have the the when the tie in the last the win was next to impossible\nAfter the the sack of Andrew Luck the loss was ... almost a hundred percent avoidable costs could've avoided the last\nThe point assuming it's not return for a touchdown you avoid the loss instead the cold the game to the Texas here you got to help you enjoy doing good luck down the line enjoy them when I and and Frank\nReich I understand it the the ... part of it and then people are trying to make this elaborate BS band about how you came from Philadelphia and that's what Doug Peterson did Doug Peterson went forward he was an aggressive culture the eagles won the super bowl and that's a testimony to how you're supposed to go forward and that's why he was hired\nShut up here the idiot All right you are an idiot time and place there is a time and place\nFor everything right and again being aggressive is not a bad thing but\nWhen the outcome is either a tie or loss and you choose the last you're not being aggressive you're being a moron you're being an idiot Doug Peterson in Philadelphia had a great deal of success with the eagles last year a\nMemo to Frank right you're not coaching the eagles Frank your income poop\nOne to one one well not great he's better than one in three which is where the costs are right now to into was not an option now the party shot here asked for the colds\nPlayers and we heard from Andrew Luck there were other players who publicly indoors Frank writes decision to go for it that doesn't mean it was the right decision it doesn't mean it was the smart decision but again nobody wants to tie but in the big picture of uh divisional\nGames that is the preferred outcome\nAs opposed to the other outcome and had the court's been closer down the field and if they weren't in field goal range and at that point if the let's say the taxes were ahead in the game and that would have been an understandable call a tie against the division rival is better than they lost only positive no\nIndianapolis they're not going to be anywhere near the playoffs and now they can settle for mediocrity\nSettling they be mediocre that's where they got to be and I also want to address Brian Billy because I've heard this go around a lot there was a a fourth down decision in the Tennessee Titans game against Philadelphia\nAnd Mike ... decided to go for it and Brian ... who at\nOne point I mean what are we doing here Brian I mean I I like Brian passed we used to have 'em on when I did the ... the show the blitz which are long ago forgotten on the weekends but Brian bill like\nI said that the titans go for the win and it works of rebels a genius the coal try the same and it doesn't work So Frank Reich is the village idiot\nThat's life in the NFL my reaction Brian ... could not be any more wrong it makes me wonder if even watch football on Sunday right it makes me wonder if Brian Billy was out fishing while these games are going on on Sunday I mean he's way\nI it'd be very clear here because I I've heard other people\nPoint out very well one for now it was the right call their worked out you're just a second guessing or not\nIf you look at the game situation the Tennessee Titans were on the eagles thirty two yard line he would have been a forty nine yard field goal attempt if if they chose to go for it on fourth into forced into as opposed to a forty nine yard field goal attempt\nFrank right and the calls were on their own forty three yard line when they went for it in a tie game in a tight yes the eagles and titans Philadelphia if you look at the the outcome of that is not the same situation I Am I'm\nGetting all worked up here and I don't really care about any of these teams but it annoys me when people try to compare and there's no comparison apples and oranges I Will say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat Willie Mays\nJar\nHere so the titans win by three they were down by three when Frank when Mike rebel went for it in the overtime there with Marcus Mario there and got converted the the first down but it's a ... totally situation forty nine years ago\nI'm not so sure about because you know like the way for three times on fourth down on that Dr you're talking about the last war down but the first fourth down was fourth and fifth cheat on his own thirty one\nWhere you have to go for when you're down by a fuel go at it you get overtime because you lose if you if you give the ball to the team so those are understandable okay you're right you're right okay\nNow do you agree with me I Want to come back to my ... thank you yes when you're down in overtime if you give the ball the team event then right that was even a bigger city and then what Frank right the rebels and you know what for data to we're not going to make it let's punt the ball away\n[laughter] that would have been outstanding but oh I was watching the cold time might or might have possibly had a little\nWho asked you on the coasts in that game my impossible you know maybe so while that was how was insane man and those people those same is not the same thing will take some calls eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox if you'd like to be part eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine\nAnd are you there yeah no I've gotten 'em out\nPeople very happy the we'd man free additional show people have been very very positive about that better joy ...\nHe'll be back of course nobody wants to have been done he's over leader Yasser ... how do I feel about the national is not a pigeon assures or though I thought it was a gutsy fall you know you don't got you only get hurt you know you save\nSave him for spring training you want ... or a hundred percent in a grapefruit wind out of the national dog shows you that is more based boys and there is no punishment see the ... the commissioner of baseball Rob Manfred is spineless\nI were to find the Philadelphia Phillies last week ten million dollars for what they did it gets the Rockies not even competing in Colorado in the series but as many people have pointed out\nAs someone that follows the Dodgers and the the fact that the Dodgers decided TK Hernandez you picture the game in Philadelphia I don't have much of a leg to stand on\nIn that in that department but yeah there is you're talking about or tried to play spoiler this has to be a thing where people made a big deal about it if you were a team that wasn't in contention and you've got a chance to be the spoiler man you wore that as a badge of honor well that was a big deal right to spoil someone's party where are\nThe worst day to die and tried to play spoiler but they just suck\nWell at least the giants the pitcher Madison Bumgarner game on friday night and they didn't shut him down for the season because we want to save them for the cactus league at least they pitched it\nBut when they just suck so what do you really there were four games there were four games in baseball on Sunday we say are just play the role of spoiler and if one of these bottom feeder teams in baseball had they been victorious if they won the game or then we don't have\nTo playing games to win the division title me think about those those four games\nWere the one fifty\nBack you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car troop car also helps people get used cars that's right true guard isn't just for buying new cars\nWhere they're certified dealer networking nationwide image or a of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy a real pricing on actual inventory and he'd sip were buying experience what do you buy new or use and withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nTo him throwing three don't make it down the line but that's OK we'll start with this one how do you feel about your Dodgers going into the giants as parents we can just smashing them beaten Bumgarner declared just fantastic [noise]\nWhat's your warm so stood superstar curse your jokes like always how do you feel going into the
