was Memphis\nBecause it comes down to a lack of just general awareness [laughter] if you know you don't have any time outs you cannot complete a path in towns without gaining a first down\nAnd just imagine being on the field if you're still in cleats ...

good thing we need to try to stir things up\nYeah we need to find out if we might have a quarter back on the\nWrong right and as good as say ... is if you don't have a quarterback it doesn't matter how good he is\n[noise] that's right\nAnd that was the thing man when you looked at that fifty five yards screen past that was a thing of beauty\nWhen he was just haven't eagles defenders lip off of him yeah we're talking the linemen and linebackers like they were a hundred and fifty pound quarterbacks or something it was impressive and Joe Buck was like is there any doubt why they took them with the number two overall pick yeah\nThat Dr produced no touched down [laughter] at all and it was just ugly after that oh gosh so we're going to lead incomplete incomplete field\nIn there like when people were people were like well look look what's the ones doing it yeah that's all fine and dandy but if you don't have someone to throw the ball down the field\nYeah which he liked cannot do with those receiving weapons are you kidding me what are we doing here yeah back to the America could you imagine stamp Donald there\nI think that Sam could have been successful friday I Believe he could

it's a running back\nThey had more success two weeks ago on audio back um had a huge day\nAnd\nYou know if it weren't for the most part it bounced off of them and then another team scored a touchdown\n... they just looked like a better team when ... was getting off in Ely was putting the ball in play then this past week the week when this past Thursday when mhm a fake one was going crazy\nBut if you compare those two games it's just like well they had more success ... team would have more success when the quarterback is on\n... it's it's just it's just it's it's tough to watch it\nIs it's beyond brutal right now there's no doubt coming up next from the guy goes studios\nWere just saying he from about great quarterback play you know mhm [noise] I got a man that we gotta talk

I call it a pitfall because people were going to be gas up on Kansas City mhm right\n... me too I Love it ... new team yeah Los bedroom home have the jury they were right now in Studio yeah how's the homes Jersey I'm ...\nWalks around talking like him\n\nBut New England is New England and they are undefeated against quarterbacks twenty four years or younger at home series\nAnd as good as Kansas City is that's going to be a tall order to do remember how good the show and watch them was against him last year\nOh yeah and they just didn't work out for\nWasn't enough it was a show that just wasn't enough very similar game tomorrow night ... and that's ... that's where I'm leaning towards you know so these last couple of weeks they've really open your eyes to the patriots won the patriots or the patriots yeah\nYou know and once you once you and they've done this in the past before you feel like oh my God this is just not going to go well this\nIs ... and then they just do what they've been doing for the last Eighteen years they lock in and I mean they just have superior coaching in terms of making adjustments right so if Tom Brady as an off game they come\nUm and we were just saying that\nYou know we were I was making a comment I was talking to a rod in one of his buddies last year some time talking about the state of baseball and you know urban communities with African American kids and why they just don't play mhm um\nAnd we were talking about in high school when kids are especially boys are looking for that\nJim Wright nobody goes to a baseball did you go to a baseball game ever at your high school no like no one goes to watch baseball games you know why because they're being played during school right a lot of times they are yeah like it's six period beers a baseball game going on outside\nRight now no one goes to baseball games and good point yeah everybody goes to basketball games or by goes\nFootball game right even though baseball and soccer two of the sports than most kids start playing when they're young it doesn't translate when they get older because the fanfare and the notoriety comes from basketball and football\nWell I agree with the last part of that sure I think you grow up that's why look that's why soccer so much better in other countries those little kids grow up\nWhere they don't have any they don't have football well I'm saying soccer you know what I'm saying and other countries they don't it's ... it's not even an outlet you really right\nRight that's right right but they grow up idolizing their favorite soccer stars they grew up wanting to be that and so I think when you're a young young kid we did the same thing when we're playing San ... football we always pretended to be our favorite\nAnd royal play right time border pay ... ... yeah yeah I'm Jerry Rice I call Geri right or whatever [laughter] yeah\nThat's what we do so yeah as it gets later in life I could see why someone might not go out for the baseball team because you can't get any shine for doing that the same way you could if you're a basketball or football player but I think that is for the the high school ranks I think\nIt's way before that when you grow up with the men's popularity of football and basketball wanting to be that\n[noise] and and I say that to to to Tyler Murray's point he did everything that he was supposed to do in baseball got drafted got pay you're guaranteed contracts but the lore and the shine\nOf playing college quarterback I'd call it in college sure at a top university out weighed\nThe professional status and the paycheck of major league baseball\nWell he's still not sacrificing I'm not saying all the actual price so I'm just saying like are the ... I'm just saying that the fact that he's a millionaire now right brain could be playing ... you know in in in in the majors right now\nHe chose to go play college football because it meant something more to him than going off in playing baseball professionally\n\nYes you know what I mean I get it\n... it's crazy right if you're just looking at it like okay wow why here's the kid who got to the political who every kid in the ... who's played baseball this would they dream of and he decided I'm going to put this dream on hold\nBecause if I go to Oklahoma play quarterback when the highs men are when the champion national championship it'll be a greater success\n[laughter] wrapped it in the job being airplane and the majors I Would look at it like this one or two of your favorite foods French fries and a\nApple pie [laughter] All right not together All right well I I like those yeah\nLet's say that baseball is the equivalent of French fries mhm okay we're we're making this a Kyle or Marie comparison\nAnd football is the equivalent of the equivalent of apple pie if you say man you know I could go through some apple pie right now it doesn't mean that you hate French fries\nDifferent from what I'm saying me five million dollars [laughter]\n\n... you can still do\nI Do know still do both are coming up next and the guy goes studios knock on wood you can do both how aggression was rewarded today\nOkay Ben matter here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me you're just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service rover Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their training specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy go dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time hey\nHalloween and we ... we can come in and it'll come November when you start making furniture and the Chinese and Italian anti friends like killing more\nAccurate and I had no pay minimum wage to linger and fat [laughter] and then fill our foreign though on line Helen ...

to see them get their ass kicked you don't want to see them play [laughter] right I Would okay I Would let us what does all of them down but they don't deserve that ah well they don't like that's the bottom line is they would have to have a whole lot of help with\nOther teams that are playing more impressive schedules in beating more impressive opponents\nTo get that chance otherwise you've got to earn it there are no handouts here and that's what I hate is people just crying to the heavens they turn into Sally Struthers\nWhere it's like these poor unfortunate UCF nights for small donation we can get them and the college football playoff and it's like ... up with somebody and beat\nSomebody with ... with it in the tournament sister sister Mary\nOr something like that where you are gene rift itchy yeah\n[laughter]\nDon't believe you hate to gene I hate to see what you're talking about I Love the little guy like if it was college basketball and we've got sixty eight seats at the table yeah come on in UCF make yourself comfortable\nBut if there's four no you can't have the resume they have what do you realize this my notes here this action that actually happened this was the first road game for UCF since August oh big deal it happens there are other teams that are in the same boat\nBut they hadn't based a team that currently has a winning record until the day\nSo like if I hit fifty lay ups in a row and you're like man no big deal if I'm like whoa whoa wait if what if I hit fifty lay up again in a row you'd be like who cares [laughter]\nThat's the same thing with UCF schedule\nAnd I'm Sorry I on the line at least I don't know you hate differently but I I don't I don't hate New York but thank God [laughter] and it\nCertainly did to some hidden vendetta against them

went for it you'd be sneak got it they were up Thirteen to nothing at the time and you could say oh it's not a big deal like\nThey're under nine minutes going the second quarter is just Thirteen nothing if they don't pick that up take give\nA Georgia the ball at LSU what like thirty seven thirty eight yard line oh that's a big gamble by it or is Ron huge gamble and it paid off man I Love when aggression gets rewarded like that\nAnd I think that was one of the bigger calls of the day and helped L. S. U. V. Georgia the way they did\nYeah I mean when when you're in that position you just got to go for it right she don't want to be in the locker rooms and man I Wish we would have or we should of you to go for it you know you you're in a position where is the number two team in in the country and you're here to win the game\nAnd I'm all in favor for going for the when\nThey're not settling for the ...\nYeah I hear you on that it coming up next from the guy go studios we'd go rapid fire style we'll look forward to week six and the team that didn't poll and LSU today in terms of being a ...\nIt very well could be right like which has been ... we've been\nToying with this for almost a decade right now is is the year where Jerry Jones is like okay\nEnough is enough because I Would get in couldn't do it with Tony Romo who I loved we were not getting it done with that perhaps God who I Love mhm so the common denominator in our failure is ah\nJason gear\nBig red yeah man it's trending that way if you had to say one way or the other today I don't think you survived this year\nBecause he's been there a long time in it's not like Marvin Louis with the bangles right where you could just not when playoff games you're old time there and they're like you see what we do next year that that the way it works with the Dallas Cowboys\nSo they are looking like a playoff team and even if they snuck in there they certainly aren't looking like a team that's going to do any sort of damage whatsoever in the playoffs so yeah I expect him to be gone how about the browns man\nThe browns are now favored against the chargers browns are favored by a point and a half or you ... a buying this Brown's love at all\nI Am and I think they're the most entertaining thing to watch in NFL right now the most entertaining as the brown\nYeah I think they are most in of course you are in Kansas City who you know practical homes papa bears team has the rams back into a major theme but when the bears when you are I mean the this gives me the uh the browns when you watch their games\nIs so unpredictable right now on their defenses phenomenal outstanding\nAnd just the lure of\nHaving that whole summer of of of hard knocks and then what ... what type of game as Baker may feel going to have in the fact that they've been in every single game they played in every single game it's hard to look away from because you you never know what's gonna happen\nYou think they're going to when I Do think they're going to when you're going to take 'em again I'm going to take them against the chargers\nIt wouldn't be a stunner and how about this they signed Rashad pair them in the old raven writers round pick wide receiver and you had were shot a restart Higgins who's out this week he's got a sprained M.

playoffs against the regular season game though the regular season game I I gotta feeling the Patriot Kansas City game will get four times the ratings are than the Astros a Red Sox and the reason I say that\nIs a the uh the Monday Night game or what was it used in forget who was a just a ... not used in the saints in somebody or just a regular game a Redskins doubled the ratings of baseball so I I can only imagine what it's going to be with Kansas City and the patriots\nYeah it's actually really funny I was at the gym the other day yeah workout no big deal\nUm and uh I was talking to a guy we're talking about sports in general he was from out of the country and he's like I don't understand the fascination with football you know he's like I'm a basketball guy\nAnd I was like an NBA

right now or what he's doing a that guy never seems to be around for some ... that is a lie that is that while I don't know if that's all I got a minute I gotta mentioned twenty minutes from the show he gave me some credit for what I Want to\nAnd do something I'm very cranky tonight I Want you to know why I'm telling you let me guess let me get snow when you want to you okay All right I Hope you're able to get okay it's very it believe me it's very traumatic what happened to me I'm ... and I'm not kidding around I I I\nI have not slept for almost a week now or five days okay that's that's how much I'm I'm Upset about this you know I I I Do a local show here in Vermont and next to my local station\nOr you know here in Vermont when you want to buy like Delhi sandwiches and stuff like that you go to the local gas station and inside the gas station\nUm they have a local ... and stuff like that the local deli I go to that's why I buy lottery tickets and\nSomebody just bought seven dollars worth the lottery tickets and won the lottery for twelve million dollars and there's no doubt in my mind\nIt was probably the old lady who I what cut in front of me who bought ten dollars worth of of of quick pick tickets I Swear she\nHas my twelve million dollars and I want my money and I'm cranky about it I Swear I Know it was her\nSee I'm not surprised by this one because it's it's ... it's the universe getting ... I did the kiss of death to myself now well and I was going to say the other thing is too\nI I'm guessing there's probably only once one place in the entire state that sells a lottery ticket our eyes yeah why did you did you get that second stoplight in Vermont yet or are you still\nHow can you know I'm Serious I'm not kidding that's where I always go to buy my sandwiches\nAnd Mike lottery tickets and and you get a lot of ah students there is a local college you get guys like me and you get some military\nAnd you gotta get get a few old people no doubt that old lady I Would cut in front of me uh took by winning lottery ticket maybe she needs the money why why so upset split with Trump billions you don't need ... million ... does not need ... million first\nOf all you're getting all that that local Vermont radio money I Know that money is wrong and I don't know why you got to be so selfish\n... it is upsetting I did the kiss it that to myself I ... and it's been bothering me too I really sleep sure I just lost twelve million dollars what do you think ... but you\nAlso have all those RVs checks coming in right weren't you in an artist commercials\nAll I was in ... and those not running a long time ago I was going on with us see Colorado what's happening there\nAre looks like Colorado just scored and I'll tell you this this is a weirdly important game Colorado is the only undefeated team right in the packed twelve\nObviously Oregon has won last but look I don't think anybody thinks Colorado is going to make a run it this thing but if Colorado loses his game with Washington now what you lost a staffer now with the last I think we're looking at a really realistic scenario where the pack twelve is basically eliminated from the playoff picture and we're not even in the middle of October\n... your rights but Colorado's already barely inside the top twenty I Believe so um unless it was going to be Washington which it isn't because they've already up to losses and\nThey ended up losing the game today which there that one but Oregon wins in overtime I don't think the pact twelve is going to be representing a this year as a four team playoff\nI totally agree and it's something and not only are they struggling but what you and I keep talking about each and every week and it stays true Notre Dame is is really ... in on line to steal one of those bits and you can sit here and say oh no today they'll\nLook at the schedule I mean whether it's Florida state's down north western's up and down USC navy like they have said that he might be a little bit\nI'm not saying I'm just saying it's it's not a good day to be attacked Wilson\nA ... it's a good day it seems like for a long time especially my ... it's not a good day to be attacked Wilson a ... it's never a good day it seems like for a long time especially my Arizona Wildcats has been a long long time so\nUtah huge baby they're good um by the way I think the Astros win deep just now so home run it is going to be\nFour to two Astros lead their batting still the top of the night\nNobody nobody out for two now Astros\nUm and ah well up the rhetoric of all people already ... I'm like holy cow I wanted to make sure was them\nI'm like Wow Did he just go deep and yeah he was looking to see the number and I was like oh that's Josh Reddick [laughter] when's the last one I needed something significant man I'll look it on Twitter now people are sent me a ... pictures of people scratching off lottery ticket not\nHer loser and loser on that so I pretty much the shape that yeah it's a nice little metaphor for a living you know\nI I got to tell you guys lose out also so there's no doubt\nThat I would've you know ... a share the wealth that would have been after one the twelve million dollars you know that do you oh you would have shared it absolutely why how what what percentage of ... century talking about here\n[noise] maple syrup for every body what are you talking about house I don't even like maples well I guess you get like a cold cash bay I guess that I get I guess you get nothing flying out on your private jet will do the show from Vermont together you know I've I've been to give you another quick story you said you like cold hard cash\nI was in Las Vegas I was living in Las Vegas do we get a national show\nI was doing the show from the casino okay it's Sunday Morning either either people they're gambling I have hung over or there's nobody around I mean it's pretty empty\nAnd this one guy is watching me do the show I mean it's like six Fifteen in the morning what say that we had no I didn't like it over the years that there's other Sunday okay so long ago and he's watching me do the show I caught a break and he goes hey I'm a big cowboy fan I listen to you\nYou're my favorite you're my favorite I\nI Love you hear such just our the silver dollar for good luck\nYeah it was a pretty bad look a it was interesting because I was thinking about it I remember I was filling in with Mike harming on New Year's day last year\nAnd we ... we got a call from the stadium after Alabama ... and it was re Kwan Davis oh wow seemed like a nice guy we had a stringer on site and we got we got a call from Rick one David seem like a nice kid\nBut yeah not the best look tonight for people who didn't see it will be all over social media tomorrow you better believe it will you going to be on the news I mean he gets down there and he takes them swings I don't know if you set it already but I mean he looked like it UFC guy just on the ground just going for kidney shots it was really really bad look\nI Would have to assume correct me if I'm wrong here already I mean the FCC office has to get involved in\nThat when I was just about to ask you can still be suspended up for an upcoming gave for something that happened in this one just because they were missed by the referees are wasn't missed by the referees and by the way to run Homer now by the Astros or make it a three run Homer and is now going to be seven to two I Believe\nUh this one has over ... I Believe that's chemical just getting rock like that [noise] yeah\nAll I can say about the Astros George Springer grew up in the town next to me\nOr unconscious in the playoffs yeah no it's not fair yeah I also get you jumping on the bandwagon ticket they smoked my team man yeah I I they smoke they smoke to my team out of the playoffs the Indians didn't even have a chance against them\nDo you have a Red Sox to as much you hit the patriots Ernie\nI don't yeah I don't vote for the red Sox at all they they they bother me also I don't know bothers me worse Red Sox fans or or patriots fans they're they're both pretty obnoxious\nSo we've established in the show you hate the patriots you hate the red Sox you hate old women\nYou have pretty much everybody I mean is there anybody that you do like the Arizona Wildcats that aren't even likeable I mean I ...\nI was just talking to like the Bee Gees\nOkay All right there's not a good start\nA sure if it was Nineteen forty eight\nI Wonder what do you mean Nineteen forty eight or there was a rock and Roll Hall of fame the beach you don't say anything bad about the beach yeah\nTy Cobb is in the hall of fame oh I don't want to I was hot I don't I don't want to have a segment on him\nA bully the Bee Gees release are really they had to make fun of them in the hall of fame musicians\nYeah I mean I could take 'em relieve him shame on you so anyway back to a request Davis um yeah I think it may be the FCC commissioner gets involved or or the office gets above ... we'll see what happens but\nAre certainly not a good look I wanted to read this one uh Mike in Jacksonville Artie did I just hear your cold hard say\nThat he thought the season that the season the big ... was the best ... before the season I mean North Carolina guy and then they see the guy but my God and what fantasy land is the SEC not far and away the best the Big Ten is average as grits is what makes that well\nMike in Jacksonville pay attention because before the season every one thought the the the Big Ten was the best conference in college football they had five preseason teams ranked in the top Fifteen Ohio State Michigan Penn State Wisconsin and Michigan State\nAlso people like Purdue to be improved people thought Scott Frost would do big things\nAnd oh by the way we're proven wrong hey Arnie you know what's great a lot of defensive you or I was just saying oh what's great about the ... season versus the regular season what are you actually learn stuff in the season and all this stuff in the pre season doesn't matter because games are played and right now the SEC is the best conference in college football\nYes just ... out out to your defense before the season um we did we did think that okay Michigan was going to be there are still good team but they were going to compete for the four teams Ohio State was I thought to Michigan State was going to be a lot better Penn State of course still with a good year even though they lost to Michigan State\nSo I mean there are top heavy I disappointed in Wisconsin I mean they do this every year I get a couple of when's the next thing you know they've got to losses are three ... they're out of it very very disappointed with them and then everybody else really\nAverage or below average I mean north western's okay Indiana's okay but they're not going to do a whole heck of a lot Ira\nYeah and you brought up the point earlier on Wisconsin is shame on us for believing in them with the quarterback play the way that they have I Know we'll talk about it more next hour but you can't win a national championship when you play you can make a playoff quarterback put like\nOur one in the books will come back we'll go over all the upsets will go back over the top twenty five make

E. C. championship game undefeated against Alabama they go down I'm just saying with Ohio State I feel like we've just put them in the playoff at Thirteen an undefeated victim champion\nI think they're going to have some real tough test over the next\nCouple of others still make it you may still getting with one last there also I don't think that's going to be much of a problem Josh before we started the show had to get this out with George Washington and Penn State falling I'm interested to see if you guys really think Texas\nWorthy of a top five slot um which is I was looking at my I don't have them in my top four but that's why I always like to do the top five if I was going to do my top five central Florida Texas or LSU might get that number five right now\nYeah I I think even amongst the one last teams are still some teams that had a Texas LSU\nThree top ten when when the game's happened that the teams aren't in the top ten now but they beat Miami Auburn and of course Georgia today Michigan by the way nice went over Wisconsin I'd probably have them as a one last team ranked ahead of Texas as well Saddam wouldn't hire\nWe give them more what do we just expect him to win this door we just waiting for ... or ... for them to do something stupid so we can criticize them or what\nI think people just have horrible I mean you look at last year so he comes in there he was terrible they immediately go from five and seven to ten in three they doubled their when total is first year\nThey went ten games the following year by the way that was the year that they were one you know there was a bad force down call against the Ohio State that could have won the game they would have gone to the playoff instead they lose to Ohio State and they have down here last year but that happens when you\nLose all these guys I mean think about all the guys that we want to down your ask Nebraska yeah yeah and by the way to think about all the guys who lost Chabrel peppers Jake but I mean guys that are in the NFL do big things right now\nUm and so I think people just don't like horrible they don't like the ... and then kind of when they lost to Notre Dame oh this proves that horrible is overrated Michigan well maybe Notre Dame is actually really good which we've learned over the last four or five weeks\nBy the way a little set out to the UCLA Bruins fans out there they get their first victory of the season uh and not only do they get it they kick a little booty out there I was a you don't watch it I'm like oh my goodness you see always as like a a year's worth of pent up frustration\nI'm with her victory tonight so they get their first victory I betcha Kelly's you know talking about you know get the monkey off your back thirty seven to seven and that was a decent county not the right I'm a tea or a data about but that that was a good victory by them obviously\nYep and by the way all those a sideline calisthenics have been working out did you have you seen this army is that in the midst of the losing streak\nA chip Kelly has them doing pushups and died jumping jacks and he he had him doing them on the sidelines so like\nThere'd be a you know it'd be a time out in the office would be meeting with the offensive you know coordinator whatever getting ready to go back on the field\nAnd there would be a line there's actual videos of it on Twitter you can search it uh so I think the hard love is paying off and yet thirty point when a dominant performance from UCLA hey Arnie get back yeah I Am in a uh just got to say they did way better than the Arizona Wildcats all\nGuys do you think that doesn't bother me anymore and forty two\nTo ... ... hey hey the best thing that could happen to you is that it happened yesterday and it didn't happen on the air and we didn't have to hear about it for three hours exactly Oh thank God for that forty\nTo detect it but I usually just get punished having to be on the air while my Wildcats play that's why I'm so looking forward the basketball as a Taurus I saw you ... got a great Arizona is supposed to be in basketball ...\nCounting on you they are I think completely under rated going into the year or keep an eye out freshmen brand in Williams from here in sunny Los Angeles that wasn't sunny today Wildcats will be better than people think\nJ.

start off back in Nineteen teens where Woodrow Wilson becomes the first us presidents who attend the world series game this weekend Nineteen fifty the Cleveland Browns played Pittsburgh for the first time in the Steelers thirty Seventeen like\nOh this week in Nineteen fifty six Don Larsen of the New York Yankees pitches the personnel hitter in the history of the world series even better it was a perfect game\nTo this day no other pitcher has had a no hitter in the world everywhere\nYou look at what part are first heart radio ads [noise] download it now [noise]\nThis one yeah I just think looks sometimes in in football you see a teen kind of going in the wrong direction and as good as Casey has been\nThey haven't been the team the team that we saw it just just blitz through everybody early in the season\nThat hasn't been seen last two weeks we all know how lucky they were to survive that game at Denver on that Monday Night by the way Denver which then got blown out by the jets a week later and then like I said last week it was a lot more of the defense the pressure they created the turnovers they created than it was Patrick my homes\nI just don't think the patch homes that I've seen the last two or three weeks is the same guy that I saw the first couple of weeks he still phenomenal but if I get Bill Belichick with a couple of extra days I like my chances\nI I I kind of agree with that he has not been the same Patrick bombs as we saw the first four weeks of the season so\nUm I I Will agree with you on that you remember the left and the chiefs one five you know they did it three different times all three times they lost the first round how many times this team was the first round at home before they get over the ... spent I'm so it's like they're the the the the ... the cubs fans of football's what's going on here\nYeah and that's another thing too is that I I I Love what Patrick homes do and I hope it doesn't sound like I\nI think he's awesome eighties fun I think he's going to continue to be great and I think you have a really you know offensive mind like Andy Reid with maybe the most physically gifted quarterback in the NFL no not the best quarterback and say that but most physically gifted quarterback\nIt's gonna be fun but I feel like we also do this with the chiefs every single year\nThey won that box borough last year it open to see that everyone gets excited they beat the eagles early in the season everyone gets excited right and then they stumbled down the stretch I just feel like we see this with the chiefs every single year\nOh well just as cheap fans will be the first to tell you they can't lose this year in the first round they just can't do it well they all have a bi weekly altered yet if they lose their second game at home no really go ballistic in Kansas City they'll lose their marbles or if that happens\nAnd I was going to see to this thing with the chief says well I mean you start to look at their schedule I mean it is a very manageable schedule going forward they obviously of course uh you know have a game left with the chargers but two games left with the raiders\nUm Denver is not very good they'll get Denver at home\nThey they should have a by there there is no she's not look they do have some tough games they do play the rams that things have been really really fun game\nUm but there is no excuse for them to not get that by not when the games are supposed to I Want I guess the point I'm trying to make I Want to see them tomorrow night Sunday night against the patriots I Want to see 'em and five six seven weeks when people have more film on them to see if they can kind of keep up the pace it there\nIf you were going to do your top five NFL teams right now I'm In what order would it be would it be Kansas City obviously number one I'm I'm guessing ... or routed Kansas City one to um what would you have after that\nWe put me on the spot ... well I mean I mean you got the same story for and won so you might have done as your number three team or my point is this let's say you have the patriots had four number five let's say a number five will make it easy [noise] um this game's pretty much a pickup nor reason the pages are three that point favorites\nIs because they're pointing at home Soviet officials tell you there's really a neutral field not much difference between one and number five or number one two three four and five is that what the ... or what\nArnie come on man this is you're making my point for me about why the patriots are going to win this game is that if they\nSaid I didn't think it was so that close at top with the Pittsburgh's the New Orleans or the patriots the Kansas city's um I I think there's a little bit more the rams I think there's more separation between the rams the Kansas City than the rest of the pack the then we're giving them credit for\nI Do agree right now today the second there is let me ask you where would you have the bears in the mix\nThree wouldn't have been my top five but they wouldn't be that far behind probably like number seven or number eight I think the festival either one of the best in the NFL I don't trust or a a fence on the what six touchdowns or whatever ... through and that's one of the news had in his life [laughter]\nLet's see um lets them do three or more touched on on a couple of other occasions\nA curious to see how this dolphin bears game is going to go\nWell and I was going to say though but there's three in one and the one loss was that melt down against the hackers yeah so I don't know just when he started asking me who my top five wasn't I'm starting to look at the win loss record I think I'd have them somewhere\nI think that the third best a plus plus differential or any other ... I'll tell you for taking out what it's worth considering they don't have much of an op ed was I don't think they they have much of it off and they will do will come back let's look at the rest of the week six of the NFL will get to that covered up that Aaron tour is already Spanier here on Fox Sports or radio [noise]\nCollege football\nWay in the end\nWhen it comes to the LA football coverage on your radio\nWanting sauce [noise]\nThis is Fox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that a war basketball is bound to the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during a game well here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nThrough ... also helps people get used cars that's right through car isn't just for buying new cars with their certify dealer network at nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simple or buying experience whether you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with drew car certified dealers\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car check out through car and enjoy more confident car buying experience some features not available all states\nMessage and gay rights me applying [noise]\nI'm Thomas the bigger [noise]\nI've just been said like I used to turns out [noise] once you're forty your body has\nLess free testosterone and that could make it harder to get into shape so I got back into the game with mechanics [noise] I'm from the stronger with a lot more energy and drive you want to get back into shape region is all you have to do is send one simple text\nFrank's right just text rules to four to four to four to get a complementary bottle of award winning new ... the number one selling free testosterone booster at GMC it's unique men boosting formula is powered by testifying a patented key ingredient clinically research to help them and feel stronger leaner more energetic and more passionate\nAnd guy [noise] shit like that this is two\nNew Jenike samples are not available in stores they get your complimentary bottle tax rules to four to four to four that's R U L eight to four to four to four for\nCall a civilian storey\nNBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

I was just you know that the people like the woman we lived through the you know the patriots almost had to leave town and go to like get or something\nThat I was never the fans I was there\nOr they were going to build a stadium Robert Craft use and abuse my hometown\nBullied and hurt by the way you live in the ... studio easy to say fifty percent or more a car insurance was Geico I just go to guy go dot com or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nAnd the hard part figuring out which way is easier yeah tourism he threatened among the kid that ... yeah don't fans here in the Boston area on\nNever forget it no I remember very vividly and um they were going to build a dome stadium in Hartford and homes that they were\nHaving a hair dollars I wasn't even a taxpayer I was going to crack open the piggy bank 'cause I was like nine years old when this happened\nI you you mentioned the Chicago Bears the going on the road that play the dolphins will say what you want to get the dolphins I think there's one thing we agree with the or they've lost ... should have won the Cincinnati game\nUm look if there's such thing as a must win game when your team's above five hundred it's for the Miami Dolphins if you want to win this division if you really want to beat the patients who are already lost two but you'll have ... later on in the season it starts by beating a team like the Chicago Bears that are coming into town\nThis is a game where a ... has to step up he's looks so mediocre sometimes less than a hundred yards passing against the patriots I've very disappointed though is that a lot of turnovers he's got to do a little bit more ...\nRemember that stat like three weeks ago they're like yeah the dolphins are fourteen and three and tenth hills only\nHe was eleven and one in the last twelve starts the the most wins in twelve twelve starts but that went back before the injury\nThey went back before the injury and it was a weirdly skewed because that was the year that they had a less play schedule and they want a lot of games\nUm I don't think it's a a a pretty night for the dolphins but I'll say this look I was very kind of critical minute ago about the chargers who would they be and\nYou look at who the bears iffy in I mean the Seahawks early when the sea hawks are really struggling they beat the cardinals before the cardinals went to Josh frozen they beat the box to kind of put the final stamp on fits magic right so it's not like the the bears or world leaders either\nA this is one where I could just see everybody picking the bears number one defense in the NFL and the dolphins pulling the ups that I don't know what I'm calling for it but I could definitely see that scenario\nIf your seasons on the line like it is for the Minnesota Vikings\nI guess you love to have it with the Arizona Cardinals come into the town you know the cardinals or you don't want an for\nUm Minnesota can get healthy real quick to two and one I'm not like they're behind the eight ball but certainly disappointed with that record right now and I I don't think you blame Kirk Cousins on that that's for sure so you're not by the Josh Rosen high\nI like him um I just think it's going to take a while obviously it it it's going to take a long time for some of the rookie quarterback to get going and\nUm it's not going to happen right away for the cardinals are horrible team yeah and I was going\nTo say even though I'm they got to win last week Rosen completed a grand total of forty percent of his past is\nYeah I think what Seventy five yards came on the first pass\n... exactly and so I'm with you on this one the Vikings Nita when they can still dial it up defensively I Know that they're obviously not the same team that they were last year but you need a when a you gotta win last week against Billy I think they they get that second street when they need\nHopes take it on the jets the jets all of a sudden get back to five hundred with the wind over this ... who they are the extra a couple of days to prepare for this what their game against doing all they have so many people out I heard on the on the broadcast I think they were like thirty eight healthy parties I\nI don't know I I don't know how you only have thirty eight football players left on your team or there's certainly a lot healthier now but it's not going to get easier for Andrew Luck jets have a much better for the people would give them credit for I think the jets when does want to get back to five hundred\nI'm not buying it I mean look the Broncos they crush the Broncos last week but the Broncos were on a short week that played on that Monday Night against the chiefs\nThey have to fly across country I just think the jets blitz them I just think they got the the right team on the right day ah we look we all love eyes aircrew will come out during the Nineteen yard on Fifteen ... that's not going to happen again stemmed Arnold\nI Know he had the three CDs but if you look again at the completion percentage ten to twenty two\nI don't think that I Know is this just seemed wasn't as good as they looked last weekend the Broncos\nWhy the Panthers Redskins like getting a little bit more high but considering the Redskins uh I think a little bit of a surprise just a fact\nGive me some different music supporters of the movie let's get to our football fix that that that was put me\nIn that mood setter um [noise] I ... I Love a lot of gave them to do with this one [noise]\nAs a soldier Minnesota's the facts against the wall I didn't want to do is go five hundred especially with the Mike Arizona come into town [noise] the Minnesota scores early and often there's the ... Arizona for more than ten points [noise] Minnesota with this one by three touchdowns\nOutweigh the tab against Arizona [noise] three touchdown but Twenty one points very clear or you're doing the math and all that that's a lot of points is all say I I'll stay away from that one Pittsburg\nHe opened his per se plus three down to Pittsburgh plus one and a half and I think there's good reason why people love since the but if you look at look they're they're the fourth highest score a gym in the NFL but they're only eight teams in total yard age which means that\nThis isn't going to last forever and I think that Pittsburgh is a team that needs a when they cannot fall two and a half games behind Cincinnati in the standings which they would with the last year I think they get the win as a road underdog I'm taking Pittsburgh\nStraight up I I agree with you and that was going to be what am I Pixar move on love Kansas City bus to three and a half of the soldier\nBetter off ... more speed I've not buying into the patriots just because they beat the coast of the ... as you mentioned they had about three actually what three four extra days to prepare for this game but that aside Kansas City the second ... even the NFL\nAnd that ... will be only give me Kansas City but the three and a half against the patriots and that's a special number one\nI Will take the exact opposite stance basically all the reasons you said [noise]\nNew England has a couple extra days coming up that Thursday night game they are more in tune with Julian Edelman Josh Gordon getting comfortable there in New England\nAnd I just think this this chief scheme that was the last couple of weeks is not the same chief dean that we saw earlier this year my home struggled last week the Anthony Thomas was out for the year and the patriots are really good at home this year they're averaging thirty four at home because of it I liked the patriots did you get the wind straight up\nAnd I'll say they cover that three and a half at home and doing\nYou know I hate that I liked the falcons because I Do like the south and um even at one in four\nTampa now that the magic is gone James is coming in and that guy how many games does he have under his belt [noise] not enough to go ahead and go into Atlanta but up as many points about it but I think is an easy one gimme of land mines the three\nSo already Spanier is adamant that the culture the worst team in the NFL and I am adamant that already spending has no idea what he's talking about while they're playing the jets at ... like I was going to take the judgment as to not but I see you're taking the call ... yes well it started jets minus three it's down to two and a half\nI Am not sold on the jets I think they caught the Broncos at the right time coming on the short week two new New York last week because of that everyone has jets fever I don't want that jets fever I don't want to go to the hospital so because of it I Am taking\nA the points I'm taking the Broncos to win this came out or not the Broncos the coasts when this came out right there you have our picks do with them as you please please\nPlease please remember now are they are strictly for entertainment purposes only in of course all those other games or ... or or just nothing compared to the Kansas City a New England game\nBy the way I got to pick that game was higher ratings of any other game and the most money bet on we'll be back came off so I think people are going to trip over each other to get to the uh to get money on that or get action on that game\nYeah I Would say so Vegas runners said it's so quick question the radio station is leading with the red Sox game by\nLocal station is going to air the red Sox game instead of the Patriot act so are you doing play by play in the corner for the for the patriots or how does that work\nNo we actually every day of signal also soldiers but that that's okay I don't go for something yeah no no we're ah we're we put the red socks on me but my\nI got to wrap it up by the way coming back a straight out to Vegas our boy Joe this will be the sole light so make sure you stick around for him again thanks to the guys double R.

certain trends if something happens over and over and over again\nAnd it's so obvious you can't ignore it that point is made by RJ bell in regards to this exact same game Steelers at the bangles Pittsburgh\nNever seems to lose very much at Cincinnati last twenty nine times Pittsburgh traveled to Cincinnati they want twenty four times Pittsburgh twenty four and five straight up Twenty one\nAn eight against the spread so even with oh since he must have stunk for a lot of that time yeah maybe\nThis bread is the great equalizer and even with the spread Twenty one in eight against the spread Pittsburgh in Cincinnati you might say yeah but since he's better this year than Pittsburgh some might think okay\nThere's been seven times during those games that since you had the better record Pittsburgh is seven to know on those occasions straight up six and one against the spread so really you cannot bat this game without knowing Pittsburgh dominate incense you why do they dominate instance the\nLot of people don't realize that if you're not from the area I Am\nIt's at most a three hour drive and the sense the fans well I don't want to be pejorative but they're not near as intense as Steeler fan and that's you have half the stadium oftentimes filled with Pittsburgh and I think that's one of the drivers of this Pittsburgh trend in since ...\nYeah and I think a lot of people if they're watching this game or if they're taking a look at the ... and they see that it's dropped down to one and a half they look at it and think how the hell are the bangles one and a half point favorite of the Pittsburgh Steelers we understand the dysfunction in Pittsburgh we understand levy on bell and his whole issue with the office of Wyman calling about and wanting his contract\nAnd yeah we know a little bit about Antonio Brown throwing furniture off a balcony which is probably not a good look for anybody involved we know Ben Roethlisberger is passive aggressive we know he's not as agile on his feet but you can't ignore the numbers and what the numbers are so clearly one sided\nTo Pittsburgh dominating Cincinnati historically in Cincinnati the same bangles team who was fortunate to survive the Miami Dolphins who is nobody is confusing\nAs a Super Bowl contender it leads you to believe that this looks like a good spot for Pittsburgh to continue the trend and pulling off in Cincinnati\nJonah socks dear straight out of Vegas infer RJ bell and Bernie ... are here on Fox Sports radio or you could check out the show on the eye heart radio ... now straight out

you\nThanks Rob straight out of Vegas comes do you live here from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy could comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only part\nFiguring out which way is easier I'm coming up in Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio there is one NFL team\nThat is trying to avoid history\nFor a second time this season will tell you who that is Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio on straight out of Vegas but we continue on here on the NFL here on straight out of Vegas and we go\nTo a game that I find fascinating because it puts one team in a situation that they've never been in before or at least not this season the LA Rams have yet to travel outside of the\nPacific time zone is not done it everything has been in the Pacific time zone and they find themselves in Denver to\nTake on the Broncos a team who struggled a team who is exposed a week ago against the New York jets a team who was completely manhandled and a team who looked gas the Monday Night before when they lost to the Kansas City chiefs and so the LA ramps travel to the mile high city\nAnd although it's only an hour away from where they're at the story of this is whether they are expecting snow there they are expecting temperatures to be as low as Eighteen and his highest twenty eight nothing that the LA ramps have had to deal with this season and nothing that they normally deal with\nBeing that we're here in Southern California and if it gets below Seventy in the last couple of months it's a shock to everybody involved in a shock to their systems\nSo the rams find themselves on the road against Denver on Sunday RJ bell talked about one advantage that Denver definitely has outside of just the weather\nAnother match up advantage you're not going to hear this discussed as much as it should be the rams defense is expected to be mighty good this year it really has been less so than we expected [noise]\nBut they're ... has been horrible the rams runs the fence is number twenty eight twenty eight\nNow what is Denver do well well if you look at TV away there's a fast rushing team in football number one so\nYou've got the best rushing team\nI guess the number twenty eight rushing the fence with Iran and I get it hey the rams are the rams but when you have a seven point underdog and that's what the Broncos are what you want the most is you want to be able to run the ball shorten the game and I think the Broncos based on this that\nCould have a lot of rushing success against\nIran and the conditions might be ideal to run the ball twenty degrees RJ and some snow in Denver\nIf you can remember this is not a a foreign thing too warm weather teams the knock on the Tampa Bay buccaneers for years and years was every time they got to the post season if they had to play outdoors in a cold weather environment\nYou just chalk it up as a loss they couldn't figure it out it was just something they they couldn't it it it wasn't it wasn't feasible for them to try and pull off of when the same thing as far as where you're out on the map\nThe Seattle Seahawks anytime they travel to the east coast for years the knock on Seattle was up early start time it Seattle traveling all the way across country yeah they're screwed Seattle's got no shot\nSo you wonder if the rams who do find themselves banged up and first grade is they've been they are a flood football team you wonder if Denver with that running game as the guys just pointed out and also\nDenver with the weather and the elements of the rams are gonna have to deal with for the first time all season long and something they didn't deal with a lot a year ago\nYou wonder if that plays a major impact in this football game right now it is the rams a seven point favorite on the road against the Denver Broncos straight out of Vegas is brought to you by discover card\nBecome a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year or more at discover card dot com slash match limitations apply\nNext up we go\nTo Indianapolis where the Indianapolis Colts are hosting the New York jets right now this betting line and its move from three and a half early on it is now set at the jets a two and a half point favorite at home against the Indianapolis Colts and RJ belt talked about\nAn interesting piece of information on the New York jets and the rookie quarterback\nThe jets or what I call a one handicapped team if you can answer this question you've got your answer on which way to that\nRule they be able to run the ball effectively really effectively not just effectively but more than that they ran for over three hundred yards last week and they control the game kudos\nBut the coats have the thirteenth best rushed defense by DVR way that's not great but it's above average my guess is Arnold gonna have to throw the ball and I think that something doesn't mean I Love the cold but I don't think the jets control the game like they want to and that's the key\nAnd Andy was ten days to prepare for this game and a lot of the team is getting healthier for this game\nAnd a big reason that the jets had a ton of success a week ago against the Denver Broncos is how well they ran the football the jets ran all over the Denver Broncos\nAnd if you were to just go back and take a look at that game it wasn't so much a Sam Darnell show I mean Sam Donald got the wind and good for him\nThat was all about how they were able to run the football and it was in my opinion because I think the jets game planted I think the jets looked at what they got in Denver coming off that short week on Monday Night football and said what's the best way\nThat we handled the Denver Broncos coming in on a short week oh body blows\nDeath by a thousand cuts three hundred twenty three yards on the ground by the New York jets a week ago because they saw what happened on Monday Night football they saw the Denver was gassed they saw von Miller over on the sidelines\nAh keel ah bent over trying to catch his when when Patrick my homes is making all those plays so now\nThey don't get that team this week ... this is a team that's coming off even extra rest not just a week coming off a week and a half based on playing a Thursday game so when you factor that in it makes you wonder\nHow the jets are favored in this game Indianapolis is not a great team but they're not the team that the jets got a week ago that they exposed\nIn the Denver Broncos being out of gas out of wind\nAnd a team that was run all over to our Jay's point a much better defense as far as ... goes in Indianapolis should be interesting to see how it plays out um next up here on straight out to Vegas here Fox Sports radio Jonas knocks infer RJ bell and Bernie Fratto here on efforts are\nThe Panthers and the Redskins so the Carolina Panthers\nWho won a game last week on a sixty three yard field goal and broke the hearts of the New York giants a few days before\nA man and broke um again by putting up that performance on Thursday Night Football the Panthers go into DC to take on the Washington Redskins the Redskins were embarrassed on Monday Night football during Drew Brees night it was not even close they didn't look anything like the team\nThat they did a earlier on in the season a team that was actually in first place in the NFC ease they were completely manhandled on Monday Night football by the New Orleans saints\nThey had no answers so the Redskins find themselves on a short week\nAt home and are getting one point they actually\nEarlier on when the line first came out the Redskins were two and a half point favorite the shift has been consistent all throughout the course of the week right now it's sitting at Carolina minus one an R. J. talks about how coaching could have an impact in this game you know sometimes\nAfter a by week following the disaster in Chicago before that James Winston was brought in Ryan dispatcher was benched it's a James when sitting back under Center for the Tampa Bay buccaneers and the Atlanta Falcons are his first stop any James Winston make things better tore\nSo Atlanta is sitting at a three point favorite right now at home all sorts of injuries all sorts of clothes losses and a blowout defeat at Heinz Field against the Steelers a week ago and RJ bell says the important thing to do is to look ahead\nI Want to introduce the concept the look ahead line now here's the look ahead line which is you can better game a week ahead of time so right now we're betting we sick but you could also that we haven't you can bet we live in now what's the point of that\nThe point of that is that you can tell how much the line changes just from the one upcoming Saturday game so last week if you're bad is Lana they were favored by six and a half\nOver Tampa Bay now the line is three [noise] what has changed well Tampa Bay had by so nothing\nAnd Atlanta look really bad against Pittsburgh does one gang justify a three and a half point line move no it does not the look a headline is a good guy about when the public is overreacting\nAnd I've talked about it I feel bad for the Atlanta Falcons I think they are ... I think they are so talented and nothing has gone there way it just feels like one of those years one of those snake bit seasons so Atlanta looking to at least feel a little bit better about themselves a field goal favorite against the returning Jamieson when stand in the Tampa Bay buccaneers on Sunday\nNext up we've got the Houston Texans fresh off their exciting overtime win over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday Night Football I just showed Watson was banged up in that game he is expected to play coming up later on and they get the Buffalo Bills\nThe bills who are the authors of the most historic upset gambling wise in recent NFL history earlier this year against the Minnesota Vikings\nAre genius tempted to lean one way and this pick he's tempted to go with buffalo but he's not feeling all that hard about it\nUsually was wise guys this dog or past when the spread hit double digit [noise] this is one I'm tempted to back the Vikings for one reason why\nDo we like the dog typically because of the team by the favor over look that really bad team they're playing that's why they're double digit favor except\nWho did the Vikings lose to a few weeks ago as a Seventeen point favorite the Buffalo Bills you know they're not overlooking this team so if you got the better team focused they tend to win and cover let me give you an analogy in the play offs\nDouble digit favorite in the play offs of covered eight straight when they want to win big they do win big\nAnd I want to go against Arizona who just got a big upset when for their first when a last week will they have the energy to compete here\nAnd he's got a point like you you look at that situation and you look at Minnesota and you'll get Minnesota hosting Arizona they don't want to like nobody wants to be a part of the wrong side of history twice nobody wants to go through that that was an embarrassing\nLoss to the Buffalo Bills and when you factor in\nThat list Sean McCoy was out in that game when you factor and it was a rookie quarterback and it was in your own backyard it's a bad luck for the Minnesota Vikings so you would think to get the bad taste out of their mouth Mike Zimmer who is called out his team publicly several times throughout the course of the season\nHe did it after the Thursday night debacle against the LA ramps on which the secondary couldn't hold the rams receivers under five thousand yard just felt like and then he also called out of steam after they were embarrassed by the Buffalo Bills at home you would imagine that Minnesota is going to be ready to roll coming up\nLater on Sunday\nI Am Jonas Knox is a straight out of Vegas reminder\nSingle Saturday Night eleven pm Pacific time two am eastern time straight out of eggs with Bernie Fratto and RJ bell and then during the week straight out of Vegas\nRJ bell myself ...

here on sports talk radio a lot of people say oh the Monday through friday shows Kiss My ass\nIt's all about weekend overnight it's all about afternoon drive time in Bangladesh which is where we are right now\nSo the cheese that I gave as to who are mystery guest would be all I gave you was the following some Conor McGregor this was the T's this was the hint and we've got people tweeting in trying to figure out who the guest is but the hint that I gave you from Conor McGregor was the following\nThe guard is\nSo it is time for the big reveal ladies and gentlemen on the heels of suck these big Irish bleeds it is time to reveal our guest mystery guest say your name please\nA British Quinn\nOf Dublin is in the house folks the pride of Dublin, Ohio a home of Wendy's and Brady Quinn is here after calling the USC Colorado game for Fox Sports ... on Saturday Night my man what's happening\nBride to be here just a just got done with a game it was what a four hour and that's something that was a walk one or not the best football but Goodwin for us see who's now a control their own destiny at least in the the patch helps out trying to get another packed all championship\nAnd now it'd be honest though I just between you and I know brainy and I do a show together I hear on Fox Sports radio eight to eleven pm eastern time five day Pacific time on Sunday night so we will be on the air uh later on on Sunday and usually it's like a segment or two before it goes completely off the rails when somebody makes a crank joke but we are in the safe\nHarbor here on weekend overnight she can be honest I just between you and\nI there is nobody listening because I'm hosting [laughter]\nBut between you and I when you go into the coliseum how much do you look around and you're just disgusted as a Notre Dame great to be sitting on the coliseum calling us seek [laughter]\nThey don't honestly um you got to compartmentalize that uh because that with this profession\nIs the last thing that you ever want to be the case um and and as much as you want people to recognize you for you being in a former athlete on all that and then you're you know history has a quarterback\nYou also want them to just kind of appreciate you as a broadcaster so they don't really associate you with the gene um and so that's where like for example Kirk street who you know it wasn't Ohio State quarterback I don't know how many young people um replying I grew up in Ohio so I remember it\nBut I think he does a tremendous job of always there just calling the game as he sees it and be able to be critical times but not showing really any bias thing that I thought it was a tough thing is people tend to think that\nYou're going to be biased um based on your affiliations or your alma mater but really they just call the game I see things kind of going down there and I think I was\nProbably over the complimentary of uh of USC and rightfully so they played a much better game that that I think Colorado to type\nA Brady Quinn Fox Sports radio host Fox Sports one uh NFL college football analyst joining us here on efforts are you are getting a lot of compliments I was for some reason tagged and I'm trying to do extensive show ... from a highly rated weekend overnight you and I got people\nCommenting on how great your hair looked during the broadcast did you do anything different did you finally break out the blow dryer like asked you\nYeah well you actually give you some tips so um I I think you said there was like a leave unconditionally area yeah so that that's one of the key you got to have the blow dryer which I haven't quite made it that far to getting the Cadillac of blow dryer as as um but all at all it it you know it's sort of get them outside before the game\nOr you got to make sure that things rocks all those you're putting a headset on and off so that\nClearly going to mess it up uh but yeah no it took a lot of hard work and preparation gotta get it to the ... how the air looks a and look at the table to stand the test of afford to maybe five hour gained about how long it was\nA if Scott Frost wasn't a Nebraska great before he was the head coach are we talking to one and done situation Rascoe\nPotentially yeah I mean I think that the toughest part about\nAny coach in the first year especially though with with you know what I think he will eventually be there is almost got to just you know just just destroy everything and break it all down before you can build it back up\nAnd you know I I think that's the tough part for him is he's got to figure out a way of being able to keep everyone that the ... getting frustrated with what they look like right now because\nThey're so far behind everyone else and then it gets tough when you're the season like this to pitch to recruit um which you obviously need they lack ...\nYou know how do you how do you pitch or what do you say to those kids about the program that you're building that besides saying come and play right away which\nWho knows if there is a much truth to that and then they get into the battle that you face as you're playing a bunch of young players you basically refer to come in and start right away it that means there's probably a couple of years from really being able to be\nCompetitive in a successful so I Will watch it there in the big tent west I think though of your time coming back a bit of that division versus the big cities that's for sure\nI Love what he said after the game when they were asking why the defense fell apart and the first thing he said was well first of all I don't go to the defense [laughter] thanks couch appreciate it thanks for making clear and throwing your defensive coordinator under the bus I I just I just\nI don't know man like chipped it feels like chip Kelly like get like the consensus is you know look this is a a bad situation chip Kelly he got his first went on Saturday is going to turn around but\nLike the Scott Frost stuff we kept hearing that's a great higher that's a great higher and they lose a heartbreak or to Colorado and it's like don't worry everything's going to be All right and their own six they've never in the history of the\nProgram bolt Fellini or whoever has been this bad so I just wonder where they dispatched going in I mean you watch all these teams you you you breakdown tape where did this bad going into the season or is this is a man\n... this was a scene that I think you're worried about their talent or you're worried about 'em ups the quarterback position in particular because um they were going to be without and um you know sort of last year it kind of moved on\nSo ... that are going to be replaced most of the poor position but also just the change in philosophy a change what they're trying to the defense as

while there or if I Would\nNever say this to them because the guy's a monster you actually really nice guy we interviewed him on the air um he's a really really nice guy\nBut I think that was\nLike some like it was something that that ah one of the producers wanting a giant\nClaw machine at a carnival and they brought it on that of course there's a guy inside even mind or did they didn't say hey give them a punch punch him as hard as you can do they know how hard he hits I don't think so he can't Wilder's right hand is one of the hardest punches in the history of the sports [noise]\nHe's a monster he's a heavyweight boxer\nAnd he's got a right hand that if he hits you you die for a minute maybe the mascot nothing would have gotten in trouble Twenty years ago oh my God but just like oh I

of ... [noise]\nThey're marble slab going to chop I'm two inch man that's crazy now which which was did they say which do you not say matter if it's the big toe a goodbye wearing flip flops how you get a hold those things on duct tape [noise] slides\nWhat else you got Ralph role if you've been watching the major league baseball playoffs are used to seeing Marilyn Manson behind home plate for pre games in Milwaukee was sitting right next to front row Amy [laughter] that'll pay\nAs a season ticket right behind home plate you know\nShe tends to attract a lot of ... eyeball yeah\nOr you can go and search front row Amy on Twitter\nAnd uh just make sure you do it when you're not a around your better how that's all I'll say around spotted out to me um and I immediately uh uh uh people showed up on site here with Kay's are is asking me to get off the computer was very very inappropriate\nBut nonetheless a very interesting I heard on the route to be why the weird world of route\nI think we've got a keeper we're doing it moving\nForward\n\nAnd that's when the Michelin Man is on your side you know helping you sleep better and Dr Saper\nNew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart to

Petersburg\nHigh heart radio takes you back to the top five October when he can't\nHire cream staying\nChildren are so I really you\nWe were ... teaching had a ...\n\nMember team Perry Cain\nOr why bring my chance to weigh you are when\nWhen we were\nYou can listen on our ... our radio ads [noise] downloaded that\n\nThe only reason the browns are getting as much hype is they've gotten and the only reason people are excited about the brown says if the as\nAs they have been over the past several years in Cleveland is because they're just not as bad as they used to be there five hundred football team yeah they've been in a lot of close games but there are five hundred football team bottom line\nSo when I see how this stacks up and I see the chargers coming into this game with revenge on their mind knowing that they were the team that the browns beat to get there only one of the season a couple of years ago I like the chargers in the spot and I like him even more getting appoint nap in Cleveland [noise]\nAustin raider this is a lot of gay and when we go to when police stadium or [noise]\nOne pm eastern time on Fox for the kids out there [noise]\nThere was a time when these two teams played twice a year and it was a great rivalry in the AFC West that's right\nThe Seattle Seahawks we're in the AFC West for a long long time [noise]\nThe one moment from this rivalry that is at the top of the list was Monday Night football Nineteen eighty seven when Bo Jackson quote unquote ran over Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth begin at the end zone\nNow I say quote unquote ran over because we actually watch the play it's not like ... we've had a great angle and I don't know who is going to stop Bo Jackson but that's sort of a mythical famous talked about\nYou know it's like when you go camping with grand dad and he tells you about the one time\nThat a sasquatch showed up and that took took a beer out of his cooler a shot gun did and grabbed his crotch and walked away and then you find out years later after grandad past no that was uncle Earl he's just an alcoholic and he likes to touch himself in the park [noise]\nThat was a mythical story about Brian Bosworth gumbo Jackson but ... is the moment got me thinking\nWill be another epic\nIt could go down in the history of the series [noise]\nLike who's got the most to prove in this game so I started scratching my head going down both rosters and I said All right well let's think about it a guy who used to play for the other team check\nA guy who left on bad terms Shaq\nAnd a guy who had something similar to what caused the friction with this former team happened with his current team last week check\nAnd all signs point to march on which we remember the super bowl right you remember that when the Seattle Seahawks decided they were going to throw from the one yard line instead of giving it to marsh on Lynch interception Malcolm Butler interception New England patriots New England when the super bowl Seattle's never been the same\nWeek similar spot not the Superbowl in a soccer stadium against the chargers raiders at the goal line they throw it interception by the chargers Melvin Ingram running down after picking the ball off\nAnd they choked away late so again it goes back to the question we're they wrong you can focus on the messenger all you want or you can actually pay attention to what they're trying to say I may not like it\nIf a family member or a girl friend walks up to me and grabs my love handles and says oh you've gained a little bit of weight yeah that's true you don't do that to keep your hands off me or I can think yeah maybe they do kind of a point maybe there is something wrong there and go figure it out\nLike you could focus on the message all you want you can focus on how it was put out there you can call them out for saying it was anonymous you can call them out for saying they're jealous whatever you want but just ask yourself the question we're they wrong and just because you don't like the opinion of the criticism doesn't mean it was wrong\nBut there's a lot of people who are starting to turn on James Franklin\nGo through find some of the diehard Penn State people who've now all of a sudden looked at Penn State look to James Franklin and said yeah we are noticing a theme here uh every time he plays are three biggest rivals Ohio State Michigan State of Michigan we seem to come up short\nWe've got fourteen games of proof and only three of 'em when our way\nIt's not a good look Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety

I Would go to Derrick car interception only because it was just so reminiscent to Martian Lynch the goal line in the super bowl and it's just like how does that happen again especially when their car made it a point upon\nSigning a well I'm definitely not throwing the ball the one yard line when I've got Marsha ...\nOh oh no oh by the way when did a ah when did Melvin Ingram I actually start playing tight and for the raiders I didn't do that\nNow that I'm a jerk cooks the only guy Dirk ... has been able to find consistently all year a march on Lynch do got paid yesterday 'cause he went and did a promotional thing with this pop up store so he made a lot or how he's showing merge in London a Jew raider fan but I I agree I urge talking before about Marshall edge you've got to feed him\nOver to it all the junk food also have Jericho has like ... ... the owner under in rushing yards sixty one and a half or marsh on I think you're licking building halftime hammer that like I Am so to me he's a must start right Marshall mentioned I see this is the\nFirst time that you can really categorically just say I'm putting in a lot of if it's wrong it's wrong there's no better spot and set up for a big game than here\nIn Seattle is twenty ninth and the NFL against the rush that to me that screams give the bald obese bowed he's a stark you've got to start in there\nI mean John John ... no I think it up yeah they are thinking of hope put Marshall much in the wild cat that's very out so uh\nMy car and by the way than Fox Sports radio fantasy football insiders joining us here on on FX art Kansas City New England we know that's the game of the week it's Sunday Night Football um interesting ... interesting starts in that match up for you my ...\nI think we're getting them all in right I mean I don't mean comes back last week seven catches on his nine targets\nShowed a bit of rushed early on ready should have had a very easy touched down in the first quarter so another week a practice a lot of great reports on Brady with Josh according to people were still\nWondering overall what his workload is right only two catches for fifty yards and a score you know what that target counts gonna rise Brady spending a lot of time working with Gordon they say he's doing a lot of\nIn a meeting time whatever ... however that transfers onto the field that can only be positive when you've got an over under sitting at sixty\nA nice tasty there uh interesting last week my homes even with some of the guardian numbers that popped up ... seventeenth\nAh highest fantasy or score for the for the week five contests but this week you know ... or probably one in three or wanting to depending on how much do you like Ryan in Winston and that other high scoring would be a fair\nWhen you get a team that got embarrassed a week ago and and I'll just go to the Washington Redskins and they got to just out class and exposed on Monday Night football on a primetime stage when you get a team like that I\nDon't I mean don't you have to play those guys the next week 'cause what are the odds they are going to have a bad performance like what are the odds Jordan reads going to have like negative for catches like he did a week ago what are the odds I mean I Know they're banged up I think Crowder is out any Chris Thompson's all\nOur other her so that their banged up a bit so so what are you if you're if you've got the Redskins or if you the Atlanta Falcons who got buried a week ago in Pittsburgh\nI I Know the gambling thought is well you play them the next week or a team usually bounces back in the NFL from a fantasy perspective how do you approach those games\nWell when you look at the falcons they their defenses\nA couple of times and even I gave you thirty one yards on the ground so James what's I think that's the issue right there so talented at you like many great but he also has the bone at ... exactly that's given moving go to Matt Ryan in Atlanta\nThree tight in the running back home it shows the receiver [noise] here's why it looks like a call but the cat is out a lot of\nPlayer [noise] nobody was there\nAnd that book was brought to you about Ninety eight rock and the buccaneers radio network that Atlanta call right there Ninety two nine the game ... radio network in Matt Ryan he got a three hundred and fifty yards three touchdowns even met\nRyan even rush congratulations Ryan he runs for Thirteen yard you don't get that would prevent riots you got to take it where you can get it met Ryan getting machine a much needed when if they're going to stay in the playoff hunt at two and four even roll with the quarterbacks one who's playing right now and that would be backed Prescott\nSecond hand [noise] Eliot ...\n\nPower boys all over the jak right now thirty seven to seven or back off and went up I went through the ban in the cowboys radio network that ... is a big\nReason why this seems ... giving you a hundred and Seventy seven two touchdowns through the air and then also big game on the ground for him that he's only ten yards ... ten Russia's for eighty one yard and a touchdown where to go back ...\nWell you need to pass the ball that Bill Maher running back because uh you know I I tend to ball obey but let's start with uh the charges in Melvin Gordon a pitch\nTo Gordon has the numbers ten five to try to the untold touchdown chargers no Ben doors where the second story today\nA that was the charges radio KFI six forty AM Melvin Gordon is a beach Eighteen carries a hundred and thirty two yards three touchdowns to receptions Eighteen yards they can't stop as long as they keep feeding this young man the chargers are going to keep writing the ship but its move on to talk girlie plane now\nFirst of all the rents principal line topic the quit step under center give to early ... powers his way to\nBack early cuts down is that the knockout blow the ramps have been looking for\nThat was Ninety One Ninety three point one jak bam rams radio network tried girly man and he does it all sixteen carries a hundred thirty three yards two touchdowns to receptions Seventeen yard I\nI mean as you can see these teams are getting better with the running backs I just I just want to throw that out that is true and then my guy on my fantasy football team James Caan are\nHard formation here it is everything is so I guess\nA W D. V. E. one or two point five FM and W. B. Gigi nine Seventy am still live radio network\nDamp countered it might be it last week telling the rock but he has Nineteen carries a hundred and eleven yards to touch down for reception Eighteen yard he's my guy he's the reason why I'm five and when they're finished the book\n[laughter] hey if you're going to go and that's the way to go out right or go to a wide receivers quickly Albert Wilson Alvin\n[laughter]\nThat was an amazing I actually I saw that one live sports radio five sixty Wu am dumplings radio network on the call dolphins end up getting the victory or in overtime thirty one twenty eight specifically for Wilson though even rushed the ball did get negative five yards a six reception a hundred and fifty five yards a couple a touchdown denying targets so of course is the leader that go out of the ...\n[laughter] ... yeah [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay and then the band Minneapolis in Vikings radio network twenty seven Seventy biking to win and that's because that I'm feeling\nGoes crazy for a hundred and twenty yards a touchdown and gotta remember six straight games now the season with a hundred yards are more and receiving though the boy is definitely hit it on his way to the pro bowl and one more Kobe's happening right now there's games happening right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nGo be a little girl was having themself a game that I'm sure the call right there is one of five three the band and the cowboys radio network ... as a couple of touchdowns and\nTo be used to sit on the receiving he had Ninety five yards to touchdown so great game for him those are your fantasy ... up to date how's your fantasy team doing uh\nRight now we're currently a demolishing a someone I'm playing in minor league\nRecord right now do you live in every week I talk to\nYour dorm one a long game by ten point okay yeah and since then I just I mean I've scored the most points in in my league by by far\nAnd you said did you not a fantasy I said you don't do well and now a lot more and more and I just I you know I've got demoted to thank you been ... burger or man Alex still event uh and counter\nThe funny thing is like if when ... bill does\nCome back I had them all

pick up the league quickly what about you know I feel like what do you think before you answer doesn't feel like he never wins\nBy the way when we're yeah he just he's he's never forthcoming with information yeah I'm having a pretty bad season so far\nThat water he dug out last week I you know the three wide receiver got ten points total combined out of all they do it a little bit worse this week a new one negative points before he left a yeah Barkley is about the only guy but my team this year\nMan you already paid your money [laughter] yeah or if they if I might add to that that's gone yeah it's all gone now he's a little bit of that it's gone man\nUh yeah I told you I didn't play this year because I went out winning the last couple of yeah you've been bragging about how you all

in the league he's had some gave Rico case kicking play and then he's got some games were again he's not effective like today where do you come out on markets Mario to a few season you know three four seasons and now\nI'm I I think he's been consistent some gay or last week he had a tremendous game came out through the ball around but then you look\nAt this week and it's just like the whole cage so which guy oh we do or two weeks ago or against Philly which they won in overtime he uh was thirty or forty three attempts three hundred and forty four yards\nAnd then you look at this game and it's just like okay well you can't that can't be what it is and consistency at the quarterback position is the best way to sum up you know talent\nAnd in in their progression as as professionals\nLooking at uh the Broncos trying to come back in this game there's a guy menu standards that can help you catch this country that she had to move out I was a kid that was the catch is under review or they're

Fox bro you have\nThe chief in town taking on the patriots also one of those big days in a New England area\nUh they actually have the patriots favor by for even though we know what the chiefs of done we know how ... so uh we're going to be joined right now where as well as well as he already what's going on gentleman we're we're we're on you already know how I feel I'm man I rattle off all the boss movies the departed\nAh around the town good Will Hunting good Will Hunting you know what's a sleeper actually Nineteen Ninety six let me go see let me ride oh see I was I going to say that\nNo but I was going to think about the good so do you ride I remember that is there any more that we're missing\nA uh what's the what's the one I'm\nWith uh the the ... the younger brother although I'm baby gone gone gone gone good one that's a good one so they got ... may be gone and then they got going girls between the two of them yes they do a lot of gone between those two brothers\nLot of things last with the affluent Robyn [laughter] say about a gentleman it's a huge game tonight dare I say most important game of the season\nI think you're going to say that next week and then we got we got but however for this week yes you can go ahead and say well for\nHim to keep pace with Miami in the division this is a huge game\nYeah huge game but I think it's going to say so much about both teams for the chiefs it's going to mean the day of the real deal patch it's going to be more of the same you know it's going to be what we expected but let me let me throw that out there now this that might be rendered you know useless because of how polish homes is\nWhat quarterbacks under twenty five in Gillette\nPatriots of twenty three and no no that's just that's the ... but you don't know what I Would say ... to that I Would say that everyone's heard that the last few days and then I Know Andy Reid is her and I think he noted\nThat matter it doesn't matter because the the thing and I'm leaning towards the patriots and is although I hate the patriots [laughter] I'm leaning towards them because it is something different to go up to ... to ... a Fox borough and play and\nThe ... gonna defensively they're going to make them uncomfortable\nOkay they're gonna take something away from him and although he is dynamic and he's talented the last couple of games he's shown that he's human that is true and the patriots have a way of really bringing Superman down to Earth Day or the kryptonite of the NFL\nThey find your best thing they eliminate that or at least neutralize it and say hey you got to beat us some other way um but I Will say this I I just wonder if that she used to have too much off for instance we gotta talk about this with the ramps demands haven't really had to feature tiger early\nIn the backfield as much as they did today and then when they were needed to do what they were able to do it he goes forward two hundred yards and wondering Kareem\nHasn't even been utilized enough because of the the passing and then you know drop it outside ... dropping off the tropics kills you do this do that and it's been working there so much off into so potent what did they get down there and it's cold and they start cream hunting you a bit I mean I think they're I think they're going to see more agreement featured\nI I'm not worried about the all fits will\nI'm I'm worried about Kansas City defense now if you're in the air berries doubtful and so it was just in Houston their best pass Russia\nThose two players missing off that defense\nMakes Kansas City a different deep fit into now you can't\nPut Arab Barre one on one with Rob Gronkowski now you have to give them safety help over the top you got to put a corner on them now you're out of place so now you you have the you know the Edelman in in in these guys the Hogan\nLet's not forget sunny Michel ... shells playing an all pro you you're talking about you know I see so many similarities in him and James Connor in the way that they both kind of came out of nowhere on a plane out of their minds he gave rejuvenation to their ground game for sure\nI'll give you that because also the way that the patriots work when you have a son who was show and then also you still have white in the back uh back to have you just have so many different ways that they'll do all of a sudden\nDrop something you didn't even think about but there are some new guy you know say hey like the credit to the patriots\nThat they'll say you know what sentiment sales working today we'll throw in Fifteen scream prizes today yeah or they'll do something that you that most teams don't do because they'll just say if it ain't broke don't fix it and they've been able to do that for years they'll find that one thing that works well Julian Edelman you to death\nOr I you know what I'm interested to see it will see more Josh Gordon is a lot fewer perceptions over the last couple of games\nIf it will give his hamstrings okay that's a formidable weapon for Kansas City to worry about not having used in a very\nIn the line up for Kansas City is going to be tough for them to go to Ross Perot and beat New England is just about a month so then you're you're you're picking New England I'm going to pick New England on this one I always pick against New England [laughter] uh yeah I learned my lesson\nYou that we've all learned our lesson there are so I'm with you\nEnded in the sec is crazy so a Tennessee\nTitans you got to do better man got ... just lets you know what those credit the titans is most anybody in the country has talked about then\nWe talked about the Tennessee side for probably a total two minutes today and that is true that was impressive that was impressive so that's accredited him that they've come up we got two minutes out of us as we can versus maybe usually about Fifteen seconds a you know what I enjoy it I was pleased with today a that is the tape is Marie ...\nFour Russians and you can maybe even say the entirety of the Vikings and that they knew to give him the ball in a rush for thirty two attempts and a hundred and Ninety five yards as a team of specifically with Marie twenty four Russia's hundred and fifty five yards a touchdown ah was able to even you know grab another ... a few yards from my book", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day":
