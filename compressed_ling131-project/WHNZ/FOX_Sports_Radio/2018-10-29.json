certainly ... calling me at a very stressful moment of dodge again last night I just got a new phone didn't want to throw it across the room so I chose to let it go to voice in I'm Sorry my GI Joe

what I've always said it could be worse you can be a Dodger fan so that's that's I mean\nSpeaking of which just lie but Jesus going to make an appearance at Chavez Ravine and I have no idea reason why I'm asking is because we're only in the first inning and keep in mind the over under on this ball game between the red Sox and the Dodgers that seven and a half will\nPost these incursions showed up Steve Pearce with a two run shot in the top of the first inning did the red Sox that's you nothing advantage but David freezing the bottom of the first\nFirst pitch you saw you what the opposite field

National Football league action all across the south Los Angeles rams they are now eight noticed season thinks of this government\nGoing to grab the favorite bring it out the Fifteen any\n\n\nYeah rams when it twenty nine twenty seven to kick the ball up after a field goal was about to a farm to play in the fourth quarter and Rodgers doesn't even get a shot to when the ball game for Green Bay\nColds go on the road and beat the raiders forty two twenty ... twenty five cares for a buck thirty two and two scores\nAnd the Arizona Cardinals have Chu wins this season and they both came at

Sunday Night Football from Minnesota\nSaints right the ball right now they're inside the five your line knock on the door there is no ... again it's the games opening position\nAnd we got all of a sea or the games around National Football league from this morning eagles over the jaguars twenty four to Eighteen Bengals beat the bucks thirty seven thirty for\nKansas City chiefs continue to dominate Patrick my home's twenty four thirty four three ... three through the airport CDs chief with the Broncos thirty to twenty three James Caan or two hundred and twelve yards total and to do the Steelers thirty three Brown's Eighteen joined\nUs back to you thanks saved by the way did you know the last ... can you guess the last quarter back to ever beat\nThe Steelers in Pittsburgh last Brown's quarterback every beat the Steve I'm going to take a guess and said Derek Anderson ooh good guess above what would you like a shot at this last round quarterback to beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh\nWhere are you going [laughter] that's a very good guess Eric robbers you want to take a stab but this year a [laughter] a Johnny Manziel\n... in debt that also is a good guess all of those are incorrect though Tim Couch would be the correct answer can watch a few thousand three two thousand three\nWell All right guys and at that yeah that was the three I Believe it [laughter] I Believe Abe Lincoln was celebrating these ... and yet at that time but that's the last time the browns won in Pittsburgh total dominance a but we got more on the browns later on because that's getting real fun\nAnd it's getting real fun there and Cleveland All right thanks Dave uh we're coming to life and the guy told Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would guy go go to guy could comical eight hundred nine four seven out of the hard part figuring out which way is easier by the way did Abe Lincoln actually have a ... that I just recklessly say that on the air\nYou just regular ... says I don't hear well don't tell them I said okay now I don't know if a small\nForce courts I just go get a lot of scores were you okay so are we are a so coming up in about ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio I think\nI think somebody ... miss an opportunity to do one of the all time great things in recent broadcasting history okay one of the all time great things I think they missed an opportunity and that and I'll explain what that is about ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio so we have got\nSaints Vikings and one of the matchups that I've been looking forward to um as much as any game all year long saints in Vikings the saints of actually scored\nA so we're early in the first quarter a New Orleans where they seven nothing lead over the Minnesota Vikings a touchdown for New Orleans was I Believe Alvin Kamara a album Kamara on a toss from\nDrew Brees I Believe they're counting that as a touchdown pass for you fantasy football players out there who have been job to buy ladder roles and flips and tosses and all of that\nBut the New Orleans saints have a seven nothing lead over the Minnesota Vikings and we will keep you up to date on that moving through out but\nI look at the saints and the saints\nHave won five in a row outside of the first loss of the season and everybody gets tripped up the first lost the CDC great teams lose the first week of the season all the time you know ... you don't know what the game plan for you don't know anything the saints won every single game sense and so New Orleans has almost quietly\nBecome one of the better teams not only in the NFC but in the NFL and Minnesota and you give them all the credit in the world after that Thursday night game against the rams a few weeks back Minnesota\nHas rallied strung together some wins they're starting to get a little bit healthier Everson gripping a dealing with his a mental health issues is coming back\nAdam stealing or maybe the best receiver and football he's been dominant um they still are dealing with some injuries often supplying a running back to album cooks been banged up a couple of the injuries on defense but you can't deny Kirk Cousins up to this point has lived up to his contract\nYou can not like the guy you can think that uh you can hate to use like that crap or you can think that the Redskins made a a great decision by letting him go you can think he's overpaid you can think he's not an elite quarterback you didn't deserve that kind of guaranteed money no doubt about it Kurt cousins has been\nA fantastic addition to the Minnesota Vikings and if they don't advance or don't get it done this season in the NFL it's not going to be because of her cousin he's been awesome\nBut the reason that this game as sentimental to this show is because we were on the air when one of the all time great plays in NFL playoff history went down to ... and I were doing the show last January\nAnd while we were on the air the game was happening and so of course it's a live game and it's a playoff game when we've got to pay our respects to it and so we're doing we can't really do\nBy play 'cause that's not legal and we can't really you know delve into broadcast on the radio side of things so that's not legal so we did our best to kind of paint the picture for ya I feel like I did a a pretty good job as a professional broadcaster I feel like I did\nI assumed Brady could hold up his end of the bargain since the guy does college football and the NFL for Fox I'd assume that Brady Quinn a broadcasting professional\nPart of one of the top teams with Fox that you see every single weekend on your TV I assumed that he can handle the responsibility as well to a here's how it sounded last January\nAs a one time element you know ten seconds but to the pass rush right now I mean the saints are really getting after this off as a wife or the Vikings\nThat's too bad I mean it ... the the crummy part about all this has Minnesota and we're just going to crack jokes and bus balls while there's a team was playoff fate is on the line as case it was back to throw going deep right side and uh oh my God he caught it step on digs\n[laughter] you got it on me and the game is over Stefan gigs just scored on it and believe me [laughter]\n\nAnd the biking just won the game ... I feel like it's like somebody like somebody gave their ... I got ... kilos of math and told them to bark at the neighbors\nThat don't care how many jobs he played it that laugh like that in mind that the guy who's never smoked\nA cigarette in his life breeding I've joked about him and I've never smoked a cigarette in our life never never ... ... and I asked myself okay if you never smoked a cigarette when how do you sound like that\nAnd and I would I Would get if he's in the elements you know if he's like in and I did a rod race and he's in Alaska hanging out in some ... during the show or he's on the side of the movie alive trying to decide which one of the victims in the plane crash he wants to eat I get it look your voice is hoarse I understand it the guy who lives in ... South Florida\nHow was that boys [laughter]\nI don't understand it\nWhy couldn't Fox has figured out a way to get Joe Buck from the coliseum to Dodger Stadium to do both games\nNow normally I Would reach out for a guest a but we can't even get Steve to save her to come on the show and he's our update anchor and we can't even get Brady to show up and he co hosts the show with me so we've got our selves an actual broadcaster with us his name is David gas gone I you know him as the gas man\nGave gave a gay guy first okay that's an allied first of all Dave\nCould you pull that off as a broadcaster yes okay but what a pain in the ass right\nIt is in fact distance from the coliseum Chavez Ravine six point three miles and normally if you're like in the mid west or maybe down south it'll take ten Fifteen minutes yeah\nRight now according to map quest it'll take you thirty five minutes of all evil that go six point three miles from the coliseum the Chavez Ravine\nKnows that taking the streets or the freeway at the freeway that still wrong that's probably taken a helicopter at the door on um yeah yeah it's it's a it's brutal man and look there are people that work here that'll leave games at the coliseum and how far away the Fox sports radio studios to the coliseum or how far how like no traffic what's the drive\nNo traffic if I leave my house and make it here and about\nMaybe twenty eight thirty two minutes yeah I've heard Ninety minutes following games that's how long ... Ninety minutes to get hit depends on which way you go\nIf you take the tea and you can kind of get here a little quicker and they'll get many details for the national audience locating point\nNine miles it'll take you thirty minutes from where we're at right now\nThat's no traffic it's unbelievable yeah we get plenty agree and going from the ... okay\nBecause today isn't a today in LA is a nightmare for people listening around the country today in LA is a nightmare all the sporting events that have gone on let me get this correct so the kings played a day game right by the rangers right\nThe clippers are playing tonight correct\nThe Dodgers are playing right now correct the rams played earlier\nAnd isn't there like some a crummy soccer team that plays MLS and Kansas City to gun L. A. F. [laughter] you know what I can imagine you're just a die hard LA sports fan you've been drunk for ten hours I get you just watching every single game you think anybody attempted to go to every single game yes sports\nIllustrated has a couple of guys that were doing it and ah they've been chronicling the entire journey but just the ... that's the other thing too you're mentioning it your soccer and he got baseball that's a lot of non activity that's going on you're just sitting around you better be drinking or did you hear Bob\nCostas his criticism of or did you guys hear this one this is great Bob Costas I heard was on a one of the local shows out here in LA\nAnd he was upset that Joe Buck was calling Thursday Night Football\nAnd then going to call the next game of the world series and he was upset because it was like Fox trying to indicate that the NFL and they Thursday night game between the Texans and dolphins was just as worthy to have Joe Buck as the world series was\nOn um hey Bob get a clue man it's cold hey we'll give you the rights to the NFL on Thursdays but we need your number one guy's [laughter] do they not get this and I and it's more you have you seen the ratings [laughter] why did I wasn't that many gear\nBetween a between the end all cs the world series Thursday Night Football I've had so much Joe Buck on in my front room in my loving weeks dude like it's ridiculous he he buys will be like a fourth roommate just kind of thing I ... I Can't get I think Joe Buck's fantastic and for all your twelve year olds out there who are you are you in mid thirties\nEarly forties um\nBroadcast professionals who go dressed as twelve year olds when your teams\nIn a big game crying because Joe Buck and John smokes aren't saying a knife not nice things about Japan ... they're not paying nice to my team they want the other team to what they wanted Milwaukee to when they were saying nothing but nice things yet because Joe Buck and John smells would rather stay in Milwaukee and extra three days in LA what is happening here\nMan trigger law current and former employees of all her throat\nYawn ran the palm palms down stop being ball washers just call it what you see that's it\nJoe Buck and John small aren't rooting for the Dodgers to lose okay the Dodgers are going to lose because the red Sox are better\nIf we can ... because right matching maybe on the take I and and again I'm here to make any reckless claims are but it but it does appear to be a little bit fishy and what we're watching All right uh Jonah socks Fox Sports radio we've got more next year from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\n\nThis story is called the ugly truth about timeshare rethink you've known your family fiber about buying a Tom sure you need my help hello I'm ... now a CEO\nThe founder of Wesley financial group two years ago I started helping votes cancel their timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called the Tom shirt cancellation industry\nTom shares the only thing that you can buy that you can't show me how much is going to college or when it's going to end what do you watch I'm sure you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they won't for annual\nMaintenance and assessment face sound crazy the crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your families\nNow going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to de calm office now I'll guarantee if we can't cast your your chapter contract you'll pay nothing\nGoing for your free information get eight hundred forty six Ninety six hundred that's eight hundred forty six Ninety six hundred eight hundred forty six Ninety six hundred\nMinutes ...

AOL [noise] download it now [noise]\nStaff who have also been had coaches Todd Haley has been a head coach did he have success no great Williams has been in the NFL for a long time did he have sustained success and other places yeah there were a couple of spots he was great with the saints\nBut Craig Williams has got a ... is is is a pretty respected head coach by a lot of people\nAnd so Hugh Jackson was trying to make it clear to those two guys I'm the dude this is me\nThis is what I've got this is my title and he was pulling rank on him\nAnd I remember watching that thinking oh this is something you've got to keep an eye on moving forward and now what we're hearing is that there is friction and this according to interrupt but for the NFL Network that there is friction between Todd Haley and Hugh Jackson\nAnd so the Steelers beat up on the browns on Sunday the browns haven't won in Pittsburgh since two thousand three\nAnd you've got all this sort of talk all the sort of just ... dysfunction all this sort of back and forth between Haley and Hugh Jackson and and now report that comes out that if things aren't cleats cleaned up soon it could lead to one of them being gone\nA most likely Todd Haley but there's not a whole lot of people out there that are clamoring to keep you Jackson around because of his win loss record and so Hugh Jackson a week ago who talked about how he wanted to have say in the ... and play calling duties apparently things have only gotten worse since then here was Jackson following the game on Sunday\nThere's nothing wrong with my relationship ... yeah that's what I said last week and obviously it had legs but I've never said I wanted to take over play calling I said I Want it to help that's it so today and all of a sudden it's just a big thing because sure I mean everybody's gonna look and say well what's going on but he was going on we need to get better we need to coach better when you to get better\n[noise] here's the thing about the brown ... I think we all sort of got them confused I'm ... and we Brady and I've talked about this earlier this year when it came to the Cleveland Browns I think that um that people confused good with better when it came to the browns\nBecause it was almost like after the browns won two games\nPeople thought they were good team\nThey weren't there not a good football team which is better than they were\nSo when you're watching this team go on the road and get manhandled by Pittsburgh and you're watching Baker Mayfield take a beating and be noticeably limping after a game and then you've got to coaches who can't seem to coexist and are are not seeing eye to eye\nThat tells you that they are a long ways away from being good\nAnd of those three people involved in the latest issues going on with the Cleveland Browns whether it be Hugh Jackson or Todd Haley or Baker Mayfield which one would you say is going to be around Cleveland longer Baker Mayfield\nI think if there's got to be a change they're going to part ways the books you Jackson and they're going to part ways with Todd Haley\nIf they decide to part ways with Hugh Jackson and promote Todd Haley to interim coach that will tell you everything you need to know about the thought an opinion on Hugh Jackson in that organization\nBecause they're not a good football team it's going to be a little while they're better than they were\nYou watch Baker Mayfield he's supposed to be an accurate pastor that was one of his strengths coming out of college Baker Mayfield always accurate with the football he's under sixty percent completion percentage\nOne of the knocks on him coming out is a little too small all of a sudden the weather's starting to change he's starting to play in difficult environments and he's hobbling\nAnd talking openly about how he took a beating in that game\nAnd that his body seen better days you know says stuff like that I get ten or twelve year veteran Kris Chandler was saying stuff like that towards the end of his career Steve to burglar stay in saying stuff like that towards the end of his career when he had a splint on his hand it looked like a Nintendo Power glove\nBaker Mayfield already saying that and he's like seven games into his career so if you're the organization you've got to look at this and say All right we're ... we're invested in Baker may feel that's going to be the guy that ... that tour with here he's the one that's got first priority\nOur head coach has got an awful historically bad win loss record\nAre sensitive coordinator apparently doesn't like taking orders from the head coach and apparently doesn't know how to handle or young rookie quarterback\nAnd then we've got a quarterback that we've invested in\nHussein and who is going it's going to be Baker Mayfield I I Would I highly doubt they would make a move in season if they do I think that just illustrates that you watched on hard knocks the sort of a friction you saw early on there and training camp between Haley and huge acts in what you saw there\nWas a bigger deal than we realized and it's only deteriorated since so it's like that that's but that's part of the reason why people don't want to be on hard knocks what people don't want to play on Thursday Night Football I don't want all my flaws exposed\nI I don't I don't want to do I mean have you ever had a fight with your better half your at home you guys have a fight right before you're about to go out\nLike the last thing you want to do is go out and see your friends or go to go to dinner with a bunch of other couples when you guys are in the middle of a fight because you know oh it's going to take is one comment one shot of tequila\nA one compliment from another woman and that thing starting up in a hurry it's like dry brush up the side of the road and flicking a cigarette at it it's over\nLike if you're a bad team you don't want to go on hard knocks or be on Thursday Night Football you're gonna get exposed and the browns are getting exposed Jonah socks Fox Sports radio\nOr you can get me on Twitter at the Jonas Knox has become the alive here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios are coming up

is what we got him just we did what we get them\nWe all got a text message rate from ... birthday text message\nThat's true [laughter] would you like to know what are my text message to him was sure well I'll\nTell you an hour for [laughter]\nI don't want to get in trouble and there are two updating you on the world of it is a it's a gift [laughter]\nThat is again [laughter] this is something that I Will not mentioned on the air\nOut because we haven't mentioned it before I miss on overnight so it's just a a letter it baby I'm yeah by the way a World Series and update end of five the red Sox holding onto eight to one lead acquaintance ... giving up a two run shot just Steve Pearce\nUm and the Dodgers are trailing to one looking to stave off elimination and the world series by the way this won't be the first time that he peers from Boston as crushed LA\nPaul Peirce get it Paul Peirce\nAnybody else that I see what you did it did there that'll\nBe stolen by somebody promise you I'm All right so I Do want to let you know we are brought to buy discover a become a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learned more discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nI can say that as as long as I've known you that's the first time that you've actually lost me with that one I didn't even think about him\nNext level man Muslim wow this is what I Do ... well I'm All right so the New York giants are a landfill huh\nThey are so bad bad the giants are so incredibly bad and a and B issue is really what's going on and off at ... and when ... brought in and Patrick ... supposed to be\nThe guy to fix the ... and the lows offensively and then you drastic one Barclay and then you address the old line in the offseason you'd assume\nThat the old line and the running backs and the receivers and the quarterbacks in their head coach in everybody would be fluid and everything would go well unfortunately it is not the giants have lost again here was patch or him earlier today\nYou can score Thirteen points in any game at any level and expect to win so we you know once we got to unlock that going to get that better so whatever it is we we got to get that figure it out there put the ball in the end zone more often [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat is a so few score Thirteen points in baseball her soccer that's good it's actually pretty damn good that that's like\nOne of my uh\nThat's like one of my things when people ask me about golf\nJust asked me a bubble asked me a random question about golf I'll pull a patch rumor and just BS the entire thing but make it seem like I Know what I'm Talking about ... how many uh PGA Tiger Woods one well here's the thing about Tiger Woods\nIt's not so much how many he's won it's how many he's dominated and when you factor in how many he's affected it just by being near the top the numbers out of this world\n[noise]\nDo you do what was he talking about what what is that you were talking about here's what I think happened\nIn New York and I'm Serious about this the giants did what all of us have done\nEvery single year every time we've tried to predict the NFL breeding I made our season predictions we go division by division and every year somebody screws up somebody picks a team to finish is dead last every year we all do this media us fans everybody does this\nI think the giants misread their own team\nI Swear to God I think the giants went into this season thinking they were better than they actually were\nBecause now you got a potential fire sale going on he like Apple's gone demon stacks Harrison is gone a Kyle letter is being shown on the sidelines as a guy who potentially could be the quarterback of the future but Kyle letter was later round draft pick and he hasn't even suited up for a game this year\nI think the giants thought they were going to be better than they were\nIf this was all about building towards the future why did you take a running back at number two you had the quarterback of the future sitting there I think the giants took the running back because they didn't realize how bad off they were with Eli Manning\nAnd so they took the running back because they thought they were in when now mode only to find out when now we might not win again\nThey completely overvalued their own team their own roster and that's why the giants are in this state that they are Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio another hour here next and fs are\nIt's been\nMale or here everybody's got to do is

third home run allowed and the ball washing Dodger fan boys that make up a majority of Fox Sports radio staff here have all run out into traffic simultaneous [laughter]\n\nIt was a good thing I realized volvos microbes on dude I rather leave the room yeah yeah by the wrong if you heard at the banging in the background that was Roberts throwing his headsets on the ground this is ... Roberts is acting like I was the other uh Dallas game by two weeks ago\nOh my God this uh this is a bad or there's going to be a lot of fallout from this series see it's going to be bad right now why doesn't day Robert shake out ... he's given up three home runs why are you leaving them in the game I'd rather have crush on there then some of these other guys at\nA pitch though the pen honestly ... who do you trust\nAnd another ... right now in our cars are not handling it damn badly and giving them is after oh my God that's rough but ... listen\nListen uh I Do have good news for Dodger fans that are feeling the pain I Do have good news right I've got good news\nOr there's been a lot of talk about no World Series titles in a long time for the Dodgers the good news is you have seen two World Series titles clinched at Dodger Stadium\nOh no\nI Do I Do I Want 'em your doctor your Fox Sports radio we our company live from a guy go Fox Sports radio studio so we'll keep you up to date I Do not plan to do a full segment on baseball but sometimes you got to shoot from the hip here and that you never know what's going to happen um Dodgers no winning a ... I I Do want to mention this though\n'cause we were talking about this earlier when I was making the point in the NFL so you saw the the Tampa Bay buccaneers lose on the road to the bangles the Cincinnati was dominating the game\nA James Winston was atrocious see through for interceptions he was benched Ryan Fitzpatrick came in he was Lebanon Fifteen through a couple of touchdowns no interceptions a drop him down the field got him back into the game actually tied it late with a to point conversion\nAnd then they went down and Randy bullet kicked the game winner eventually for Cincinnati but the story are coming out of this game\nI reached out to somebody that is close to the organization I said hey I'm On the outside and maybe I've read this all wrong but it said\nJust looking at it from the outside it just appears that team enjoys playing with Ryan Fitzpatrick more they seem to rally around Ryan such Patrick am I wrong you said you're not wrong you're a hundred percent correct and this is somebody that is really really close to the organization\nAnd so I tried to poke around okay what's the future what is going to happen or they are they going with moving forward and he said you know it's too soon to tell\nHere's all say we do have an example of this in recent years and the example took place back in twenty Thirteen with the Chicago Bears in twenty Thirteen Jay Cutler\nWas looking at a long term contract extension but Jay Cutler ended up getting injured and he was out of the line up for the bears\nAnd so they went with a veteran backup a guy who kind of knew the system a little bit and Josh McCown\nJosh McKenna was brilliant he was fantastic just like Ryan Fitzpatrick and the bears made their choice the second ... healthy they put Cutler back into the line up\nAnd the bears were not the same offensively and ended up missing the playoffs afterwards and if you talk to players on that team or people that covered the team at that time they'll tell you the biggest mistake they made was going back to Jay Cutler after he got healthy because they were not the same team offensively that they were\nWhen they had Josh accounting\nAnd so the bears doubled down on that and they gave Cutler the big time contract extension afterwards and the rest of us history if you're the Tampa Bay buccaneers you got to figure out who your riding with here\nBecause I don't see how\nYour cutter and James Winston coincided moving forward you either need to determine if James wants singer guy or dirt cutters your guy or neither you guy you keep Brian Fitzpatrick around you're finding off into minded head coach and you develop a young quarterback like other teams have done around the year around the league\nBecause at this rate it is not working and when I can see it and you can see it watching box game that it is not right there that there's something off that that the backup quarterback it's a better reaction and the huddle then to start or does the potential franchise quarterback something's not right\nIt's a bad situation and it'll be one to watch moving forward right Jonah socks Fox Sports radio uh we're comedy live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios get me on Twitter at the Jonas knocks coming up next\nA there was a team that made a decision on a quarter back a few years ago and they got crushed for it and they got

[noise]\n\n[noise]\nJonah stocks Fox Sports radio [noise] so\nUh it was a bit of a correction I been corrected by someone of a celebrity [noise] by a first date but I made earlier on the show or we will get to that era momentarily on Fox Sports radio Kirk Cousins was nearly\nIntercepted again on Sunday Night Football the Minnesota Vikings trying to make a game out of this or the Vikings trailing the saints thirty to Thirteen\nFive thirty eight to go in the fourth quarter of this game on Sunday Night Football now a second and goal and cousins are trying to get the Vikings into the end zone a down to the one yard line so Minnesota will have a third and go this is a pretty disappointing a performance by Minnesota by her cousins and I said it earlier man\nBecause he's the new guy he's going to get the blame don't kid yourself he's a better quarterback than Kay skiing image but you go by what's different and what's different is that correct cousin\nThis is the new edition and so now here he is on a big stage the biggest game of the season for the Minnesota Vikings and they've come up small so far so he's trying to get into the ... now ... sneak her cousins has been stopped now we've got a fourth in golden Minnesota or we also have\nThe world series going on game five to ... a Boston Red Sox looking to eliminate the LA Dodgers\nThe red Sox are they five one leader bottom of the eight to one on one out for the Dodgers are trying to stave off elimination but it just ... looking good at it looks like a Boston are just now five outs away\nUh from my winning another world series and eliminate the Dodgers the Dodgers losing 'em in the world series for a second consecutive year and the second consecutive year at Dodger Stadium we have a touchdown\nWe haven't touched down in Minnesota Adam was feeling now who nobody knew about an hour and a half\nAgo is now the greatest wide receiver in the NFL Adams the land has scored for the Minnesota Vikings a and it is thirty to Nineteen extra point pending a well it's you know we are brought here by discover card we treat you like you treat you\nSo I made a statement earlier on the show Steve Pearce of the Boston Red Sox has been unbelievable the past couple of games I hit a home run a last night I mean he's he's been all over the place Steve Pearce and so I made a statement earlier in the show I said hey this isn't the first time\nSomebody with a last name piers has dominated LA in reference to Paul Peirce back in the day I winning a finals MBP and beating the Lakers back in two thousand eight and now all these years later you've got Steve Pearce uh ten years apart and he hears\nIs doing a number on an LA team in a championship\nAnd so I ... and it just came to me and I said look that somebody's going to steal it from me\nAnd so Arnie Spanier Fox Sports radio host who's going to be all with Chris plank after I go off the air\nHe said over a screen shot of a tweet that somebody had already sent out previously I Believe during the last game making the same reference so I stand corrected\n'em by army spanned who called me out so congratulations already by the way a counter McGregor joins us now

I Can't go out on Sunday because of the five games going on so I'd rather just hold up in my house and not do anything\nWell I got to be honest with you we don't have a problem with traffic too much in Oklahoma so that would be a whole new virus one me read light I go crazy and and and the boy [laughter]\nBut I Wonder if UCLA Dodgers a UCLA Dodger Frank's thoughts will be eco tonight throughout the program who writes as a Dodger fan last year hurts so much more I'm at the age now early forties where alcohol and mean tweets about my team help me go on to that yeah fair\nPoint a sale is coming in for the night I didn't want to get to some football here in this opening segment I Will say\nIt was just like it all star game and you have to bring everybody in ... I'm not quite not quite sure why he has\nThem I don't get this either I mean again sales nasty don't get me wrong we get Clemens the warm up or is he not only that on the roster he should get his three outs rather easily you would think but what if he starts to struggle a little bit you know what is that a lot of problems about yes then you'll get kimbrell up and then you got married heart dancing around\nHome plate and suddenly you get a little bit hotter again outside of Red Sox fans but it's been it's been an interesting link managed series and I I don't know I Am very frustrated about hills coming out last night and then you bring in another ... years old when\nI was quite an egregious error and then you hear the drama about what led to it and what didn't lead to it and whether or not there was a miscommunication about how tired he was at the Robert saying well I didn't hear from them\nWe wanted to hear from him so I mean it was just a it was a a carnival of errors from the Dodgers in the way that they handle things uh last night in game five or pardon pardon me game for the series no weight gain three of this weight what am I yeah I don't even though we're just talking about it the more you're low in Eighteen any game\n... or the ... of those coming in the ... the bottom of the night\nIs that on your got tonight is to bring up old players from the series

C. S. man he was nails\nWhat some of the criticism was brought on by himself\nA one he criticized the fans for no reason a out of the blue at the beginning of the year\nUm some little shocked about that last year the rift he got in with Dennis Eckersley um so that's always been easy of course the fans of always given the fact that the average price because of the amount of money you make it on his contract so it's been a little give and take on both sides on that park wrist\nCar lifted up the phone shall we ate yeah I've been seven Ninety nine on Fox let's start by talking about the Dodgers side of it David is in Maryland wanted to break down mainly Machado what's going on David they got they got a good day rate\nFirst of all you know I'm just not really for like the world series for the first of all I'll tell you I'm not really a fan of the Dodgers are the red Sox especially the red Sox 'cause\nThey play in the same division teams you know in Maryland [noise] but I Will say one thing I'm a little shocked you know and I like those guys but I'm caught a surprise Steve Pearce actually play many Machado nothing gets the parents you know you had a wonderful series but I Am kind of surprised because mainly Machado he played actually worse than somebody oil ballplayers we got now and that's\nKind of shocking 'cause what made him a job as with the oil you know he was one of our bright spots and like we didn't have to make bright spots when\nYou know this year before Matty Machado was trading but no he was actually something look forward to go into auto and I'll tell you I mean he looked like a complete bump tonight and wow does he is I mean it's just amazing that Steve Pearce would actually be many Machado I'm\nLike I said okay well I don't know I appreciate the call I don't know why he's comparing appears\n... over for bad it only one eighty to a lot of criticism coming on his part about the lack of hustle I use by somebody else again um you said that it was by accident\nOr but it wasn't only Machado there was a lot of guys on his team about just war to anybody's the red Sox ... years was phenomenal I thought that was fantastic picked up by the red Sox when he got them\nWell and to be honest with you I I Know it was painful right now I Would say to be honest with you I'm going to lie to yeah I Know exactly sorry my bet it's a crutch oh I'll get over it at some point I'm only ... read a [noise]\nBut Arnie the Dodgers aren't here if they don't go get many Machado ... they're not in the world series they might not even end up\nWinning their division Manny Machado picking him up this law since this often she wasn't going to be where it ended up being even though we struggle in the world series or an enduring even the you know ... they're not here without it now\nI think it's going to create an interesting conundrum in the off season because you've got secret coming back\nOr the Dodgers going to be players in the main Machado sweepstakes or did they say we're going to go on and kind of follow our our analytics mindset and build this roster through our our minor leagues I've been a firm believer that he was coming back but I mean I don't know I I don't know if the Dodgers are going to get in a bidding war especially\nWith what the Yankees being front and center right now in some people's opinion [noise]\nUm I well you know what though I think maybe and yes the Yankees or the front runner but I think it's easier to sign somebody like that or a harbor because I don't know if I'm going to get that money to starting pitching any more\nJust because starting pitcher going really goes what about five or six innings in a courtroom by the analytics Julie need to go about four or five ... when you get to the third time around so what the hell am I going to give you two hundred million dollar contract when your role is not limited according to major league baseball kind of like a running back\nIn ... in the NFL so if I'm not going to give the big big money to buy starting pitching um I've got to find somebody else I'm going to give it to him that comes to the everyday player\nAnd a good one morning here this segment before the break dog is in Reno talking World Series Doug welcome to Fox Sports radio\nGentleman I worry and and I am I've got a couple of things here uh the Dodgers that darn Dodger pitching I grew up in the East Bay area Hayward, California back in the sixties\nYou know Mays McCovey marriage show and the great Giants' games that could never beat the al ... Dodger pitcher [laughter]\n... ... yeah perhaps to them but the red Sox they were clearly better and I tell you what for for a\nWin win in Fifteen Years or World Series with and you know the giants right behind him at three here in in the last seven or eight anyway and couplet really great teams snuck up on it I got to stay\nThe end of year this World Series World Series baseball is different than the regular season I get the analytics I get the ... the strike out so that's putting you know everybody loves to see nine to ... you know you're sitting at the ball game is all great\nBut World Series game is different products to Cora props to to everybody in the postseason the Dodgers touched their ass off like you guys were talking on the score is really\nDidn't get it and I just wanted to but that was what reshape the call because some of that question though I was just trying to get on it feels like it was enough\nMardi loves taking holes but the first thing he loves to do was trample over don't go along for ... well he\nSays he says you know ... World Series is a different time so what you could do everything right to get you to the world series and then what did you get to the world series change everything about you do differently that's not what that's what he's saying\nYeah ... that's what he's laying out because imagine if you had a pass happy team that suddenly got to be either Superbowl or the fourteen twelve and ... and he suddenly started just going for yards in a cloud of dust right if you really over analyze things so in all honesty Arnie\nA David Price or even though he only start in one game Chris Sale or the Steve Pearce is of the ... or the JD Martinez is\nOf the world you know JD Martinez yeah this this game this game five is going to be so in a raging to me because the Dodgers had so many just little small opportunities to get some momentum going and it couldn't happen\nOr what was it the fifth inning when Martinez misjudged the fly ball ...\nComes out on the first pitch instead of driving in the run from third I runs up the shortstop you've got a ride home on that anyway because it wasn't like the shortstop was playing in um he was playing halfway it's I think you've got to make him throw you out at home at that point\nWell it it was right after Joe buckets that if you want anyone out there with less right two outs in around her third drive a mom you weren't just in turn and lo and behold the grounds that the shortstop so they have that opportunity to have some opportunities to try to get momentum going and\nI don't I don't know it just it seemed like as someone watching at home and as a fan in the stands they were trying to win the game with one swing a bat this whole series now worked it worked in game three it took a while but it worked\nA but in the er pardon me gave when ... when was the Eighteen any who now everything's starting to run together thank you it worked one every ... months he hit one out of the yard and we met Kim hit a home or to get things started but\nMy word army they just never were able to put together that big inning to threaten the red Sox pitcher consistently just never happened in Boston was very comfortable\nNo they didn't have a spot you wanna you know yet but Red Sox overcame not one kind of easily when they had a three run Homer to get back in ... and making four to three at that\nPoint when they when they when they had a force spot last night you I really honestly thought to myself we've got ourselves a series this is going to\nSue where are you going to we're going to win tonight loaning I'll be talking about the Dodgers going back to Boston I really thought but then again they they pull off a guy in more than off the bench that ends up going yard when he had no business going you argue serve on on a platter\nTo Steve Pearce I mean it's just it's frustrating part if you're a Dodger fan\nBecause you feel like there were opportunities in the series now again you have to stand back\nTake inventory and realize that from start to finish the red Sox were the best team but Arnie you can't help but limit missed opportunities if you're the Dodgers to make this a more competitive series not saying you would have one right on trying to disrespect the victory but those chances were there for Los Angeles they were just unable to take advantage\nOf how do you think ratings are ah across the board for this World Series overall I think we're going to see pretty good stuff on this one\nYou know the ... and you know I'm a I'm a door for this kind of stuff I Love talking about ratings but they weren't good early on um as a matter of fact some of the some of the early numbers were low and react to the Eighteen any game three crazy stumbled to an absolute new low\nNo role ... did I must have misheard because I thought they said that they got better ratings from like one to three in the morning eastern well\nWhat what are you normally if anyone even normally watching TV and one to three go to those already\nBut my point was that they have better ratings than than they normally would have gotten in prime time earlier at four o'clock or so it made it sound like the ratings were good I guess that's my point is what I was rather say Chris\n[noise] ah well I'm sure if you looked at it from that perspective but\nA according to who was this a deadline dot com righty the the result was down over four percent in early numbers from last year to ban same here so it's again it's not some massive drop that you've had so far and the ratings\nAnd it'll be real curious to see what last night's games numbers were liking what tonight's games or like I mean you do go up against the NFL and\nIt wasn't necessarily ... no offense to New Orleans from Minnesota but it's not like you're going up against the cowboys and the giants you know there's a lot of the eagles\nMust see TV with any of the law you know like programming on something that we haven't had that in a while because people watch it their own leisure\nYeah absolutely and you just you you you watch TV differently now but I'll you know when we come back to the guy could Fox Sports radio studios only will get an update on the ratings will check in from Chavez Ravine with Steve the savior\nAnd we'll hit these tweets that are rolling in at stinking I just want S. T. I. N. K. I. N. genius in the number one I'm playing showing everybody get hit us up at Fox Sports radio he's already spent your um ... like the red Sox or World Series jams will talk about that in the NFL next on Fox Sports radio\nHey hey it's\nBeen Mather here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the\nGood thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you couldn't be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart milk or English seemed to Michelin switched to the curb\nGiving you a ... long lasting only do\nSo when the going\nThe difference you can see\nUnreal fifty W H ... from my heart radio\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen ... sixty three year old schoolteacher name any medicine Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls and a ... with the help them to assistance Taylor strapped herself into a leather harness inside an old wouldn't heckle narrow five feet high and three feet in diameter\nNot violently from side to side by the Rapids and then propelled over the edge of horseshoe falls Taylor reached the short lived around twenty minutes after her journey began\nAfter a brief flurry of photo ops and speaking engagements Taylor's fame cooled and she was unable to make the fortune for what she had hoped\nThey were helpful\nTaught our first ... [noise] downloaded [noise]\nOr regular whenever you go wherever they want or what [laughter] what are the phones let's get Larry in San Diego anyone that wants to talk black helicopter conspiracy talk go straight to the front of the line what's going on Larry\nI like to say I just felt like an east coast west coast type thing and trying to get road across or is there\nBut you already got a a wreck so good at it but you can have offered LA no cost the boys right now you end up around 'cause the patriots and the civil it'd be a fighter end up in the lake it hurts the Celtics\nBut it may it got to say that the sports world is going to get back there wherever he would say\nWell you know it's funny I got up you know Chris you could actually bats\nThat the Sox patriots Celtics and Bruins all when their respective championships in their sports a and get something like about a couple of hundred to what a and a lot of pay are a lot of New Englanders are running the pet that I might come on stop it stop you're crazy but how crazy would that be huh\nWell I don't is it going to be a ratings generator in other words if you were going to let let's just say hypothetically if you're going to fix things is that the ... the direction you wouldn't want to go now guys like myself that grew up watching magic and Larry and and kind of a\nDog maybe a little bit of what we've seen over the last couple of beers from this dynasty if you will that the patriots have built I don't necessarily know if I look at it and say oh yeah this is the rivalry for years to come between Los Angeles and New England and the Lakers Celtics thoughts at least in baseball we added Arnie their lives in baseball we at it\nThey just read the the the uh Larry Magid commercial today did they yes they are you at your own question of course that's what everybody wants to do a Boston\nOr you know ... unless you unless you get Dodgers Yankees would have been only think better but that's what people want Larry and magic Elway and Boston LA New York that's what people eat up\nWell I Will I Will say this much if that's the conspiracy count man I'm all about it and you know what if we started talking football this hour if you want to make it the patriots versus the rams and go ahead and seal that deal right now for that [laughter]\nI'm fine with it I'm fine how about if you want to make it the kings and the Bruins by God and the Stanley Cup final stop and look at 'em all about it if you want to make it a Lakers Celtics once again I'm absolutely all out on\nThat I'll give you that I I'd rather have well I'd rather have Lakers the Knicks but right now that doesn't look too good\nHere's a crazy no for you or the last five World Series champions have clinched it on the road the giants in Kansas City royals then did it in New York against them wow that wasn't too long ago when the Mets were in the world series wow fame or the cubs did it in Cleveland and now the last two teams\nHave pulled it off in Los Angeles the Astros last year the red Sox tonight do you know already spent the last team to clinch at home then was\nNo not off the top of my head who would that be\nThe Boston Red Sox and tall or seeing gas that yeah so I just thought that ... not a size straight World Series championships clenched on the roads and then one other quick note before we grab a break and I keep trying to get to football I keep trying to stimulate\nShould I go to the parades and I take like Thursday off and that's probably when the parade is going to be I go down there for that of course you should why wouldn't you say there were like a tiger blue shirt see how that works out or\nI Would probably go against that [laughter]\nOr you know they might ... something that they might ... kids or you might just want to wear a kids were Jersey ah the red Sox spent just to twelve days out of first place all season they were the best team in baseball wire to wire\nAbsolutely dominant and they finish the year if you add in the numbers from the post season to the regular season numbers\nOne night team yeah and fifty seven that's not bad one Nineteen fifty seven that's ridiculous ...\nHow many how many of the national debate shows in the morning or are you going to see the graphic comparing the red Sox the warriors how many [noise]\nNine to ... am eastern tomorrow how many of the how many that you're leading stores will be is the red or the red socks that the warriors of them will be\nWith the way they dominated ... like the thing is like people painted the underdogs ... they had the highest payroll and then we'll be guys I was just like you know a a team underdogs like these guys were good\nBut I mean I think that connection with obviously be made throughout plenty just trying to you know get the the tie into this very ratings and stuff\nWhat is the record for wins for the entire year I Know Seattle had what was it won sixteen but they lost in the playoffs so is is one Nineteen or as somebody of more than that Chris I don't even\nKnow in Nineteen oh six Arnie the Chicago Cubs won a hundred and sixteen games and according to the Google machine that's the most wins and major league baseball history tied with your ... how many are without\nOn one okay so there you go now just won Nineteen so there you go\nUh I don't I don't know do if they truly include the post season in those numbers as well too so uh I just I think it's kind of funny that people actually keep track of the numbers for about six bravo to them I [laughter]\nI lose things I had last week but somehow were able to keep numbers from Nineteen oh six eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox will get back to your calls I tried guys I Try to get to the NFL will take one more dip in the pool if not we're back to the world series champ Boston Red Sox\nI it's the most raging thing on the planet when people say they all of the seasons to walk it just needs to get over okay don't I mean this is the most that aren't even I have talked about baseball probably since last\nWhat do you what do you need to change the channel that's like saying okay I've watched uh ten years of the Sopranos\nDon't watch the final episode that if you don't like the way it is and what do we do watch the final up of course I got to watch the final episode well don't bitch and moan about it then if you're going out there was nobody else complains about the last episode of the Sopranos ride\nLightweight well you're comparing watching the Sopranos to maybe watching the ... the red Sox and the Dodgers of either one which I don't hold out\nOut of it was awesome oh my gosh are you continue hurting your elbow patting yourself on that baby the gas is going to join us and the guy or it's radio studios to get caught up on everything not baseball related that's going on what's going on day that's\nCrap man I Love baseball wow talk all night with baseball and what's wrong with that\nSaid I I don't know apparently it's the worst thing that's ever happened to some people so I just want to give you that had\nWhat else you can do in Vermont Arnie while we have maple syrup up here remember that what does that do

bad gold in Detroit so for the students anyways guys the either Greste will go back to the world series ballgame and Sears are now over the patch\nAny signs of Dr one last Saturday\n\nAre facts mentioned betting on steep peers to win World Series MBP guys hit three ... and the series in five games ate rice or even in\nThis reminds me of one of these great calls though whenever already had von Miller Elia MVP a couple of years ago when we're talking about what an option yeah grill I bet they are ridiculous\nAnd Chris you know what a full disclaimer I had never been so scared in my entire life betting on a game\nThan that Super Bowl because I grew up being a ... fan\nAnd actually took them in a game as soon as I heard or and he was on Denver I was like oh my gosh it was really my fault yeah that's true but anyways Red Sox won at five one they won the series four games to one Steve Pearce is the MVP Clinton crush us up for the last year for a home runs in the ballgame

I understand you want to try to do something you want to try to make something happen but only he left the locker room he didn't answer any questions afterwards I Know I I Know we're all tired of the media and that with social media you feel like you have a closer tie to the fans and you ever had before pardon the pun with your Instagram\nWould you bet on baseball to today I\nI don't know a great odds to get great and by the way to do it if you think of one of those good teams like the Yankees or the Dodgers are going to win I bet it now before what science Bryce Harper\nAh oh\nGod no I don't know I'm not that he's the difference maker anyway right\nOr not he could be what if he ends up in Chicago you can you imagine adding him to the mix with what the ah the bears out here with oil Mac and foreign rushing to know if you ask him to that line up in Chicago to someone's got to go you would think but I don't know where\nYou're going to end up as much either gonna end up with the Dodgers are what\nI Would like to see that David gas God what are you saying where does yeah and I do end up\nWell I think much chateau ends up in New York but I think you can have Bryce Harper be Brian or like or to point do you mean pretty good as a linebacker save our guided tied in wouldn't be too bad for Bryce Harper either has been the health issues with tied into Chicago over the last couple of years I don't know if he wants to do that\nEspecially with that fine hair so [laughter] I'm already brought up some might as well talk about it right now when you think about odds and what not bet on line actually had some odds posted as they usually do\nA proud of the world series starting in game number one odds on the MVP for the world series your favorites\nClinton Chris shot Christian Bale JD Martinez in ... beds for all listed at nine to one and a gentleman can you find where Steve Pearce was\nThey would have been in like the other is a is a group of others like twenty five or thirty to one or something like that I thought he had his own on Mr\nPlaying what do you think I Would say he'd be like a hundred and one or something like that well you went over if this is the price is right so aren't I'd be out you are correct he was thirty three to one MVP of this World Series so\nFor all those non gamblers out there if you would have been a hundred dollars and Steve Pearce to win World Series and BP you would've been paid alone thirty four hundred dollars oh that's pretty damn good yeah it's\nTough though but she didn't know what the what if we're going to be who is in the wind up who wasn't in the wind up but I mean heck the Dodgers but three guys what Seventy total runs on the ... game oneself I knew was white and you know planning the numbers aren't they playing the way the red Sox but better tend to be on the bench hitting five hundred that are on base percentage of like five eighty and they put them on the bench\nYou know it's one thing actually have those guys from the bench it's another to do it when they're left handed bats in American League ballpark that as a short porch and right you know I mean\nThat on top of that on top of that one thing after another anyways Boston Red\nSox do when the series four games to one and see pierce is the world series MVP three home runs he runs driven in just a five game set\nDavid Price picked the W. went seven strong innings get one means the run three hits five ... in a couple of walks speaking of lines of what not something I'd just knocks and I went over in his previous show here on Fox Sports radio um game next week in college football Alabama and LSU and you guys know what the line is on this one\nVote in an added half my friend and that's the biggest uh um other dog she's been home since Nineteen Ninety not\nDry and it's like you read my minority ... crazy right I mean you and I were just two peas in a pie Alabama covering the thing is\nWell here's here's the thing that's interesting is I Do I think they can cover it absolutely is how much are they didn't LSU quite a bit better but crazy things happen and rude on a Saturday and primed yell and this is\nThis is the biggest test Alabama has had this year and I'll tell you what I'll tell you what Arnie eye and Dave sorry I think that uh LSU is going to be number two when the college football playoff four team playoff oh no no\nNo ... Alabama's going to be while\nLSU is going to be too and then we'll have noted a suit and that the that excuse for a program Clemson a number for\nGood steward number two they're all but guaranteed in that that even if she loses came to Alabama if they win the rest of the games outright there'll be fine and they make the fourteen playoffs you know there there there's a big place it's way in\nA while I think they will but we are talking about the first four team playoff poll once you might remember that if you go back to the initial one you had to Mississippi State moment in the top for you know what I mean it's just kind of ridiculous how this plays out but I'm telling you Arnie don't be surprised if bam and LSU ... ban was going to be one I bet LSU was up there hard and\nYou know I may hit three out of my four teams I said Alabama Clemson Michigan in Arizona so I I may get three out of the [noise]\nIt was really had to Arizona that ... that you had to get it and everything yeah hate in Michigan in there as a rattlesnake roundup that not not at all\nGuys we are not not you guys per se or or me but the media as a general will take their shot at Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Louis for what the team does and hasn't done especially in the postseason but the same division in a different head coach Hugh Jackson\nOver under winning percentage career all time is it over or under three hundred well under\nFive hundred with the raiders so he just should've stayed there are the\nGuys he has a whopping ... five winning yes it is good enough to start for the Dodgers batting average she has a record of three thirty six and one with the Cleveland Browns they again last today in Pittsburgh\nThey they didn't look good at times they had some chances but overall they've got beat by Pittsburgh thirty three to Eighteen James Connor had two hundred and twelve total yards and a couple of touchdowns I Know they want lay down bell back but this is the guy\nThat's been getting it done Baker Mayfield an illusion caused under a hundred and eighty yards passing and shoot CDs but again we've involves two to five I'm One who Jackson's still has a job\n[noise] probably not for long good stuff gas got in with the at the top of the hour you know it was funny because last week we had that seat not just burning hot but maybe some buyers for huge accent and then this week it's almost as if he's making all the calls so kind of find out what may happen as they get closer\nTo their ...

Fifteen minutes ago I by the way to able to try to hear what Robert been taking shots at you Arnie\nWell David Price took a shot at the media I guess why am I yeah about Fifteen or Fifteen minutes ago or twenty minutes ago are at one of ... at the press conference or whatever you want to call it um I'll have to get the sound or not I can't wait to see exactly what he had the\nKinda guy not be happy\nNo no you can't that's the way he is I'm Serious he no he can't be happy I've talked about this nausea met my local show because that's all he does is it's either because of the fans this or you know this going on or that going on a more Dennis Eckersley it always seems like there's some type of problem and\nReally from what I hear he's like the ... a nice guy does great things with charity work so I I don't know why brings us on himself you would think after tonight you would call off the you know the the dogs I I guess\nNot celebrate celebrate your rain and joy and race it but it looks as if he has a little\nAh axe to grind and he's not going to let it go up by the way Sean I agree with this tweet Shawn he just up and said this is the worst show you to have done during an NFL season I thought this was a football show if I wanted World Series coverage I Would listen to that fan boy bin ... who is coming up why\nI got in that I I had to I Am I'm a I'm you know ... this is always one of those challenging dilemmas for me personally because\nI don't want to talk about this game tonight are you kidding me this was a disaster of a World Series for the Dodgers I don't want to mention a word of it and part of it too is because of you know you're so laid back Boston the enemy and you're just you're so humble about things the easiest thing to try [laughter]\nBut you can't help but just congratulate him I mean\nSee I Wonder if his son's favorite team um or the one I guess he's a Dodger fan but as he put am five Seventy LA sports so I Wonder if the Dodgers were the one he was oh let's talk about it all week and that's fine let's do this all we\nAre a couple of quick tweets before I get back to uh buy or sell stock upside down whatever goofy way you want to phrase it matter writes cursed shows in going anywhere the main reason is no other team is going to give him Seventy million dollars including the pro rated signing bonus over the next two years like the Dodgers half to\nMaybe that's part of this discovery process because I Know he can't go out and contact teams right but I'm sure his agent is laying some ground war cry\nHey what kind of deal could he possibly get what's the market look like I mean I'm sure there would be ... willing to pay him a lot of\nLawyers rather have Seventy million for two years and then the Dodgers say well we're not going to resign you after that or somebody like the ... I just making the team of like the Texas Rangers but these from now has a say in you know what I'm Will give you the two years Seventy million then we'll sign you for another three more years after that\n[noise] boy that's tough I Would I Would probably go just to do something different I mean\nI I Can't get inside crush us mind I\nUnderstand what you're saying that if you look at it from a pure financial perspective it's LA he he's not going to go anywhere else\nBut this dude money is not a problem he's made a ton of money in his career and I'm not ever saying you don't reach a point where you're like no no no I'm good I don't want any more money I still have yet to meet that person in my life that says no don't pay me any more money and do it\nBut maybe he wants to go somewhere else maybe he wants to do something experience a different time I don't know and maybe that's probably leading to those who have taxes\nYeah there are ...\nThe million I Would think that maybe he would opt out the fact that he's got more than that left on his contract is not going anywhere but um yeah he's fed up with some of the red Sox fans and media no doubt about that\nNow rough nice to be a Dodger fan but you know what foundation is well late they're going to be back great not to be a Red Sox fan but uh even David prices and allowing himself to enjoy alright Arnie before we get some final football knows to get outta here what are you saying we wrap it up with your picks\nOh yes put me in the mood give me a little music let's start with a little college football my friend we got some big games finally because last week\nIt was absolutely horrible was not was not good no not at all like oh that special number what [noise]\nI don't need the fourteen and a half\nI don't want to fourteen and a\nI'm going to take the fourteen and a half [noise]\nOur family with the pie week but you're going to tell me Alice you at home with the way they're been playing at the way they beat the top ten teams that this team's going to roll over and over at home not going to happen defensively I think they can't stop Alabama but they can slow them down offensively\nThat's the part that scares me will they be able to put up enough points to beat them [noise]\nI think they can give me LSU over Alibaba picking the force that points for\nGame number two [noise]\nMichigan did you see the wide in this one did you happen to see the white and I I haven't seen the line and this one out of Michigan's favorite over Penn State what are you thinking\nOh uh I Would guess it'd be like six\n\nSame\nState that's way too many points I guess the Michigan team who may win\nBut I got to get that ten points there you've got to be\nKidding me give me a Penn State plus the gets Michigan\nTo edit fell games I have taken the Green Bay Packers again plus to separate it gets the patriots on the road and I have taken the same at home to beat the ram so there you have my picks do with them as you're pleased but remember now they're strictly for the payments purposes all\nArnie you're not picking the battle of the bay picking theirs and others that could listen to it all day Stewart Gilligan Griffin you're not picking the battle by debate Thursday Night Football the raiders and the niners how dare you everywhere when you're watching\nHow can I missed that one I may have to pass on that one I'm Sorry about that one thing to watch World Series or something what\nIs your thought on this number real quick 'cause I I I don't care about this Alabama's not just the best team in college football this year they're one of the best non Oklahoma sooner teams I've seen in a long time\nOr they haven't beaten but what two teams with winning records this year in Ole Miss in Texas ... so does that do anything for you does that affect your your your pick this week in or not or you just rolling with them for oh Alabama Alabama has only been two teams were winning with a winning record is she'll\nDo go there's still a kitten knock them they're still impressive world have been able to do but um that's why like el issue and playing at home and all the points and again even though they you know beaten teams inside the top ten I don't feel like it was she was under rated so um I Would have picked those points and and and enjoy that game\nI Will say this Tuesday is not only the NFL trade deadline but Tuesdays off so the first time that we'll get an opportunity to see how the four team playoff committee\nIs viewing the top four six eight teams whatever they rank ... remember do they always say they pick it as if\nThe season war to end today which is kind of unfair because we I think in our minds Arnie we look ahead quite a bit which is why I think that they also get this is all they also get try to sell the sport a bit I think that's why you'll see LSU number two\nBecause they're went over Florida it might be ... excuse me uh then went over Georgia might be the most impressive when of any of the top ten teams so far this season so I think you'll see them high but it's going to be real interesting to see what they do with Michigan to see what they do with Oklahoma to one last teams that have been very impressive and you have to have Notre Dame that's undefeated in that four teams\n... you know it's so funny you brought that up I got breaking news on them just real quick uh northwestern just beat Notre Dame so you didn't you didn't hear that one does that surprise you know no it doesn't surprise me at all what was the good cheated on remembered that Michigan about Seventy nothing northwestern over Notre Dame\nBy the way joke clap Fox Sports analyst on college football the number one dude here's his top for\nAlabama number one concern number to Oklahoma number three oh Notre Dame number four oh no Michigan at night and LSU at number ... out as a very smart guy or you just have to pack twelve teams though in the top ten with Washington

not even include the seven inherited runs that Ryan Madsen ... up on them out so think about that factor that in a secular\nOr ... you better storing losing locker room and the Dodgers got brilliant pitching in a couple of games from ritual and Walker viewer right wonderful pitching in both those gates and other than that\nThere wasn't much of anything that was magical and great the meat and potatoes of the Dodger office provided very average returns they needed the core especially Justin Turner\nAnd mainly Machado to carry the load those guys were unable to rise\nUp here in the water for the Dodger office and make a great example that Justin turn with a runner on third in his game to tie it off the game five elimination game for the Dodgers a chance to tie it up all you need new fundamental baseball what does he do it doesn't get the run all\nRight let me get a hit three thirty three it's misleading hidden Justin Turner a no home runs you know or be eyes when the world series but he had three thirty three you know it didn't hit home runs and driving any many Machado who got off that good started at three R B eyes on the open or the world series hit ... the other four games

on and on down the list All right uh but wait but wait there's we're not done no no no no\nNow part B of is there are a couple of fundamental flaws in the Dodger strategy the analytics which have gotten the Dodgers to the world series\nTell you what has happened basing everything on past results tells you what has that it doesn't tell you what's going to happen and it's kind of like investing in stock or real estate they put that disclaimer we have commercials that play on Fox Sports radio there's always that disclaimer at the end of them\nPassed results are not always have reliable indicator on what is going to happen next you can have all the data\nAnd the algorithms but the algorithms do not tell you when a player is going to poop the bad no computer model indicated that my unmatched in\nWho played in Philadelphia for a decade was not going to be able to handle forty degree weather in Boston and would come in and bomb and all over the mound you cannot factory and the human element\nInto the algorithms you can say well eventually will be able to do it well it doesn't work right now every time you bring any new really push the ... the ironic part of all this is my major criticism of the Milwaukee Brewers\nAnd the bullpen games was that when you keep going to the bullpen your odds of having players not perform well go up right with every new player you enter into the game there was a higher degree that that players not going to perform\nAnd yet here we go right there is a Congo line of relief pitchers coming in out of the Dodger bullpen against the red Sox\nAnd you can't factor in the human element you bring in a new relief pitcher the odds go up that that players going to have tight focused syndrome and the Dodgers had a systematic problem of tight took a syndrome we saw that was several relief pitchers who came in\nAnd then Robert said the quick hook you bringing a left handed reliever situational reliever he walks batter you take him out of the game you bring in another guy he sucks you take him out of the game one after another\nThere was a factor in our data last point here\nTalking about the losing locking them the Dodger front office got the roster they wanted they traded for Machado now they would have loved to have Cory Seeger but he was out for the you you knew that he was going to play but they had the roster they wanted they made the moves they made to get ready to winning World Series\nAnd the these guys sucked at a time you cannot suck uh in in the big moments you there needs to be an adjustment sucked and we stuck to the time that you can suck\nOr this is going to continue happening again and again it's the law of unintended consequences playing out in the world series nor does that mean cannot one with um\nYou you know the um people talk about Dave Robin yeah and uh the thing is that what he took the words out you know because of the seven and a happy ending going on eight and he threw a lot of pictures\nLook clean or at least ... who do you take your uh what's the guy he took\nHis last name is what the pitcher but before to back then so name yet but they ... didn't know that non run was gonna uh Carl why\nDidn't they know that was John John ... is job to know that his job he's paid to know that they Roberts has paid to know when impending doom is about to strike it's like a weather
