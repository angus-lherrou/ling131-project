[noise] download it now [noise]\nNope nope different different from the network\n... let me see let me see if I can guess it can we have some game show musically I Want to see if I can guess which former cowboy was slinging it from the booth and had a really good performance I mean there's a lot of different ways that I could go about this because there are several former cowboys are in the booth currently calling football games so let me see if I can\nFigure out who this is I'm All right so where do you tell me if I get this gray area so it's not ... not just okay is it [noise] Daryl moose Johnson [noise] it is not Daryl moose John [noise] I mean when we think is it um [noise]\nIs it Troy Aikman [noise]\nIt was not choice [noise]\nLet me think of other great cowboy\nYears when the Carter is in Quincy Carter when he was not Quincy Carter\nOkay let me think cowboys quarterback okay I Know what a Super Bowl\nIn Dallas took a knee at the end of the super bowl Bernie colors are [laughter]\nIt's amazing you even know that are known it was not Bernie chose are okay but all I got left his Tony Romo was Tony Romo there was actually told me\n[laughter] the stuff is\nBecause one of the things that Tony does um is is he tries to call what's gonna happen before the play and it's called first guessing\nOr something that kind of gives you some brownie points if you're able to do it accurately [noise] um but if we've got it got the plays ... police play it for us and what kind of talk about this crucial moment of the game where it's only wanted to interject himself [laughter]\nFor adults\nAs the coverage\nWas provided by ... let me let me they're trying to take shots\nIs doing that but there's a ton of cover himself when did explain what happened a Ninety percent of samba apparently it's either a runner ...\nAnd I did end up just wanting a pleasure pass and yet he tried to say there it is I'm not sure if he knew what he initially said if he blacked out during the beginning of that I call 'em but it wasn't anything anything that he called and they followed it up the next play with another song would call a solid performance\n[noise]\nFor adults as well yeah and it's the same with ... well uh we okay so here's a little behind the scenes of what happened here we've just gotten where the Tony romas called in and he is not he's not allowing us to play that second clip\nAnd and I think that it's just ridiculous as a CBS I think I I don't know um but nonetheless yeah he I've noticed this as well to Jason a witness starting to do that on Monday Night for a are you hearing me starting to call plays he's starting to just start ... and\nThe worst prop part is is unless you know and you're going to be a hundred percent\nDon't do it if you want to sit there and tell us where the ball's gonna go that's one thing that's still pretty difficult to do right you've got one in five shot\nBased on if they throw it out there's five eligible guys they can possibly throw too so um you know that's that's impressive in itself but\nA lot of times these guys just throw stuff out there and then do a kind of act like that's what they said no no no people are actually listening out there but nonetheless he here's here's the thing and then the game I thought he did do a good job of talked about the clock management it was as poor as it gets and I don't think we have time for it now 'cause you have to take a break but when we come back would briefly\nI Want to throw it idea to you because I think maybe Dallas could have\nHandled the end of the gained a little bit different and maybe they would have had more time\nStill my heart was that a radio cheese from ... in which that I just said you don't shoot down the side I Know I Will not shoot down this idea that is the most shocked I've been since the end of the crying game I Am blown away by what just happened here on Fox Sports rated back over there's break when I'm Jonah snacks when we come

where are you going coming to you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go get a guy go dot com or called eight hundred nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which way is easier so so Sunday Night Football is under way we've got the bangles at the chiefs\nI haven't the chiefs getting to Sunday night games in a row\nSong you could talk about calling their shopping NBC called their shop before the year he they didn't know they were going to be this good\nI think anyone who when they did a practice tape of Patrick Rome's anyone who saw him during the course of\nA the oh jeeze many camp training camp that people kind of knew what was coming I I had a chance to talk with Peter ... a horse Retta fell network does some stuff for Fox as well on the sidelines\nUm and it was on good morning football he had the opportunity to go spend some time out there this past summer and wasn't when I saw last week I just said hey man\nYou call it right out of the gate I said you're the one that that basically was standing on your soapbox screaming for ... saying this kid's going to be in a VP candidate in his first year starting and he's he's been just that and it and I think the more impressive thing is is he hasn't slowed down\nHe is he's had some a little bit of ups and downs for him but he constantly finds ways to move the football and produce and and give him a chance\nYou know who I Know I didn't see tape on patrimony arms who's that Ryan pays 'em [laughter]\nSo let me [laughter] so go back to that for who they take instead what was the uh the guy's name\nUm oh is it a lot with the hell's that guy's name a gross ... who's ... well\nThat was those labels wave 'em or you know I heard gross and used to have a hard time making weight\nYou know I'm a ... or ... I have I talked\nTo I Would ... you would get fined a weekly because he couldn't way the amount that they wanted him to weigh it was like two twenty five to thirty but he couldn't couldn't get dumped gator David\nAnderson told me a story I hit the gross Mintz former teammate in Washington David Henderson told me a story that grows someone would get into the huddle and if he didn't like the play is just like I don't want to do this just go deep [laughter]\nI don't know how to play any advice but Shannon's liked him so much that they were cool with it because he was such a good guy and everybody at a fun time with it so well it helps to produce and he was a guy to slant yeah\nUm now that yeah we will touch on [laughter]\n[noise] or whatever that was from Mr Butowsky on Sunday we'll talk about that at some point um but I Do want to ask you about Andy Dalton in primetime games\nWhat do you make of this man psychology of a quarterback he continues to not produce in primetime games he's got another opportunity to try and prove the skeptics wrong in a primetime spot against the Kansas City defense that you can put up points and get your yards against because teams have done it all year long\nCincinnati is often says plenty good enough but what do you make of Andy ... and not just dandy Dalton Marvin Lewis is struggling primetime games\nOkay quickly there on the road for this prize I'm gay for starters and Kansas City is or at least was I think one of the last week the number one third doubt defense in the legs so look what's not paid it like it's that much of a lay up for them okay well a combined it makes the story sound better or the other end of the truth getting away with it we don't deal with facts here\nRight so I think what happens is and this is human nature I mean you tell me if if you have an experience this in your life\nLike the more time something happens that people start to identify you as something\nThat the more apps you are to sit there and say maybe I Am that you know maybe I Am the guy that can't ever get the job done in primetime or I just I I Can't figure it out\nIt it's hard especially in today's age should not hear what's being said about you and that's why what's so many players talk about block yeah social media or block it out the north on the outside they really do have to disconnect because it's so loud and it's so noisy that you can't help to subconsciously\nStart to think those thoughts\nAnd to play in the NFL especially as a quarterback and to play at a high level consistently\nYou have to have the utmost confidence and you can't allow all that stuff that gets you so\nUm I think for him it's happened enough in his career that it feels like a monkey on his back it's like that weight that he's just he's bearing every single time he goes out in this scenario\nAnd you know it's just he needs to figure out a way of either having that you know big time performance where he gets a monkey off his back\nOr that needs to be an instance where it happens a few times his team helps them out and and then maybe he starts to feel more confident from that they can build off of a couple of wins that are really more maybe led by their team more so than him\nBecause he's not a bad quarterback and he said you said pretty good years or ... or you could win games of anti ... and you just can't win postseason games are games that a lot of people watch that's that's [laughter]\nAnd it didn't it he can win those games I I honestly feel like their team has not played as well around him either\nOh they've melted down that that play out a game against the Steelers was a complete and told them out to I was on the air right afterwards and it was the most fun post game show I've ever done because I've never seen a team melt down like that not only just with playing making\nBut with just undisciplined personal bond has perfect may as well and had a machete on him in that game he was out to hurt people um so yeah it's it's not completely on him but he's the quarterback so he's going to get both of the blame you\nWas there for that game was that a one age ...\nOh that's right yeah he was with the bet your brother in law jihad ankles then yeah and I remember asking him about it and he was just because I've never seen anything like that\nYou looked at me with his eyes as wide as you can imagine these shows I've never seen anything like that before my life I you know where an egg any came from Green Bay so they they want a Super Bowl they well they don't even use the F word in Green Bay [laughter]\nUm yeah I was going to say the vegan writing out it was Scott's and so it's all thing was\nMan once you got into certain guys heads\nLike a guy like ...\n... it's just there's there's no turning off that switch and I and the other fortunate part is you still see him play the way he does and getting it's getting it's getting by the way she has because he hasn't changed as is way of playing but\nAnyway you go about it he just said look though that's kinda how you know that she rides you know it's it's really led by their players that it's pretty loose there's not like some hard disciplinarian when talking about more of the Lewis and as much as that the strength at times it also can be their their their downfall I can just imagine\nAJ Hawk look at her it's like when you're in a at a at a table in a couple of starts fighting out of nowhere and you start looking at the show like what the hell's going on here well what what is happening here I could just imagine age losing his mind\nDo I'd rather not play and they have to deal with it\nAt us for our yeah a Brady coin Jonah stocks or Fox Sports radio comedy you live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios do we get out on time a few bubble I'm coming up next year on Fox Sports radio\nThere is a a prestigious list All right a quarterback did something that is hardly ever been done in the history of the NFL and the results might surprise you find out what we're talking about next year on Fox Sports radio\nIt's it's just the tradition that's like one of those little anecdotes from college football but you have to be a big fan though you know\nLike if he has his last over it to just ... I Know I worry like that's normal behavior okay they don't it's not literally a pair of gold pain oh and it was a little like Sharm although I don't even want it I Want the gold pads no not at odds were hanging too much on the ... the pointed it when they were hanging out much at all trust me by adults hands on [laughter]\nIt doesn't matter if what the record is there a story that everyone's best shot they're still living at Penn State's best shot\nThe store to get a hostage best shot I'm the only thing now is that they ultimately do control their own destiny which they did by the way they did before Ohio State lost because they're they're one last came out of conference so did matter\nUh okay so now that we're done with your terrible answer ... radio you're ... if you'd asked me are terrible a cliff [laughter] it'll ... um we get a little bit of a some game show music here on Fox Sports where do we have a live studio ban this is a high budget program I Know what you're thinking well\nI yeah you know yeah I Know what you're saying it is a this and this is Sunday night radio these guys are just mailing it in a\nHold on quite contrary my friend this is a high profile high budget radio show we have a studio band\nAnd attendance at that as an actual band that's not a recording we didn't just hit a button in between both those swiping on tinder oh this is an actual band the studio right now here in ... radio opposite bumble um Astrid bumble and so\nSo here we go Brady Drew Brees\nThrough his five hundred career touchdown I Am Andrea career touchdowns as the saints beat the Baltimore Ravens erode when for New Orleans\nDid you know that Drew Brees as now just the third quarter back in NFL history to beat\nAll thirty two teams in the NFL [noise] can you name the other two [noise]\nSo you you kinda posed this question before the break and I gave you an answer and then after I gave you the answer I thought about it and it was like oh I don't know if that's going to work right so poverty is the first one that comes to mind [noise]\nI was thinking about how Britain I kept going All right [noise] one of the themes of thinking about my feet this team's beat that seems to be just to [noise]\nSo if so Tom Ridge is not one of these quarterbacks but what team is poverty not be ... [noise]\nThe New England patriots [noise] exactly [noise] so it couldn't be Tom Brady 'cause we put for one team so then I assume that I I basically came to me I got an an EMT ten minutes notice\nIt's gotten to know it's gotta be quarterbacks were hall of fame caliber that that move team right so they were great one place and then maybe they went one or two other places or they just went to one of the can I give you a hint real quick nuts Peyton Manning uh Brett Farr\nOkay well I was gonna say it's definitely not my Tom ... since we're talking a old school Ohio State football it's one of the threats on the bragging Ohio Ohio State school in times that go to Ohio State did a good call want to do I keep it in the Columbus area Columbus right next to\nDouble in case you know I'm All right uh so yes you are correct Brady Quinn Brett Farr Peyton Manning and now Drew Brees are the only quarterbacks in NFL history that the beaten all thirty two teams in the NFL\nHere's some other names that surprised me on this list so obviously Tom Brady can't because Tom Brady plays for the patriots that he's never had the opportunity to play for the patriots until this off season when ... probably trade them I'm Aaron Rodgers is another one clearly can't beat every team because he only played for the Packers same with Ben Roethlisberger\nYou know who's mixed into this bunch and this order back\nHe's the only team this quarterback has not beaten is the Miami Dolphins right I Want you just walk Penn State I think about a longtime quarterback from Penn State Kerry cones bingo\nBingo who knows they're being quarterback football or you\nThink about this by the way it's not even multiple teams it's you have to play for one team in each conference but that wouldn't be the case for Peyton so it's kind of interesting yeah 'cause because he was he just had the opportunity to play a nuts and as the teams where he was able to beat them all\nOkay let me ask you this more impressive feat right Drew Brees Brett Farr and Peyton Manning beating every single team in the NFL for me cheating\nTo beat my mom and a horse shoes tournament years ago the family [laughter]\nProbably do [noise] [noise]\n... veterans are proven tough to perform and temperatures of a hundred and forty degrees and forty below zero because when you\nStarted extreme conditions you can start an everyday conditions like running late for work\nBroken alarm creepy purkis runs\nAnd only those visitors\nFor fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more for you [noise]\n\nIs your job sucking the life out of you wake up you can do something else information technology I\nKnow what you're thinking but I'm not a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer career\nGo to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today you could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four months my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot E. D.\nHis baritone day Thursday and host of spit I our radios newest podcast were twenty three in where we explore how understanding your DNA changes how we think about ourselves and the world around us we've got the inevitable why cleft John we have so much more\nIn common than you could even imagine you put two kids together they're going to want to play they are going to want to have the time they gonna wanna fall in love\nWell Fifteen when federal\nYou don't want to listen on our first I ... [noise] downloaded [noise]\nWell look I listen to the chargers play sixteen wrote a games I cut them a little bit of a break [laughter]\nI'm just I'm just making the case that at this point the season you could probably poke holes in everyone's resume as far as what they've done with the exception of Kansas City pay for it really tough schedule and they've been pretty lights out I'm losing the New England on the road and by three\nNow so I'm gonna just call out Houston but then I'm going to give them a little bit of credit this actually should show you how bad ... was and how bad the jags were on Sunday so the through the four winds now for Houston\nOne of them came when Frank Reich decided to go forward on fourth and five in his own territory in overtime that's giving the ball back to below Brian who tried to go for the tie earlier\nAnd they escape with uh when they're first one of the season there than they beat the Dallas Cowboys\nIn a game that I wasn't that the did it did it go to Jason Garrett played it safe and then they completed a long pass and then they kicked ... if I'm not mistaken I Believe okay so there's that once they escape with that one\nThen they beat the Buffalo Bills a week ago because Nathan Peter men forgot which team he played for late in the game and through a pick six and then they beat the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday because Blake ... was awful and the team is melting down around him\nWell here is how bad the Jacksonville Jaguars were on Sunday\nTo Sean Watson was so bank tough\nThat he took a bus to the game and still out played ... [laughter] ... because he couldn't fly because of all the injuries he was dealing with now you can relate to some of these injuries you've gone through similar pain that the Sean Watson has gone through tell us what it's like\nYeah it's it's pretty miserable I'll just full disclosure I had sworn Carlin bruise ribs when I was in Kansas City and it it happened from ah I forget who I got sacked by but I\nAs I kind of tried to turn away to escape um when he hit me he landed on top of me and the ball landed like ... up in my chest there like right on the shoulder park God and so I think I ended up um chair and some of the college in between my ribs from that like the way we fell\nAnd so after that point it was difficult to breathe it was difficult to sleep because I mean at forty one who you know first off I'm not a good sleeper as it is but then when you're trying to like sleep on your side or you only have one side you could sleep on because it hurts to breathe and it's it hurts the way your body adjusts when you weigh on your side\nUh it was terrible so um they had to shoot it up with no became they just ... like directly injected into my chest before game now that's the um ... the shah was fine I mean I I'm used to that kind of stuff [noise]\nUm just just ... you know you sometimes you know if they can you were taken toward all just to get through you know certain games that are higher body was feeling um but I Would take that before games and then I had literally got a cocktail of\nIndecision flex role and bike it in just every single day I I Would take that just to be able to get through the end of the season 'cause I was so banged up between my ribs I added a poster a labor of terror and like everything else but I just wanted to finish the season as bad as things weren't two thousand twelve\nAnd I were pamper 'em taken that cocktail and that was like the only thing that could that knocked me out at that point a which which is not a good habit by the way a those three things mixed together as a terrible idea but it was like the only thing that would help me be able to get through the season at that\nPoint um and the swelling on the plane is is a real thing there was a a documentary that was done so every year the NHL does this or that let's go live to our NHL insider we use him once or twice a year at most because it is the NHL Roberts they still do that when a classic on okay\nI'm ... years ago they did the winner classic I think's Roberts will ah will catch shares the winter classical ... who cares um ... it's ... I have no idea on the plane went to Notre Dame stadium if it's not Jack johnson\nI got no interest in it All right how 'bout that that's called loyalty to singer or no like I think some talking about your brother in law that hang ones\nUm I think he got there late though they're not gonna wanna ruins Blackhawks Notre Dame said you know it is a while ago that it'll be fine\nI Can't wait to not watch 'em so [laughter] so it's not a Fox game fighting chance no or go through our pockets like NBC I don't want to burn that bridge to but I there was a a part in this sort of burn like there was a there was there was the lead up to that winter classic years ago now I Believe was the penguins and the capitals\nAnd a guy for the penguins took a puck off his face off his cheek you didn't break his cheek bone or anything but he was a little bit swollen\nAnd he got on the plane\nAnd he looked over at Sidney Crosby and it was on film because they were doing a documentary and Crosby was like and I forget the guy's name he said\nI I think it was Ben love of joy it was bad this guy named Ben loved Joe which is probably a porn name but this guy bend love joy was on the plane and Crosby looks over them goes Ben his entire face swelled up because he was on the plane [laughter] so I I I Wonder how like how excruciating it was the first time maybe watch and\nI'm like what what do you think went into the decision to not send them on a plane and how soon before they knew this guy's got to go by bus or a we've\nGot to pay for you to go any further than into that decision if that is the decision that you're making don't you think you just shouldn't be playing well\nThat's my point okay so so what point did the conversation go from yeah this is really bad to\nHey gray and greyhound operate from here to ah [laughter] is that about ... like no way\nOff I Would much rather travel or twelve hours on a pimped out like tour bus all yeah than fly\nAnd if it took me two hours I Swear to you it sounds crazy that's how big of an impact I think flying I was in your body is an athlete I'll just I'll go that far just I've got messed up the at all is Frank injury\nEvery single time we traveled you would be the worst pain achy an arthritic it'd be and it just ... you know it'd be swollen barely fit into my shoe and that was you know ... years after I initially injured it but that's the impact that um you'll fly house in your body 'cause you're in a pressurized cabin and it just\nI it ends up playing um a a medicine injury that you've got\nYeah I just I I Wonder how close they were to just not having them play as opposed to take a bus to get to the game very very bizarre a alright ... Fox Sports radio would come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios coming up next\nUm we're very very confused as to what the hell one quarterback was trying to do on Sunday we will tell

out of the only hard part figuring out which way is easier breeding about twelve to Thirteen minutes from now depending on whether or not bubble will actually break\nIs still not it jumps it I'm just don't say it I'm I'm hearing reports that he ... cash I guess he didn't win last week he lost in dramatic fashion but look\n... you don't go out on an el I learned that growing up if you're ever shooting hoops\nMake sure the last shot you take before you walk off the court whether or not is getting dark out or not you make it you need to go in and good vibes and that's what I had a lot of sleepless nights than huh thank you I really you know the I guess that's the great thing about working with Brady coin\nIs a [laughter] you know I scratch his back and he stabbed mine it is really just that just that great Diana guy yeah and not him not any more getting\nCut off you know more or less for me I found it really inappropriate now that I'm not sure where they're going to\nLie about Jesus is coming out twelve minutes from now or whether Brady Clint likes it or not right how's that so uh so he will be making an appearance but I'm going to throw an idea that you\nThat I think is actually going to work and and get this this is such a good idea that I'm shocked that nobody else has come up with this idea yet I'm so everybody assumes what what would you consider the worst statistic for a quarter back in the NFL\n... like the most overrated one yes ah to me it's the quarterback reading because most people don't even know how it's comprised so people will throw it out and there'll be like oh he's got like a\nHundred and something quarterback reading and there was like well what's the highest rating what what what how do you calculate that so to me that's the stupidest one when people like to use that um but they're they're all pretty bad\nYou don't watch the film yeah I'm like like interceptions I think are are a little bit overrated from time to 'cause they don't can be missed\nYeah and I actually through the id out to you what you are you were ... I don't actually believe you responded\nTo this idea I had appreciate it but I actually through the U.S that the idea out to you how about we do ... box score where you will defend quarterbacks who get where there's an interception but it's not really your normal interception a lot of the way that it ends I Love the quarterbacks full yes I ... and it's a way to defend quarterback until the dying\nAnd here they are the most prominent position on the field they deserve the most respect and they deserve to be defended the most um I have another one that I Would like to throw out you looked Sarah okay this is the brand new stat I'm I'm working on a copyright for um\nThis is the should have been in interceptions that I'm should've I ended up under section or is this relating to a certain quarterbacks okay because ... and the reason I bring this up is right now as it stands Sam ... Arnold\nIs the NFL leader in interceptions this season\nRight\nMixture ... should be leading the NFL in ... [laughter] okay [laughter] because he was not good on Sunday and they almost like I I wondered after he missed\nHis fifth or sixth open wide receiver on an errand throw a sometimes out of the flat or sometimes\nGuys it it you see quarterbacks and make the completion all the time I saw Jared golf you know throw the same flag route to the corner the ends on on the left side to Brandon cooks in place the ball beautifully yet Mr basically was intercepted when he at Anthony Miller open\nI almost wonder if there was something wrong with him what did you make a ... performance and now he's progressing so far this season\nYeah I think he's been a consistent and I think that's something that you're going to see 'em one ... when you see a young quarterback a guy still technically in first sixteen games starting you know and based last year and and\nYou know combining with this year didn't play a lot in college we always talk about that but it but I think it shows in it and how inconsistent he is\nAnd he went up against one of the better teams in the NFL you know statistically whether or not you can make a good argument for New England one thing is for sure you know situational a third down red zone they're as good as anyone and you know that was you know what the term in fact I think today but um I I think he's\nFrom the pocket\nTo me watching right now if his first reads not there\nIt's it is his percentages of of completing that past go down significantly if you have to go to a second and third read from what I watch him he tends to throw the football a little bit less accurate he tends to not want to stay in the pocket of world miss that next guy who was open\nUm so you know if I was that if I was a defense plan against the man I wouldn't place much man to man because typically when you see teams play man to man\nYou know where you're going with the football and you're already committed to that decision on that guy getting open and you can throw him open if he's just working one on one depending on where the defender is if it's zone danger typically going to work more through a progression\nBecause there might be a few Ralph in that ... in that concept that are they're so like the first and second you know push is supposed to look based on that covers they might not be there might be the third option that might be your best option\nUh I just how do you fix somebody who's not accurate because\n... I see him make these throws in in guys are open man why it's not about separation or anything like that guys are getting open there's opportunities there to make plays and it's almost like he would rather pull the ball down and run than trust his arm and and it seems like he's he's almost scared to pull the trigger\nHow do you fix that like is that just something you work on you continue to to practice or at this stage you kind of are what you are\nWell I think as far as how he's program right you saw the rushing touched down on what is the third six when he's scrambled around and then ... and the funniest when the end zone like that's a great highlight it's cool that he can do that he's not going to be able to do that again\nI mean ... those plays probably only come once just rent it and then one and then defense is doing allow you the sack you the next time you try to do that 'cause they figure out different ways of rushing you but\nUh I I think when it's in your DNA like that you know you become and who've I always compare it into right now what older guy by compared mischievous you too\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart like signaling ...

I think a team actually won and lost at the same time that's next year on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nThe fleas that makes you a rise out of your share\n\nThis is why you love puts sarin\nFox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that a war basketball's bouncing the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during the game\nWell here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car through ... also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network at nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simpler buying experience whether you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with fruit car certified dealers\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car check out through car and enjoy more confident car buying experience some features not available all states\nI I mean it it just it wasn't going to be genuine and whether or not you want a contest that no deal and the NFL does genuine just what his genuine what it seemed draft you as their quarterback\nI mean whether or not you feel like you you want to be there you want to go there or not it's irrelevant you're getting that she has to play professional football not see that shows you so that is genuine\nAnd so that's where it when you look at the decision that maybe\n... cousins made or the jets made a ... but it sort of things that matter I think each team has essentially don't what was in their best interest I think the Vikings didn't want to have to have a rookie quarterback they like what they got and I think when you look at what the jets Avon Sam do their future I think they're happy with what they have\nA I I also think that people forget ... ... and maybe you don't realize how how cutthroat the businesses because everyone just assumes you know you're rooting for your favorite team and you've told me stories and stuff that I Would never repeat on the air about just what real life NFL is and what real life relationships with the organizations are\nDanny ... none of the bears his grandmother is sick with cancer\nAnd she's never seen him play a game\nAnd practice on Saturday they surprised him and they flew his grandma out I'm surprised him at the practice field and Danny to rate them broke down and how does grandma and said I've been in the leaf seven years\nI've never had anybody do anything like this for me from an organizational standpoint in my seven years and I saw that and I thought\nYou know like that never came up like it's it's like that it's ... you're playing for me or are we sign your checks a go go go make us a bunch of tackles and go go to a pro bowl and go into some games but the idea that\nThat the NFL really is such a business I think we know that and we see the contracts that are out there and we get all of it but just from a player standpoint\nYou know them flying his grandma which is you know a couple of pennies to the organization\nMeant that much to a guy that just goes to show you how cutthroat up a business the NFL is and you've you've talked about before just you know players not wanting to play late in the year because there is a contract year and they don't want to you know give up another sack and have it be brought up in negotiations I don't think that we've really wrap their minds around just how much of a business it really is\nIt's a huge business and it's sometimes you know people are are penny pinching and they don't want to give you certain equipment and all that kind of stuff [laughter] and that's and that's where it's at the little things you know what they're thrown at USC jock straps you instead of just giving you your own ... um\nYeah some that I haven't [laughter]\nWe only have a high um Brady joining us Dr Fox Sports radio as we can be live

Eighteen the original series\nMystery new episodes Wednesday's an audience [noise]\nExclusively on direct TV channel two thirty nine and streaming on direct TV Now\nHis baritone day Thursday and host of spin I hurt radios newest podcast twenty three in the where we explore how understanding your DNA changes how we think about ourselves and the world around us we've got the inevitable why ... we have so much\nMore in common than you could even imagine you put two kids together they're going to want to play they're going to want to have all the time they gonna wanna fall in love\nWith the veil\nYou can listen bought our first I already downloaded [noise]\nWell here's the other crazy heart about it this team is lost for the last five games and in their division there only a game out of first place right now right I mean there are only a game out of the play offs and all it takes is\nWhy it it sounds a lot easier I mean bill Brian with us all it's hard to win in the NFL today but all it takes is a couple of breaks that I mean you start looking in Jacksonville schedule\nTheir hosting Philly next week that suddenly no fur coat match up by the way they played recently and then they go to Indy so next thing you know we're sitting here dumping all over them and Blake poodles but in two weeks already they could be five and four and sit in a top that division right now\nSame thing speaking of the eagles and the NFC oh wow how do we how do we make sense of what's going on in the NFC East right now only three of the four teams that were in the championship games last year and the a obscene NFC championship give their garbage this year\nI thought we had seen a bad last for the eagles when they lost that game to the titans\nThis one that ... that's ... that could pears\nIn comparison to what they did today up Seventeen the nothing and then they were that that whole game on and so the cat Newton throat for over towards a yours is the fourth quarter I mean you've got your eagles fed right now you got to be pulling your hair at it that was in Paris the laws today\nBad I mean bad horrible 'cause you see the eagles Twitter account put out they had a sponsor deal it's a vote for your player of the game was let's just say eagle fan a little bit salty but much like Jacksonville player that gorgeous Cam Newton [laughter] exactly we vote for Kim moon\nBut earning much like Jacksonville ... ended his there in a division right now we're no one's running away with it you're not looking up at an undefeated rams team you're not looking up at a\nAt a one last Kansas City or I don't know if you if you want to throw maybe kind of the way things are going in ah well I Can't even see the NFC North okay you're not looking up at a one last New Orleans saints team\nHe you're struggling if you're ... you only lost three games all your last year you're three and four and you're only\nWhat a game and a half out of the first place right now and it's Washington in front of U.S foreign too and I don't know how you feel but I don't think they're going to run away from it so are we breaking down two teams one that won a championship one that played in the AFC Championship game last year that are in panic mode only when they really don't have to be quite yet\nThe well Jacksonville or Philadelphia Philadelphia has to be in panic mode because there are three and four of the season is about to come to a quick get one more last they dropped the three and five you could write that season up\nJacksonville ... a little bit different because as you said that division is absolutely disgusting ... bad and the Texans actually lead that so when you only one game behind I wouldn't be that though you don't want to go to three and five also in Jacksonville but you've got a little bit more leeway because well every game you're going to be favored in\nBut I mean how is the AFC South so much more of a balance battled than what you have in the NFC East I mean you're looking up at Washington right now Washington the Redskins now granted they play at the giants next week but are you are you taking in Washington is going to run away with this now\nI just want to say the only reason you're look it up at the Redskins is because Jason Garrett decided that were good with a fifty two yard are let's let's go ahead and kill the last ... seconds of the game were okay with it instead of you know what maybe we could pass and gave it an extra ten or twenty yards make it a little bit easier for the kicker otherwise you'd be looking up at the Dallas Cowboys right now\nSo again that's my point I I don't I I'm actually buying in to what they were selling post game what Doug Peterson was selling post game for the eagles and nobody nobody wants to hear this after your team loses but\nHey three and four I'm not going to try to tell you this good thing in your galvanized now but in all this panic that I Would feel as if in maybe not as bad as we might be laying it out of ... I I\nCan't believe I'm what am I doing All right I'm going with like this positive spin\nOr you can do some of the writers you still think the writers are going to go and come back it when that division\nWe're already at one in five right now if they beat the Colts next week you would have I mean there are only two games out of the wildcard spot don't think I haven't figured this out yet why we have tons to get you on the show tonight when we come back we've got a tip our tone went to the college football world but\nThere is some wild rumors rolling out of Cleveland will tell you what we know next with audience plank on Fox Sports radio [laughter]\nGoing to be too\nLate one hundred sixty three\nAnd now when for in your city is a world champion\nWill it be Boston Red Sox still Los Angeles Dodgers World Series coverage is right here\nEven if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or is that a war basketball's bouncy cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during the game\nWell here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car to ... also helps people get used cars that's right to car isn't just for buying new cars where there are certified dealer network at nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simple or buying experience when you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with two cars certified dealers\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout to car and enjoy more confident car buying experience some features not\nAvailable at all states technology to most people money like oh you have fourteen Logan passwords and you can't remember any of them\nAre one or two is awesome awesome one two three\nTruth it's so easy to switch and save on car insurance I'd Tyco dot com Doug is super cool ... percent underscore exclamation point exclamation point Nineteen eighty five Neal act like Fifteen minutes because they'd be Fifteen Percent or more [noise]\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans drive safely you Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart military ...

this I\nI like college town they would lose my five to six touchdowns against Alabama\nWell I think anyone actually would lose by about\nFive I barely be Memphis in that one that was that one got a little bit hairy for them ... forget about Alabama then up put up against the Irish or your Oklahoma team they will lose by for touchdowns either one of those teams also\nI Will say this I Will say this\nI Love seeing these like because they have power five and group of five the conversation I Love when you see a team make a run like this\nThe problem is I think they get so caught up in the look at me mindset that they're going to trip up someone they got to talk of games they got to potential ranked teams that got Cincinnati coming up the guys out for the I Know you don't care about those teen Barney but they're good football teams and to me\nI did what you're trying to do but when you're games right just go out there and when your games you know let's have that conversation near the end of the year because there's a lot of people that think\nUh to loss Alabama three Alabama would deserve a spot over an undefeated team from the American athletic conference\nOn or off I Would say maybe a two U.S team I don't know if I'm going to go where the three laws team but I'll I'll stick with the ... when\nWe come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios whereas the college football

dominant on the stat sheet as well as Patrick my home's had three hundred and fifty eight yards passing for touchdowns one interception\nBy my count this makes Marvin Lewis prime time record at nine thirty two in his career might off when you have been around long enough to have over forty primetime games including postseason and you've only one nine of them ever ...\nYou know I've not a good

final played hit the upright\nRams are seven and oh after winning thirty nine to ten at San Francisco Tampa Bay and overtime be Cleveland road wins for Carolina and I come back for New England and Houston which has one for in a row\nNBA the four games are all final now Chris Paul starting a two game suspension tonight Houston still want at staples center as they did last night against the Lakers no they didn't win without him it was the clippers can you believe that clip while I'm eating Houston that I nailed on one Fifteen one twelve\nSo much for that narrative everybody just assume but no these clippers beat Houston James Harden did have a thirty one points\nAnd fourteen assist in defeat Denver beat Golden State one hundred and Ninety eight nuggets are three into Cleveland oh and three after losing it home to Atlanta Oklahoma City owned three after losing it home to Sacramento and Russell Westbrook play at thirty two points guy by the way a that Steven\nSaid he'll be back in the thirty minutes with everything that's going on in the world of sports we really want to remind you that were brought to buy ... what does it mean one guy who says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well it means you're probably should have gone to a guy called outcome Fifteen minutes you\nBy the way up to come up with a new nickname for Chris Paul you know those like the three fingers ... if he would have stuck his finger in my face oh he would have been missing a finger I probably should not be as 'cause there was no spit I'm a firm run though I think he's full of bologna\nWow you just drop the three fingers more to ... yeah I don't know how I got that one but I you know ... you know you don't put your hand in somebody's face like that come on now hope they spit in my face I might I mean that's kind of what they're trying to show what they are they ... as you have video but I didn't see it I mean I'm Sorry\nEveryone was like watching the you know the NBA is looking at this and they think he spit in his face and I watch it at like twelve times and I didn't see any no no I didn't see it I think\nJust Chris Paul was on the line there are ... what was he thinking what was he talking about\nBecause he uh he doesn't eat he needs to eat what he was mad about [laughter]\nHe skipped too many mills he's angry so he needs to eat so he can put some meat on them both I you know I'm gonna I'm gonna hide behind the door so you guys can't throw anything at me but as I look back around this I Want to I've watched every minute just about last I was flipping around a lot\nUh just about every minute both Lakers games I'm going to say this and and then I'm going to hide back behind the door she could throw things at me ... playing very well there were ... I'm going to go hide factor there there's not the numbers that are out there where you can say like tray young did tonight against the ...\nHe was thirty five but I'm saying yeah uh but I I think he's playing really well I think this is going to be a nice little breakout year formula brown there are I got to get back to football but yeah I get all these hates which I'm just a good point and I'm\nWe talked about the UCF statement of Danny wide released tonight or who is this this is a way who I take out an ad the reason for the statement was a rebuttal to an ESPN college game they said yes I understand that and I get it but I also think if someone says who cares to a twenty and twenty game winning streak\nThere just idiots I Can't think of any other way to put it I don't care\nIf Steve the sacred I coined this phrase back whenever we were working the graveyard shift together good is good and if you put together twenty straight wins no ones out there playing just guys that are throwing with the wrong hands every single week so that that's\nThat's you know what ... pump the brakes I pump the brakes I see that here in Vermont when I watch college basketball and I see Vermont dominate the American east next thing you know or would they played in the tournament your one and done\nYeah you could dominate your cup friends when you have teams that are equal or or or less are far less are inferior that you but when you play the big boys is a different story it's a little ... and all that stuff come on now\nA loyal to Chicago making the final four this year old and already\nHey I before we accept up let's see there's always a rule you know what I mean\n... the year before our\nWell but what conference today play and you know you you I think you're really selling short how we're starting to see that bar get a little bit more do you know who's the preseason top five team in some people's mind the sheer Nevada yeah they they just lost the Washington by Fifteen and up preseason game\nDidn't get caught and I had to come back with something off the head\nI thought that was pretty good though they even knew something like that a very very ... turned on that uh they gave you the answer no no that's right you could have just a deck of the ... are made something up and I wouldn't have known anyone ... and then one more quick one since we did bring up the the punch\nYesterday a Eddie right cp three couldn't help but get into a fight with the guard that actually has won something significant to bat he can't have\nHaving class to his resume I'm Glad the clippers dumped him only wish we could see less of him in ads I guess that's the state farm conversation right [noise]\nUm I I don't go patient from the in Studio crowd grow I've watched is a thousand times I don't necessarily see a spit he's got a mouthpiece in that he's talking to him through the mouthpiece I mean that's not that I I\nAgain it's out there you guys can determine and Paul gets in his face and\nThen of course the sponges are handed out with four games for Ingram so we can debate this until we're crazy but I I just I don't think it was that agree just maybe I'm allowing\nMy Laker fan them to override this a little bit uh by the way already this was a a very good tweet that came in moments ago yeah ah they wanted to know are you are your dolphins ready to take on the Alabama ... uh Crimson Tide\nNo no not yet well hopefully we get some better practices and then we might be ready to take them on you know were born three it's not like the seasons completely over we going to die offs we can come on we can still make a run in the playoffs give me a little bit of a break\nPerspective because now you can it's a couple of people treated right away well maybe they should have put the patriots and bears in prime time maybe it should have been the same thing the raven Redskins\nNot on Fox for the first time in like twenty something years\nOh was that on the NASA today yeah it was it RCB yesterday she I didn't even notice I didn't even know what does that count down while I was watching it but I guess the point is Arnie did you can't you feel like when you put a team\nIn Cincinnati whose foreign one and an undefeated oh I'm Sorry I have five in one Kansas City chiefs team who was undefeated when you've flex them to Sunday Night Football feel like you're going to get a good match up when you look at San Francisco unfortunately even though they play very well against the Green Bay on Monday Night and you could argue they should have probably won that game\nThey lost a lot of their ... whenever they lost Jimmy ... for the season so it made sense to flex out but this is always a a high side conversation which gets we don't want to want to ask you may I ask you about the second who's got to beat the rams [noise]\nEven in the playoffs or the regular season [laughter]\nSo they don't go sixty to know or\nThe bones [laughter] honestly I'm starting to think boat I they're scared\nI I'll tell you this I think the rams lose at New Orleans in two weeks so okay uh I think that's good to be their last they may even lose to Detroit on the road also and then back to back up games Detroit and Chicago so uh I think they get up three losses when it's all said and done when it comes to the playoffs do that\nThat's a whole nother story I I at this point\nUh you know when you have a great often so that's one thing but we know that defenses win Super Bowls do they have a Superbowl caliber defense I think they do\nSeven ... and four turnovers today by that rams that defense in air and Donald I mean my gosh you're talking about a rounding into warm it helps when you got sued next year but that defense is ... good ah so here's their their shouldn't ... right or the dolphins when they had to\nA ... day wait Philips found a way Arnie yeah they they were willing to pay him a lot of money and he didn't have air and Donald next to him and I guess that's made all the difference in the world Packers next week\nRight and they got the saints then they've got the Seahawks then they had the chiefs and they don't have their by until after the chief's game so they've got four games before they even reached they're buying as you brought up\nAt Detroit at Chicago home to Philadelphia at Arizona and against the war\nYou know what I'm going to be in a desperate situation oh by the time they get to that game was considering the three and four right now\nYou know and it's also pretty amazing when you see what Sean McVeigh is doing because this now sets the bar\nFor every single new coach right every single team that's looking for a coach if it's Cleveland or what Mark Davis expected with John Bruton in Oakland uh or I I don't know what the expectations are probably in New York with a new coach everyone looks at the rams and go well when they when\nIt took over obviously that was a that was a four five six when team and now they were the best team in the NFC last year in the undefeated this year everyone looks at Sean ... I Do as a fan\nAnd I said what's he doing that we're not doing right now Jarrett golf everyone thought he was a bus stop to the first year now he might be one of the ... on quarterbacks in the NFL said the same thing about the ambient Brad Stevens\nSure of course to\nThat's just how it is you see these guys that have success in situations where maybe they were struggles beforehand\nAnd you think All right everyone should be able to do that right because they're showing that they could do with the rams if Brad Stevens could do it with the Celtics come here and do it for me in Oakland come here and do it for me in San Francisco come in and do it for me what the judge it sets a really high bar and that's a huge praise\nTo a guy like McVeigh but only it's incredible what he's done with this team\nWas the talent you know I mean jeeze for quite a while they look the way everybody goes oh look what has been able to do well not sure what ... what you got you got all all broke out liberal running back\nYou got tiring kill I mean you you got weapons all around you and you got a great coach it's good to go at nurture you Andy Reid you've got everything in your favor\n[noise] true but it was pretty much the same roster last year that fell short losing to the titans in the first round of the\nWorld who have well I I was just like we saw that coming back I mean I'm Sorry [laughter] long\nWay to go before we get to that point I was to bake this more but when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios we've got a hot seat that apparently has reached the boiling level of big news potentially tonight we're tracking stories out of Cleveland could this be the end\nFor Hugh Jackson and what that really make that much of a different will go more in depth on the\nUh intent coaching situation in Cleveland next with already and playing on Fox Sports radio\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds\nEveryone's on them if you're a fifty year old male maybe a bit\nPorgy and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month called term providers speak with big Lu at eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight big Lew will find a term my policy for you even if you have\nType ... diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure term providers helped thousands of people like you think they can afford term life insurance\nTo buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you all you need to do is called big Lu at eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight ... will make sure the scales are tipped in your favor\nGall eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight ... we'll answer your call and worked at the window a term life policy that you can afford remember big lose IQ he's on meds to golf eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight\nSeparate thirty first twenty Eighteen see us or go to go ... dot com for more information\nI Love the ocean [noise] me I Love a slow winding river I Love them because of that but nothing compared to what you love inside of my family my child my best friend first grade if you're behind the wheel of up to pay attention that way your favorite water will always be safe water\nLearned more about voting safety in my F.

today I have one of the local of on the local whatever you getting your local market have that game on on one of the TV's as well to just watch the red zone and it was great it was fun I was following my fantasy team I was\nGoing on at the patriots special teams I was\nAllowed at just how strong of an arm that a pitch ... showed late late ...\nMy team doesn't play I feel like it's a vacation or something I I I just can't like something's missing I Can't do this I mean my team playing\n[laughter] and then a one more quick one here before a break from Mike\nWho writes I Know this game happened like two days ago or something but maybe might ... you can join Hugh Jackson and the unemployment line tomorrow seriously what was that are going for two points early this morning\nFor those that flip through it on the west coast had yourself a little what six thirty AM kickoff yeah this morning I Love those games I Wish they did more of that\nBetween the chargers and the titans and instead of taking an extra point to tied the game and go to overtime migrate decides to go for it to the first time they did it they got a penalty called I honestly independently what's called obviously on the chargers\nI would've just gone ahead and kicked at that point I Would have said All right and you know we're just going to go out and kick this thing and tried to get the overtime I think that he went to that so they didn't have time to go to overtime you think that's what it was\nNot what it was that the report will walk with the belly ring I think is what I heard that\nI still believe the belly ring right up until the sacred and tell me Fifteen minutes in the first hour I saw it you know part of it is I follow a bunch of astro fans I don't know how this happened\nUh and they were all in on out to the plate with a fractured knee and sail had a belly button ring that let made him is starting up and I'm kind of remember thinking that that seems a little bit much and then find out it was fake ruin my whole night but I I just I never\nHave a problem if you feel good about your chances and you've got to play drawn up that you think can get you to point why not knowing that situation from over watching that game this morning the chargers were gassed I mean they were beaten I I don't know\n[noise] Hi time for the most iconic brand and the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now high time investor dot com dome is your chance to be part of history and uh making busy at high time investor dot com that high times investor dot com huts I'm holding\nCorps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and chairs and kind of stuff\nIs there some day Thursday in and if you haven't already you have to check out our radios newest podcast twenty ... this is the show where we sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around us\nThis week we got real with Melissa Etheridge has we discuss what does it mean to be family family's family ... you can make family family's loss that the bond\nWe'll say he idea of freedom that some of these individuals have is if someone else's feeling something that I don't like the national freedom because they don't believe I Believe because they don't talk how I Want them to talk you don't you just run out of the island Cindy they don't recognize the Iraqi Freedom here any of\nBut uh yeah no nothing that's going to make it go running out and say I got to watch his game\nAll right we've got more I got more I got to talk Dallas Cowboys we've got the latest on exactly whether or not the Redskins are good and what happened between the ravens and the same to something that we haven't spent a lot of time on\nBut the rest of the intro webs have been talking about it all day long but before we get to all of that from the guy a Fox Sports radio studios state to state or is in the house what's going on Steve\nWell the easy Kansas City when I but did you see the Jason lock in for a report this morning that of course Paul Allen suddenly sadly passed away this week not only Microsoft cofounder but Seattle Seahawks owner\nHe has no errors he's not passing on writing hawks to anyone rights and so the Seahawks will be sold one day and for a record price no doubt his sources said\nThe exchange of the franchise is likely to follow a similar path that we saw with buffalo and Ralph Wilson finally passed away and there were provisions about the franchise remaining in that region\nWait a minute route plus that airs yet had siblings yet children what they they\nGo on to his own now what the goal is on the\nBill right but they wanted they ... the family wanted to sell the Buffalo Bills they couldn't sell about up it was like you didn't have any airs or anything like that I'm wrong\nBut had to sell it to buffalo people keep all in key right yes yes yes absolutely yeah though it's going to be here they are lineup ... talks\nAbout what Bon Jovi moving it up to Toronto and Donald Trump one of the fire and I don't know what was going on with\nThat that's right former a ... right and you mentioned the giants at Atlanta tomorrow night there is one item that sake one Barkley can tie Kareem Hunt for most consecutive games to start a career with at least a hundred yards from scrimmage in each of those games\nToday was cream hunting year to\nScoring more and more three total touchdown Casey over Cincinnati forty five to ten hunt at a eighty six yards rushing plus five reception for family five yards chiefs are six and one Washington beat Dallas twenty to Seventeen Dallas missing a fifty two yard field goal attempt on the final play\nYou guys mentioned this was a a CBS game even though NFC packages on Fox yeah they have this thing called cross flexing in recent years where to kind of balance it out since the NFC teams generally are the larger markets they actually trade some late afternoon games\nAnd that's how it worked out so it went to more a greater audience a larger percentage of the country but that's why it was not on Fox wild Dallas\nWashington no longer the prime game unbelievable\nAnd Dallas by the way had that false start yeah the play before he'll call terrible and that's what the blown snapper and horrible ... talks and it's been there long snapper for fourteen seasons in Dallas\nHe's only at five penalties ever yeah and uh know poor snaps in his career and he says I was telling the ref this is exactly what I've been doing every snap for fourteen years I'm not trying to draw them off sides he thinks as long as the balls on the ground the whole time I didn't lifted up it's not a penalty\nAnd yet there was a five year coal so instead of a forty seven year kick at the end fifty two yard field goal attempt missed by Dallas hit the upright they lose by three twenty to Seventeen at Washington chased LA at the NASCAR when angels new manager Brad Smith the late NBA game went to the clippers over Houston one Fifteen one twelve\nAnd a Houston to not have Chris Paul two game suspension and finally Ohio State failed a number eleven in the new a pie college football poll after last night's loss Alabama and Clemson or one to Notre Dame is three\nWashington state up to number fourteen in the country Oregon is down to number Nineteen NC State failed a twenty to Utah is in at twenty three I Believe that yes the endgame\nNext weekend is a\nIt's the friday night is is Utah at UCLA so while the rose bowl is hosting college football there is a little thing called the world series at Dodger Stadium happening though and that means also that they're going to be televising this pact twelve game\nWhen the world series and they're not going to be going to highlights or interviews or anything like that [laughter] wow so congratulations us a Utah is right now they are at twenty three then stand for twenty four an Appalachian State is number twenty five in AP\nStuff Ah yes lap state showed up in the top twenty five no and he loves those mid major schools to get an opportunity like that by the way up\nA cording to so why you gotta hey Arnie listen just because Arizona always loses to them doesn't mean you can't give them respect\nA quick note to kind of tag on since she had brought a college football's most recent rankings the twenty eighth team playoff predictor from Seth Waldor who runs ESPN's analytics saw that they still have\nOhio State with a twenty five percent chance to make the playoffs ... considerably way down though that's the second best odds for a Big Ten team with Michigan as a matter of\nIn this whole stupid little phrase we have in the radio world if the season or two into two day which it doesn't so why am I wasting your time with this because we have time to fill Clemson Alabama Notre Dame and Michigan would be the four teams in the playoffs\nGeorge ... of the other teams on the outside looking in Georgia in Oklahoma both with a thirty percent chance and we mentioned Ohio State there were twenty five percent while El Al shoe is at fourteen what would they give central Florida\nCentral Florida is not listed whoa they have a Washington at six in to what the five percent chance listed a head of central Florida\nSo such afford to even have a five percent chance\nThat would be affirmative Arnie now will be affirmative what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well it means you probably should have gone to a guy called outcome Fifteen minutes ago cannot looking good for you\nThat funny how we love to see uh the underdogs play the the big boys in basketball vote it comes to football right guy come on let's move it along here we don't want to see this yeah uh and\nAnd then when it does happen for instance whenever UCF goes to a ball game and beat someone like all burn Auburn fans while we didn't care that boy they're right\nAnd so it it's kind of like Hawaii in Georgia oh wait a minute that that's the way that one doesn't fit that would have learned that doesn't work that we did not end well it'll All right I got a couple of other uh buy sell stock up stocked stocked down here for you real quick Arnie\nBecause I I Do think there is some intriguing things that came out of Sunday today are on the west coast yesterday on the east coast\nAre you buying that the saints might be the number two contender in the NFC 'cause I mean come on the rams or definitive number one but is the second best team in the NFC saints\nI mean that's\nJust my man Paul on Twitter but I like this is well to add kids rocks I'm In Ohio State Dallas Cowboys fan army I like your Ohio State urban Meyer take he's got to be tired of this BS I'd love to see him in the NFL\nMaybe even to replace Jason Garret\nWho are not too bad I think about this if you're thinking about this up your urban Meyer um\nWhat have you ever been so disenchanted in your life\nA and look I don't know what happened uh for the reason he decided to see at a bad heart and all that stuff I don't know what was going to maybe does I'm I'm not exactly sure what's going on medically but\n... if he ever wanted to leave a job I Would assume it is right about now or ... I was up to what he had to deal with at the beginning of the year not that he didn't deserve that are to be honest with you so\nUm I Would think I Would put more than fifty fifty that this would be as last year if there was something out there that he really wanted\nNow the uh the amazing new Steve ... is there still somehow alive in this playoff conversation where do you want to start tonight and he's\nSeen as a harder the belly button ring I think by the way to items that we bring up every Sunday night one another overtime game today so this has never happened before in the NFL at least one overtime game each of the first seven weeks\nAnd also Adam feeling the Vikings receiver another nine catches a hundred ten yards at a score and the wind over the jets today so at least a hundred receiving yards for him in Egypt is teams for seven games of a season\nThat's only happened one other time in football and that was with a Nineteen sixty one Oilers\nI kept on guard that guy man somebody knock him on his backside [laughter]\nSounds like a jets fan if you saw the rams\nToday you saw Aaron Donald for sex a force fumble fumble recovery\nCorey little town of LA a couple of sex at a block party for a safety they dominated at San Francisco so the rams open the year seven and hope for the first time since that Eric Dickerson back in the mid eighties with Kurt Warner that open six and oh three straight seasons but always lost the seventh game not this team and running back Todd girlie has fourteen touchdowns already\nThe only other guys that have had fourteen touchdowns in the first seven games of his team's season Jim Brown and priest Holmes who did that twice started that well in two thousand two and two thousand four in the ... category but three more touchdowns for girlie today\nOr put it this way Todd girlie has fourteen touchdowns the Buffalo Bills have seven\nBut by the way you mentioned priest Holmes's Jersey has made a big comeback because everybody stick it out there ... and just adding a ... to it so they\nCould see that in the end I think at the Jersey there has been set up by the way for all bill\nSeven touchdown says a team in seven games just for the record and ah I mentioned that the rams start at seven in ... when they were playing in Anaheim back in Nineteen eighty five\nWho was the quarter a quarterback got ever Dieter\nBrock a theater and they tried to be eighty five championship game and got snowed under by the bills the bears defense in Chicago angels will have a news conference by the way tomorrow in Anaheim new manager Brad ... they had read on that stadium after the rams moved out\nUh about Twenty years ago they did it into being just a ballpark and the angels in Southern California made big news this weekend opting out of their lease with the reality of Anaheim they're going to instead reopen negotiations with whoever the new mayor and city council are there\nWhile keeping other options open whatever other options for them and the other options are going to some other city in Southern California and already a rumor is well if you're thinking about money and stadium building\nThe bomber owns the clippers and wants his own arena what if he actually went together with the angels on something but all of this is years down the road but there is\nNo commitment for the angels staying in the city of Anaheim for years and as far as old as ballparks of course Fenway in Wrigley are the two oldest but the next two oldest are Dodger Stadium an angel stadium both nineteenth ...\nWhat about that already Marino went to a Arizona to college you of a big boy\nYou want to go to those laws yeah we'll look at that by the way the angels did play at Dodger Stadium before this Anaheim Stadium was built bad four seasons there they just they can call it Dodgers stadium didn't want to use the name but it was\nChavez Ravine named after the ... the world series with the Dodgers in Boston starts Tuesday night on Fox TV all the games will start at about eight pm eastern time\nUh Boston today so it started young running back get injured the patriots Sony Michel injury and bills running back with Sean McCoy head injury below pal jets neck injury\nKenny Stills and Albert Wilson and Miami with injuries still limping locker room apparently with a minute left Wilson left with a leg injury and his game at what has gone wrong with the Jacksonville Jaguars they've lost three straight last uh Houston today\nFailed to score in the first half for a third straight week\nFinally change quarterbacks today but in the jags young franchise history they haven't done that before and they've had worst teams but in the opening heads the last three games that but I'd scored fifty seven nothing total jeeze by Houston Dallas in case the genetic being cloudy the Texans said to sex in a fumble recovery today\nAnd the kicking wow we'll start with Adam vegetarian future hall of fame kicker for the Cole sees within five points of becoming the NFL's all time scoring leader but today missed two extra points in one game that is the first in as long as he has\nA it's a Anderson has the overall right points isn't it ... Anderson Justin Tucker is going to be a whole why\nHer I was in a blender up there he played quarterback ...\nWe had a very long career yeah like a Nolan Ryan type of long career yes they didn't used to make field goal set off and backed Raul Castro adjusting Tucker missing the first PAT of his career as you mentioned it looked like it was going straight down the middle and then somebody\nMaybe a thousand people blew it to the right I immediately but they lost by a play or to the back of the stadium giants to anything\nLike that and as far as him never missing the exact numbers but since they moved the extra point back a few years ago he was one twelve that if one twelve and if you include all the shorter extra points earlier in his career he made his first two hundred twenty two pi eighties I'm at the end of the game ...\nWhen we come get stopped Steve when we come back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios to the locker room [noise]\nOkay Ben Mather here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me and just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service rovers Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their training specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy code dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart like signaling ring must be Michelin leads to the group\nGiving you unparalleled street free long lasting only\nSo when the going\nMichelin ... is a difference you can see\n... all over all the folks and I don't well register online but on the\nMost of the plane are corporate plenty far from over on the phone from one of my former Carmen calling from [noise]\nCorporate problem from ... from Austin who ... parts per hour over time\nProbably hurt him over and over half of all ... harmful for\n... for both of them are from\nHorrible proper her heart\nWe're ... we were talking about I'm pregnant with her ... her vote on who all\nArmed him my home phone about provide problem for most of them were from a court reporter for Latin\nMusic I heart radio present in the studio check it out now\nAnd now the hard radio we can sports time capsule\nHey fellas sports fans are Danny weapon I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history\nThat's the way back in Eighteen fifty seven where the world's first soccer club or football club shed feel that the founded in England [noise]\nThis week in Nineteen Twenty one the Green Bay Packers play their first NFL game seven six when over the Minneapolis Marines this week in Nineteen thirty nine NBC become the first network to tell us\nWhen we were helpful\nListen bought our first I ... [noise] downloading\nI'm On you know no offense I don't have that much time left here I've got to get another Super Bowl so you know he'll make that move when he has to kind of like the Buffalo Bills Ralph Wilson they went through a lot of uh coaches after Martin levy or you may see the same thing now with the Dallas Cowboys but one thing I Know for sure uh Jason ... got to do\nIt again with every one is looking at the rams everyone thinks well outside of John grown in Oakland everyone thinks they have a pretty good roster and they look at the rams and say look what they're doing not necessarily seven to know Arnie but moving the football like they are having their off it but nobody has\nTo die or what was it thirty three years old Twenty years old Thirteen Years old nobody has the guts dots wire somebody that young\nTwelve years old already and they gave him a complete control as well too I\nI Know but if that's the standard now and if you're in Dallas senior Jerry Jones that's what you want that's what you expect and and that's what you feel like you should be getting as the owner of the most\nLucrative organization maybe and spores right what we got time here we have one other big media kick that we need to get into here before we wrap up this segment and kind of get you\nSome more of the post game sound as this acre brought up he had been absolutely perfect absolutely perfect an extra points in his career and Justin Tucker my fantasy kicker mine showing ths\nSteps up to try to tie the game and potentially send us into overtime\nDown\nFor forty four seconds I must say twenty four hundred and twenty three\nBelievable [laughter]\nI mean I I don't know if that was just a pure mind blown I didn't ... celebration I didn't\nSee the replay was one of those times where the quarterback they've scored an and Flaco wasn't even watching just assuming that it was going to be an automatic or what\nOh no no no they were all watching and they all saw it and their reactions were priceless hey speaking of Flaco here's what he said\nSometimes I watch some time to do this one you can't really tell from the sidelines anyway or listen to us into great friend of mine and we've all been through football games where it looks like it's you're the guy that\nYou know he's in the spotlight at the end of the game when you can kind of be determined we go to overtime win that game or prevent them from going down and kicking a field goal\nSo a lot of things go through your mind but I've been there are plenty of times I mean if you play football long enough you're going to be there at some point so we're very tight team here in the first thing you think about is your brother up in him dealing with it and I mean just in the best in the world what he does and he's more confident person that I Know it's not going to be an issue\nHere one hundred percent one hundred percent from thirty three yards in in your career and that happens so real quick here already yeah I give credit to Justin Tucker it was kind of a goofy dude but he wouldn't answer every question they asked him\nTo the challenging data taking our stadium but\nWe're here because we make it not only in our stadium but\nAnywhere we go and that's exactly what we're going to do moving forward it's going to keep working out on our practice field and hopefully turn those kicks they're into more may feel ... he's in games\nI'd be what what can you say\nI don't really want his name was born in the hell out of me so much as I come out you suck I mean you miss the an easy one by the way she could be criticized even though it is your first extra point Mr ... you'd be criticized because the team the game or no that doesn't matter\nYou take that someone in the reporter pools should go yeah well listen you suck okay you miss the let me ask you a\nBroad James miss the dog with one second left a down by one you don't think he'd be criticized\nWell I'm I don't think Justin Tucker isn't being criticized drawn out All right just I don't think that even if LeBron does that you have reporters and walk up and say well you suck\nSo I don't know what you're doing here in the league right now you miss the gimme a to win the game I mean what do you expect ... as he said you're in this position because you make kicks look at it may seem Crosby yeah two weeks ago already well yes five field goals five opportunities so\nKicking man it's the most ... thing to try to figure out here we are probably\nA probably putting everyone asleep talking about taking a little bit too much but that's the story of the day the NFL amiss kick in Dallas the mist kicked in Baltimore ultimately I think I think it was a nightmare day uh in Tampa for the browns the buccaneers but regardless\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nJackson after the game today was\nThat we got to do our best to our best rural or best skillful was it in Jacksonville was it before or in the middle or after the Michigan Michigan State was it the Laker game was it the only guy said Nick Saban by missing I didn't agree with what was also by missing\nI Need to get these approved or film of the ice being thrown on Nick safe speaking of that there is a pretty good little debate about whether or not butch Jones should be allowed to celebrate a lot of great [laughter] well it was a direct would only and play on Fox Sports radio\n\nPlace it makes you rise outta your share\n\nThis is why you love\nLost sports radio\nEven if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or is that a war basketball's bounce the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles door game\nWell here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car through ... also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network nationwide inventory of nearly ... million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory\nAnd a simple or buying experience when you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with two cars certified dealers\nSo I already they didn't just get beat they they got destroyed right and they got to be forty nine to twenty\nTo produce team is now foreign three on the season and I thought you had an incredibly emotional story right just as they do team that lost to eastern Michigan this is they produce team that last uh two moves do I get it they won four straight games but in those wins\nThey knocked off of Nebraska team that just now got his first win at Illinois team so I don't I don't know why you're not ... why do you try to work kid gloves on this one well I Know in the\nLast week when we were together so um it's not that I Want to work it goes it's just that I don't want them being behind the Texas school which I think it's overrated I don't want them uh you know being by like a central Florida which I don't think it's going to happen anyway I just wanted to make sure they're in their proper spot there\nTexas will be very interesting this weekend as they travel to Stillwater, Oklahoma state they could lose that game very easily even though as you struggled sorry we'll get back to the NFL when we come back to the gecko Fox Sports radio studios but for one final time tonight let's check in with their buddies Steve to say good to see what we missed out on and what's going on in the world of sports what's going on Steve\nGood evening once again you know I read this tweet last night it looked it up and it's true that next Sunday in downtown LA all four major sports could be an action same day\nDay game for the rams day game for the LA kings that staple center then they gave a staple center with the clippers and then the Dodgers World Series game which wait a minute wait wait\nOne more time kings playing at home and then they got to turn the ice into basketball and along\nCorrect that happens all the time on weekends in LA and the ran double checked out to say your ambulance news game with the Packers jealousy so it's not just for sports for sports in one area of one town on one not it will be a lot of traffic that if there's even a\nGay I thought I was at the kings game ah the kings game on Saturday with king savers and figure Braun was a bronze home to be with us naval what four or five hours after the game that's where I might as well been behind us with pitchforks poking at the door [laughter] I haven't seen them pushed you out the door staples in that that quickly that fast\nLouis or the four games from the forest sports next Sunday in downtown LA\nBy all means drive in downtown LA next time I'm sure the roads will be quite free as always in downtown Los Angeles\nLetting you know in advance all the world series games will started about eight pm eastern time on Fox TV beginning with game one at Boston on Tuesday temperature about fifty degrees there they say any rain should end before game one it's the weather will ... on in LA next weekend temperature and the eighties Ireland know up here today in Vermont\nI don't think the world series being played in Vermont and they've gotten around to get a new like he was already Marino to move the angels the two sides [laughter]\nWe talked last hour by Drew Brees with is five hundred career touchdown pass one point went over the ravens today\nSo he goes on a list with Peyton Manning Brett Farr and Tom Brady he's also on a lift with manning and far he's defeated every NFL team at least once a while at Tom Brady has not because those are breeding Quinn pointed out last show Tom Brady has never faced the patriots therefore probably never be on that list but good for anyone and a\nCouple of years ago when they get rid of them\nTwenty four twenty three New England won at Baltimore because the ravens did score late touchdown but then missed the extra points and Washington beat Dallas twenty to Seventeen is Dallas missed a fifty two yard field goal attempt on the final play hits the upright Kansas City is six and wanted one tonight's game over Cincinnati forty five to ten Patrick my home's four touchdown passes\nThe chiefs had over five hundred and fifty yards of all fenced in other words about eight yards per play tonight against Cincinnati\nOnline car shopping can be confusing not anymore which reprise from true car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next cars to visit true car to enjoy it more confidence car buying experience wins for the rams in New England for Caroline and a comeback Tampa Bay in overtime just for NFL a and a\nNBA games after all the NFL talk there was basketball the clippers won the lake came over Houston one Fifteen one twelve\nAnd know Chris Paul in that one starting his two game suspension Russia and Ronald LA got three games for the fight against Houston why do the same that he did spit yes they're saying they use that word the NBA and its release Brandon anger him a four game suspension\nSo the clippers win by three and an upset and the clippers on free throws tonight we're twenty six for twenty six and one house game Denver is three and oh after beating Golden State one hundred and Ninety eight even those Steph Curry had thirty points that I gets blocked a lay up a temp at the buzzer\nCleveland without LeBron is oh and three Atlanta beat him one thirty three to one eleven is Ricky tray young at thirty five points and eleven assess Oklahoma City oh and three they did have Russell Westbrook he scored thirty two but Sacramento beat him one thirty one one twenty back\nTo these jeez wow how often is it is it\n... the clippers no doubt Blake Griffin anymore when they're twenty six twenty six and the foul line [laughter] ... Jordan's yes master if I can I come up with that one them\nI'll I'll say this much I still I'm Sorry and I will not let my wake her home or to allow me to believe that ... of that round those spit Chris Paul sorry NBA I completely disagree with that they're getting all three games because of it right\nWell and then here's a here's the crazy thing about it what is it well first of all what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well\nIt means you probably should have gone to Geico dot com Fifteen minutes ago we've obviously were were NFL show but there's been so much going on we haven't given the world series the attention that it deserves I'm not a Big Bend will do that coming up next we probably haven't given this suspension the attention that it deserves but think about this army\nUh Carmelo Anthony threw a punch in two thousand and six and was suspended for\nFifth teen gained yeah yeah I'm In Brandon Ingram of all the things that happen in Brandon Ingram Enron do clearly through punches I mean they they clearly through rather they didn't do a punch you just push them is ... came over the top with a punch no way he\nShove James Harden is that what you're talking about\nI'm Talking about after Ron do through his punch watch watches the the play goes on after Rondo and him get into it you see Brandon Ingram come from the back and come over the top with the big right okay I didn't see\nThat I I thought you were talking about the James Harden shop I still don't understand why Bush START I I don't know what are dead to be honest brokers pardons of punk that I Know that but he's been like that for years though you got to push it now\nThat summer's finally going to say enough you're hooked him I'm tired of you are All right here's a couple of things ... let's get to before we get outta here are first and foremost I Love whenever a coach goes for too because if he hits it and they get it and they win the game they're the most amazingly um\nLove this game [noise] love this what was I thought Florida was overrated from the very beginning I think George opens up the whole can on them and I only got ... seven\nI think that's a small price I Would have liked to get the six or six that kid have everything gimme Georgia mind is the seven against Florida Penn State in Iowa [noise]\nWell I I Do like Iowa but Penn State's the better team and it's a small number here for that I think that's a bargain give me some of those ... y and Z months the four and a half against Iowa or over to the NFL\n'em all over my Kansas City chiefs I'm going to lay nine that gets Denver they should crush them like they one today so that shouldn't be a tough game and I bought the rams in Green Bay [noise] now normally I'd be taking the rams but are you telling me the rams are nine point favorite them in the back arguing say [noise]\nAnd they may win but they're not winning by nine [noise] give me the Packers plus nine ... World Series I just starts on Tuesday [noise] Dodgers may not when the first game when I get the Dodgers in seven over the red Sox are there you have a big deal with them as you please but remember those strictly president David purposes\nOnly ... that you have Stuart Gilligan Griffin with your kudos there the Dodgers in seven you liked that one bike or what a ... why do so many I mean like I said I ...\nI really every year you have a team that people just assume is going to win at all we have the rams this year in the NFL you kinda I don't I don't know if there was ever a time where people said last year oh if the Astros but everyone will get on board I don't know if I've ever seen anything more definitive\nIn most people's minds as they feel seem to be and feel about Boston that this is the best Boston Red Sox theme we've seen in a while well managed a well prepared a deep decent rotation so\nThey're going to ... the rotations in disarray that's the problem salesmen coming back after that illness a price got his first win and I mean his first went into ... as a starter he was only nine up that that was in the area of about seven so you kick out of all these been\nThe best started they've had the only thing about the red Sox is the bottom of the light up like Jackie Braley junior\nAnd guys like that are starting to head so ah but I still think the Dodgers up better enters overall also I I like that they might not even take seven games for the Dodgers\nI Would like that now here's here's a question I have because I'm obviously very biased and I think if I throw that out there you all can accept it\nBut did you have a problem with Joe Buck and John smoked at all with the way that they seemed to be skewed towards the greatest pitching staff in the history of mankind in the Milwaukee Brewers in the greatest picture that's ever stepped on a ball diamond before and Josh hater did you seem to have a problem with that or not because I'll be honest with you I don't either\nTalking about bringing them into the the third inning is that what\nYou don't know I used to be a while that was one time when they talked it appeared as if they really like Josh hater like like really really really like Josh Eyder now I'm going to be real clear I have a problem with it I it didn't bother me too bad because I thought how good their bullpen was and how good he was\nYou just got to kind of take it a little bit but there was a faction of Dodger fans it felt like it was a bit over the top\nWhat I was listening about bringing them in the third inning they're like Dodgers will take the ... the rest of the game so let's get his ah two or three innings out of the way in and they'll move on from that I I don't I didn't have a big problem with that on the white Dodger fans\nWill no no no just in general you're focusing on one thing this is the anger that had built through the whole series about how they do they\nGet the point about Joe Buck no matter what gave me call and it's just you're wearing this color suit this color tie you're pulling for this team you're pulling for that either way you could be neutral one hundred percent anyway\nI dig them I thought he smokes were great I really did and I thought a John smoked add an element and has improved every year that he's called baseball so I get it everyone wants their team to be ... over and I understand it but hey crank down a TV crank up the radio trolley Steiner all have your back\nA a tough one quick tweet we only got two minutes before we get outta here in big big Mauer takes over to get you through into your Monday Matt writes I thought this was great we're talking about the browns and what they could do at the head coaching position\nAnd there are some rumors out of Cleveland that huge accident could be done as soon as maybe today we'll find out we'll see Matt right I think guys like Dorsey go after guys who they have roots with\nDorsey who's the gym in Cleveland ... is an established executive one name I think you guys should watch for is Mike mccarthy what the Packers why appears to be having issues with Aaron Rodgers and who history was up to where he is an actor is yeah\nYeah so I I Love that I loved that as a possibility but again you're talking about a guy that won the super bowl has had incredible roots there but every every relationship comes to an end at some point right could we see Mike mccarthy on the move in the off season\nOf course I mean look what's going on in Dallas I mean even at one point Jimi had to go uh you know Barry Switzer had to go Tom Landry had to go everybody's got to go one time or another there as\nI Know we play this game a lot very early in the season much like me looking at playoff standing after seven to the NFL\nBut you start looking around the league there could be quite a few big time vacancies out there\nAre any upcoming off season and then when you're a fan of a team that is one in five you're

do you think the Jackson just move on from him altogether and stick with Carlos Hyde or well\nNo here's the way I was I Would say each day on that day I was how I Would answer that go out and by the way ... pig Latin so I use ... let's pick a number Juan Carlos Hyde was brought in as high end insurance kind of like guy go\nFifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance with their friends are Geico he's a better option for Jacksonville Carlos Hyde than TJ yelled\nWas falling out of favor so the jags they failed to make this move the real app for Jacksonville is they should have made this moving the off season\nThey knew they had an issue here they didn't address it in the off season so they forced to making in season train Jacksonville could've had Carlos Hyde for nothing he was a free agent and instead they ended up having a trade a mid round draft pick the GED and number two Leonard for net is a better players and Carlos Hyde\nThe problem is he's not a healthy place has been nursing this hamstring it sounds like he's going to be out for a good stress longer possibly not even play again this year there's another setback for Leonard Burnett Carlos Hyde has his chance if he takes advantage of it great\nKnow if anybody's going to take advantage of Jacksonville the running backs are collectively the quarterback place sucks

mine Robert Harward to bring\nA different kind of financial radio show\nYou'll get timely information to help you navigate the tricky financial markets with a whole lot of financial noise coming at you will help you sort it all out and make an understandable you'll get information may give birth or may not be telling you it's fun to entertain him relevant had like\nOf having a week arm and that's one of the reasons that he was drafted where he was and why he did not last\nIn Cleveland although he was given the opportunity\nBut Jacksonville despite all that they have\nTo start him give him an opportunity to practice with the number one's the start him in London and see how he does against the very questionable Philadelphia Eagles defense\nAnd those cheese steaks and they're not very good that is you you think about the perfect placebo Cody Kessler starting for Jacksonville you would think would be the magic magic formula to get out of the doldrums\nFor the Philadelphia Eagles defensively but they can't play a full game they have not played a ... they didn't play for game here other than the giants just not showing up which is more about the giants than it is about the Philadelphia Eagles\nBut ... the the cast of and the other reason you started\nYou could get one of those corn ball Disney asked ... feel good for a week or two stories where Kessler plays pretty well\nRight because it gives the arguments men Jacksonville their defense we keep hearing how wonderful their defenses integrated defenses and all they need is a game manager and they just have to have someone not turned the ball over to give them an opportunity to win again no Catholic did have an interception which was more about the wrist\nUber than it was about him but he did throw the interceptions on his resume in this particular game but the schedule is messed up you don't normally change quarterbacks going to London\nBut this is a unique set of circumstances it again if you keep looking at the Philadelphia secondary where you say hey maybe just maybe we can catch lightning in a bottle if were dug Malone\nIn Jacksonville now though the party shot on this\nPraise them quarterbacks in the NFL are extremely rare you're better chance of seeing the Loch ness monster as the second reference to Loch Ness monster on the show than you do of seeing a trade starting quarterback in the NFL but if ever there was a team that should flip a quarterback\nAnd and you know that John grew ... is crazy enough\nAnd just nuts so to consider a Derek car Blake board all swap of starting quarterbacks if Jacksonville tossed in a draft pick\nIt is something that at least have to consider if you're Jacksonville you ... you know you go out you make a move 'cause you can't go with Cody Kessler more than a couple of weeks\nAnd the trade deadlines coming up we're closing in on the straight line in the NFL it's always right around Halloween so if you're going to make a move the clock is ticking the doomsday clock is ticking on Jacksonville and the only plausible quarterback you can get\nNot that their cars great because he's not but he's better than you have who else is what what other decent quarterback would likely be traded at the deadline\nYou've I mainly socks\nAnd the giants they can't trade him 'cause the fans would revolt so they can't get rid of him who else does it get to be go through the list a crappy teams and that's who you look to who's going to trade their starting quarterback\nWho is it who is it going to be\nYou know the answers and there's no other than the raiders there's no way\nThere's no no we should point out to Tom Coughlin\nAny other Jacksonville executives but mainly Tom coughing I Do not believe that they were put into a straight jacket enforced just sign Blake borders to contract but they were clearly prisoners of the moment here\nAnd and they were they were seduced\nAnd smitten by the playoff run and they did not look at this objectively\nAnd I'm not talking about hindsight bias we said at the time we talked about what are they doing what are you thinking you're giving portals even though they went halfway but giving him a contract with pretty much all married to him they they've got to Blake ... tattoo on their ass at least for the next couple of years they can't get that tend to remove\nSo this was a very predictable pickle\nThat the jacks find themselves in the ... again my theory you go with Kessler you hope you find something with shutdown Cody for the next couple of weeks you're starting them against the Philadelphia Eagles you do that that's the first move\nYou assume that he doesn't vomit all over the field in London and that you put them out there in that game and you at least get the game manager that Blake portals cannot be and then you reevaluate the eat the Jacksonville jacks have there by week after the game in London\nAnd then you have Indianapolis at Indianapolis I say winnable game the ... they they stink so that's a winnable game there for Jacksonville ... and there were reports of fighting in the locker room and see to me that's embellish\nI point in the south before I don't have an issue with guys fighting with each other after games 'cause that shows they care and supposedly the locker room door swung open and reporters witness Calais is Campbell holding back\nAnother teammate and apparently the teammate through off the layers Campbell and they were going after each other in the locker room and they were at odds with each other and all that I don't have a problem\nIdle because it doesn't that doesn't matter to me doesn't matter of guys are fighting with each other a locker was long as they play well in the game and the issue of the issues portals and he\nHe thinks that the issue is terrible not only is he a quarterback heath sucks and that's the problem\nAre let's see if this year from Blake porous borders you've just been best are you going to Disney World or Disneyland where are you going like morals\nThat's obviously not what you want to hear ...\nA quarterback really the\nI could save you I Love to watch tried any of the same thing and maybe the guy that that when a plane handled it with the most\nI saw was that was when I tried to do\nSo let me ask Roberta Roberta what would you do if the raiders announced we've treated Derek car to Jacksonville\nFor Blake board old and a\nSecond round pick what would you do man I wouldn't be surprised you wouldn't be surprised wouldn't be surprised you're you're being ... them full tank mon you're in St ... all the um on line all Dodger Ben I'm forgot about football season or anything is that a World Series sure you have ... ... that\nWow you already got a World Series sure that's right [laughter] you didn't waste any time that's not that's not an old last\nYear she oh is that an earlier I didn't even know they have those out already yeah right here in Studio ... really oh yeah there's an official shirt place is packed yes it is\nI Would I Do is I buy the ones off the street and then what I did and you weren't here last year but the are there when I did coup last year I bought a couple of World Series shirts from uh for like ten bucks each\n[laughter] yes [laughter] yeah they were pretty good\nAnd I and unlike the rumors that those shirts you know you wash them a couple of times the now you should not by counterfeiters\nThat illegal you should not do that I buy those also but it's a great deal yeah it's a very good deal you just watch them inside out that's a good move yeah yeah about a couple and they're still they're holding up and they're not even going back so\nAnyway ah Ralph's here as well he's over there will take your calls eight seven
