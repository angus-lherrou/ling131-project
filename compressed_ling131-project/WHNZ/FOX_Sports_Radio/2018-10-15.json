[laughter] it or hold on let me just say this here's why this is a bad idea if you're ... nagging you're wearing advisor in Miami when by the way you could tell that defense was caster ... down the stretch the bears what to do part of that game at the end but\nThat's why the ... a a hundred percent I wasn't sure had nothing to do with ... this is ... Brock us why notes the month of October\nAnd I know you want to get into it but I we we will save that for later on here's why it's a bad idea for a matinee Aggie to wear a visor while doing a game ...\nEvery single time in LA I talk our back door right now yeah there's eight oh okay yeah yeah I I'm not too concerned about this and catch me in the act of doing\nOkay up now but here's the bigger point it both these games are going to end at the same time in Boston what's the bar scene gonna look like later on if they both when the red Sox in\nThe end of this though aren't they yeah I mean there's yeah he'll simultaneously there'll be there'll be excited there'll be people throwing up in the alleys or you know\nWho knows I mean they're not the type that like flip cars or start stuff on fire I mean that's that's one of like a college town right that's probably the Ames, Iowa after the upset West Virginia this week yeah there were protests out right they've got work tomorrow they're cognizant of that they've they've won a lot of championships I think they know how to handle them\nI don't know man I think this is like one of the last decent weather weekends for a long long time up in the northeast and I think it snowed in Denver yeah I I think they're going to take advantage of it I'm telling you man it's going to be a wild scene if you do go to a bar after one of these games take pictures and send it to us so I can prove Brady wrong right what what is your expectation like what are you\nExpect to see if you're walking down the Newbury Street even though it's kind of a nicer area [noise] um ... what would you expect to see people's stumbling out of the barge\nAll a ... a lot of guys um who got so hot because the booze makes you a makes you overheat and they took off their cardigans they're wearing ... top siders and they're walking down the street in a V. neck and the top of the neck\nCaught Porsche caught portions of their bar ... as they tried to throw up into the stall and uh and so they're walking around and they're cologne has been canceled out by bar\nBecause they had Fifteen Sam adams through a beer run on two minutes\n... what's your impression of Boston like everyone from good Will Hunting or like it's just like everyone goes to Harvard and their truck dressing preppy like\nWhat is known mixture you know like a little a little mixture it and very angry from time to time that's that's my impression the departed the departed if you will um All right so Brady couldn't Jonah stocks or Fox Sports radio we come into your life from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios are coming up next as promised\n... people are going to lie to you about an NFL game on Sunday do not let it happen Brady and I will tell you why the lives will be coming and

yes Steve in Maine\nTo say well you're correct on the on the last one thank you and by the way Jonas does think everybody walks around Boston saying your job [laughter]\nNot actually I've brought [laughter]\nThe red Sox by the way at Fenway of just at a three run double off the green wants to in left field and so it's a five for Boston lead over the Astros in the bottom of the third inning it's five for in this game I'm not sure these two are ending at the same time and the red Sox game started earlier David Price the starting pitcher for Boston\nIn his career post season starts yeah ray over six coming in but they scored five early runs warm in the red Sox down one oh in this ALCOA\nActually leading early against Garrett coal\nOnline car shopping can be confusing not anymore

S. over the next twenty four hours in sports talk radio and they're going to lie to you by saying\nThat the bears dolphins game was a great game [laughter]\nNo one was not [laughter]\nIt was a weird game it was one of the weirdest football games I've ever seen in my life but it was not great football game that was a couple of mediocre football teams and nobody can figure out whether or not they want to do when\nThat's how that uh that was exactly what I feel like boats fan bases deserved\n... can I explain myself and fleas do for all the Chicago Bears fans and and you may be included in this I'm watching the hot star and all of a sudden it was like no no the bears is this their year you know this is the second coming of eighty five bears with Dick or\nIt all the rest um there was some thoughts that that that may be what this team was\nI think those came to a screeching halt watching how just inept at times they're often was uh the ... some of the struggles that they had\nUm and and then for the dolphins fans you know they're kind of here's the thing that that are I struggle with with the dolphins fans there's some people and there's a there's a small select amount or die hard and they stick with them thicker than\nBut then there's the others who are just straight bandwagon and when they were three and they're like this is it this year we're going to have these were on top or number one right now ahead\nOf the New England patriots and and that was kind of their approach then after the last two weeks rather like same old dolphins team you know throw throw in the towel season's over with rice and they just have this like complete polarizing volatile relationship right\nSo this is what they deserve you deserve to watch that'd be drug through a terrible football game where honestly no one's deserved to win that game to search ended its high now you know I mean I'm Glad ... park he was able to uh was part was perky knows the other kid added another\nTo Sanders I don't know who care centers of ... I think will re think will cause actually let's just got why don't we just if we're going to get throwback to kick hers I'm Pete story on a bitch or who won the game for the little ... that is just some of that yeah that's one from deep inside of mentally\nAnd it's had rented in that and it's getting a cab and it's not often I go that deep\nNo no [laughter] so you're getting bruised up a little bit but ah [noise] that uh yeah that no one deserved to win that game that was to hum average football teams but it does make the question what did you see ... what I saw I loved it I loved every bit of a man\nWell he owns the bears three now yeah you just read it now but he's three ... three different teams like it's not like Aaron Rodgers owning the bears and he's always been with the Packers and he's a great quarterback\nRaucous while there's not a great quarterback and he goes to three different teams and he beat some every time and he was announced the starter like what at an hour before kickoff\nI mean I I think she had a pretty good idea of it when they started to ... when rights you know ... report late in the week I think they started to prepare us while at that point they just didn't let the media and all that\nUm it did seem like ... like he suffered a little bit of an ankle injury in that game and it seemed like it and you can speak to this because you live in South Florida playing football as a down linemen in that heat and it goes to over time how much the disadvantages that for you and you're not used to it\n[noise] yeah it's a pretty big disadvantage I think it's not so much the heat that gets you it's just the humidity um and and the only reason I can\nKind of see the difference is you know the humidity is what you feel you're suffocating like I always used to explain to people I I Love training in Florida the off season because when you go up somewhere I'm doors there's not as quiet as quite as high the humidity and and when you know you're in South Florida you're\nUm you know in one of those more human environments it feels like it's hard to breathe like you're breathing in stick out our house to describe it almost as if if you've ever been an altitude and you've got upstairs or um you know you you had to you know climate something and you're all of a sudden like extremely outta breath\nIt's it's kind of like that but you just you labor more to breathe in that environment so that's\nUsually the toughest part I but I actually kind of like the humidity because I always feel like it helped you um get warm and then stay warm yeah it wasn't as difficult to get your body warmed up to play 'em it's just you know you get exhausted man if you don't stay hydrated that's when you can end up getting you know those\nBecomes hard sometimes and those guys are up on the line of scrimmage and then you lose them amongst the mess in front of your face you know a lot of times I'm just throwing the spots where you really can't see your trust in your practice and all the things you went through during the week and trust in what you saw pre snap\nAnd in that case a once a ... dropped I think there was a bit of a of a mess kind of been from the pocket and he just through the ... was gone and never saw tower\nUm so this is now a touchdown for the New England patriots Sony Michel into the end zone and the patriots will capitalize on the turnover by Patrick homes but the homes last week was the worst game of the season and I had a couple of interceptions now he's got an early interception here\nI I I look I Know that we always we tell ourselves this you know don't jump the gun you know let everything play out don't hype everything up too much don't be such a knee jerk reactor kind of person on radio don't you\nBut we all did it we saw with the guy pulled off on Monday Night football a couple of weeks ago in Denver he was phenomenal was outstanding and it was really fun to watch I to me the patriots having this extra time to prepare\nWhen you talk to guys in and around the NFL or guys that are played for the patriots what is it the ballot check does with that extra time that other coaches don't seem to do\nI I don't know if there's anything that he does that that different I I just think his attention to detail and how it goes about preparing you for these different situations um and and really attacking\nYou know one of the things you have to respect about the New England that they do we can and week out is it's an entirely different game plan you know there's games with the run the ball fifty times there's the following week they'll throw the ball fifty times and it's all predicated on what they feel like your weaknesses are and how to exploit them\nSo to be flexible enough to do that and to be able to be um\nYou know kind of not run it put yourself in a box you know it's tough to do some times that people want to talk about an identity um your identity wants to ... wants to be a football team that's able to take advantage of wherever the weaknesses of your opponent you don't need necessarily just over a great running football team okay may become becomes predictable to stop right\nSo I think that's the thing that they do better than anyone else's every single week there's always going to be some new wrinkle you didn't see it or you weren't prepared for that you have to make in game adjustments for and then they're really good at doing that\nYou know it it's almost like a a fight you come out the first few rounds you're trying to kind of feel some things out based on what you saw before you went into a match\nAnd then all of a sudden the fourth fifth sixth around there there's something else has been thrown your way so that's kind of how their games typically go and they're just rents are every single drive every single series there's some little wrinkles some little adjustment\nYou know Brady when I think of the ah the Oakland Raiders [noise]\n\nI think of a I think of the autumn wind is a pirate [noise] I think of Savage host during ... from ... I think of ... an organization with a rebellious owners ... I think of\nPlayers up and down the roster that may or may not have been on performance enhancing drugs [laughter]\nI think of the violence and I think of full contact I think of broken bones I think of bruises I think of blood sweat [noise] the one thing I don't think of ... it's I don't think of tears\nAnd there's some images going around on social media and I know we're going to get into the John gluten aspect of the raiders and where this team is but there's some stuff going around on social media\nOf their car who appears to be crying after he goes down with the injury on Sunday so it begs the question Brady Quinn you being a quarterback who is played for many organizations and it's played pretty powerful playoff bound Notre Dame fighting Irish I might add you Brady Quinn have you ever cried during the game\nUm I don't know if I've ever cried during a game um I Do remember I played three a broken foot one time in high school that was really really painful um and that one was probably hard to kind of hold back some of those emotions are\nBut I don't think I've ever cried during a game no\nUm so what do you make of their car is he trying to have you seen the image have you seen the video going around it appears that he's an old guy might be it's like you know some guys handle stuff differently I'm not criticizing I'm just saying that's sounds like you're being critic I look I'm not criticizing it sounds like it'd be a bad luck right\nOr just have been critical right well we're going to make everybody cry when we come back next has that\n[noise]\nOkay Ben matter here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me you're just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates in great service rover Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their trained specialists twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy code dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nAt discover we believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to get new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget\nAt the end of your first year will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar no caps and no catches because we know you try us you'll like us and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match cash back match offer only for a new card members limitations apply\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nThey fail\nAlong and listen bought our first I ...

[laughter] and our ears I never I never worked\nWith that guy local radio here that that was it no that's true that is true I did see Steve that we had a nice to talk it was a good shot it was and I assume you you made it to a microphone so I assume you made it the LAX well after midnight an entire and all that\nI had early flight the next morning but I actually had to go with our crew back to their hotel and then over back because I was staying in a different spot with my wife the wife came out for the uh the trip so it was a good little this is going to get away\nAnd you want to know something I live down the street from the coliseum did I get a phone call from somebody [laughter] sorry about that yeah it was a look a lot of sense of one on one side I can literally staying on the corner of my block and see the ... yeah I don't think braid is going to go to your block anytime\n[laughter] Irish walk what's wrong [laughter]\nHey let me say hey let me say something that don't here's the thing\nYou can go to errands block he'll give you the a code to get into the gate don't worry about it I don't get like ... yeah you're ... you're going to drop my name you want to get in that place now that's going to get shot [laughter] the voice of Crenshaw man to live with her son with our water gun come on Aaron ahah [noise]\nLiving donors so I'm All right so ah so just knocks Brady quitting here on Fox Sports radio um\nSo we're talking about this uh John ... situation in Oakland um do you want to hear a little John Gurdon post game and yeah you want to hear some of some good stuff from John Gurdon post game so ... so we're dialing up a little John crude and post game\nI'm here on Fox Sports radio so we were able to get a hold of John Gurdon or we will have him make an appearance or on the show here's what I Want to say about ...\nI I think that we over hyped the raiders and I think that we over hyped the raiders similar to what we did with the browns because they had been so bad for so long that when they finally had that one pretty good year and made it to the playoffs we assume that this was a team that was back and they were on the right track but let's be honest\nIf you go back to that year a lot of things went there way they had a last place schedule there were a lot of flu the games I can remember the season opener at New Orleans a bunch of crazy place at the raiders one\nThere were a lot of things that bounce the way of the Oakland Raiders and it was nothing that you look at and go oh that's probably sustainable I Wonder if we overhyped Garrett car\nI Wonder if we overhyped I'm Ari Cooper I Wonder if we are over hyped everybody on that team outside of ... Mac\nAnd I think that we went into this season assuming that the Oakland Raiders last year was an anomaly they'll figure it all out and I think that we assume that this team was better than it was and maybe grew in is it wrong and walking in there and going\nYeah I don't like what I see here I've got a ten year contract give me some room to work and some time to work and I'm gonna try and turn the franchise around right or wrong I think that's what he looked at\nI ah I don't necessarily feel the same I I feel like this Ross who does a lot of talent and I think it it's been a combination of things um between coaching turnover changes scheme um I think that's been a product of it they had some injuries to I mean obviously the you're on the last day or a car kind of hurt 'em I'm either going in the playoffs I mean who knows how to finish his out\nHow he comes back the next year I mean you'd you'd never know um but I don't necessarily see at the same way I I think this is a good team I just think they've kind of been mismanaged missed handled in some ways to [noise]\nUm and and I don't think like the whole idea of them moving and knowing that that's the light at the end of that title is rapidly approaching and I think that's probably kind of weighing a on on you know their minds and everything else is that whole\nScenario kind of you know it's kind of goes right it's got to I don't I don't know how it goes and like I remember when I was up what part of the rams and twenty Thirteen\nI mean there's there's talk of the moving done and and the equipment guys talked about it they're like yeah I mean we do know is it seems there in LA the first time so\nYou know they're talking about the difficulties of that and just how expensive it is to be in Southern California and the stress that brings and not knowing a hundred percent at that point\nUm but just hearing rumors of it I mean it's ... the people out there are some players who you know you'd never look really pastor next opponent\nBut you can't help it because everyone else in your family worries about it so when they hear the rumors of oh is that seem to want to LA they're asking you they're constantly every single week I heard another him or her no story and so there bothering you with us you you can't help but\nUm you know internalize that stuff and and it does you know play a factor on you\nYeah I ... I mean and and I think a lot that maybe that sort of under ... understated and people have been brought that up enough but when you wake up every single day and there's constant uncertainty\nLike there's nothing more frustrating the waking up to a dirty house or waking up to a bunch of boxes laying around or a bunch of suitcases and it's just you're just starting off on the wrong foot you just start and I think the raiders for the past couple of years have just been kind of in this law in this in between like they don't even know where they're playing next year\nI think there is no stadium up yet in Vegas they're not sure where they're going to play you assume they're just gonna did sign another one year lease the plane Oakland but they don't even know what's happening next year and I do think that that isn't discussed enough like to me that would wear on me if you've ever watched the documentary and you know this growing up in Cleveland the year the browns\nWe're leaving in the mid nineties when they were going to Baltimore like they interviewed some of those players the browns we're a pretty good team ballot jak had them back and in contention and they were looking like a team that was on the rise when the decision was made for them to move\nMembers of that team and I think even Bella check included said we were finished we there was no coming back from that because the constant uncertainty\nOf weight so we're really gone uh this is really happening like when this isn't just a dream like I think that weighs on teams get weighed on MIke McCoy and the chargers when he was leaving a in San Diego I think it it does have an impact on some of these players in Oakland\nHundred percent and and look that team right that that seem that ended up leaving and finding the home of Baltimore\nBut the minute of winning as a super good team man I mean there was a great scene that Baltimore raven scene was a century the extension of what were the browns that's when people always ask me like oh you grew up in a browser that that's kinda miserable I'm not really the browns were actually a pretty darn good football fan eyes\nNow he's got a social media following\nYou don't know if it's a heat you know I I don't have no idea I've never seen him because he lived ...

been to okay well here's what I said let's think about this London London's were most drama goes to die or if it comes back a kind of gets lost somewhere over the Atlantic it really does like I I Know we're making a bunch of stuff off like group today\nBut that's that's that's a snowball effect that's been building up I don't usually it's it's almost like a black hole like you're kind of go there the game happens you come back and people forget about it okay but here's why I say that\nAnd I've never been to London but I've heard reports with the food is not very good that's that's false there's actually some good spots for okay good uh well uh uh but not the kind of ... so just to go to go along with the joke here and tell me that the food and London is bad the fruit and one that's not good okay\nNothing will set you off like a bad meal right so what's to say\nMaybe they have a uh some fish and chips\nAnd um and they realize that the fish and chips as a matter of fact is like a a rolled up dish rag\nAnd a and a like a pretzels that have been sitting out in a pub for three months\nAnd the guys are pissed off and Blake ... goes out there and he cops on up the defending Super Bowl champions\nAgain they should have one and the Jacksonville Jaguars looking at it as a statement game this is the super bowl that should've happened it should have been out there last year and and not a new the New England patriots and we lost because the Blake board was owned by the way we haven't had a good damned meal since we were in Jacksonville before he left on the trip I Would think that that is a possibility\nA a frustrated appetite and a frustrated defensive secondary and and front seven that gets after Blake bottles in London\nPotentially a ... a play along all play along and I'll say this okay\nOr even though jak vote goes to the London every year right it's got like a second home for the jaguars um maybe if they go over late you know 'cause I remember I Would have with the Denver Broncos back in ... ten\nAnd we went to late so we left Thursday we had ... and all that in the morning that we flew 'em later that afternoon and so we got in friday morning and then they actually had to stay up\nAnd go to a walk through a cricket field and kind of warm up and go through some things I got to tell you I've never been more tired of my life it was awful\nAh and then we probably thought our worst on game day I'm so if that scenario plays out\nThen yeah maybe some guys just cranky and they're exhausted hired they haven't had a good meal even though the store price of good food spots over there um but but it just got through with that and they're tired of it they just take all their frustration out I'm Blake\nI'm yeah so that is that so we will monitor that and we'll keep you posted I've you see any ah if anybody listening here's or sees anything about the defense calling out Blake mortals publicly uh let us know\nOr you can find us on Twitter I'm at the

I mean everyone always wants him to be a pocket passer but I mean if you're going to say well he didn't get over two hundred yards so I'm not that impressed me they and we we have the jaguars deep into the hall of fame\nAfter the first two weeks of the season we had we had him in the hall of fame after last year as well to in Dallas a team that I think what was the average but with me like twenty four twenty three points per game it was not pretty and they put forty on them I mean this was ... I mean it was thirty seven at one point in the ...\nI ... first of all that may be fake news I'm Still adding up the score you said forty I'm double checking on that I I find that very hard to believe I Know that is that is incredible did they put up so many points and as he didn't even get over a hundred yards those last carries so wasn't like he was tearing it up also\n[noise] All right we are monitoring this chiefs patriots game with three fifty to go in the fourth quarter New England is holding onto a thirty seven thirty three lead out to the one yard touchdown run\nBy Tom Brady there's three fifty left in the game did they just pick up that flag warning I Hope so yeah they were going I'm going to call catch interference\nAnd I think they pick the no thank you uh Iraq I was watching it back in the Geico Fox Sports radio studios bill that will check is absolutely losing his mind you hurry I'm ...\nI'm not getting every call in the book where he's talking about those other five minutes left we know when the when there's that little time we've got to go to a booth review and we've got to get a recall for the patriots you know that and I know that\nBig gain or right here to grow up you just absolutely ended some port St these courier who tried to attack on a better job tackling rock on that point so New England burst into Casey territory in one other note on that point party\nThat was the first one of the night in this case so far beyond me ... and doing All right let's I\nHave more teams to get to that I'm confused that you have to help us settle me on and we'll get your take on it as well to Twitter already blown up you get hit us up\nAt stinking genius one that's at SGI in K.

L.\nSports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball than there might be a few facts about the game you don't know\nWhy did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or is that a war basketball's bounce the cold one or the players to run as much as four miles during the game well here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nTo ... also helps people get used cars that's right to car isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simpler buying experience whether you buy newer use\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with two cars certified dealers\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout to car and enjoy more confident car by experience some features not available all states\nI'm Thomas the bigger\nI just couldn't stay in shape like I used to turns out was hit forty your body has less free testosterone and that could make it harder to get into shape so I got back into the game with new Gen x\nThe stronger with a lot more energy and drive you want to get back into shape region is all you have to do is send one simple ...\nFrancs right just text rules to four to four to four to get a complementary bottle of award winning new Gen x number one selling free testosterone booster GNC it's unique men boosting formula is powered by testifying a pat and the key ingredient clinically research to help them and feel stronger leaner more energetic and more passionate\nBy the way somebody said to some video of a ... going on that last touched on the tie it up and then giving the one single out one finger salute and because you do the one finger salute what do you think the patriots fans do in return they throw a liquid beverage out you are so I just wanted to go and throw that out there also\nOh I think the fans were flipping him off oh is that we are and I don't know is that somebody was throwing a liquid ...\nYeah yeah yeah and when he got a right to their there is a fan flipping involve right in his face and then they throw beer right in his ... in fact in fact I think I think I might ... might have found my third wife that's sitting right there given the middle finger in the [laughter]\nThere you go but in the end the patriots end up pulling it off forty three to forty alright listen I've got to get to another team is confusing me maybe we'll have to change stock stock down to are they good are they bad\nUh later on in the show but right now seem to say is in the house to help us recap that thrilling amazing Sunday Night Football in between the patriots and the chief what's going on Steve\nHello gentleman and what an evening for bone in Fort sports fans let's let's put it in this context first off\nYou at a baseball playoff game or David Price started and you one\nThat has never happened before [laughter] and he didn't he get the ... I don't know if you guys don't get that when we had when he's all for nine in the postseason he had had ten career post season starts the IRA over six but his teams had lost all ten and yell tonight\nThey scored enough early especially against scare coal and one seven to five and then about thirty miles or so south\nYou get to the game and Fox borough in New England gives up forty points and when I was looking up if we were going to have the highest scoring tied game ever because remember it's only a ten minute overtime now and the chief tied at forty all Leighton regulation but no still the highest scoring tie game ever\nWas the first ever overtime game for NFL regular season it was thirty five all Nineteen Seventy four Steelers Broncos oh of course seal the record but there have been plenty games where each team scored it was the kicker there really weren't around [laughter]\nYeah I did seven days of course it would be very I went out of my head very good no wonder they didn't weigh relatives guerillas are short field goal final play for a New England to win this one tonight even though for Kansas City\n... three touchdown catch is seven receptions a hundred and forty two yards including the the late Seventy five yard TD when he put on the after burners down the sidelines and it looked like the defenders were running in mud as he tied the game forty all the ... with the twenty eight yard field goal to win it\nSo in the end a New England victory and Kansas City suffers its first law they had been five in oh the rams now six and over in the NFC after a win at Denver today twenty three twenty\nNo snow on the field although that's only because shoveled it all off there was plenty of the day before the game twenty five degrees and the LA teams still goes in and when\nIn fact they lead Denver twenty to three late in the third quarter Todd girlie two hundred and eight yards rushing into touchdowns Dallas in Baltimore with victories Pittsburgh late TD pass to win at Cincinnati Miami in overtime over Chicago Houston and the chargers with victories\nOhio State is up to number two in the new college football pools behind number one Alabama NASCAR when for Eric out on the role of at Talladega has Kurt Busch ran out of gas on the final lap\n... only led one lap today the last one so he gets his first cut out\nFor years so he clutches a spot in the round of eight back to you\nThanks did we come to life and the guy could Fox Sports radio studios which begs the question what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well it means you probably should have gone the guy could calm Fifteen minutes ago that was insane tonight [noise]\nGood good good good night as Steve said oh he's not going to like this because both Boston area teams one you need a little bit of negativity right what\nWas that she was three and a half so I I feel good about that I always got to tackle informed\nBy the way the browns were really a favor today against the chargers to ... amazing so unbelievable with what happened in that game hey speaking of that we're getting into this week to week lead conversation and trying to figure out you know what what what's really the bleep going on in the NFL and trying to figure out who's good who's bad\nThe jaguars are still a team that I Can't figure out on the and I know it's funny I go back to about a year ago this time when when I brought up the jaguars to open the show and you openly called for me to be fired for even try to talk Jacksonville Jaguars football\nBut they start out to him they destroyed this New England ... forty three destroyed them then the last three or four\nIncluding a game to Tennessee somewhere and that makes no sense to uh to Sean our our resident Tennessee Homer and they've been scored in the last two weeks by Kansas City in Dallas Seventy six to Twenty one and I think I heard the stat tonight that it's like forty four to zip in the first half\nThat they've been out scored in these first two games yes they are in a sea championship contenders question mark but everyone is pilot I'm Brock Bob listen to me ... all one word October in my head thank you English line Blake ... you're not going to make a deal for the quarter back in the middle of the ... you're not and not coming off a champion\nNow with the money that you're paying him right and he hung up so you you're in a no win situation there's nothing you could do it took you to the AFC Championship game and uh he was rewarded what the year before that or was it after the after the seas\nAfter the season just as easily won his he ended up\nFor the for the contract so you know you're between a rock and a hard place you're you're not going to be able to get rid of him you're not going to be able to cut them you're not going to be able to trade them and you're not going to be able to bring in another quarter back to take his spot so are you gonna have to live and die with like ...\nI see some people do get ... that's going so well oh go get try to make a deal with Denver to get keen them and send them ... okay well whether contracts might be similar I mean\nCome on I mean I I don't really necessarily know if that's an upgrade right now it's just it's hard to make sense of a guy who looked as good Arnie as ... did an ad and went over New England to see how awful they suddenly become and the span of just the two weeks but again\nThey go out next week and they play the Texans and it's quite possible that they could end up feeding them thirty three to Fifteen or something crazy like that that this lady well and we actually know does it\nIn Jacksonville fans are yelling at the radio right now but we are a little bit of an injury problem we don't have a running back you may have heard of him you know let her for that he does ah is pretty good we you know ... ... could use them so I I I can see that going on in a little bit\nI understand that but I mean it's not forty\nAnd Seventeen since ... and and now they're talking rebuild we're not even two full years away from their car being and MVP candidate and the raiders on me up tick now\nLet's see well let's just just real quick they traded their pass rush star will Mac\nAnd he suddenly turned the bears into a contender well I mean again the bears up a good supporting cast defensively around him often simply ... but still I mean you get to first round picks that\nI mean I don't know what the way things are going through the bears is that he's going to be a top twenty pick up right now so you get it it gets what the raiders can't do on against what they can't do it offensively they can't rush the passer\nSo what do you do you trade your best to try to you know what else they can't do already they can't get a feel go on the porch\nYou know why they can't do that because they they they cut their kicker and they cut their punter before the season started the whole Marquette King thing obviously he got cut by Denver as well too but men whatever I don't have\nWe got an important question to ask you Chris ...\nWell I'm a dog but you can go well about the raiders we want to know in two years when they moved to Las Vegas are you going to be opting out\nAs as as well as as your favorite team because what a team moves from one city to the next that is that that that window of opportunity for you to bail out that team and join something else\nYeah no no no I I I realized I joked about it last week\nAnd as soon as it came out of my mouth I realize I Can't quit him I mean it's like a it's a really bad relationship right now they cheated on me they told me that they're going to quit cheating but\nYet you know all happen to check their Facebook profile like your grandmother she voted off I mean I just can't do it right now are some other guy stuff I I don't get this I don't understand what's going on\nI don't know how you can pay a guy a hundred million dollars you know honestly the money doesn't really matter to me to basically come in and try to take that next step was arguably a decent roster a decent Ross I'm not trying to tell you they were patriot level\nOr hell even ... what's he talking about the the raiders before John ... took over\nAnd now now he's basically anything that has been built he's picking this little pick act and he's just trying to put it down and they want to know who are too now huh no I mean he's off I mean you can have\nHim I thought they were they were they want to tread a couple of guys off the team it's so funny whenever Jake laser reported that today I kind of ... a little bit because I was like a treat those two guys keep clipping back\nGo back to Chicago and say here we want will Mac back because Cooper hasn't done anything consistently since he was drafted by the raiders might be their fault and coal Joseph for goodness sakes shorter than I Am so I don't know how he's going to end up being an NFL safety so it's really hard right now for everyone who wants to say\nWhat about the raiders what about this it sucks because you basically took a roster that was in position to compete\nAnd you just absolutely stripped it away their car's broke I don't know if he can be fixed I I was thinking to myself when I Wonder if maybe the jaguars would one car for a couple of first Graham picky maybe hours away for not being a starting quarterback anymore being about two and a bell to might be one game\nWell Mr two years ago it was going to be the MVP\nWell I wasn't alone on that one already Sedona silver and black lung back then everyone was\nBut here's the deal I'm convinced that the goal in Oakland right now\nIs to get their car hurt that's the only thing I'm doing good right now that's the only thing they're doing good right now there oh I just I Can't even get started with their first round pick their cornerback that everyone talks about in camp Gary on Carly\nOh wait till he gets going he's losing rats to Dominic Rogers ... yes the same due to couldn't remember all his kids' names\nHe's a writer now and he's playing more than the first round pick last year\nAlready what in the hell is going on how can you pay that much money for a coach only to have him come in and have every it's like the Bush winning all these back to the track and all of a sudden one of your buddies shows up and you start losing every but that's what John\nI Would say the judge and say to himself you know what one year Ted Miller I'll just take that will call I was joking about that with butter and the guy who does arrive at all but I don't think I'd go through died more years of as I I think if I get back please is if they show I could host or something\nIf he does not ... they're going up a hundred million dollars to hope I hope you're right All right uh\nSee that's why I don't want to talk about the issue people want to troll the way this is why it ruins the whole show each ruin my energy gets ruined my mo Jo now I have to rally boat I watch football when we come back it's already and play on a very busy Sunday that we've just scratched the

the only Steelers that have started a season like that on the ground Jerome medicine Franco Harris so are you going to pull him from the starting let\n... no not in this lifetime I ate that's for sure\nTo see how that works out anyway that's another Marvin Lewis lost to the rival Steelers so in his sixteen seasons the home record and this includes a couple of playoff losses at home to Pittsburgh the home record is two and sixteen Marshall Lewis again for the\nAdult fire him not to more than we thought\nThat there is kind of like the Charlie wise thing just come close and lose and you'll get an extension you'll become the richest man in coaching by not winning\nOver all the bangles head to head of last ten of their last eleven match ups against the Steelers meanwhile uh chargers chief you were talking about Kansas City\nThey may still when this west and they do get to play the chargers again later this year remember and they beat in the chargers head to head nine times in a row\nIncluding the opener this year when they ran wild course since that gained the chargers had one for the last five they won at Cleveland thirty eight fourteen today did you see the Baker Mayfield injury what the ... on the sidelines\nNFL please please take note of this speaker may\nNot on the uh thing that we're the Orioles you with\nYeah exactly may feel was sacked five times today so he was rushing to the side light on one play being chased and his first step out of bounds was not on the grass firmer footing instead it was on that already in orange thing that they do it next to the yard marker so if the\nChain crew goes flying they know where to reset the chains that it'd be like fly papers wages yeah something sticky something you said he slips on it and turns in ... limping feel\nMy idea I would've been something and make money\nNFL you cannot have equipment around the field that does this to players that's like an padded walls because of my bikes I'd be out of it or something my goodness anyway the Vikings Adams the little loving catches another hundred year game a TV and the Minnesota win over Arizona\nSo that's six straight hundred yard receiving games first player in the NFL since Nineteen sixty one to start a season with the streak that long\nBut the fact that he has almost sixty catches through six games to start if these and that has never

course a long time sports media member in Minnesota Larry Fitzgerald Owen six at Minnesota in career visits\nThere and why and he and empty catches the numbers are really low to\nEven here as well thirty nine yards receiving today which is kind of par for the course for a season and the cardinals fans but the cardinals has a franchise have not won in Minnesota in over forty years wow nuts in St Louis cardinals they've lost their last ten visits\nAnd you mentioned Miami what the overtime win so we can keep tacking onto this ah another game in overtime each of the first six weeks of the season that has never happened before\nI was watching that Brown's game and saw clips of them honoring future hall of fame tackled Joe Thomas they spelled out with a band on the field ten thousand three sixty three couldn't figure it out and they said that's the number of consecutive snaps he played all around us\nIn his career easy Cal Ripken junior though he was a entered into the clubs ring of

all the sex shut out at home for the first time since they moved to that place in Ninety nine ... it was not scored a touchdown there last eight straight quarters\nWhile offer to shut out for the first time since ... and Marcus Mary Yoda sacked eleven times in the game\nHe was ten or Fifteen passing had fewer completion then he was sacked or ravens [laughter] I don't know if that's\nEver

station [noise]\nHi heart radio takes you back to the top five October ... are we start teaching happy he will be on [noise]\nIt's helpful\nBought our first ... AOL [noise] downloaded [noise]\nJacksonville at home Dallas at home than at New Orleans that's their next four weeks for Philadelphia ... three three\nYeah it's a tough one there's no doubt about that they're not lived up to expectations Carson when's is done good job and he's put you know a a start up on the board there but unfortunately it hasn't really shown in points I think what else is going to be okay because that and it's used as a not a good division\nAnd they'll still have enough to win that because they'll get by Washington in Dallas and\nThe giants are already eliminated full of ... is only going to continue to get better their defense if they come along and get stronger or they'll make a run through the playoffs even\nAnd it's kind of funny because you I I wanted to sit here and debate you on on air on Washington but the Washington Redskins are essentially an Alex Smith quarterback team I mean I\nI Know hey thanks that's starting quarterback but no look at the history\nSince he's made that step forward under Jim horrible this is what I'm Alex Smith quarterback team does they win some games that blow your mind they beat some teams that maybe they're not supposed to and then they'll go out and get destroyed by teams they have maybe no business either getting destroyed by are losing too so\nWashington to me or any as a real hard team to figure out where they are are they going to be there in the ... are they going to be a product of a bad division or could they end up\nPutting a nice little run together I mean the schedules favorable for them in the next four or five weeks Dallas at home at\nThe giants which is kind of that give me on the schedule right home for the falcons they can win in a shootout if necessary to go to Tampa two teams\nThat do play a lot of the fence and then their home for the Texans so that's not a bad little five games stretch for them\nI Know that are favorable five games stretch I think what you'll see what the Redskins is what you saw the last couple of weeks you know they'll get blown up a like a New Orleans right that's who they played\nA couple of weeks ago and I did not or they step up and have a ... a very big when like they did today it's a week to week thing with the Redskins one day they could look so fantastic and the other day and they'll get clobbered by like I said the same so I think that boy consistency and that's what you see that's why I think what else is going to win that division couple of quick\nTweets on what we're actually getting into here you can hit us up on Twitter at Fox Sports radio is the best way to do with the easiest or you can go to our uh our individual performance acts if you will have plans for that to me and he's at stinking genius one that's where Eric hits us up and says good stat on Carolina from Brady Quinn earlier they had the most back to back road games in the division\nIt's it is interesting status as it is hard to win back to back road\nGames like basketball games could you possibly have other than maybe two and what to so that'd be four games in a row right nobody's going to have three which would be six um\nThey are looking at Caroline and let's see her going to do I see they go back to back to the boxing the browns in early December they went back to back with the Steelers and the lions in early November or so yeah they have it happen twice\nOn unlike the waiter yes he was a lot of like the patriots play every game at home um do you do if you're not doing enough they play every game at all and they do\nEvery single time everything our national TV they seem to be on TV and then Edie hits us up and says prediction CJ ... and the stinking niners all take down the Packers on Monday Night football that's the pattern of the NFL this

Arnie\nOlive oil on by by the end of the first that's how much is going to be a blow out\nI I Want to get into the AFC but I Want to make sure we have plenty of time to do it so let's hit a few tweets before we hit up the AFC and who's real and who speak and who were buying and who were selling let me see uh where would we want to start in the magic\nOf the world of Twitter though I I Will say already I kinda disagree with you I think I think San Francisco's gonna gonna keep this game tight and I don't know what's wrong with me and he was asked why they're starting writes TJ the dolphins are back it's\nTime for everyone to get on board and ride Brock Tobar and the express the playoffs in the super bowl ... taken offense to the promised land book and book it right ...\nWife said Ryan

I I'm not going to argue with you what does it mean when the guy says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance well it means you probably should have gone to a guy who dot com Fifteen minutes ago uh my mind just got blown during the break oh I don't I I I Am blown away I got this uh well I we\nGot this tweet a tweet from Brett who writes tell me how New England doesn't have those nearly somebody had a dump sorry tell me how New England does it have a single entity a penalty against Kansas City yeah thanks wraps I I didn't realize that yeah oh I didn't I said something\nAbout it as a matter of fact I said yeah the they're good at Tom Brady show him because I like those are ... don't you understand we don't get penalties called on us in the last five minutes of the game\nWhen you said that it didn't register that they had not had one called against them how does that happen in an NFL game penalties for fifty eight yards he gets to Kansas City zero zero against\nNew England they play the perfect game what can you say ... has got the ... the perfect game\nI have never in my life seeing that in in an NFL game I mean I Know what's happened I'm sure\nStats an info is on it I'm sure all of our gurus or look at it up\nBut Arnie how in the world in in today's modern NFL where you breathe on a quarterback it's just foul you push a receiver it's a penalty I mean seriously you win an entire game four quarters without one now even if you ask\nHow do you square forty three points and not get one procedure called about that [noise]\nUnbelievable I mean ... just wow All right great I've got a bite of the conspiracy\nThat that's why I Need to be an NFL rap I'm going to have to leave the show and become an NFL rough\nNow and then there's this from Louis Riddick who tweeted moments you go\nAnd said I'm so disgusted by the defense is in the league right now I Can't stand it and I know on a you're a big believer in that we're sending the rules up to where it makes it impossible to play defense but I think it goes deep deep or to\nThese guys don't practice I mean they they don't practice anymore they don't have to give their NFL guys but\nFrom the high school ranks to the college drinks now and now even into the NFL it's very rare that you actually have a physical practice that you will to the ground so how can we expect defense is to be added an elite level when we don't work on it we we as a place to protect them\nWas not through last year in the year before in the year before but yet the fences warn is soft as they are this year\n[noise] ah well I mean I don't know I saw that\nWith changes also it's like the perfect storm um we've made it perfect we made it easier frog fences we've made it harder for defenses and you can't touch the quarterback even more now so there's more penalties being called in that situation and that's why there's more scoring\nI don't I I don't know if I agree with you I Would love to see the stats on that I mean I obviously we only have twenty four minutes left we got to get to been Mauer for some comedy before we get out\nBut I don't know if I agree with that already because I I think this has more to do with what has been a a a slow burn towards it I don't think these new wrapping the pastor penalties have suddenly signaled this up shoot off its if I could\nBe wrong yeah but I mean the numbers look how many teams are throwing for over like three hundred yards the game or putting over thirty points a game it's like double the water was last year\nI Know I Know but I just again there's\nA lot of rookie quarterback for four or five rookie quarterback none are playing out there which means that shouldn't be that high\nAnd were riding away one week they look incredible one week they look awful one was able to record All right Ryan this week uh what seemed Arnold one the other three lose Josh our last Baker Mayfield last Rosen last so yeah\nYou know house called him Sam Rosen but I mean you you get it it's going to be a roller coaster what these guys every single week got a couple of tweets before we get out of here and before we get to what everyone came here for tonight which was ...\nGot my ... got six of them three college uh three\nFor for a team which happened to bill bell check afterwards I'm sure found something\nThat can really delicious fields not too good teams and they can see both competed very arcane down to play the game there's a lot of the football players out there and ...\nThat's when he was at all I heard that at the beginning of the show is that while the game was still going I Know you had a dog is it gets so much inside that's why oh and then uh then my new favorite soundbite on the planet Patrick ... homes afterwards\nYou want to compete against and every single day and we got down put herself in a huge hole and I I'm just proud of my team and how we fought to get back in the game and we had to lead at one point and we ended up not coming out with the wind but just that fight or something you can carry on and to the rest of the season\nI Love that do wish that I was up in Minnesota and the Mets are just yeah Minnesota and the Mets right\nYeah he's got a pretty good background and in fact patrimony homes probably could have been a guy in the ... will be if you wanted to but chose to focus on football his last couple of years so there you have a crazy sending that football game crazy day in the NFL I don't know if we solved anything or figured anything out except to say\nIt's a week to week week man and next week we'll sit here and I wonder how the hell blank happen so that in mind it's time for armies picks it's what you all came here for any way so stinking genius take it away\nFluids get right at it we saw with her too\nOr at home getting let's start with her do that's where we're starting tonight Purdue with a boiler makers were the Ohio State and they're getting Thirteen\nAnd a half now whilst they didn't look that great against Minnesota matter of fact I thought Minnesota just a phenomenal job defensively on unfortunate they couldn't score and the second it up\nWell they still kept the game coast or you don't produce team struggled enough then struggled there are a couple of tough breaks in the first three games and they started up owing three barely losing in each of the games but they picked it up in one the last three granted ones to Nebraska in Illinois\nAll that being said I think they keep us what cos I may go for the upset I think the game\nWhat the third you know that\nGame number two [noise] he the youth\nAnd Oklahoma you may have heard of them like you I write I'm very familiar yeah\nLook I'm not going to sit here and blow smoke it tell you how great you see you okay [noise] plus three of their lives for and their office doesn't even resemble they're off in years past they might know K gave me gets Ohio State [noise]\nWell Homa [noise]\nMan I'm telling you the way they went ahead and look against taxes and the deep end [noise]\nAbsolutely horrible I'm Wondering if you can capitalize on that [noise]\nI get too many points and missed one give me TCU\nPlus the seven and ... what's the word on the Alabama Tennessee game\nI have not seen it I think it's up in the air right now because if two is injury right there have been thrown anything out yet\nOr if to replace 'em all over Alabama lay in about twenty four twenty five against Tennessee a matter of fact even if he does a ... jail on hurts and get the ah inflated wind down a little bit let\nMe ask you this ... the real quick how did how much of a difference do you think to a mix is it six points [noise]\nIt may be that much and Eighteen to twenty four that's big time it\nMay be something like that so I'm going to take Alabama overtime to sleep in the NFL I'm all over the bears plus student advocates doing little as a let down after when today [noise] gimme Washington at home I Do is get the cowboys\nAnd I'm back on the Kansas City bandwagon only six at home and get the Cincinnati Bengals so very of my next to them as we remember the strictly press the payment from his um [noise]\nI got to admit I'm a little disappointed you didn't go after him Adrian ... spoiled gas\nWhy well I mean I'd still pick of the Dodgers and the red Sox to go to the world series that was my ... okay so you're sticking with that and I'll tell you that I feel good about that right now\nI I guess maybe I I\nI've not given to a enough credit so far maybe maybe I'm not in that position where I've given him enough credit to think that it could be a six point difference I like what Tennessee has done but I'm with you already I think Alabama is hands down\nNo question the best thing we've seen this year I Begin is coming up next already have a great week buddy buddy you to think it takes the Iraq thanks to both both great job tonight on the wheels of steel and is a perceived as sacred

in the the defenders faith\nAnd then maybe not a touchdown and now all of a sudden is that the sixteen yard line Kay peanuts rap so he can't score the ball if he gets within the red zone and like all of this study and\nI don't know I like the coaches ... anytime the Broncos play like hurry up off the rams are on the heels and they were able to move the ball down the field I don't know why they didn't do that the whole game on and it's just it's awful\nTo try to get people to watch the NFL they they a lot in one hour of airtime\nWhich one I point out was smart because somebody at the BBC

people of England that they would\nOnly point one hour on\nIn because that's really at that point it's like smart at that at that point for the people in in the u._k. there to have to watch that

were caught\nPeeking ahead hey we're caught look in a\nToast to the NFL anointed the new team and the NFC the Chicago Bears\nAnd you don't get up for the dolphins you get up to go to Miami to have a good time in Miami but you don't get up for the Chicago Bears and over the dolphins rather and the best looking at they have a matchup week seven it's one of the marquee match ups in the NFL this coming weekend bears patriots\nThat's a big effort in game in the NFL schedule it's a much bigger game it's again it's going to have ramifications can be a ... a featured highlight gain now it's not a prime time game but it's in in Chicago it's a big spot\nFor the bears to see how they match you up with the New England patriots who are suddenly found themselves again after being in Kansas City in the Sunday Sunday game\nBut the lack of focus was embarrassing for Chicago in Miami and end up losing overtime thirty one the twenty eighth the coach of the bears Matt Maggie Maggie Maggie is the coach of the bears who needed to take a nap after this game\nThat's exhausting you know it's tiring we are not time but it's it's mentally draining for the guys 'cause they try so hard and uh but someone's gotta win someone's gotta lose unless you have a tie and so for the guys you know they're so hard for coaches are are are players everyone everyone or you know pretty much gave everything that\nThey had [laughter] I saw the coaches bears just admitted they're not good enough to beat the backup quarterback of the Gulf that's that's great football and now it's just the planet again look listen to navigate explained the possible outcomes of an NFL game\nThat's exhausting you know it's it's tiring we are not time but it's it's mentally draining for the guys 'cause they try so hard and uh but someone got her when someone's gotta lose unless you have a tie you know after the guys you know they they fall hard are coaches are are are players everyone everyone or you know pretty much gave everything that they had\nAn art Adam gays is the coach of the dolphins but maybe not for long maybe not for long you know who knows this is a temp job the the way the dolphins have been inconsistent\nI Would say that if things don't turn around and they they make the playoffs and make some noise that Adam gaze will be gonzo as coach of the dolphins but he's the coach now and he is waxing poetic celebrating his backup quarterback\nPlus wise here he knows the system in and out you know he knows how to operate on history mentioned the huddle he does things or the right way the right way way [noise] you know every week he'd be treated as or he's gonna have to go in the game that puts him in a great position when there's something like this has happened in San ... session for [laughter]\nOkay who the players on your team that don't do things the right way\nIt's grim as long as that five hundred yards [laughter] against the bears defense which is supposed to be a top five\nDifferent\nYeah not not in this you might one more from Adam gays here who is going deep into the bag of cliches\nMaybe plays when we needed him to\nKnow they're done with good in a couple of those ways to point conversion was we never thrown that fall to that guy factory job it blew up the whole whole play and then ... stayed on the move\nOr do we have the summer Adam gays got the one I Need is he got very upset with the media because they kept asking about Ryan tannahill status and and he was he was howdy and snappy like he was he was troubled the dolphin coach because\nThe media in Miami is that when we went standing are going to come back he he was a late scratching the game and engaged or he did not want to talk about this and he got very upset listen\nOr some kind of like ... or something like that\nWere supposed to be for one you know the three into the Miami Dolphins are foreign to wow\nTremendous football commentary you might be replacing Aikman at Fox if you keep this up\nNow I'm I'm not that I'm so tired I just can't you know my energy going\nAnd held in when you're burning the midnight oh here it's very early in the morning should ask\nLeader and burning but the
