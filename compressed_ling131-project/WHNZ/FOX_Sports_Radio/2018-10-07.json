that's exactly what the day was brought it to do what he was a very good job in that regard warhead\nAt trying to come forward but this Taylor who cannot control it\nRocket will get it now to Jordan Jordan trying to set it poured will get it Jordan will move it forward himself\nTrying to go it looks like around colon he manages to get it up near midfield [noise]\nAs Jorge rare to see I'm fine

Would imagine so just inside the Eighteen yet I'm going to go directly to the tangles up Jordan [noise] legs a little bit clique goes up on his left shin\nSo that's a dangerous opportunity that it's just been presented to Charlotte now these are certainly can have a lot of guys on the wall [noise]\nOr they're going to back up and it looks like about sixteen so what college twenty six Herrera will be on it you generally the guy that take free kick the referees guardian trying to line everybody up\nHappens here Herrera up take that blocked\nBoy Cole got in a way and that was the bullets\nThat certainly was there I don't know they always try to go through somebody 'cause that was very very low trajectory on that attempted free kick that shot towards the net [noise]\nRight directly down in front of us here in our era will get another chance that looks like he's going to come over to take this she'll be an upswing or by him\nAnd he got a lot of free kick opportunities against a NFC in their match this past Wednesday so he's pretty fresh in the department [noise]\nEight years old Jorge Herrera that's well that's almost\nAll the way back out again that kind of like ...\nAnd trying to

exactly was it for him\nNow it's called taking one for the team I think we had all that\nVery accurately stay in a gym that's a tough place to be in the wall when someone's fire now she's back the other way at times now and what you see the there's a violent collected about\nAnd he's not real happy with that he thought it might have gone the other way [noise]\nThought to be a free kick for the Charlotte any pet it's a long way from goal here are the only about ten in front of the half one\nFor the game is really started to slow down because of the cows the Tampa Bay has been charged with [noise]\nSaucer\nWith it now drops it back off on the right side forgive our foster back a little further with it and you're trying to get it for here is Jordan Jordan calming trying to pass it in the

yeah but it was a captain on that in fact one of the center of doing a nice job just struggling\nTo pass the Senate get the other way boy now we're coming down the other way on the watch enjoy\nWay playing the game boy he just white out later\nWhat he saw where the ball was going and he eats where on white it right in there so it wasn't too much distance between the two so when you make your body bigger when you cut off that shot in the direction you have a much better chance to hire ... that you said in Vegas the shopping mall involved down the right\nSide Leon Taylor got it got me through it's going body trying to go through on the part that is who he then again why he crosses then he's going to draw the corner get coming up actually home stores corner kick number two in here in the match for the ... and it will come in the ... minute\nWell that was an excellent chance by Tampa Bay [noise]\nThought they may have had a little bit of real estate going toward running towards that are left for Joe cold but he decided to go to the right does it does draw the corner opportunity\nAnd sell Fernandez won't go over to take it now in the twenty thirty minutes about half way home here in half\nFernandez foreigners get around to try to get on the\nBoard\nThe top let's see what the caller is\nThe head her was by hundreds of course they're going to call another corner kick number

have fresh bodies out there have you with Rosemarie comes in we will see here hopefully momentarily but\nNow it's not a good sign for the ... when\nReally good holding the builders is one thing around\nSlipping off a zero now he did this a moment ago and then came back\nGave it a shot but it looked like ... ... is in fact going to replace them so they're riding filmmaker first substitution again a little bit early but that's just the way it happens when you when you have injuries like that and we saw roads me play a lot earlier this year prior to his knee injury and he could itself pretty well\nHe's also he was also a former captain with you I don't know if you're if she last year so he's the guy was experiencing can really point\nHeavy another leader alongside Joe pole so those guys can do a nice job together communicating and he doesn't have the ability you know there's a good job in that moment\nAlready in the season so we're supposed to be on the attack as well\nAny additives Gore skiing or she got it back to them under some pressure\nMorehead will happen now and he will come forward in thirty minutes\nDay in the middle and forward it will come for ... and the

of light back into this franchise bring back around the same as we see if they attack\nAlmost coming down there is something you got it out to Washington and walk them will get it back up in the field the visor and now they'll come forward\nWith the words I mean it's got an amazing job ... really put a lot of voters don't notice it as long as it's own power\nAnd influence into this club to really try and bring Dr back into the bay area of course rallies and I kind of\nGone they probably would have not been around here at all but had been\nFor you're absolutely right it you know so this

will join us for what he's all\nSure well and and it's part of the agreement which is even better if we see them all around the field\nFor the heart of the agreement the rallies will be playing\nThe stadium for the next five years sharing seat is part of the dream that that's great for all the fans who are here tonight\nI Know this season has not been what we'd hoped it would be but towards you really couldn't look\nBetter yeah I mean you know you have the same when the paper they're raised well obviously do a lot you know what they do in St Pete so you have the familiarity with the owners that do the area very well and what attracts fans of the season for one of the big things is really trying to prevent ... press conference earlier this week and what we've seen her she\nReally wants to sell this place out your every single day well he's got to be happy tonight CNN [noise] yeah it's a very big crowd obviously tonight with so much on the line this last time\nThe ... fans are going

old is right\nCorner kick flag well do you want to do with it then the metal that spies are again he got one earlier back it comes out maybe there are these can run on\nHere it looks like the veterans who have that going to try to get it down certainly on sale or Taylor is going to get a clear shot\nWith a left handed a back down to ... or ... yeah so you know there's not a lot of both of our time to waste potato van and then it goes fast now\nWe're in a thirty eight minute here in the first half to early ... Charlotte Independence\nTime but it it's been a year of missed opportunities for the rowdy we've had we've seen so many games where they have to kind of dominated play and [noise]\nHonest I Can't say that so far tonight this is Beverley Charlotte is played\nVery well yeah they certainly have a couple of bounce the gods Charlotte's way but yeah they have certainly they haven't been side of the challenge I mean they've really come out very aggressive\nWhen Saudi will cross it or is no one there and it's going to be heading up the far side and it's going to be one over there by tack to\nHave to like to run with it like we make anybody will drop it straight back more ski will pick it up towards the box it's going to be headed back out that was by Jordan and our do come back down and Fort Leo Fernandez rally San Fernando ... drama straight behind it more and more and\nAt back behind the ... day\nHundred ... on that right side again you can see how that three man back line of work for the route eases more at all around the blimp up near midfielder\nLooking for Leo Ferdinand is great passed right over left us mind feels got that good left dropped off into the middle\nGood possession now is to get around it can turn it into a goal of trying to come forward and it's going to be one back by Charlotte not this diamond allocate our satellites hold on we're going to try to surround him\nOver there is that going back it comes from Irvine [noise]\n[noise] and he got a ... fold here on around here or\nThere are aligning joke Cole who by the way it is under suspension morning and we have seen this before Joe can't get a card or you will definitely not play next Sunday at that point [noise]\nSo it will be a free kick coming up here [noise]\nWas just really turned up the

whichever where they try to score where they're trying to run done\nBoth in some cases if nothing else you know try and build or just keep away at play keep away from Tampa Bay but I think you have to really admire Charlotte and there's this game when David this year tonight they this is not what I least I haven't seen that this way really engage on the defensive it really can bid on that side to really disrupt Tampa Bay they wrote an excellent job in that regard [noise]\nThey got nailed belong on down to the left side but it's got to be looked down on that far side and it will be another goal

[noise] that is big points right there for folks want [noise]\n... well with Nashville hit New York both on the outside looking in answering tonight because these are the critical\nWe see it looked like a hundred ... is up walking\nSlowly you know you'll have to come out but it also looks like Mr get very good heart is not up yet now he's going to slowly making its way of\nCourse he's actually walking back and I think he's going to\nSay hey no hard feelings but come on let's just walk over so we have currently\nWell again we're in the Seventy six minutes\n... goes over to check on get hard to see how he is the first and foremost for health\nOf course he's still sort of bending over in self here and they want to try to get going here but again they\nWhat they can't do right now though is some reality to use their three Charlotte I Believe is have you just have one left but I think in a row\nSo they're all these back they're going to call a water break here and I guess with the temperatures like they've been here we can certainly expect to see that there are going to go over to talk\nTo head coach meal Collins that it looks like horse is just going to go stand on the sidelines down on our side and that's where he hopes to be able to be let back in and it was hard to say why they're both standing there and\nNone of the worst for where I suppose but I'm not sure I can say that because I'm not in their shoes they both are pretty\nMore violent hits we've seen in the stadium to see a gym or the other side [noise] maybe the last time your college I'm looking at them you really really raising his boil it made it very animated and this maybe the last real chance to get the thought is one\nPlayoff folks on the line they're going to have to come away with goals very very bad for them\nSee that third sub Caleb caliber looking forward to getting ready to check in here now [noise]\n[noise] and we'll see whether it's getting harder\nWould point\nAn outstanding and getting water themselves so\nHeart looks to be okay and that's\nDon't see anybody walking off those substitutions look like they're not they're not let them in your hand no I don't think they know they have not like you are playing a little bit\nSo Sam binds going to put it in play but went back and he'll send it all the way down to that will get hundred Gore ski and get heart back in ... players in return trying to clear it back up but it comes right to give our teams like the ball find when you first got back in for being injured but the rallies will get it thrown Allen morale is going to leave it for Gore\nWill get it and looked like he wants to go down there right side will be on Taylor trying to get on getting morale get there again any quick but there is the ball and watching clearing it back up we're\nGoing to try to head it down can't quite get erotic will get it with taxes again moved into the middle of putting that outside right spot\nYou're going to drop it back [noise]\nThe reality is going to send it all the way back to Daniel Baker who put it on his big left incentive for over\nAnd she almost got it through like play by the little duck it keep it from going in the rowdy direction\nWith and to keep in mind ... what kind of back a little bit it'll be up to the top but he's got a position to the middle\nShot taken wide or Google and it was my taxes will be a goal kick coming up here for brand another wearing a Seventy nine minute rallies still down there to buy those two goals they scored in the first down [noise]\nAnd so rather Miller will put it back in play here now for the Charlotte Independence [noise]\nSo the key thing got a yellow card well I didn't see any yellow card fly up here but\nRallies continuing down down the left side Leon ... going to try to run on he does that is pretty good at it\nExcellent job trying to work\nSons taking a page out of Charlotte's Taylor celebrate it but he can't waste too much time with\nIt was shot that with an excellent crossed over\nA nice pet bike when Johnny to get it over to tailor the week that\nAnd Taylor with us just really spreading is just dumping like Superman and that was a Superman Bowman and it's two one Charlotte ... not done\nWell you're in Charlotte looking for an upside down an apple I didn't get it Leon Taylor get this core goal of the year and with ten\nWe have ourselves the game we said do nothing scary bleeding soccer now Charlotte's gonna have to play in both means abuse their allotment of sub what we see is what we get we see Caleb Calvert coming in and I would think that if my jeopardy headed to do over again he went to put forward in\nNow they really have to watch themselves this is this is what a nightmare to creep into their heads once you get from Charlotte\nVery hard and just could not keep it down but a great crossed there like\nA speeding bullet young ... me he had a shot at\nUses the right near\nEach year had a shot at it we get a chance to watch it on the monitor their if he just able to hit it straight down he scored\nAnd why do\nI like Taylor and that does that exact location where Taylor was and they were actually used to head to get back all\nLook like it's just so many ain't going to let it was his head but wow what a moment and yellow car getting dished out the Miller [noise]\nHe was eighty second minute now\nHad subs we have had injuries [noise] wherever I Would\nThink that even though we've only had eight minutes of regulation play I Would think we're looking at at least five or\nFive at least I Would say so in other sure think Miller probably\nIt remains in I Believe we're going to have\nGo work at it now but then he did not miss by much at\nLike [noise]\nOff the air is Brandon Miller who get up above the ground and make the play\nAnd he can't time white because he's already got a yellow\nCar it you cannot brown will take a look look\nAround at an excellent job getting free [noise]\nAnd just missed it over the crossroads on Hi Ian de\nOpportunity cheered whichever you look at this and you just have to wonder if we got a couple of guys down ... down and he's been hurt earlier in the game we saw we\nAlso see Charlotte player down and\nKeep talking to the referee Mr guardian say in what in the world is going on but you know as as it was gonna say we'll watch more right here to get up at ...\nGot to say I mean you know otherwise they would\nTell you that you can't you can't be done at this point have you with all my bills paying as he came in here on the challenges he always was by certainly take tangled up I looked like Jordan\nPerhaps I don't Georgia Works in the right side it looks like the collider knees ... really hampering on that right there and he is not in good shape and home\nFlipped off to the side here so they can play with him and\nTo wait till they figure out whether or not he can still go it's a nice on that\nTo one and it was Pfizer was the guy was heard\nHe's a he's holding you why do you see Joe coal over there he's directing\nEven though he's wearing a bit but let's see Pfizer\nHis up walking around other going to give them a card they are I think that given find her record it looks like [noise]\nOn ... and again we'll see he's ready to come back we can see the ending of that half wine there on the far side of the field could have\nBeen that or it could have been hit delaying the throwing\nPerhaps him because he was going to throw it in and he just gave it up\nHere come around again now let's see if they can get this equalizer\nPast down just over the abstract like\nAnd Miller Chavez was wandering around right on the end of that\nBig cross ... wants to be kept running he kind of turned around to see what the goal was to be kept running you would have been\nBack up the bill goes to his right seems like he's been doing that a lot [noise] all it's like John Barr side and we got to throw coming up and it's going to be the guy came around and go to get a\nRenaissance of really favor no Tampa Bay the Fifteen at this moment in time to Charlotte so it's really shifted the second half\nI was going to say a few minutes ago she was like the last ten minutes to places just come alive the Riley's on the field has\nIt's just an amazing atmosphere no matter what the turnout is a real big show here for this crowd it [noise] it's something hopefully they see the\nCity or ... or all I Would love to see this again\nThat is self with how far away but we were there to see it again I think it's Leon Taylor\nOh it's shot as maybe rarely off so I think\nHe was leaning in that direction just leaning across that back\nIn a great great camera work here by the other video production screw the does the TV here how now just second ... well yeah there's not much time left nail it comes down inside the ... going to get a ... or if you're going to drop it back the tax ... cents to forward as quickly as you can tailor just had this back though\nAway by example if you read it well mine's up for ...\nAn effort battling for he's got it got to go\nOver there and it's getting a little physical and we got a salad and no we don't we got the final score wow the game is over\nRowdy are going to come up short and\nThey're gonna have to keep some of the rallies away from the officiating crew here [noise]\nAs the gang sort of ended in a hodgepodge and around these are really really upset rally that that gold didn't go now again we had a\nLike Taylor's right shoulder\nLeaning a little bit\nYeah there are job is rather job is yeah it looked like he was just leaning off and that's all it takes some times and the official in a good position right there can't really argue that call that it's just one another which I think too many times the season Jim heartbreaking moments like that one where just cost him a a goal and just the game\nI think somebody else got a card in the aftermath I'm not sure and I might have been big or maybe a bagel with just throwing up at ... or something I couldn't tell but Vega is still though there is no right or wrong Vegas Vegas is out there has been ejected which means he cannot play next Sunday\nIn ... at that point in Pennsylvania it gets back when the ... now they got a whole big back wants to go after the official now that's not a good idea\nNot recognize what's going on but my goodness I mean I just pouring outpouring of frustration knowing how much this game that the Tampa Bay [noise]\nRealization that there are folks are virtually all dash and all but dashed\nProbably

all you can say well I mean the thing that's interesting to me is that in\nWhat twelve minutes they just came a lot and I would say the prior Seventy eight\nPushed Charlotte to the break\nA lot of people are going to complain about the gold that didn't count\nWe had a pretty good look at it pretty of let it go maybe but it looked like really onto his right shoulder was leaning and again when it leans are Chavez rather and when it leans it's all you can do all you can do so yeah well it really ...\nYeah really talking to the gym and it's just too many times the heartbreaking moments I think really defined the season just a microcosm of the season that\nYour call back goal and things of that is you know post ... we own tailor hitting the ... you know just little Mrs right here by the slimmest the margins can cost the team several points and throughout the course of an entire season and that's just another one right there but you gotta give Charlotte a lot of credit they were not shy they did not\nWill especially early on in this game they came and brought the attack the Tampa Bay early and often really balanced first out that's the difference sometimes\nBecause you don't have to put that added pressure on you in the second half to really try and work and you get press and you really get ... you know you really are not maybe on your game you're just\nTightening your grip maybe too much that's more than necessary so gotta give Charlotte a lot of credit so they stay alive but barely because it's still hard up Bill Clinton for them and they probably don't even have a chance at this point because they only have one game left they probably saw the end of their hopes tonight as well yeah you know and again\nIt was a microcosm of the season in the sense that there were so many opportunities must have annoy most of them way but there were opportunities here around it's going to not only title that good wanted and kept this they're leading hopes alive here in the playoffs picture and like you said it it may not be officially over but it is and it's and they denied it will be probably Tuesday when\nA bunch of teams play again heading into the final week of the regular season so in big disappointment but are they battle you know and again Neal comments that at all year tour every said they never quit playing now they're sure as heck didn't quit\nThey don't they they work hard and they do a heck of a lot to try and put the best quality product they can't onto the pitch of course of their fans from the community and of course for themselves because they want to be champions and they want to win and\nYou know be recognized [noise] excuse me like that the entire season in at the end of the season directly recognized but you wonder if this kind of style of play can you know these kind of moments that we've seen them really come on strong\nMaybe put that in the first time a few times you know how long have you noticed that they don't even want to waste your energy 'cause that's a really big moment 'cause you know you don't want to waste everything for the second half\nAre going into the second half but you know if you see a couple of moments like that we're not just like building slow methodical you can get a couple of springs like that maybe the the course of the season couple of games here and there change but yeah it's still an exciting game you're at to wrap things up here at home it's a pleasure obviously to watch than you know call these games with the gym and just a little disappointment this year unfortunately\nYou know the ... eleven and fourteen and eight\nForty one points remains forty one point so you said North Carolina tied right now they lost they lost so they're forty four Nashville's that forty seven New Yorkers at forty six so right now those guys are in\nAn auto what may I Believe the outer North Carolina would be the one that's out right\nNow correct like North Carolina still at forty four points of course they get moved down though that's yeah that's the biggest thing so it's auto one now in that spot at forty five points with one game left which unfortunately means for Tampa Bay they are out on the outside looking in and can't get that forty fifth yeah and uh\nThe team Charlotte tonight will move ahead of them so the radical falling to Charlotte teeth like Charlotte technically sixteen team to\nVisit Charlotte technically has a chance if they were to draw with Ottawa I don't know how it would work depending on the wind total is it looks like auto has the edge there so I don't even think Charlotte could get and even if they one of these there last game here because NATO has Thirteen wins this is only Charlotte's death\nSo Charlotte the most they can do is forty five points in with auto already we're already there Charles looks like there are two\nSo tough way to end the season a couple of final numbers here will take a look at George you stop wound up leading the route easing goals that season seven goals for three is Seventeen points\nFifty nine career goals he did not play the last couple of games because of a rite nice brain right now still one game to go to the bathroom when Saudi really showed him still or is the end of the year with five goals that an outstanding season and\nOf course Daniel big I think we didn't really talk that much about him tonight it's going to eat he will not play next week you know he's got a red card so he's going to finish up at four wins for losses into ties and I think I think he showed quite a bit here gold the season and wouldn't surprise me to see him coming back\nPlus of league could three clean sheets in a short stint with this club it's a very cool to see that and of course the guys in front of 'em did a pretty good job with only three guys and one of them on the back line anyway it's really a lot and really speaks to how good and talented he is I Can't go without mentioning junior flemings because\nWhat what ever happened\nBetween the fifth and sixth inning he takes\nMy arm from my body with the torn labor minute and begins to pitch\nI don't know what it is where he's like alright seven thinning everything that was working as normal change it on the fly it's like you don't want something different try something else that started here it's like yeah your check is here's what Clinton was saying in terms of not having something to prove\nI don't really need to prove myself or anybody I Want my minutes for me out there I think that's the biggest thing you know ... inside of a great season and his pitch really well for us and looking forward to watching the night and uh I'll get my turn them all\nI I think this way from you always have something to prove whether you've had good and bad\nPerformances Clayton Kirsch always had in the postseason he's certainly hasn't been the same caliber of pitcher not even close to what he is an all multi blows my\nMind is if he pitched the way he pitched in the postseason like he did in the regular season if he did that we wouldn't be talking about it\nOh gosh but even if Clinton cursed shah was the same guy in the post season that we see just before heading baseball in the regular season\nI still would disagree with them you still have something to prove always it's not about what you've done it's about this postseason it's about a year and now I hate when I hear athletes say I don't have anything to prove you always do I don't know why anyone would have that mentality\nYeah eat any time you step out there you have to prove them yeah you don't think they are um Tom Brady has something to brew\nDrill ... then they they go right to write like Drew Brees we're talking about him he wants to have an eighty percent completion percentage this year he he's not satisfied Tom Brady has got five rings he see I'm going through the motions now that it oh no [laughter] it's like\nYou know Peyton Manning thing during his run when he got to the playoffs I don't have anything to prove oh yeah yeah you do have and that's the only do\nWe got the check this out from this is Peyton Manning this is when the colds and Peyton worst actually breaking up remember they had the pressure on friday out when they were releasing him losing his back and forth with Peyton and a reporter\n[noise]\nNo I don't have it in for for a while I was playing fighting for more than I\nAm still still want a boy\nAt\nYou always have something to prove I Love all where Michael stray hand this goes back to the o seven giants this is before the NFC title game when the giants beat the Packers and Tom Coughlin face was about to break off and it was so cold [laughter] Here's Michael straight ahead on NFL Network [laughter]\nThat gave me with my face because we make our own history now passes dead\nI Love that so much more men that's the mentality to have it doesn't matter what happened before it doesn't matter the success we once had it's all about now all all All right bye now\nSports is uh what have you done for me lately business all around every single sport every single professional athlete period it didn't matter what I what I mean it didn't matter how many boxers Mike Tyson knocked out in this first round it did not matter it's all about to go and they didn't care about that [laughter]\nYeah right [laughter] buster was like oh yeah I think I Walk through me in Tokyo him I got something for you iron Mike yeah\nSure I Love what Malcolm Jenkins the eagles safety did this year before the season started they had all of this stuff in the locker room defend you know Superbowl fifty two champions eagles over the patriots and he's like take that down\nThat doesn't help us here at All right I Love that absolutely do\n[laughter] for Clayton Kirsch ought to be the dude I don't have anything to prove\nWhat that shows you that he hasn't come to grips with how awful he's been in the postseason\nRight that's true you're right about that that means he doesn't he doesn't grasp it or he doesn't want to grasp that are coming up next to the guy goes studios it's very different\nCold but it is an impossible\nSo

three yard field goal\nShame on me I thought Steve the sacred misspoke and I'll never make that mistake again on that when you set of products are I'm like oh it's a forty three yard or you must have meant upright nope you might cross bar and it wasn't the flight did it wasn't anything he just came up short of forty three are\n... that'll do it come on man welcome\nTo the world [noise]\nOh [laughter] [noise]\nKicker let down\nDo you vote yes or no on the phrase he shooter leg\nYes\nYou go yes I go All right we'll put that into a fuel put that into the rotation over the show 'cause that's the sound\nOf the ball coming off your foot sure when this just doesn't have enough mustard on it\nYeah that's a that's an ugly sound it's kinda like the ... sound you know what you are not happening on Wednesday they will be a lot of ... ... ...\nThat is such an ugly sound man especially when you think you just drained a three pointer and it's just the back of the iron just from\nHorrible\nHorrible a Texas a and M. they just one rush up the middle\nI uh try beyond Williams ... Kentucky falls from the ranks of the un beaten\n... ... there'll be ranked twenty fourth now\n[laughter] you don't want it stinks for them is they totally get host because of the past yeah\nReally it is it's Kentucky's done nothing in terms of football so it's a tough loss at Texas saying them but a and M. was favored by six points they went right on to the spread depending on when you got it you know so\nThey did what Vegas was essentially putting in the ballpark of them doing but you're right Kentucky they are going to be like oh we never should've bought in on ranked [laughter] exactly that's exactly what the [laughter] ... yeah okay So Richard Sherman\nHe's shared some opinions throughout the years writing from ... year and they're they're sort of ... a little bit so he had some things to say about these new NFL rules check it out\nYou can't touch 'em you can't ...\nYou can you can knock 'em all down to the ground hard if you're pushing through ... you know all the better you can hit a receiver high and low and you can't push 'em you can you can barely prep him you know it is very very difficult on teams to to combat it because it's just every ruling and brokers inside\nTo make sure you don't get himself\nYeah man it's rough it is rough to play defense it's not impossible but everything explained is true and hitting the quarterback the right way where you're not falling on top of them that is it's really tough to do and I'm sure you saw this during the week you from\nThe Los Angeles rams they were practicing hitting a dummy tackling it as if it was a quarterback\nAnd there was one funny thing ... just went up to it just punched it [laughter] just flooding but the other times they were doing it they were hitting and they were wasting as they were wrapping and falling to the ground and that's the next aspect of this\nWar I understand they're trying to keep the quarterbacks healthy\nAnd it gives them a better chance of defensive linemen are not falling on top of them I think that puts the Lyman in a bad place at times\nBut you're going to see them twist so they don't land on top of them and if a quarterback has his foot planted firmly in the ground in a big defensive lineman is twisting while eating out you can see where this is going to end up\nYeah then it's literally going to be a game of tag if you can tag the quarterback the ball is did\nThat's headed and tags you think we'll ever see that in the NFL\nThink about like legitimately quarterback was the only position on the entire\nTeam that doesn't receive any contact other than in the game\nThat's it quarterbacks only receive contact in games mhm no one ever touches a quarterback and practice training camp oh tia anything\nSo now they're making it to where you can barely touched them in the actual game mhm\nI mean I understand safety but\nThe message that it's sending this guy can't be touched\nYou can't touch the quarterback if you push the quarterback down after he throws the ball it's a penalty if you land on the quarterback no matter what happened to you to force you to land on them it's a penalty\nIf you I saw a play um\nIf you jump up and that and the Thursday night game roughing the\nPasser mhm ah linebacker blitzed running back cut him he was in the air his hands were up ... gets cut splits forward hits a cousins right no no he hits I'm gone or the Brady oh and I\nThought your age I was stuck on then I started writing I Would go with last Thursday night this yeah in my helmet\nNot that he was trying to put his hands up to block the bed he gets cut your foot forward\nRubbing the passer I was like [laughter]\nAll right there you have it\nWhy do you think this is where we're going yeah that's where it's progressing towards um I Want you to listen to this this is Eli Manning and take it for what we're talking about listen to what Eli Manning is talking about in terms of forcing the ball down field\nCollege football\nWhen it comes to

Margaret as our okay yeah we'll get a million dollars was excellent yeah oh that was fantastic movie\nYeah by the way before we do a rapid fire week five preview\nWe were doing and I should of written it down we were gassing when levy on bell would end his hold out and there's a word that he might end the whole doubt by reporting around week seven which is the by week does that make any sense you know why why would he do that\nThat makes no sense we pin I'll see you I Believe that it has its uh when they could uh trade 'em right that's the the deadline for trading is weeks since\nThe dawn is he's forcing his way back to maybe\nI don't think that is that the deadline I don't think so it's right around the trade\nThat I think the week nine is the tree deadline I Believe\nWe'd have I don't know off the top of my head but it's around that time and that's the thought is maybe levy on bell is saying hey I'll be back guy and that gets the ball rolling with the trade because\nThere's a lot of stuff to work through if ... heads back goes into the locker room with the Steelers with them counting is money in the back and forth\nSo they might say let's just get something for the guy while we can't I think they should work through those issues it's obvious they need that guy back big band has been exposed so far this year yeah six in the backfield\nHere in even though a James Caan has done a ... job and replacing him there's nothing like one of the uh best and most dynamic runners in ... when you don't have that guy there is a difference you can tell the difference\nYeah All right so let's go rapid fire you from how 'bout speaking of the Steelers hosting the falcons you gotta win this game if you're either team you can't be stuck on one when\nAfter weeks five how do you see that game going down [noise] um\nI'm looking at the Steelers to pull that game out yeah fellow defensive so bank but I was really bad and you know on the road I'm going with still there's the total is fifty eight [noise]\nCan you take the under [laughter] God avoid that gave you will be a lot of points of view that we might have defense on both sides so [noise] you know [noise]\nI'm looking at the rams I have no problem laying the seven and a half their strength their defensive line is the Seahawks weakness the Seahawks defensive line I think it's a mismatch and it's the first game without her old Tom and she told me Sean McVeigh can exploit a few holes but it's\nGoing to be a nasty one I think I agree with that as well [noise] yeah ... [noise]\nOh man they're rough right now absolutely how about all\nBaker may steal the chosen one he's eleven dating above the earth right now with the twenty seven pass or writing in the league but oh

there's nobody else in this league really at the top of the standings and all of a sudden Texas' right back in there were maybe they can get to nine ten when I think they can and maybe compete for big twelve title unbelievable turnaround for Texas and obviously now we've got to see what's next for Oklahoma\nOr Texas quarterback ...\nUm I just thought he was caught see he was just absolutely fantastic I thought gee I played Marie ah he had Seventy two yards rushing Maria ... to ... and he had a little bit more passing that Marie did\nBut I mean he picked up the first times when they need a big purse downs on that last drive when the school was tied\nHe could have easily you know made a mistake next thing you know very Ponting and Oklahoma gets the ball to come back and tried to go ahead and win this thing with a field goal especially with the crowd and the momentum half that stadium I'm absolutely just being packed with Oklahoma ... have you ever been by the way to a game\nOf that magnitude have you ever been to a Oklahoma Texas or do\nI have and I was actually texting buddy during the game I said if Fox has the game next year I said you and I should go down because he's a huge sports fan like me and it's one of those games were knock on wood if you and I already are still hosting the show it's one of the few games that you know is going to be a noon eastern kick off\nSo actually you have plenty of time to get back in the studio you know if I Want to go to a\nI don't know in Ohio State Penn State game or an Auburn, Alabama I just don't know what time that game is going to be but Texas Oklahoma is pretty standard yeah a new kicked off so I don't know maybe we can do remote show I mean I just I don't\nKnow why he if he of course lives there is the Oklahoma sideline reporter I ah I've been to a couple of them having that was ... and um I got to tell you it's an absolute blast I mean you're going to the Texas state fair you got the game going on\nI've never been to a game where it's split right down the middle I mean it is absolutely intense and you know it's one of those on Chris Shays you throw away the record um it's\nIt's one of those great traditions you know I hate to go ahead and and be one of those guys I'm Wondering how much better this tradition would be or the survivor would be\nIf we had a home and home series instead of playing it right down the middle and I know it's about the same mileage\nFrom Austin a I Believe the dollars as it is from Norman the Dallas but how great would it be if we at home field advantage in a game like this\nI kinda disagree oh come on I mean I think it's one of the cool things look there are ... there are a lot of great home and home rivalries and college football the ones I mentioned Auburn, Alabama Ohio State Michigan\nBut I think it's pretty cool it and listen you're the the expert that's been all these games but\nUh I mean you know I'm told that the scene outside with the state fair going on is an unbelievable dating yeah yeah so why don't we just keep it the way it is because that that that's what that's what college football's about though that\nWhole field hell no you know what college football's about what tradition and this is an unbelievable tradition\nYou know and you know maybe it's kind of like 'cause I've I've also been to the uh Florida Georgia game and I I prefer that would also be a home field advantage to be honest with you\nI don't I'm not too crazy about these new neutral site games I don't know what were the Texas Oklahoma fans feel about that and you could send us a tweet Aaron underscore tour as um ads thinking genius one\nBut I think the fans of those teams would love to have it on their on their home campus I think they were just enjoy that\nYeah I mean I think it depends I mean it's just one game it's another game or maybe a people in the town in the city maybe can't afford to go because we know some of these uh these good seats in these big stadiums he's on campus stadiums are owned by the big donors\nA plus you know there's plenty of people in Dallas that aren't that close to Austin that are that close to the norm and it's a chance to go go there it's a chance to make a weekend out of it go to the state fair\nI'm I have no problem with it and I think too it sets up for you know an interesting scenario as far as just what a winning last means going forward as far as if that games in Oklahoma is there may be a different\nResult today and then if there is now all of a sudden Oklahoma there in a position where they maybe have probably have to win out to be in the mix for the playoff conversation\nI'm sure we'll get into kind of where Oklahoma is later on the show\nI like it the way it is I mean why can't why can't we just keep some things the way you know we do we do this in sports so much we changed so much every we try to improve the stuff that's already awesome I don't get why we always got to do it this is one this is fun I wouldn't say it would work for every rivalry but this is one more I think it does\nRight when we get back we'll take a look at the rest of the top twenty five ... not happy with his defense so all of that coming up he's Aaron tourism already Spanier says Fox Sports radio [noise]\nAnd that will be the thing goes off\nWe'll have a job are from the city on\nHome is the right here this is Fox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know\nWhy did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that a war basketball is bound to the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during the game well here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a

for mom ... last year and that's even took me a long time to get here you're right I should get out yeah the first is not that ... have\nCome to sway the more adventurous you let's kick out discovered the force dot org for cool places nearby you by the U.S Forest Service any cancer\nBy trying your first thirty day bottle free just pay shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word man to Seventy nine Seventy nine\nI mean jeeze I I I'm not I'm not going to be too much of it because they've just been destroying everybody up to this point and and and look I'm supposed to knock them for what are you my thirty four points and I think Oregon states horrible team but I guess Arkansas's not that much better\nNo they're not but I ... I'll say this is I think in defense of\nUh basically I I I actually agree with you as I I think that this is Nick Nick Saban his team is so much better than everybody else I mean here's the thing about Alabama they've always been so phenomenal on the defensive side of the ball not today obviously but in general\nNow they have the number one scoring offense in college but right now and I you know ask you quarterback\nThat they know no disrespect to jail it hurts the quarterback that's part of astronomical numbers\nOh absolutely I mean to us today\nTen of third team over three hundred yards and for touchdowns three under thirty he average thirty three yards per completion jeeze forty percent of his passes what for touchdowns today so it the point is is that I Do think next David is looking for ways to motivate his team I think\nI don't know if it'll be until that as you see championship game but I think he feels like look at some point we're going to be challenged maybe it's LSU\nI guess in theory maybe it could be all burnt although ... did not look good tonight they lost again\nAnd so whatever whoever that opponent is Nick Saban needs his team ready and I don't think he wants it to try to click in a place a week or two before that game or the ... the week up the Georgia game I think he wants his guys focused right now and needs them focus\nBecause eventually they're going to run into somebody that can at least give them competition and he doesn't want them coming in on focus I think that's why it makes comments like he did\nToday we will continue with the top twenty five first though we'll check and see what's trending with a buddy Steve the sacred tonight what's going on to say\nGood evening gentlemen let's start with the major league baseball 'cause the AOL division series game twos words today still going at top seed Boston Yankees leading in the top of the nine six two over the red Sox\nReady to tie up the series at a game of peace scary Sanchez

now one in five after losing fifty five fourteen at Memphis\nThey are so well well what do you miss the big score\nI Know the Wildcats are playing on the ... not that I really got to tell you\nMy kids' teams can how can you can Kent State they want an hockey tonight Fort Irwin over a fence for what's wrong with\nYou didn't even know the name yeah I Know I asked him about that a can or can't say that like you know he didn't want that I got to pay for the education where I write the check\nOut the way the Arizona football game is on at this one at halftime losing at home fourteen tend to either\nYou don't have to keep ... very much right now ... wherever our news desk we just report move along there\nA couple of July for the guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more car insurance with Geico or go to guy go dot com or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well that's figure out which way is easier you know you just said that if there's a faster way to get the eight teams\nThat's the way to do it um you know when you're getting two teams from one conference\nBut doesn't seem to such a disparity in you know are such a gap between number one and then two three and four\nDo we really what eight teams when we think five through eight really is not even close to the same part about effect teams five six seven and eight would all be double digit under dogs to Alabama\nWell I'll tell you this Arnie first of all I'm One of those guys and I don't know where you stand on it I don't really have a problem with the four team playoff like I think it's good the way that it is and and I understand we always want more we always feel like we need more but I think it's the the reason that I'm okay with poor instead of eight is because of what you said\nEverybody says well if you're a conference champion you deserve to be in\nWell there are teams that played for these conference championships because the conference and the divisions are imbalance search he's playing for conference championships with three four five losses I mean us see a few years ago played for the pack twelve title was for losses is that a team that deserves to automatically get in\nUm so to me I've never had a problem with sticking with for\nA while you have no problem in college basketball though when teams or ... five hundred or five hundred that get into the into the boy tournament what the conference champions ... yeah the conference champions you with us from these small conferences will that tradition well\nThis is the average everything's tradition to you this is tradition what do you\nLike first of all but yeah of course if if the NCAA tournament if they wanted to expand to a hundred teams in lead in you know the ninth place team from the pack twelve although they actually did that last year right right\nBut if they want to let in tents placed team from the pack twelve and the thirteenth play Steve from the ACC I'd be don't I'd say don't be ridiculous\nAnd so to me I just don't like this idea I don't have so much of a problem with expanding eight I\nHave a bigger problem with automatic conference champions in the case of football I see that solves every situation different that's I I I\nHave no problem going with the top five ... go with the five majors and then maybe like three at large and and work at that way but I'm I'm certainly one that was like the expanded from Fort a just a couple of the scores you mentioned Georgia you know this was not as easy as it looks like on the school board forty one Thirteen if you didn't see the game\nAnd easily miss because there was so many other great games today or this was seven to three at the end of the first than a Twenty one of the six I Know sounds like it's well in hand but that's the scored after I've been there for about a couple of drives where they could have put touches on the board\nUm obviously they're they're often folders it gives a great Georgia's defense but I just wanted to say was that much of a route like like people were expecting\nWell say this for Georgia they got a big game next week against LSU on the road that's the one I think that well first of all the look at the back in uh Georgia schedule depending on how you feel about a couple of these teams yeah\nOr at Yankee Stadium so uh that's a legal to change the tide Yankee fans be out there in full force there and that that that's going to be a fun one I was gonna say the theme of tonight shows\nTradition I a grown up in Connecticut I grew up as a Red Sox fan but there really is not very much like a big playoff game in the Bronx oh no no no and I know I I you know it's crazy I haven't actually been to the new Yankee Stadium yet because it open right around the time that I moved out here and maybe not maybe move like two or three years earlier but anyway\nThe point being I haven't been there yet I heard it's not quite the same but it seemed like last year for those playoff games everybody was up for it I'm excited to watch them excited to see and it's been a fun it's been a ...\nIt's been awesome so uh we'll see what happens there\nOr Washington state of thirty five thirty over Oregon states are about to start the fourth one are you going to criticize Washington state because they're given up thirty plus to Oregon State I couldn't care less about watching the due to their idea good team for one coming out and I'm surprised that executives cause I thought they would\nGo ahead and en route Oregon State I think the games in Corvallis so maybe that's why it's it's closer than I thought\nYou know I have a great can I tell a great get fired for talking about Washington state Oregon State I think can I give it a great Corvallis story really quite yeah go ahead now will really gets fired but go ahead no I have a buddy who was an assistant coach up there I won't name the sport\nBut apparently Corvallis it's a little it's a little hard on the eyes let me put it it's not the most scenic place\nAnd he was talking to a buddy his who was an assistant coach at an opposing school the other team came in for a road game and he stops them in the handshake line before the game he says this place is so awful you got the NCAA should allow you guys to cheat to get players up\nThat I'll never forget that that's my only valid or yeah I'm also later tonight we're waiting for the McGregor fight I mean how long do we have to wait for this what is it is it going to be starting like after three o'clock in the morning on the east coast or what\nI Know I Hope I Hope it's on or by the time we get off I think that Jonas and all of them will be doing the recap after I think it'll still be going on we're going off air here\nUnbelievable so we'll keep you updated on that I've got it got a lot in front of me so uh we'll just wait for the start of the fight it because they've got where does that mean our producers he's sleeping again\nNo I'm I'm I'm right here are so many more fights so we have to go till we get to the ... I Believe we have one at ... percent against Anthony pet is in the uh Kobe an event\nThat is the one fight before I'm assuming this is going to determine who's going to face the winner of the main event\nSo are they worried about a sudden the east coast it's going to be like one in the morning you know how it is Arnie with boxing they don't care about that like we may whether we'd come out and fight or some of these big name boxers would come out and fight like nine o'clock Pacific time it would be like midnight on the east coast I Know it always has been in the fight games\nDo have a ... latest odds on this ...

the job you ought to take the rising\nI mean listen you're you're in Arizona fan I'm a ... a football fan you know you got to take the good with the bad and so you probably get a lot more bad than I Do\nBecause I mean nobody really talks about you kind of football but a great thing about it on at all but gone well excuse me have you heard of women's basketball the dynasty and all college sports take you're\nNot my friend and you know I Will what's\nThe last thing Arizona one wow wow you're so mean to me the west coast junior college not something something doesn't count okay and all the\nAnd and well I mean I guess I mean and I would say also I was gonna say considering that\nThey have the highest payroll and the pact while at all basketball would be a little bit better\nIt's not the highest just one of the highest All right let's give our top five real quick for college football I don't know it does not go head to play some music what'd you please for crying out loud so you could put us in the mood not much has changed at the top for me um I saw Alabama number\nOne followed by Georgia AS number two I kept him up there [noise]\nUm as much as I didn't want to put 'em in number three I left Ohio State three once an impressive with the points they put up on the board after a almost a losing last week so I've Hudson for and just outside that tough for Notre Dame at number five so that's my top five Arab you are out of your mind I\nHave a lot that you don't like the tough I don't like that I've\nAlabama one because it's Alabama's too I Am making the league\nNotre Dame no right now that when at Virginia Tech better than anything that George W ... wants to Old Dominion yes Virginia sex silly and they were still top twenty five seem everyone has a bad day you have many a week Arnie but I don't know that you're in there\nBy the way a quick shout out Mikey over street on Twitter asked me how does Notre Dame match up with Alabama\nI don't know that anybody matches up with Alabama but I Do think Notre Dame defense is is very very good I think Notre Dame we discussed it earlier could give Alabama the most troubled anybody in college football three I got Georgia\nFor I got the Ohio State and even though the ... doesn't really matter because there's only four teams in the playoffs I'll put slams in there for now I'm Still not sold they're very good\nWell does matter I mean you don't think it's going to finish out like this slowly teams make the playoffs and going by my uh tough for\nYou know we still get an S. or you'll get to SEC teams in there if Notre Dame sneaks in yoga enough to conferences are represented could be the SEC and [noise] the big tent with Ohio State [noise]\nNo I mean that Notre Dame thing is huge because there are going to be a lot of disappointed upset people in the ... upset people in the packed well and maybe the ACC was cleansing may be the Big Ten depending on how that shakes out they're\nGoing to be a lot of angry people if we get us teams and Notre Dame and I think that's where we're headed I mean\nOn paper it looked like that game at LSU was the toughest game remaining on George the schedule doesn't look nearly itself after today George also has to play at Kentucky which could be a a tricky one but I think there certainly better than that he will be fascinating\nTo watch but I'm telling you man I think we're on a collision course undefeated Alabama undefeated\nOh gee and LSU last today at Florida twenty seven Nineteen gators with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter including a late ... six there were\nA combined Seventeen puns and Nineteen penalties in that game in Gainesville and the LSU quarterback transfer from Ohio State job or a three hour and oversee was sad like five times in this game was not his day\nI I just can't understand why they are just so much better than I look I Know says they banned it but I mean head and shoulders better than everybody else\nWell when you're starting quarterback has three hundred and thirty four yards passing on ten completion yeah and then leave the game ten of Thirteen for touchdowns for to talk of a little while\nTo us still hasn't yet this season thrown a pass in the fourth quarter\nNow that's just silly he hasn't been six were halfway through the regular season assistant we to the Ohio State quarterback had six touchdown passes today Dwayne Haskins through for four fifty five Ohio State was only up on Indiana twenty eight twenty at the happy with the final with guys forty nine twenty second\nLet me just jump in there I mean McGregor is just getting pounded\nOn the ground the whole time but I did it to go second\nHoliday nonstop he looks like he may die I mean you just getting he's getting pummeled in their\nBelief getting hit but he isn't exactly you know it's not like chasing and losing energy that way but yes he is absorbing punches more in round two then round one by the way and again most of these first ten minutes being spent on the ground so the champion the undefeated lightweight champion is really having it his way I'm guessing this is what he would draw up\nAnd what hunter withdraw up with the check he's going to catch shortly I'm sure\nAnd this is just the start of a U.S the deal he's beginning a new deal with us see of course\nThe beginning of the end uh no no he's got a few of our fight like you might not make it for the next couple of flights up to this one\nIt's just a matter of how soon that actually it is I guess still late in round two uh Georgia still undefeated rank number two in the country Thirteen penalties but they killed Vanderbilt forty one Thirteen Jake from three touchdown passes and the cleansing game\nSixty three three at Wake Forest unbelievable way different from last week wake punted twelve times and I only eleven first downs\nWake Forest as a team seven of twenty seven passing for Seventy four yards as one guy that meanwhile Clinton had almost seven hundred yards of off as\nWe mentioned uh to us that passing for Alabama on the ground for Clemson Travis E. B. E. T. and ten carries a hundred sixty seven yards\nI think that three hundred yard Russia's and only chain carries each wow ATM three touchdown runs in that blowout and as far as Notre Dame you mentioned it was close earlier it was one point halftime yeah for the Irish they're still undefeated winning at Virginia Tech forty five twenty three you got to reiterate though Virginia Tech\nDid lose and give up even more points to Old Dominion earlier in the season and that that'll down and you're the only way I felt far yeah that is absolutely I'm a great and it was a road game but\nHonestly Dexter Williams of the Irish today three touchdown runs only Seventeen carry the at a hundred Seventy eight yards the Texas Oklahoma game in Dallas did you realize both starting quarterbacks finished with five total touchdowns\nBut the sooner skyline Murray had to turn over says well Texas kicked the forty yard field goal in the final seconds to win at forty eight forty five Oklahoma had tied it with three straight TVs and the fourth quarter I started flipping channels when it was lopsided going into the fourth and then come back my goodness it's a game again but\nThe sooner did fall and talk about falling\nNumber eight Auburn was awful tonight\nHoping to even see that up through all the stuff that was going to get over what\nThey should not miss this because Mississippi State pummeled them into submission\nUsing a USC reference twenty three to nine was the final all burns off and had ten drives only one of them lasted even longer than two and a half minutes gee they went nowhere no touchdowns ... missed field goal time a possession at the end it was Auburn Eighteen minutes at a sixty that they have to call\nThem and I was gonna say it's not like Mississippi State was playing well coming in and they were coming back to back losses themselves one of them at home last week so\nYeah both of these teams are foreign to now a couple of more rushing touchdowns for Nick Nick Fitzgerald in this game and a pro prospect at quarterback for West Virginia will Greer had four touchdown passes but four turnovers as well\nWest Virginia rank ninth finally put away Kansas thirty eight twenty two and the game on Fox tonight tense rank Washington winning at UCLA struggled small crowd at the rose bowl as well the Bruins are wind lists thirty one twenty four huskies the final\nBruins own five for the first time since Nineteen forty three Nebraska lost at Wisconsin Nebraska oh and five for the first time since Nineteen forty five she fight in round number three in

I got to tell you there's maybe one or two games that stick out but most of the other games\nYou know I got big question marks on and what are they in treating games coming in under the radar I feel\nHappens to be my dolphins against the bangles both at three in one what are we going to get the with the dolphins after that terrible blowout that they've suffered in the hands of the New England patriots\nAnd the bangles maybe one of the surprise teams are these surprise team in the NFL with the three in one record uh Cincinnati a overwhelming favorite an escape tail looked awful I mean awful\nAgainst the patriots I expected them to get back on track with their defense but the Bengals are no slouch at home that's for sure\nOf all the games we could lead off with we have a NFC championship game rematch Billy Minnesota we got a big divisional game and the AFC North Cleveland Baltimore we got a big NFC North Green Bay Detroit we got Casey Jacksonville you're telling me you want to talk about Miami Cincinnati\nYou didn't like that why you didn't know what are the intriguing games out there you know you first of all the top ones you don't want to see what they do have to pay you know he came and bang goes I mean is there any dog I'm for real they taken the ... the bagels getting back to the playoffs and\nAnd and make it a run if this thing both teams three in one what keeps going to go to foreign wanted and and if it's the top ... they'll have a bigger preying on the patriots\nThe dolphins are the counter McGregor of the of the house all\nThe all all says all no stake come on the dolphins are awful I'll say this about the the\nThe bangles um I think they're sneaky really really really good I mean for so long it was only Eddie ... J green right how you look John Ross and it was a little bit banged up but the run game is going\nUp mix and also but I mean again are they using him in up in the you know getting utilized enough\nWell and that's that's a fair point but but it just feels like such a more dynamic off as if I had told you Arnie the week before the season started that we would now be you know whatever it is a a quarter of the way through the season or whatever\nThe Cincinnati Bengals their force in scoring in the NFL behind Casey which we you know we would assume because Andy Reid the rams we would assume because it's Sean McVeigh\nThe the states we would assume because of Drew Brees and Sean Payton and then number for the Cincinnati Bengals the fourth highest score it's human AFL who would have predicted that a month ago\nYeah I I didn't see that coming also you know things do you do have that auto correction and I'm Wondering if the Bengals are going to be one of those teams with the auto correction like I said you know I Know you brought up those other big games out there this one is a monster game coming under the radar one team's going to go to Ford and wanted to have a command in their division\nThe other one gonna come back to earth a little bit um I'm I'm real interested to see if ten they'll get the dolphins back on track because\nThat was just an awful performance I think you have like a hundred yards passing he looked like the worst quarterback in in the history of the NFL after that patriot came ... that was a beat down there and not ... that was an embarrassment\nI was going to say I actually did feel bad for you because I Know that you were convinced that the dolphins were and oh yeah ... get that when yeah as I told you that one got so that they they slap to the patriots left around the dolphins so bad I thought somebody should call pita because that was why are you doing this do that wind by the way it is you know yes I did yeah there you go it's okay\nBut the other day I came up with it and you took it for me about that I made on this show will say that I came up with it 'cause I'm Out in the real sticking genius ... less than what you do in Vermont Monday through friday that's an I might as\nWell what goes on in Vermont stays in Vermont right as I say is that is that the way it works out there that ... ... exactly right let's go to one of the games are that you mentioned earlier that is one of the big games out there that's Jacksonville the Kansas City chiefs look I I Do want to pump the brakes a little bit on Patrick homes\nAnd this is going to be the game to see if Jacksonville defense is going to show them what the truth homes is now they are playing in Kansas City\nUm and I expect the homes that have still a little bit of trouble remember getting the city's not done too well in the play offs was supposed to be at home where they who's in the first round seemed like every year but we'll get to that later on uh I like Kansas City I just have to pump the brakes with the homes\nBecause I'm not going to make in the mix of what what did they say John Elway Dan Marino red radar I mean come on now I I don't you tell them not through a five games are or four ... four games this year\nI totally agree with you Ernie and and I look we all love the ... story is a great story the kid is phenomenal I mean that left handed past that he made the other night was like wild\nNext oh it was okay I've seen that come on come on already come on now but I Will\nSay that cheap stuff kind of made a habit of jumping out not not so much last week against the Broncos but have made this habit about jumping out to these big lead against um you know against teams and then kind of letting their foot off the gas\nThey are not going to be able to do that this week against Jacksonville Jacksonville I think as weird as it sounds may be good for them to get away from home I Believe they have three straight home games\nAnd I just think that with that defense I think that defense is going to be tired of hearing about Patrick homes I'm fascinated to watch that kind of chess match ... matches\nWere just scratching the surface on week six will come back it more of the games out there uh finish off major league baseball my Wildcats with a ... point lead so now I'm In a good mood I'm feeling good he's Aaron tour as I'm only spend your this is Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nThe place it makes you rise outta your share\n\nThis is why you love puts sarin\nFox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know\nWhy did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that award basketball is bound to the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles

all part of it but at the same time I like how much is too much where it takes away from the spectacle within the octagon when you have stuff like this going on outside of it I'm\nSubmission that's what people want to see you know like some people go to racing for the crashes some people come to leave the city after fight hockey for the fights yet Israel or the or the fight for the up their

and I truly don't know what the best way to pretend\nLike your you know disgusted with his behavior because I think he did that with Qatar McGregor up to the uh Boston so that he was just absolutely disgusted so I'm sure you'll get more of the same but I bet she's laughing inside\nYeah I was going to say it's one of those you act outraged you know and I'm trying to think of a comparable example in everyday life but you know we all do that with our significant other when they're upset about oh no I'm so I I totally understand I'm so mad meanwhile data whites probably\nI mean I don't know that

that I think about that but what's what's gentlemen as in like ... yeah he's talking about like I just know that you should go whoa hold on just the whole thing just the whole thing\nAnd made it on the wrong guy there McGregor does nothing to do with this yeah I'm a ... yeah you if you guys watch the video McGregor actually uh he was he was sitting down in his corner like he was gas after\nHe had gotten choked out and all this stuff just transpires as he stands up\nHe gets jumped from behind sucker punch from behind by this dude from ... camp and\nIt's it's just turned into a ... like in this was all after it could be went into the crowd the other way so it was like a two different directions you a tutor for ...\nI don't know I Want to make a comment that you could do it that Aaron underscore tour as I'm at stinking genius one\nUm yeah I mean it's certainly going to be a big story I don't think it's good to overshadow what's going to go out in the NFL or anything like that because really people are just going to be outraged at what happened after the fight but it still they separate it and figure out what the hell happened\nWhat are you going to really do [noise] I don't know I just it just to me I don't know it's just such an insane story I mean because we all expect kind of the bizarre to happen in this sport I Will say this like Connor is so device\nEspecially with the fight and gets ready for the upcoming week in the NFL speaking about the NFL let's get two or three picks I actually got for gay oh a little music put us in the mood um and we started the topic is\nUm although as much as I said what's left the brakes on my homes and all that being said I still think it's a small price I Believe the widest three with Kansas City\nI'm shocked and that's not going to three and a half but I I don't think she's laying low number there are three [noise] because I'm from Jacksonville be able to match them point from point that's a small number given the chief fundraiser a perfect place to start because I completely\nDisagree wow yeah I just think the chiefs of gun you with these big lead [noise] they're not going to get a big lead against Jacksonville is by far the best defense plea knows the chief the date have not played the tops and then\nThe jags or number two in the league I think they get at least one defensive touchdown and they win this game outright in ...\nI think I vote against a Joe public just gave us the charges open up as a seven point favorite down the part that means a lot of heavy money coming in on the Oakland Raiders who are not as bad as the record shows the one in three hours of brutal finally gets that first victory but the chargers have so many more offensive weapons I don't think the raiders could keep up\nFive and a half seems a little steep prices are you going to be sick\nBut I later six what the charges thinking they'll run away with this and\nAm going to go next to a game we talked about last segment Green Bay agile traits opened as a take Detroit now a slight favorite in office I see why Green Bay is not the vintage green\nThey would see in last year's Aaron Rodgers only eat in the league in passing middle of the package behind guys like any dawn Joe Black go to Shawn watching this is not vintage Aaron Rodgers I think he struggles the lions are better than that one in three record they get\nThe when our bloods are going to go to my third pick and [noise]\nI gotta tell ya San Francisco and I actually loving this one\nAnd I know obviously Jimmy gee gone but that doesn't mean at home and the way up to three and a half against Arizona who if the culture is not the worst team of the other building Arizona's the worst team in the NFL\nAre you going to tell me this Arizona team to go to San Francisco to keep the was closed or pull off the upset with Josh Rosa not I'm not buying it give me the Francisco MINUSTAH three and a half [noise]\nLast one from me this one started at three and a half it's down to three in some places do three and a half others Houston hosting Dallas yeah\nI don't buy Dallas look you had the great game from ... last week catching the ball running the ball the taxes for all their struggles protecting the John what they've been very good against the run I think they cut off the head of the snake I think\nHe does it have those holes you had last week the Texans winning ugly one but they win their second straight after starting on\nRight now I was going to go with the red socks over the Yankees in by not serious tied at one game of peace [noise] um I like to see the red Sox and the Dodgers are in the world series I think that that'd be a good whatever if not obviously Dodgers and the Yankees would get a lot of national attention all\nYeah that would be the air or as World Series there because it has a Red Sox fans are living in LA now although I Am pseudo\nAstro spent George Springer on another prominent a lot of

Jacksonville was seem to pick their spots or Seventy one by the way in the last ... bucks in his game\n[noise] yeah I I think it ...\nI was talking with somebody a year ago who said they are the toughest team to gauge because the wild card is always going to be Blake portals but I think there is something to\nJacksonville on it or getting a team who is playing on a short week and you would assume that at some point Kansas city's gonna get a fall off I think it's a tough game to try and handicap it's a tough game to to figure out which way you want to go\nBut the reality about the jaguars defense I think is a little bit different than what people would expect because yes there near the top of the league when it comes to points allowed\nBut they're also middle of the road and Saks and they're almost dead last and takeaways and to me if you're if you put that up against the team who doesn't turned up all over the home still hasn't thrown interception I'd I don't know how you could feel so confident the Jacksonville is going to go in there and prove a point I just don't\nI Will say this to James are really getting their defensive ... back they've allowed seasonal yards in the last two games and yes the chiefs are undefeated but they own a defense that ranks dead last in league in overall team defense in Jacksonville is near the top and typically in the NFL whenever a number one ranked defensive guinea points\nFrom a defense that ranks in the bottom ten the dog is favored in a minute here Steve ... is going to tell you we're healing this is straight out of Vegas

because they're kind of mystery wrapped up into a rental or whatever that come under ... you know it is and they're\nThey're hosting the falcons tomorrow and the ... three points in the you know let's call a spade a spade the loser of this game is in serious trouble because the loser will fall to one in four\nAnd in the history of the NFL if you follow wanted for\nYou've got about seven percent chance of making the playoffs the last team to make the playoffs after falling to want it for to start the season where the two thousand to New York jets so I don't think either team wants to be in this position tomorrow\nMeasure Lee ... has a strong opinion about this game let's find out who he likes let's take a listen\nI like the Pittsburgh Steelers I bet the Steelers mastery RJ we talked about being stubborn the odds makers are just being stubborn with the Atlanta Falcons they keep setting lines thinking oh the land often says just clicking on all cylinders but that defense with all those injuries are so bad right now we some money coming huge against that Lana the last\nTwo weeks I think it's going to happen again this week I think the science going to go up I like Pittsburgh mastery\nJonah says it is absolutely spot on yes both teams are wobbling there wouldn't want a piece you know going into the the tomorrow's game but for the falcons it's absolutely been their defense it's completely abandoned them they're allowing thirty points to a game\nOnly Tampa Bay rays thirty four points per game as wars and the dirty birds they couldn't even take advantage of a three game homes than they had earlier meanwhile Atlanta is on five against the spread in the sucking back to back AFC confrontations\nWe talked about this last week with our GI Bill they play they meaning Atlanta played Cincinnati last week last at home a Matty I says now seven and fourteen and his career versus if the teams and they get another AFC team tomorrow what are your thoughts about this game Jonah\nIt feels like a get re game for Pittsburgh now the Pittsburgh Steeler fan base a they're a very passionate I'm there if they're going to attack you Bernie I'm just letting you know that it's going to look like post fight McGregor comes\nAs because you shorted them and you said that they are one in three about to go on for their actually won two in one you always want to count your ties especially if you're a bad football team early on so I just want to say that\nUh so yeah one two and won the falcons earned a bad spot they've got a lot of close losses this feels like a get right game for Pittsburgh Antonio Brown compare to him and Ben Roethlisberger at a spotty why as far as being able to connect on the field Judy Smith Schuster has had a good year but a banged up secondary for Atlanta\nPittsburgh notoriously is a good a better team at home better office burgers splits are much better at home I don't think you could look too much into what happened last week against Baltimore that series has been dead even\nYou could easily see Pittsburgh going to Baltimore and do the exact same thing the ravens did last Sunday night I think this is a get right game for Pittsburgh one thing to keep an eye on though\nThere was a game of college football game that was played there on Saturday Heinz Field notoriously one of the worst surfaces in football\nAnd apparently it got torn up pretty good at so to come back for a one eastern time kicked off I don't know how that would would would affect the betting for an over underlined or appoint total line but just something to keep an eye on\nYou know it's a good point Pittsburgh hosted Syracuse today the Panthers at probably one of their best games of the year\nThe field did get a little chewed up so it does remain to be seen I mean you look you've got to Atlanta don't team you know what I call a hot house Jimmy plan perfect conditions they go on the road I Wonder if that shoot a few maybe favors of Pittsburgh joined if we think\nYeah I Would I Would think so I'm just as far and also look\n... of of the stadium better like I said Ben Roethlisberger splits are bizarre almost um you you know it's not like science field is this nice cozy comfortable place it doesn't deal with poor weather late in the year so I Would think there should be a game that would favor Pittsburgh um I I just\nAtlanta much like Minnesota feels like a team that got dealt some bad cards early some brutal losses I think Matt Ryan is really played well but they've been in every single game you can make the case that Lana should be for no but unfortunately they're sitting at one and three and I think they're probably going to go on and for after this game\nMiss Piggy back on what you said about Ben Roethlisberger 'cause you're right at home this guy's tougher than a three dollar steak by the way he's eleven and won against the spread at home in games when he faces teams with the losing record when that theme of the losing record is coming off a game or they lost at home and by the way here's the kicker for your Jonas\nBanner office burger is sixteen into against the spread\nOr excuse me sixteen into straight up and Fifteen and three against the spread career in October and games when the Steelers are coming off a loss including twelve and ... straight up against the spread\nIn which in in in game for Pittsburgh under five hundred so you just said it at the top I think you've nailed it this is a ... well game for Pittsburgh you get the last word on this game\nYeah I I like Pittsburgh in this game I think uh I I could easily see them putting it on um I think there's been a lot of talk there I think there's been a lot of dysfunction a lot of stuff is played out nationally I think Pittsburgh comes out and like I said at the top this is the get right game for them I feel bad for Atlanta I genuinely do I think they've gotten they've dealt\nA lot of bad brakes early in the season um I think Matt Ryan has taken you know or some criticism my time Steve ... and I thought I got the heat after week one which I think that was strictly on Matt Ryan I don't think it was so much on ... and unfortunately they find themselves against the team who feels like it's a must win spot\nTo continue to stay in contention in that division I like Pittsburgh big time\nAnother team it's looking for when after shellacking Miami they hid in Cincinnati to modern got blown up by the patriots and the Cincinnati or believe it's six point favorite RJ you know he has he expects a certain team to show up kind of big tomorrow let's take a listen now\nThis is one that I Love love love and I'm a bat in the team I've already bad them that backs this trend if a team gets crushed\nThirty one or more points they lose on the road so the dolphins got crushed by the patriots it was thirty one or more points and then they have another road game so road road\nThose teams are forty and Nineteen against the spread sixty eight percent against Vegas why it's the same idea is the world saying oh my God look how bad the dolphins looked\nAnd the psychology of the dolphins is we're going to be a hundred percent focused to redeem ourselves and oh by the way the factors road road means they don't have any time to get distracted it's going to be all business and the focus has all the way that\nI agree with our Jay and by the way a systematic missing a key player which we'll talk about in a minute here after the break coming to you live from a gecko Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance for the guy with a guy go dot com or call one eight hundred nine four seven auto dealing hard part\nSearing out which way\nIs easier now we're gonna come back in a minute you Jonah smacks number in front of your this is a straight out to Vegas fly from a Jack of Fox Sports radio students and by the way what you buy discovered we treat you like you'd treat you were going to pick up one more thing on that dolphins Bengals game when we come back who don't go away you're listening to straight out of big us\nRJ had some thoughts about the buffalo Saturday the equation and how they might fear in tomorrow's game let's take a listen\nThere's another trend in this game the points to the bills if you shut out in the NFL zero points and you lose that game by more than three touchdowns\nThe next game fifty seven percent against the spread\nOf fifty seven mighty good it's Seventy nine winter sixty losers so that's actually pro built the first trend was anti Tennessee this is pro bills the NFL is a betting league\nThat you need to be contrary if everyone's going one way you got to go the other way because the where everyone's going gets expensive\nSo in this case everyone's going on Tennessee because they just beat the super bowl champs as an underdog so they get a little bit of expensive everyone's running away from the bill because they just got shut out not big zero well that's that that goose egg people hate that\nBut what's happening to the team the bills are saying God what are we doing and I think you're going to get a great performance from the bills\n[noise] great news there was a quick way you can save money switch the guy go go to guy go dark prominent Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent or more\nOn car insurance join us let's unpack what are you just said there because it speaks to when the great acts GM's\nThat we've known about sports betters forever the fact that folks overreact to what they saw last you saw what the titans did last week the last three weeks and you saw with buffalo did last week\nAirline should force a John ...\nYeah I mean here's here's the problem I have with this and and I I Would lean towards the Buffalo Bills but here's my biggest issue with it\nWe have no idea what the hell Josh Allen is nobody no we don't know what he is we don't know whether or not he's a good quarterback we don't we know he's got great physical abilities\nBut he went from having a good game one week to turning the ball over multiple times there's an ax and even in the week against Minnesota when he did during the ball over they recovered all those mumbles so it's hard for me\nTo put my money on a guy who I don't know what he is like we talked about borders being a wild card at least I find that have seen\nConsistency from time to time with ... I haven't seen anything from John\nI found that leads me to believe oh yeah I Want that guy I'm going to put my money behind that guy ... ... plus five and a half or plus six points against Tennessee Titans team who just knocked off the eagles I Would lean buffalo because of the points but I don't know how you could feel confident about it\nMoving you know unless you're really intelligent angle because\nWhen you consider that they've now got film on Josh Alan ... you know here's a kid comes out of Wyoming he does well I'm a combine for my money or the games too fast for him quarterback is the position\nThat you point with your eyes you drop back you make mental snapshots you got to make you read progression you got to recognize personnel groupings schemes formations\nAnd then you've got to execute somehow Josh Allen went into Minnesota a couple of weeks ago and play the game of his life even had to rushing touchdown\n[noise] quite honestly I really think that was a bit of a fluke and now the problem is they have Josh showing on film but this is where did the numbers become a guideline or inflexible anchor because you are right you don't know what you're going with John challenge but it's hard to [noise]\nYou know fight that I don't feel battle against teams were Thirteen and forty one straight up sixteen and thirty it against the spread the week after the beating the super bowl the plus [noise] we've got plenty of history in the NFL teams get sharp particularly at home [noise]\nHow they bounce back next week that is a game I Will probably stay away from what I gotta tell ya I agree with you join us in the sense that it provokes draw because the governor center from buffalo he's the one that's got to take you home and I don't know if he can't\nOr this has been straight out of agencies Jonas marks on Bernie Fratto as a matter of fact if you want to stay tuned this gentleman coming up well he never\nHe never procrastinators DMV responsibilities you join us ...

is so this is funny ... everybody knows this and you know just to be a fact\nLike ... and I can I can criticize it all I Want I Do a lot of driving coming into the studio here and it's one of the freeway driving and you know that\nThere are certain things that come with an accident okay there's the fender bender there's the cars that are impacted and then there's the cars that are impacted that aren't in the accident and they're impacted for two reasons one\nBecause it's traffic it's a lot of chaos you come to a screeching halt and to there's a lot of people that are lucky you lose rubber neck hers who have got to stop and look at the accident and see what's going on and my favorite part is when people try and say [noise]\nUm yeah I don't do that ocean I've got things to do okay we all do the same thing when there's a fight that breaks out\nOkay when there is some sort of a skirmish you're at a bar restaurant whatever everybody turns around to look and see what happens right everybody does you ever watched a boxing match on TV and all of a sudden in the middle of the fight you see the crowd behind them on camera turn around and look up they're not even watching the fight that they paid to watch\nThey're watching the fight in the crowd and it doesn't matter who's fighting in the ring\nEverybody's turning around to see what is happening\nYou all look everybody looks like that's that's just the way this stuff goes so when you're watching UFC two twenty nine on Saturday Night and you see the skirmish breakout afterwards and I see people after the fight these and then they\nAre these um like real enemy insider guys talk about how yeah there doesn't need to be a rematch we don't need a rematch it was such a decisive win for ... made off okay you don't get it\nIt's not about what you think look I consider myself very knowledgeable when it comes to Anna may I covered the sport I covered live events for Fox like I Know what I'm Talking about I'm passionate about it\nI watch the same fight could be their market made often dominated majority of the fight he got McGregor down early he landed the more significant strikes he's the guy who knocked McGregor down with her right hand he's the guy who dominated the fight and he's the guy who finished the fight I get it if I wasn't necessarily close\nI didn't think McGregor was in that fight outside of a couple of moments early on\nGet felt like a pretty dominant performance guess what\nI'm watching the rematch I don't need to see a close call in order to war a rematch there's more to it than just whether or not it's deserving Lee so based on what you saw in a cage\nLike this is all about money man this is all about what draws the most money you what's going to get the most eyeballs and there was no fight anybody wants to see more now than could be burst Connor to know fight you can't think of another fight\nYou remember when Connor ... D as an atheist submitted him you remember the rematch\nEverybody wanted to watch that that was the that would that set a record this fight is going to be a record like you want to watch this stuff don't pretend like you don't stop in turn when there's an accident on the freeway\nCome on man like you you could be scared you know what of of dead bodies but if you drive by an accident and looks like a bad one you're not turning your head and focused on the road you want to see what's going on like I got to see what's happening like people that are too close to the sport\nYou're not looking at it realistically you got to be pragmatic when it comes to stuff like this people want to watch this that was riveting television man that that was as good as it gets chaotic crazy unpredictable filing\nUm [noise] so it is time to find out now which one we've got do we uh Iowa Sam have ourselves and I was on the on the show I say you do not have and I was ... what happened in positive to be here did something happened well I've ah I've sort of retool what I Do on game day so [noise]\nI I honestly maybe I think for one game the northern Iowa Iowa game a couple of weeks ago I had a couple of beers but I just drink water I watch the game I go back to sleep or you know it's it's too difficult man it's it's just too much um I'd\nRather yeah be attentive and good at my job when I come back yeah plus Iowa has he been played a ... game yet so [laughter] I haven't had a chance to uh throw a couple of back\nWith a fourteen hour ... so yeah so so you are one single nine AM\nOr eleven central kickoff game yet so now\nThat I Would do they want today at Minnesota one big put\nUp forty eight on the ... the aid for Iowa that's like dog ear you multiply that by seven years like putting off two hundred point in interest at Georgia Tech into was Cumberland Gap from like Eighteen hundreds gives you were on the Jew hundred and Seventeen to ten or whatever and I'm Amazed though I Am in good spirits Jonah I Will\nWill will debate we're happy to have you ah definitely thrilled by the way you know who else is thrilled ... this this may be one of the greatest promos Africa now um if you were watching that UFC two twenty nine of and\nYou watch the heavyweight title or it wasn't that way but the heavyweight fight between Derek Lewis and Alexander ... and Derek\nLewis is losing the fight I mean he's losing he's\nDown on every scorecard going into the third route I he's been tagged a couple of times he's been ... a couple of times but he's got this right\nHand that can put people to sleep and with heavyweight fighting in boxing but especially in the U. S. C. you've got\nTwo hundred sixty two hundred eighty pound guys and these little baby four ounce gloves\nAnd if they touch you you're going to bad there's no there's no other way around it like you're going to sleep\nSo Derek Lewis is losing this fight he's down on all three score card it's done it's over under twenty seconds left he lands a crushing right hand and ended up winning the fight at the buzzer I'm not going to call the Minneapolis Miracle but it's something close to that I mean it was craziness\nAnd then after the fight Derek Lewis decided to take his pants off in the cage he's just in his drawers he took his is UFC board shorts off and this was the post fight interview with Joe Rogan\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[laughter]\nSo\nWe walk like this\n[laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n[laughter] very much really really [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh it was brilliant Derek Lewis post fight after as miraculous when a over a Alexander bulk off [laughter] so why do you take your ... your shorts off because\nYou don't watch were hot [laughter] that they're basing a bad\nUm by the way we do have a this is a this is actually a audio or when I was talking to you I I Wish them or earlier in the show I said I was salmon like but listen man but I think what you need to do is you need to do this for this segment do this for this segment this was I was ... wants to me\nLike this [noise]\nAge Ben Miller here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea of what's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car

wealth can be pointed the finger\nWe're four weeks in and these teams are combined to five and one on the year Atlanta his got injuries\nThey've got close losses their ... their defenses a slew of starters either injured or out for the season and Pittsburgh's problems have played out nationally\nWhether it's way beyond bell an adult situation with his teammates calling them out whether it's Antonio Brown not being happy with the ... and ... burger maybe butting heads whether it's Mike Tomlin whatever you want to call it\nAll this stuff is played out nationally for the Pittsburgh Steelers but I think last week's lost a Baltimore as bad as it is I think it says more about the rivalry\nBecause if you want to swap these two teams later on in the year when Pittsburgh goes to Baltimore I could see Pittsburgh doing the exact same thing to Baltimore did to them the rivalry the records they're almost dead even historically that's just part of what that game is\nI think Pittsburgh rebounds [noise] I think Pittsburgh rebounds in a big way and in fact I think Ben Roethlisberger feeds on a banged up falcons team\nMy knocks lock isn't whether or not the Steelers are going to cover the spread you can find this prop that in certain market you can find it on certain Web sites around the country if you go on and you look and you look hard enough\nI like the Steelers to score over three and a half touchdowns in this game [noise]\nWires that one\nAt ... pm eastern time jags in chiefs are the Patrick the home shows the best thing going on in the NFL\nMonday Night football was so damn fun what a good time that was man I could watch Patrick ... play football for the rest of time I'm In it's exciting\nI don't know how it's going to finish up but it's exciting or he can make every throwing the book he keeps them alive in games it's an element to the Kansas City chiefs and an anti read off instead it's never been there before and it's a lot of fun but it's a short weak\nAnd everybody is waiting to see when Patrick Boyle homes is going to throw that first interception [noise]\nThe reality of Jacksonville defense though maybe a little different than the hype yes Jacksonville is number one in points to laugh [noise]\nBut they're middle of the pack insects and almost dead last in takeaways so then why\nIs there a betting line on mobile homes to throw in the interception in this game and why\nIs it a slight favorite why is more money coming in on ... homes to thrown interception is one of those while he's do situations is one of those well you know love averages he's got thrown interception everybody throws the interception\nI'm going to go with it I'm going to go with where the money is flowing I liked Patrick Boyle homes to throw an interception his first of the season in this game [noise]\nBoy the\nTexans are a three and a half point favorite on Sunday Night Football look I'm Still pissed off over the game from last week I talked about it I mean what a bunch of crap what a what a load of crap that was the Texans shouldn't have won that game\nMay come on man they shouldn't one night game they should have been a tie it best below Brian even settled for a tie in that camp now I can make a case for teams with the losing record because I could say look you've got a bad brakes teams got injuries\nAre all sorts of stuff you know a couple of bounces here a couple of ounces they're tipped pass interception like I can make the case for that but I just don't think\nLike you're not him you're not injuring fighters\nAnd throwing a Dali through a bus window and removing fighters from cards because they're not physically capable of fighting\nA couple of days before a fight just to promote another fight that may not happen this was real and this is the potential when you have the fight game like I made the comparison earlier if you have a pet tiger 'cause you have so much money don't come to me\nTwo years later and go I cannot believe he wrote my arm off I can you believe that this is unbelievable that this pastor this ungrateful you know what he ... my arm off well I mean yeah he's a wild\nAnimal or that happens you run the risk\nThat's how it goes in fighting you run the risk of this stuff happening now Dana White was upset after the fight uh this is him talking with the media and the press conference but Dana White as good as there's ever been as far as fight promotion I think he is disappointed but I think Dana White\nIs going to wake up tomorrow and he's going to think about things and he's going to figure everything out and ... ... some way or another I think we're going to get a rematch here was Dana White afterwards though\nGive us an idea kind of where you stand I mean should these guys running back or is that the whole idea of her that you see\nWhere we have to see what happens with the Nevada state of the commission I mean not just an\nThe commission I mean there's going to be fine there's going to be a God Knows what you know because these guys get visas and get back in the country you know what I mean [noise]\nWe'll see how this thing plays out and you know like I was saying and doing this\nFor Eighteen years and uh um\nThe biggest night ever I couldn't be more disappointed you know you know me I'm usually mad at everything you know not even that I'm I'm just really disappointed\nI mean I I I get it man it it it the optics look bad you don't have control your sport you don't have control your fighters\nBut I think if you ... if if you look at this for what it really is which is the fight game and things like this can happen and I'm surprised they don't happen more often I think the rematch\nAlthough maybe stylistically in what you saw in the cage doesn't make a lot of sense because if I wasn't all that close the rematch\nMakes even more sense because it sells itself\nThe fight sells itself it's true genuine bad blood\nIf they can figure out a way and they talked about all the security they had there just in case and it still wasn't enough if you can figure out a way to do it to where none of this stuff happens maybe you bar the guys who jumped into the cage from cage said next time\nThere's no way if if\nIf it's available and if both guys want it there is no possible way that there's not a rematch with this fight you got to be realistic about it the owners

one and the first broadcast of the world series on radio in New York Yankees beat the New York giants three to zero [noise]\nThis week in Nineteen fifty five Baltimore Colts pulled back Alan and meet she becomes the first rookie in NFL history to top one hundred yards rushing in his first two games get a hundred and fifty three against the Detroit Lions after his one hundred and Ninety four yard performance\nIn his debut against the Chicago Bears this week in Nineteen eighty four Walter Payton\nPassage Jim Brown as the NFL's career rushing leader\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety One the New York rangers trade burning nickel to Edmonton\nFor mark messy a Nineteen Ninety four he would leave the rangers to his family come victory this week in Nineteen Ninety three after nine years of playing in the NBA Michael Jordan retires from basketball you start playing minor league baseball and then he returned to the bulls in the NBA in Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nAnd this week in two thousand five the NFL plays its first regular season gets helpful\nYou can listen on our first I our radio ads [noise] download it now\nPeople sit on it can't get that out of your mind\nSo when you're watching the Cleveland Browns and you realize if you go down the browns record and you see a tie against Pittsburgh in a game that they probably should have won a game against the same so they probably should have won on the road if not for poor kicking\nAnd then a game against the raiders who they probably should have beaten there were questionable calls including a spot late in the game that would have ice the game\nIf you're looking at all that you've got a team that probably should be for no but we can't get it out of our minds that this Brown's team may be different than the one that we're used to here's another thing we can't get out of our minds\nThey you know maybe the guy that they took at the top of the draft maybe this guy a he had kind of a head start coming into the NFL over everybody else reason I say that is our rear\nWorks for the Monday morning quarterback dot com he's fantastic he's been covering the NFL for years and years he was on the herd with colon cow or this week here on main aired on many of these Fox Sports radio affiliates and he brought up an interesting point\nThat may change the way you think about Baker Mayfield moving forward\nI'll tell you this calling people on the fell right now believe that Lincoln Riley is one of the top five ... ... soldiers on the planet anywhere and the fact that he comes from that and the fact that he was able to play for like an Riley or just from the uh the quarterback coaching standpoint\nReally put them in a position to develop over the last three years at what you're seeing and not all of his translator or the NFL or what he learned all all you're seeing\nTwo very important qualities one is very accurate with the ball and to its decision making for the most part was off the charts at Oklahoma if you have those two things coming into the leak that's a pretty good starting point\nSo let's just think about this then now that we know all that and now that we've gotten a little bit of sample size of Baker Mayfield\nAnd I understand it at a couple of turnovers and there were some uh a couple of bad throws may be in that game against Oakland and that's going to happen with a rookie quarterback but it now hearing Albert beer said at that Lincoln Riley is considered to be one of the top off five offensive minds in all the football\nNot just college not just the NFL all of football if Baker Mayfield came from that\nMaybe we don't see that many typical drop offs of of what we normally see what the young quarterback\nYou know maybe he is the real deal maybe the browns actually did get it right because think about it the browns\nProbably should have won that game a road game a week ago Baker Mayfield first start he went blow for blow with their car\nAnd they I mean that that was both team scored in the forties there were some\nPoor you know bad turnovers and I get it and and young quarterback and that's going to happen and it happens all the time and yet about guys ... it happens that is a road game\nBut now that you actually take a step back I've been saying this from day one so many things point to they got this right\nThis guy's better than advertised meet one Heisman Trophy but I think people just expected\nUndersized Johnny Manziel they couldn't get the idea of the brown actually getting a pick right in their minds so they just kept deferring to what they're used to nine hours that's that that's that's what we're used to that's the browns know\nLike it's different you know they are they aren't the kid in high school\nOr who used to cut farts during P. All right they're not like that it's a different like they're not they're not that same kidney more like they actually did get this right a couple of the best talent evaluated in the NFL have talked about it both like Johnny Manziel more than any other quarter back in the draft check\nSteps in on prime time no notice wins the browns their first game in like two and a half years check those blow for blow on the road and again the browns probably should have won at Oakland with their car and the raiders check\nCame from a college where the head coach there is considered\nOne of the top five offensive mines in all of football check at what point\nDo we not take a step back and go yeah maybe we missed this evaluation maybe it's better than we thought\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox

sponsorship that's fine I dressed in a Charlie Brown shirt alright there's got to be something that I I don't know\nI'm into it I'm All right so my comment that you know what else I'm into what's up buddy returns right returns\nYou guys coming back sanctions that have left themselves and their teams shaking their heads go what the hell are you doing\nHere like I personally have Julian Edelman on my fantasy team and he came back and I made a PR league and I was in ... you know Julian Edelman given what Thirteen fourteen points I was good with that man from a flexed\nPosition if only he'd caught a couple of other ball and left like he gets a butter fingers getting back you didn't get the ...\nHe did um but mark Ingram yeah there's a lot on because he is back for the New Orleans saints ... what does that impact on that team\nWho who does it affect the most and a good way or a bad way as he is back for the St on Monday Night what brings you back your sledgehammer\nBetween the tackles and Robin ... owners they're going to be a little bit saltier about it 'cause that's probably ten to twelve touches maybe Fifteen or on the right\nGames script that go the other way on you and can merit coming into the sea coming into this week you're looking at the highest fantasy point score among running back tried three touchdowns a week ago Drew Brees owners if you didn't watch the game you saw that final point total\nLike oh I'm sitting pretty and then you checked your fantasy team and you started throwing stuff and causing a problem so uh for where I think you're looking at the goal line stuff going away 'cause you want to make sure he's ready for the stretcher on because you were just talking about the falcons and they're bad luck starting to catch up with the AIDS looks like they're pushing towards a playoff run\nAnd uh and what's interesting so Drew Brees has got the record that he's going to try and and get 'em and that's on Monday nights where he's going to try and pass Peyton Manning for the all time passing\nYards record so if you know a guy I mean this is just fantasy psychology yeah get from somebody who is actually good at it unlike me\nIf you know one guy has got X amount of yards to break her record\nDoes that impact ... who you play on that team for that game specifically like is there like would you would tie go to the to a receiver um see you've got a receiver you've got one spot to fill and it's a you know it's not a top name receiver\nAnd another game would you give it the edge to the guy who's got the quarterback going for the record just based on you know they're going to try and get that done in that game\nYeah you got you things you go from milestones and you also go for your over on his right those are the two games we play when you're going and try to decide between players we don't necessarily look at\nAt some of the the target counts can fluctuate right 'cause a lot of folks just look at straight target counts as opposed to what the game's script was they might have down Twenty one nothing after a quarter and all of a sudden there's Thirteen targets well they've got to hang an asterisk on that one right 'cause the game to play out\nAs a normal flow of your unless you're getting buried every week than Thirteen is as a magic number but in this particular case for Drew Brees going up against Washington given up only eleven points for fantasy points per game two opposing ooh not to you but they are at home\nSo that's you know you always have that Washington also coming off of by week so figure they come in with a decent script but you're still looking at Drew Brees he's going to break that mark certainly probably by the end of the first\nTime my car and Fox Sports radio is fantasy football insiders with this year on up as art disco fantasy you can watch 'em at swollen dome on Twitter ... and you can watch this uh on periscope don't your friends we got hundreds showed up man yeah where are you ready

I'm\nNow we you talked about you you look at you know over under Z and you look at milestones\nAnd over under that is through the roof and it makes a lot of sense seeing all the injuries and what you've seen from those defenses is Atlanta in Pittsburgh I talked about my my sympathy for the falcons I really do feel bad for them because they've had her just a bad run of luck in certain spots over the past couple of years\nWhat jumps out to you from a family ... fantasy perspective in this game Steelers falcon while we play 'em all\nBut they the one difficult proposition is trying to figure out what devout freemans going to be this week coming back off the injury right he's going to be available how much does that he'll off any extra production for seven cold and so now it pulls his sealing down and now you're looking at\nBoth guys is back and choose slash likes plays for your your running back position because this one is going to be a a Thirteen to ... there's no chance in hell no you got to watch for starters already done for Atlanta\nMet Ryan kept in a show like ... Jones you see of lofty in all ... like yeah you like yard is that is great gimme Galvin Ridley\nWhen the money's on the line that he had been great so far man phenomenal last three weeks to come up with more touchdown perceptions and Julio Joneses had in well over a year or at this point so he becomes the guy maybe take a little bit of a of a shot with Austin Hooper\nJust so we could yellow\nAnd we will recreate Nineteen Seventy five classic jaws another type ... dramatic reading uh the the us as it did apple is fifty another man went into the water saw my friend went to show up on the shoulder shows turned upside down he had been bitten and have\nShow ... rivers right now doing his thing and uh you rented thirty nine yards couple touchdowns will but has his team and the red zone again so he can be adding to that uh he still has two minutes thirty seconds left or the way the add some more points with ... having a good day so far those\nYour quarterbacks in Spanish you ... you do quarterbacks I'm gonna do running back ... love to block but a running back everybody to run the bat that's just the facts social service acorn Barclay\n[noise] they throw at the fact\nHe might as well ah put a obey Jay quarterback because a lot of drug in the military but that was a courtesy\nOf WFAN a giants radio network I think one Barclay Fifteen carry for the yard but he added board care for catches eighty one yard that long when we just heard into touchdown yesterday\nIt was the last uh he got a little banged up we'll find out a little bit later how serious that injury as hopefully can bounce back ... a next step tiger early\nFor two inches away from the goal line rivers on\nDown curly headed by the time\n[noise] uh that was a ... year early from Ninety three point one jak after him rams radio network are currently game still going on here fourteen carry thirty a yard touchdown go for reserved for thirty minutes yards\nYou give that bought a girly he will ram it all night a little [laughter] we'll go to the heart of the middle of a good\nTwo inches away from the goal line river soccer center how white out there with poor sap hands development and now they saw\n\nOpen court with the one yard times\nNo charges radio KFI six forty AM those boys a bill cows men Gordon Nineteen carries fifty a yard touchdown for reception six who yards you have to be dual threat to be on this list is running back you're\nRight about that I'm actually shocked to see how well ... has been out of the back of receiving this year you know I Know he lost a lot of weight and really taking it seriously it's get onto the receiver we'll start with somebody who was humid you could have been a quarterback today was well through a touchdown pass and he caught some as well about king junior\n[noise] oh\n... really did that okay that was my bat didn't hear that that's got a coup cut\nOff her shoulder right in the right way to\nThrough a sea hawk down put down in LA and Iran's are back on the high side\nThat's Ninety three one jak I've been rams radio network there Cooper copying a guy again that many didn't know about but all of a sudden they definitely have to know about us he's having a lot of success being the reds maybe probably their number two receiver on that theme behind Robert\nWoods are renting 'cause I don't know where you but maybe to a to B joy to be the way to beat up and a Walmart boy into receivers that is Christian Kirk\nPlay accent Rosen setting up with time look the fires date got 'em an wide open inside the thirtieth caught by her twenty bucks\nKatie a e cardinals radio network there Seventy five year old just down for him from Josh rows and rows of ... pretty well you and I watching the game ...

to I've been\nBut I think the issue is okay we we don't get it and we just saw I was thirty one right they didn't get it we don't get this they would have the ball at our if you get ... with three yard line thirty\nNine left the game is over\nYou completely take the game\nOut of hand don't get it they are right there even if they didn't get out of the yard a at least be kicking a sixty yard field\nGoal to winning right you're right so it will go with what you see but now they put the ball back in the hands at this point\nWith the magic man Russell Wilson all they need to fill go we'll
