D J ... although he joined the humans job he's not limit for net he does bring that that type of a of of of toughness in in in hard yards\nThat Leonard does he can get you to thirty to thirty three on a regular basis if you had the ball off to him the first two down so now you're stuck with a guy who's inconsistent a quarterback who makes poor decisions\nOr if he has to throw the ball forty forty five fifty times the game you just do live in a world\nIt's brutal when you're one dimensional throwing the ball and Blake Bordeaux says Jekyll and Hyde at best you know that's a bad recipe the thing that's interesting to me though and this gave me from is both teams are three and four\nAnd ... have been called out way more than the eagles have right and I would actually I Would compare the eagles to the patriots because the patriots start off one in two and it's just a she'll say oh these patriots what's going on with them and the evil empire is crumbling and blah blah blah blah blah right\nAnd the eagles there are three and four there the defending Super Bowl champions they are three and four have they been just crushed have they been heavily criticized at all no\nBecause you know that they can they can turn it around we don't know that about Jacksonville and I think the main point is that is fine my prediction remember our subjects but would make the playoffs\nRight oh well I could see that collapse happened right I just think that it's crazy that they haven't been heavily criticized yet the expectations are not even close to them as the patriots type team coming up next the three worst starting quarterback in the league right now [noise]\nI was only helping to get more done is what we do that like what the auto zone rewards program you learn a twenty dollar reward every time you spent twenty bucks or more times is just one more way to get more done I right now I'm going to depend on\nUs don't give come by mail a rebate when you for just a so many of silver star older one or two single fax to super PACs must be purchased on the cells received a visit any of our fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more for you\nSee terms and that was on dot com slash remorse restrictions and he tells a story\nOn this episode of the world shorter sitcom like Cassie\nI say it's inside accounts like what's inside my now\nKFC can be stricken V. ten basic chicken too large mashed potatoes and poor mascot for an ID nine and I\nAre under twenty dollars\nThat's what really matters is pretty incredible what chicken ... your life [noise]\nAnyways and failing participating half a if I did my very ...\nWe hear about it and bring it with a guy who can vote on our\nArms around in your home from a proper balance provide problem from all sound like I'm a court reporter for less than what\nI'm founding board member of the Innocence Project and my new podcast as wrongful conviction available on our heart radio on wrongful conviction I interview at different exonerate every week and help them to tell their incredible stories of tragedy and triumph against impossible I Know you've got to hear it and believe in wrongful conviction from my hard studios\nOf album now and I are radio [noise]\nHi heart radio takes you back to the top five\nOctober twenty alive at five\nFifteen when they were helpful\nYou know what can we fought our first I ...

when you go into a game you're like oh gosh rich hill on the mound to know you know\nAnd he's delivered something that Clinton curse jaw rarely\nHas in his postseason career but it's just strange I I think you some people would feel more uneasy about rich he'll starting a game than they would Clinton cursed Shaw some would would you agree with that he from yeah but Clinton gr show man\nIn the playoffs I'm cool [laughter] well cool man he's awful is awful ... near this is not like a new revelation\nHe's been awful\nFor his standards yeah yes for his standards at look he's pitched he's

you don't do that either a season envy go before me ... all of the whole nine yards good lord man\nThere's something about at least I'm curious to you from because I said this to the lovely Christina last night was\nClinton cursed shock came in to pinch hit and I'm like a man I Hope this doesn't pitch and give up the winning right exactly because it's just going to be he's going to get crushed you know he's going to be criticized like crazy\nAnd I I'm not going as far as to say I'm rooting for them to succeed but I'm hoping he doesn't say he'll do you do that sometimes\nWhat players have yeah typically not come through Romo fringe right you know I just hope that they wouldn't continue to not come through and continue to get lambasted\nYou want them to continue to\nBe bad no no no the opposite I Want them to stop being bad [laughter] and to see ... lambaste leave good yeah yeah you hope to be like oh this is you know by the way the coup eggs beat\nStanford Bye bye to the top ten

trusted before and has not come through they had to one lead when he came and walked in the game time run the gave up\nWhat a two run single and so it gets up to three run home run tonight so Ryan Madsen is just not getting it done for Dave Roberts OU's not come on now so I've got\nOne tonight me from you still going with the\nDodgers logo with Dodgers ... want to see him are here and healthy or next week so\n[laughter] good spirits\nAlive you know all that Mm Mm yes how about this latest Superbowl odds\nThe rams are eight to five favorites so they're less than two to one favorites to win the super bowl that's followed by the cheap that five to one the patriots six to one you think the ramp should be favored that heavily yes you do yes I Do\nWow yeah they have the most complete team in the league\nI just look at I\nListen I've that's fine I agree with you there I just look at how good the competition is in what could potentially trip them up just in the NFC look at the same the Vikings\nDo everybody was off road but they have the most complete team yet arms of often the fans running game passing game weapons they they do and coach\nThey do so I just don't see what their talent them looking down on the rest of the NFL just talent wise like their trumping everybody else that much I just don't see that like you take for instance do you think that the chiefs or the patriots have half the roster of the rams\nThe chief do the patriots do not\nHow about the saints half the ... the thing that would be like ... half the roster did they have 'cause those the rams are eight to five so let's just say two to one right right around there the saints or eight to one\nDo you think the saints have like a quarter of the talent the rams do\nYou think outweigh more a more that you know where\nThat's where I look at it when I'm like I've got no problem with them being the favorite it's just how big of a favorite they are I don't see it man I don't think they have that much of a talent disparity compared to everybody else\n[noise] no I I mean I think um my I\nThink ... you know when it's all said and done\nThey have the best team I think their teams that are close to them in in terms of town inability on both sides of the ball I I think often simply\nNo one's more talented than Kansas City but they have no defense right now right oh so\nYou know as a whole I Would put the rams then I'll put Kansas City then I Would put a\n\n... term overlook those patriots fan\nYeah but [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah there's this guy named Brady under center still you know yeah I ...\nTo get in there but does the same defense that you know it's been getting rammed through for two years\nBy the way we ate the gain your most looking forward to would it be saints Vikings Sunday Night Football that's a good one\nOr Packers rams ravens Panthers anything else besides the Sunday night game that you're more looking forward to you know no really that is a great match our van der tremendous\nI think this is a big big game for her cousins 'cause if he doesn't play well and he doesn't get a win at home it's going to be like well they're regrets thing it OK scheme and blah blah blah and it's a big game for her cousins were going to enjoy week eight I'm going to enjoy UCF being outside the top ten when the player\nOkay Ben matter here this is a thirty second

top of the eighth in LA turn a hold on for dear life they've made Boston for three\nJess finals Syracuse they pull a little bit of an upset they beat NC State it was a number twenty two I Believe in the country\nFifth or who knows somewhere and there are fifty one forty one so Syracuse gets the victory their South Carolina\nThey beat Tennessee twenty seven twenty four so a big rivalry and not one you're Notre Dame fighting Irish Sharon forty four twenty two I Believe about five and a half minutes left in that one Irish up by twenty two they were dominating the first half and\nKind of let their guard down a little bit in the second half in this one\nYeah that is the gifted in the curse of playing against the triple option team is that\nUm and they can break off a run on pretty much any play and sometimes you just don't get the ball back because of the way that they can control type of possession ... going to hold on to win this game and then it got to feel good right I mean I Know they were coming off of pie but your travel across country you play this kind of quirky team and I know Navy is good\nBut Notre Dame they're going to hold on to get the win that they need I think I mean technically navy has the ball but I it's a solid performance by them but like you said aren't you a little flat here in the second half but I think that's part of play navy\nWere asleep it on the possible big upset of the night where Oklahoma State leads Texas thirty one Twenty one it's through three quarters\nThey're about to start the fourth Texas with the ball deep inside Oklahoma State territory I think it says about the Twenty one so monster game here a loss for pretty much wiped Texas out of any chance of\nIn one of those four team playoff awaiting here pretty much guaranteed them a top seven top paid or when the BCS comes out on Tuesday mobster game you're not looking real good but Texas tried the rally was thirty one to the fourteen at the half Aaron\nYeah Texas A M myself in our new producer Ryan Dennis who as hard at work today he and I were talking\nWay not working let's be honest na ... doing nothing\nHe's actually helping me right now so he's not going to chime in but um but we're talking and I I don't think anybody thought Texas was really the ... best team in the country coming into the game today now look they got that big win against Oklahoma the a couple of other teams fell in front of them in terms of the rankings and they moved up kind of\nA just because that's kind of how the rankings works sometimes but I don't know that I'm really surprised by this result there are a little kind of early in their development I feel like to just go on the road and we feel super confident that they're going to be a really really really good team are even a decent team on the road like Oklahoma State tonight\nAll right Bye bye Arizona Wildcats who I Would have been a a a couple of fingers or that they were going to lose against Oregon oh now pet nothing over the Oregon Ducks\nA four O. one left in the first so still a long way to go for my Wildcats let this one are just completely slipped through their fingers Aaron but nothing Wildcats up to a good start in that\nOne oh yeah no wild in the packed twelve by the way Washington and ah [noise]\nWashington loses Washington state Stanford comes down to the wire a USC loses to Arizona State what are we

help my argument but did you see the stat that joke latte or buddy from a well\nCheck this out so remember you and I were doing this show obviously late last Saturday Ohio State falls Dwayne asking Seventy three pass attempt right right so this is the stat that joke clap put out Dwayne Haskins in last week's game\nSeventy three pass attempt for four hundred and thirty arts\nTo a tongue viola in his previous four games\nSeventy to pass attempts\nOne thousand thirty three hours [laughter] so in one last pass attempt over our games he has six hundred more yards it's unbelievable I mean it and no disrespect to your buddy a critic plank in Tyler Murray who he follows yes this is Heisman Trophy race is over\nRight he's a while he's there unbelievers are already I'm already that's a phenomenal what I'm already Spaniards of Saturday Night uh we got some moving and shake it going on in the world series let's bring in gas gone to tell us what's trending out there what's going on gas\nIn the Heisman Trophy race is over ... ... is done gas kind of crazy talk we gotta get Steve Hartman or Heisman voter on I Wonder what he has to say about I mean the Carmen you should probably be awake right now ... someone was fine hair out of\nOut of his head right now ... with a pen shit RBI single up the middle of the Dodgers which led for nothing at the end of six innings\nNow trailing than nine five four ... with a pinch and single up the middle of how to run battered in Mitch moral and in the seventh inning into three run pitch it home run off a Ryan ... made it for three Dodgers but again bullpen issues for the Dodgers all night long Steve Pearce\nHopefully the solar shot ... in the eighth inning track record of six out saving could not do so again Red Sox leading the serious two games to one and now leading the ninth with two out and went on at second base chew on now\nFive for Red Sox in the ninth inning meanwhile switching over to college football Washington state with a big W they went in Palo Alto and beat Stanford forty one\nTo thirty eight in the state trailed throughout and could not come from behind Syracuse get some fifty one to forty one navy gets hammered by Notre Dame forty four twenty two and Texas which is down Seventeen at one point now only down by three to Oklahoma State thirty one twenty cowboys\nUnder six minutes to play in the fourth quarter shockingly in the desert Arizona's actually winning a football game they're being nineteenth ranked Oregon\nThirteen to nothing clear six of four eighty seven yards and itchy and he has not thrown multiple eye and T's just yet [laughter] guys\nMBA talk real quick Lakers they fall in San Antonio ... tend to one oh six the brawn James at thirty five and a losing cause but the margin Rosen at thirty twelve and eight as his that line\nFor the night Damian Lewis had forty two points for Portland but they lose in Miami one twenty to one eleven the Seventy Sixers get by the hornet's won all five to one of three Joel and be twenty seven points fourteen rebounds and chew assists\nGuys kind of Murray's the best player in the country\nWhile I take slug guys got by the way to recover the alive and the guy called Fox Sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more car insurance was Geico so just go to guy go dot com or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well let's figure out which way is easier he's Aaron tourism Arnie Spanier\nI by the way thanks the guys got ... again I gave the sake of the night off the air and well I mean come on now at the guy was begging me for the night off so we can go to the Dodgers game what am I going to say\nNo ... what does he get that type of guy or what what a slacker that goes by the way I already did\nYou see all four or four of the major teams will all be playing in downtown Los Angeles tomorrow or let me correct you uh five five who's the fits the Gallagher\nYeah yeah there are a little there are a little out of town there but ah why should I make Carson you know that that's you know that's the difference between a\nVermont and whatever they last for modern wherever yeah wherever you about it yeah yeah I was gonna say wherever the next town is with a a a stop light\nThat once they do have and you live in Burbank or where I actually live in Pasadena okay so the traffic are you is it going to be like Carmageddon tomorrow tried to maneuver through the freeways are you staying home or you're going out the venture to go watch a game or go check when in life\nI Am staying home but there are four games the kings I Believe at twelve thirty at staples Centre right the rams that won the Dodgers at about five and the clippers at six and for people who don't know the layout of Los Angeles staples center in Dodger Stadium or probably five miles apart from each other\nIt's going to be miserable so I Will be staying home like one of your snowstorms Arnie where you can't leave the house for days up there in Vermont I I've packed the canned goods I'm not going anywhere tomorrow\nThe sports Carmageddon is that what we're getting it to me is that is that what they're calling\nIt or what yeah yeah it is and I guess I I don't know maybe things change a little bit with the Dodgers are being on the brink of elimination actually but uh\nIt's right now Red Sox lead five for a cause as you heard ... tell you the divers had the RBI single\nOr that bought in ... cold who had the double beforehand down the third baseline runners on first and second richest pitch six or the third gave up one hit one run seven strike outs the bullpen and two and a third for heads for runs\nA in that time anyway there's two outs runners in first and second of the top of the knife or the Dodgers have to close it down here ... up\nFor the red Sox Dodgers can't afford to give up any more runs they got to come up in the bottom of that I've only done five for 'em and tried to scratch one way or or get lucky and hit a bomb otherwise you know hit a home run otherwise ah they're down three\nGames to one and that it's really going to get tough this this was there they were up for nothing you just don't blow for nothing weeds in the world series I Wonder what the record is I'm Aaron for a losing a lead and losing a game in the world series it like that\nYeah how about a a a U.S essentially a must win game for here by the way you said uh they got they got to hold the the the lead to five or the deficit to five yeah or\nI was going to say I just assume that the analytics are probably going to tell the robbers to pinch hit for many Machado maybe with Clinton ... or something so I I have no doubt that even if they do they Roberts will find a way to ...\nSo you're anti analytics is that what you're saying I mean especially I mean I'm a little anti analytics too but it's hard to argue with a team that's made back to back World Series appearances and and and by the way speaking about the odds are analytics if I told you Steph Curry\nWas over twenty from the field and they were down by two you would not tell them to stop shooting which is that you would say well keeps ... it's going to go in the odds are in our favor\nThat just shots got to go in so keep on city do you play the odds there don't you\nYeah but if I were if the situation was\nWe need him to make a half court ... there's no real comparable thing in in basketball because what you're asking Kennedy Jansen to do tonight is something that he hasn't been asked to do all year and so the point that I Am trying to make about analytics and this is my belief in analytics in general\nIt's a piece to the puzzle but it can't be the only deciding factor it's\nJust that it's also supposed to be used for the course of a season not just for one game I Believe\nYeah but I but I think that you know at a certain point you have to go with common sense and we saw what happened last night with chance and\nUm and I just ... and there's been other instances to wear the right analytic move has not worked out and so I think sometimes look people in and this is the other thing drives me crazy about analytics all these people say oh you know things like being clutch aren't analytical or getting nervous in a tight spot\nAnd so I don't think analytics can account for the fact that can lead Jansen knows hey last night I had a six out saving I blew it\nAnd I got to come in and do the same thing again now I'm not saying you don't pitch Kennedy jeans and I'm just saying don't put him in that situation similar to what happened last night that's all I'm saying is I think analytics or important they're good they're valuable but they can't be the only deciding factor\nUm right now better tend to get an infielder single he beat it out a base hit so the bases are loaded in the top of the night with two outs the five four leaf for the Dodgers\nAnd they'll make a pitching change so a low go ahead and see if they can again keep it to within five four right or just a couple of games that are going on Texas has closed within three but Oklahoma State that just got a touchdown extra point good there are thirty eight twenty eight\nThis is I mean I'll be kept it obvious on this where they are in a cluster for Texas this was a team that was you know right there that would have been maybe a top aide when the BCS came out on Tuesday a last year or you will find them anywhere on the top fifty and ... probably\nNo I don't think so and I think kind of the top Fifteen that's probably a little reflective of where they are I mean they're they're not a finished product yet I Know they beat Oklahoma on that neutral field by the way as your buddy ... Chris plank knows as he I'm sure you guys talked about on your show that led to Oklahoma firing their defensive coordinator and they've looked a lot better\nGames apiece by the way my my still my favorite ... a jinx kiss of death whatever Penn State they were up at like Eighteen points [laughter]\nLike six minutes to go or something crazy like that you're like oh it's right then it'd be a Penn State fan and then here comes Ohio State they end up winning the game oh I can never forget that one\nIt's a yeah I've I've got a few of them I don't know if you do that but I've I've had a few of them are right now it's not pretty they finally get out of it the red Sox are just going ballistic I mean they're really talking the fans you know the Dodgers troll the red socks on Twitter after game three putting some mouthed about\nYou know obviously about the victory what are you going to learn you just don't poke poke the bear you don't do something like that especially when there's no doubt two games to one Aaron\nYes sir I get distracted because ah the president of the United states just tweeted about this game and I'm not making it up whether you want me to read when he said it's pretty funny I go ahead if I died it in the ... it's a very presidential tone he said watching the Dodgers Red Sox final innings\nIt is amazing how he manager takes out a pitcher who is loose and dominating through almost seven innings\nRich hill of the Dodgers and brings in nervous reliever relievers who get show lack for only gone managers do it all the time big mistake exclamation points so apparently you know I don't know the president wants to call him but he's in uh the tourists camp here about\nUm about a day Roberts in him being blamed for Mr President if you are listening You're welcome to call in we'd be glad to ah talk to you about this because ...\nI agree with our president on or how this bullpen was managed\nMatter of fact why to Donald from last year\n[laughter]\nThat'd be pretty wild member of the day we tried to get Brian on the show does Bryant was tweeting up harmonies I go to know how could you know I'll do any media interview I was like will take you on the show right now and uh we have\nHeard of course but make sure those winds are open and case Donald from Washington doesn't want to call that eight seven seven on Fox ... nine nine six sixty six nine though I got to feel we're not going to hear from dirty Dodger fans are and so obviously when this game gets the third out and then\nThey're going to be calling in droves of questioning day Robert says I Hope they're not going to start the this guy got to get fired routine because\nThat's the furthest thing from the truth I why are they going to start that or what the\nTwo most powerful men in the free world the president and me are calling for his head I mean if if those two voices can't get change I don't know what would\nWrite the real quick go ... and I know we're short on time or did you watch any of the Florida Georgia game and it was kind of a\nA struggle earlier there was a good back and forth gave George ... a a you know a got a bunch of turnovers a Florida just turned it over left and right and then it was too much too late they benefited from that and it was all George Joffe that good victory for them\nYeah absolutely and and I was a little dubious about could Georgia bounce back there were so physically dominated a few weeks ago\nBy LSU but you look at that game and I will say this to Jake from the quarterback making so many plays with his arm if Georgia wants to compete with either Alabama or LSU or whoever they are going to play for an S. U. C. championship\nHe's gotta make plays like that like he did today with his arm and it'll be interesting to see if he can keep that up because by the way they had a huge one with Kentucky next week when there's going to win the SEC\nOklahoma had no problem with Kansas State\nI was Seventeen nothing at the end of the first they rolled Murray was phenomenal a night did it twenty four three fifty two three touchdowns but still not the same classes to about race I Believe uh with you that one is over 'em but still had a phenomenal a\nRun in our ... phenomenal game and by the way how do you decided to play baseball yeah we're expecting him out here in Burlington, Vermont because of that is the single life or what the Oakland A's who drafted the correct\nYeah well I mean I Can't speak to the single a affiliate but now I was going to ask you have you and Planck ever talked to we can maybe get into this and the next hour but how good must ... baseball if that's his better sports than football 'cause he's pretty he's pretty good at football\nYeah no no doubt about while our our quarter back in high school played in the super bowl was one of the topics of baseball time Jay Schrader

melt down I think that's the only word you can use man I really do I don't know how you feel but I think\nIt was a meltdown they had that game and hand ... fell apart yup ... while\nAlready the tweets coming in a four twenty specialist a dozen of the worst part of the world series history\nThey've given away for straight games they they've already given away game five\nCan't listen uh yet because I'm listening to the game still not a Dodger fan just a gambler so I'm obviously he had his money on the Dodgers so oh yeah there you go on that one I look at it is a tough loss you had it within\nYour reach getting the red Sox a lot of credit that's unbelievable I'm hard of a champion they just fight back fight back the two out hits are unbelievable I've never seen too many to out hits that have driven and runs that's that's what would your ball games that's what's going to win the world series\nAbsolutely and looked at the red Sox have been the better team over the course of this World Series but let's be honest even at seven game series the best team doesn't always win and you can go back to those first two games in Boston the red Sox winning both games comfortably\nBut I just look at this one you had it in your hands you were up for nothing that's a game you gotta when you look the the the Dodgers as I said that the show they have the third highest payroll and baseball they they have guys that are capable of getting the job\nIs right now even though the plane at home and against a two and five team um they're still not going to get any law from the batters and that's exactly what happened and that's why they are now weighing like I said the more you're probably looking at three and a half\nOr I could reach Vegas writer at the big moves dot com that's

lead for nothing at one point until the seven thirty in the wheels fell off\n\nBack to\nYour red\nSox radio network that started the onslaught Red Sox scored the next nine runs a ballgame Steve Pearce

[noise] so where I went all the college football that we have [noise] you would think that even without those teams we still have a pretty good weekend but [noise] man you take away that sparked in really went downhill there was nothing for us to really anger out on other than maybe Georgia Florida coming on it and\nYeah and the other thing too is I Know that Florida State was bad last year but usually Florida State Clemens is one of the marquee games and obviously this year it was a total died\nOr some of the other one's Washington state Stanford could have been good at Stanford kind of really fell off the map the last couple of weeks or with two losses in their last three games coming into today and then they actually took a loss as well so\nI get it but I I just think look the bottom line is when Alabama LSU Michigan and Ohio State all have by week I mean it'd be the equivalent of like the rams the chiefs the patriots and the Packers all having to buy or something you just you just feel like a weird weekend in the NFL\nAnd of course the red Sox up three games to one after eight nine ... victory over the Dodgers is going to be one of those signature losses at Dodger fans are going to be talking about\nFor years to come saying man where you had them on the roads were up for nothing we're going to tie the series at two games apiece no doubt we would have one game five and went on to win the world series all of a sudden one inning won three run Homer another Homer ties up and all of a sudden it's three games to one in favor of Boston\nI absolutely think that it is a game that Dodgers fans will talk about forever for all the reasons you just mentioned Arnie I'm your head you're at home you have a chance to tie the series maybe take the lead flip the series on its head on Sunday night they lose so let me ask you this I I ... I mentioned\nDave Roberts I think he's got to go you know you can't you can't let go guys meet\nYou how you Byron some guy that would take you back to back World Series I said this about John for over ... than a year or with the red Sox who took it back to back elites titles are they replaced it with court but obviously that was a good move\nThis is there some day thirst and host of fifth I heart radio podcast twenty three in listening in and I chat with brothers Darren ... Chris of the band computer game and New York times best selling author AJ Jay Gould about how we are all family like it or not a judge\nJudy effect I always hated her then I found out through DNA I'm her like fix says it actually made me switch my perspective I'm like oh cousin to the radio\nClock the whole Glenn raiders take on that San Francisco forty niners\nRaiders neither Thursday at seven thirty eastern on boxing now [noise]\nThis program brought you buy progressive insurance last year over three million drivers sweating to progressive call one eight hundred progress or visit progressive gun come today and find out I mean you could say [noise]\n\nI think everyone ... already fan you hear a mug sports radio of course there as far as the guy go Fox Sports LA studios up at the guy go Fox Sports east coast studios on the border of\nVermont and New York where a lot of the Boston Red Sox fans happened to be Red Sox won at nine six up three games to one Aaron you mentioned that the president said something about the world series game and I guess what all the moves the Dodgers manager made in this one is out is that what you're told me\nHe did yeah he did he tweeted let me see if I can find the tweet really quick because I did invite him on the show via the winter\nOr he Arnold from Washington on line [laughter] real quickie said watching the Dodgers Red Sox final innings it is amazing how the manager takes out a pitcher who is loose in dominating through almost seven innings which heel of the Dodgers and brings in\nNervous relievers who get ... poor run the gone managers do it all the time big mistake exclamation point\nWow well I guess the robbers um has a response to the president um let me hear that ready to ride and what are they just have to say to that\nA map used tuning in in watching the game I don't know how many Dodger games he's watched [noise]\nI don't think he was privy to the conversation [noise] that's one man's opinion\nWow shots fired I'll say\nThis was that that is the first of all was that the NFL analytically correct answer for him to say I'm sure he looked in his binder before he decided to respond voyeur really anti day Roberts nine really are I Am but I Will say this\nListen the president in ... or the president and the bar ball went back and forth there for a solid like two weeks\nI really hope the president ... because the thing because that might be the only saving grace ... from this World Series is say what you want about the president but I Do think there's probably a lot of Dodgers fans who agree with him on this particular evening\nRide or if you want to get an errand underscored tourism ads thinking genius one I'm obviously Dodger fans are going to have to put this behind them and get ready for a game five tomorrow I'm no time to you know cry over spilt milk as they say because you got to bounce back you know and you got to worry about the next game and and of course\nI'm you know you're you can now there's no wiggle room and this one you have to come back and unfortunately they have to go up against Chris cell that is going to be a tough one or to get on by he has been\nLights out for most of uh\nYou know the playoffs now he has had some injuries or during the last month or so ... and ... saw or is it going to be a good match up even though both those are coming with good erase\nWhat what was that injury that he had over the last month\n[noise] um well one of them had to do with his shoulder and I think what'd you say not know the the the belly but Rick I heard that that wasn't a true story I I\nHave to imagine it wasn't true oh yeah say though I I was assuming that uh everyone was on high alert for the belly button over the last week in Boston\nYeah no that that's not a true story but either way um I have to figure that the obviously now Red Sox um the big favorites to win this thing and I think there should be the favorite game five also though probably the ... and will be on that I'll see if I could find that when it comes up one thing I wanted to bring up to you and I'm not going to mention\nThe young man's name I guess I own a as a football team it would have thought about that\nAnd who would have thought we'd be talking about I own a football which we kind of are there's a young man on the I own a football team that's been suspended because he physically\nPunched his coach now we don't know the whole story he's saying that his coach tried to wrestle him to the ground and they got to the ground he wasn't going to let it roll ma'am I'll throw punches on him and hit him so he defended himself\nUp surprises doesn't that put a lot more kids to read the stuff we've seen the going on you know especially in Maryland and stuff like\nThat yeah it up it was a basketball player and a basketball coach but I think the the the\nPoint still stands it's like to eat it but I I'll say this army I don't know man I've seen too many of these stories where a kid claims he was done wrong by the the school the university whatever a coach whatever\nAnd we never get the other side and then when we do get the other side it isn't quite exactly the way that the kid made it out to be and what I found interesting about this was that I guess the kid went before\nA school kind of judiciary board\nAnd they basically said that he was going to be suspended from the school and he's not allowed on campus or through two ... two thousand twenty so because of that somebody at the school found him to be in the wrong but I I'm just I I'll hold opinion until we get the other side of the story\nAll right so that's the way so I didn't know I I I thought it was a football so I didn't even know if I I'm like I didn't even know they had a football team or my Arizona Wildcats scored they're not what they got on the ball team\nSyrup thirty eight\nOver Oregon right now ten thirty left in the third who would have seen this coming Aaron

I mean if I had a couple of beers I feel lousy the next day for the shelf for crying out loud\nNo I'm with you and that was the first thing that stood out to me it was not that they were arrested that not that they skipped out on the bill what are you doing out at four AM right there's only so many things you could be doing it for a year to\nMake your a big part of senator up if you're a big part of the seasons across roads are now you're\nFighting for your playoff life your quarterbacks been bench you went to the AFC Championship last year what the hell are you doing\nI totally agree and I'll

because I was going to say I mean there's some guys that\nI Would think they they they should it be feeling\nToo comfortable yeah you're right to bury church running Harrison DJ hated and Gerald Gerald Wilson\nBut yeah I don't know man I I just think I'm with you is that it's such a bad look on so many levels and the fact that the team is playing so poorly makes it even worse by the way I Would say this last in the shuffle of this jags mess the\nEagles are a mess to man right and and all that about a yeah I was going to say but obviously the focus right now is on the jags and yeah it it feels like I hate to use the cliche that dumb or own is lost that locker room but man oh man there's a lot of knuckleheads doing dumb stuff right and\nWhat else the job on that store yeah I mean you just mentioned you know big big name players are guy you know it's not obviously not a good look what are you doing out for him or Romney Harrison ... like I just mentioned he was one of the guys he was actually their third round pick of this year's draft out of Alabama so you know you don't really have that much of rope as a rookie anyway and you're you're out doing this\nI think they got

download it now [noise]\nFox Sports trendy and\nI'm not crazy not unusual it is so Aaron Rodgers biggest underdog of his career he's never been this big of a dog [noise]\nAnother way to say that I think is marine base never been this bad around them because even though the rams are clearly the best team in the NFL housing the rams are historically good [noise]\nYou know they're rated right about we're a Super Bowl champs typically wind so every given year you're going to have a team that is right around where the rams are correct so the idea that green base played in Super Bowls Green Bay\nObviously gets my Steelers day one and two thousand ten season and no doubt but I is it fair to say that the Packers are the worst team that Aaron Rodgers has ever been surrounded by oh I think so so what are they miss what are the key\nI I mean is it running game as a defense of obviously some combination what are you seeing with his ...\nOh I think it's the deep as we thought that they brought in some guys on the secondary they were supposed to improve and bottom line it just hasn't happened and it's frankly taken a herculean effort from Rogers and the fourth quarter steal games against the bears against the forty niners\nYou might want to know folks Aaron Rodgers has been an underdog of six points four times in his NFL career you for no against the spread in those\nGames yeah six or more so the idea that nine nine and a half year is an old timer that's an I pop or yeah but the idea that in his whole career and Rogers has only been a six point or greater underdog for prior times undefeated ATS\nAnd the other game of great marquee value no this is uh divisional Jamie's two teams met earlier in the year Denver will visit Kansas City another large member the chiefs RJ they played\nSeven foot ball games this year they won six they've covered all seven or ... and ... also handicap this game earlier in the wake of several is\nThis to me is about Denver in one o'clock games and that sounds crazy about one o'clock eastern that's normal\nWell the last time Denver one a one o'clock Eastern Star was over two years ago there oh when six straight up since so usually you wouldn't think so much about one o'clock eastern start for a mountain was a time zone team but the Broncos to remember\nThis is a very popular team that plays a lot of night games so playing at one o'clock eastern unusual for Denver and I think it's a negative clearly for Denver against the chase\nRJ for openers the chief zone seven against the spread is home favorites coming off a home game when they're facing a Pullman opponents coming off of home division game\nThat's a mouthful where yeah I'm not sure how much that means\nYou know I'm not so sure I Know what it means either but it is there but what I wanted to broach with you is this\nI think the day of reckoning is coming we talked earlier about the two thousandths of a New England patriots who started out eight no against the spread they finished using going on at nine at some point when I'm not against the spread that was that famous or infamous two thousand seven patriot team to win a T anyone lost the giants and the super bowl\nAt what point are jade you start to take a look at the professional you're the professional better here at one point you take a look and start to fade the chiefs\n... [noise] you know I I think that game on the further or that question applies to the rams more I think there's a lot of love for the cheese but I also think that there's the the pros see clearly that the cheese defense\nIs a very good and the defense has played better at home Seventeen points per game yielded by the chief at home defensively but the the rams in fact let me ask you Bernie mhm now give you a chance to you know maybe this is one ...\nI got a question for you about a potential back we press the green button here because we do All right I'm going to offer you a bat when we come back but you know you can\nTell us what else is coming I'm all in one of the most best by the way that that someone once said I Want the dreams of a young man with the wisdom of an old man that was Bob Seeger unfortunately that song was called beautiful\nLoser but here's the thing you get that wisdom through clashing with me that they might cut that actually there might be a little tuition\nWill come back and talk about that little bit more about that and St Vikings\nAre but what does it mean when ... says just Fifteen minutes could save you fifty percent or more on car insurance that means you probably should have gone to ... dot com\nFifteen minutes ago he's RJ bell I'm Bernie ... this is the pre game show you always wanted don't go away you're listening to straight out of Vegas\nThen they go to Twitter now okay what's\nGoing on here although I'm fully shrinking political donor here you go\nTo Twitter to it so I Do quite a female running search box sports radio Hamas Fox Sports radio\nBut neither here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we did another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car true car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide image or a of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simpler by experience what do you buy new or use and withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nThere also more likely to enjoy it faster buying experienced by connecting with\nTrue car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car and enjoy it more confident cart by experience some features not available in all states [noise]\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ... designed with exclusive smart like signaling ...

points ... rebounds unit the when I got you guys in Vegas\nThank you Robert boy alright [noise] one thing I think we got to understand about college football it's the sport\nIn which team can get what more than halfway through moving towards two thirds of the way through the season without necessarily playing more than a hand for meaningful gangs\nAnd obviously if it teams I'll eat almost every games meaning for eight they're going to try to win but these packed twelve teams you look at an Oregon and said well we thought they were good 'cause out one game\nAnd now they're getting crushed and I don't think there's any sport\nWhere our biases are some ... or just more plain wrong then in college football and the other reason about under dogs that you think oh this one team is so much better than the other team often times we have no real idea and that's why the dogs I think in all sports\nAre best but especially college football\n[noise] speaking of dogs are home dog the Carolina Panthers now this game started RJ the Panthers has a short favorite in the line has flipped\nBut be aware Cam Newton and company well they're pretty tough at home and earlier in the week you touched on that let's take a listen\nPeople don't realize how good Carolina is at home [noise] they've won ... games at home [noise] twenty six and six straight up at home so to me when you think about the great home field it's not often Carolina being discussed twenty six and six straight up is mighty good for the Panthers at home\nWhere they get it done last week baby in the Carolina Panthers Donald Seventeen to the super bowl champions beat them then we all know the week after you beat the super bowl champs RJ\nNot necessarily strong meanwhile Baltimore smarting after last week what are your thoughts ... do you have a specific trained on the week after you beat the Superbowl champs we talked about it a couple of well yeah I think he was Thirteen I'm forty one something like that again against the number\nYeah and I think especially if you beat them as an underdog which Carolina wasn't that game yes they were\nI I like Caroline a good bit mhm but I'm not bad in it and here's why and this is such an important point I don't think I've ever made this point I straight out of Vegas is a ... like a world premier I don't think we've ever done that before the idea of a concept [noise]\nMore valuable than any video on MTV here's the concept if you like a game\nIt's really tantamount to saying the line is wrong\nBut if you say I want to bet who do you like best Sunday burning you Seattle I sew lines plus three in a line drawn I where do you think the last ... I ... it in the absence of a handicap is the line drawn\nHere's the second part of it though you have to be able to explain why the line is wrong and there's two possible reasons or at least buckets of reasons one you know something the market doesn't\nLet's use an example oh this uh quarterbacks really hurt but I've got an inside info\nThat he's heard a lot worse than people think all they know he's questionable they think he's fine but he's not OK that happens very rarely another way that you try to inside info another way you can be wrong\nOr the like and be wrong is you think there was a factor that's being ignored so it's kind of like something the market started counting for I think in this case is true Detroit is horrible against Iran Seattle has run for a hundred and fifty five you're more the last three games each of the last three\nSo I think the matchups favor yet okay there's one other reason bucket of reasons\nThis is only the second one in six teams to the forty niners wanted six in the last Thirty years to be a road favor [noise] let me say one more time in Thirty years of NFL games\nOr one in six team has been a road favor once before this week so the forty niners being a road favored here is truly historic\nStraight out to Vegas brought you buy discover become a new card number and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar is the first year learn more it discovered dot com\nOr words flash match limitation apply\nYou know bring I keep trying to figure this out we're on six or seven Easter ... three or four Pacific to hunter stations nationwide many many talk twenty mark yes right and we don't have to discover\nAs a sponsor semi you got your when you know why what do you do in the daytime what's your ... will ... put it into work for me so what's your what's your stray job I'm asking a question\nI Am in business development at so somehow you did some special business development here\nYes but do you not also hold the day job paying job yeah square job\nYou've got a square job earning it square [laughter]\nBut I also do have back pain [laughter]\nAll right now the the jaguars or in the news and this is why would like to come you live your knuckle heads a gotten a little trouble a minute I understand they tried to skip out on a bill for players for the Jack ... jaguars we don't know the players who they are\nThey been released to our best understanding that they're now in the confines of the team and the team O'Hanlon internally the line is not the four and a half it's wide open mind as three modest one twenty ... four and a half but again before any of this happened or did you have some perspective on the jaguars in general earlier in the week with stimulus\nJak last three games everyone knows they haven't played well but think about how poorly the jags a play\nHGF means against the spread\nThe HGF margin is how far you either exceeded the spread or fell short you add up the last three ATS margins for the ... that tells you how much have fallen short it's by sixty five points combined against the spread in the last Thirty years\nThere's been only twenty four teams that fall on that short against the spread so this is a less than once a season of current that any team is this bad relative to the Vegas spread over three games you add in our borders and the discontent in the locker room\nI think it's something more than all the jobs are on ... street\nI I actually looked for really to bounce back strong here uh they're angry they blew a Seventeen point lead last week you lose it home the are the super bowl defending champ slipping curse and wants to getting healthier and I would say that since Nineteen eighty Superbowl champs the losing home the following week eighty one sixty five against the spread the following week\nThat's a really significant final thoughts Archie\nYeah you know I think you're right on Bernie friday when it comes to when he came back a little early maybe not earlier than he shouldn't have but he wasn't a hundred percent psychologically minimum\nAnd what we've seen what happened yet conservative if you're not a hundred percent you throw the ball way you don't run in certain spots all the things that differentiate when he's not a pure pocket\nPasser he's fine as a pocket passer but if you look at the yards per attempt which is how far how much a quarterbacks going down the field and how successfully\nBest game of the year was the last game yeah Carolina came back [noise] so you're in Philly last really played mighty good last week now you got jak now you have Jacksonville distracted [noise] I like Billy though it's getting expensive\nIt is getting expensive but I think you can lay of the woods here first of all Jacksonville police

I don't understand what's happening in Minnesota I don't understand what they're doing I guess the team's offering you for first round picks why are you keep holding on it it feels like Tom ... widow can't let it go [noise]\nHe really thinks that he can mend fences and he really thinks he can get through to Jimmy Butler but if you have an opportunity to trade a guy and get that many assets I just think it's a no brainer why they haven't why it hasn't been done\nI'm I'm interested in seeing how it plays out whether it's a trade deadline deal and whatnot but yeah I mean this this is so chaotic there in Minnesota and there's been so many rumors\nAnd reports that have come out of there is I'm a little bit interested so yes yes believe it or not I do care [noise]\nRight for this next one here

the NFL has fired a referee in the middle of the season after missing with the week called a quote unquote blatant false start the league fired Hugo cruise do you care [noise]\nLove it yeah I actually do care about that story only because\nIt feels like that's the NFL trying to to set the tone that nobody's nobody's safe here man if you don't perform you're going to be out of here you're going to get ousted if you don't perform and our league and it just feels like ... if that's the case\nThen why wouldn't you done that with the other\nOfficials at other points that have also made mistakes like if it was that egregious of an air there had to have been something else going on I'm waiting to see what else happens from that story 'cause he's also remember the same league\nWho lost like twenty five percent of their officiating Cruz this off season who just decided to go take other jobs because they didn't want to deal with the hassle anymore [noise] see I Do care because I think there's more to that story that's being let on next\nAll right so the U.S the trades dimitrius Johnson to one and I think for a while dimitrius Johnson was with the the pound for pound\nContender yep yes so do you care John\nI Do ... yeah I Do care and here's why this has never been done in the history of em I may to where you've had to promotions trade fighters never been done now the two fighters dimitrius Johnson was number one pound for pound to your point in the world is one of the all time great fighters he's on believe will but he's really tough to sell\nBecause he's a smaller fighter and he's been so dominant that they couldn't really make a whole lot of money off and then\nAsk her and the guy UFC is getting in return is undefeated at as dominated his weight class for a long time and other promotions and he's already started calling guys out on Twitter I already started picking fights with guys and he's really funny he's a goofy dude\nAnd he's willing to fight anybody at any time and he's a really really really good fighters so I Do care because\nThese are two promotions trading with each other it would be like if the CFL and the NFL made a traitor or if there was an equivalent to somewhere they decided to make a trade it's a big deal it hasn't gotten talked about a lot but it could be the start of something major down the road for mixed martial arts

think he's going to play well I think it wakes them up a little bit I think he locks in I think he's more careful with the football for this week alone because you know he's going to go back to the old Blake ... a week from now or two weeks from now my knocks lock in London is no interceptions for Blake portals against the [noise]\nThe one\nPm eastern time kick off on Fox unlike the first few weeks of the season the issue with the bears recently has not been the often it's been the defense ... has not been a hundred percent since ... his ankle at Miami a couple of weeks ago [noise]\nThere's some real question as to whether or not he's gonna play later on today I Would bet that he doesn't play I Know he wants to but I think that they're going to arrest him because he is not the same player they've dropped him back in the coverage at times he was dropping back into coverage against the patriots\n[noise] even if he does play he's going to be limited later on that's good news for the jets what's not good news for the jets Sam Darnell leads the NFL an interception and the bears are tied for the league leader in interceptions I think that creates a lot of short field potential for the Chicago Bears\nThey've average thirty nine points to a game there last three outings I Love the over forty two and a half and the jets and the bears [noise]\nRaiders coral five eastern time from the outhouse in Oakland it is the Oakland Raiders hosting the Indianapolis Colts this has been a rough week for their car and the raiders bad one man the colds come in as a

coming up all by a week and they're facing a lion steam who's won two in a row but one of them was against ... and the other one was over the Packers and which Mason Crosby melted down like we've never seen a kicker meltdown before\nI was tempted to take Seattle getting the three points if gun to my head if I had to bet somebody in this game I Would take Seattle and\nRussell Wilson coming off the by week but it said I'm going to take the over on total touchdowns for the Seahawks at two and a half [noise] gimme Seattle over two and a half touchdowns in this game and that is this week's

Smith is worth a look see especially in the daily fantasy lead the way that maybe you get a big in out of here mark Ingram getting back into his role at least at the goal line gets into a top twelve\nPosition and Kirk Cousins we celebrate her cousins around here\nOh look he gets he's a punching bag for everybody had a great year man he's if you look at his numbers ... cousins that a damn good year I mean he I don't know his\nFumbling issues are weird though it's a strange thing you have a question about it what like who is the guy the old the old ... there was a Roman Gabriel used a ... yeah and I remember hearing that like uh I forget who told me that yeah ... yeah but he\nIt's it's weird thing her cousin's just always fumble football like he's got an abnormal number of ... but if you look at his numbers\nHe's played really well he played good for for Minnesota yeah both\nFor fantasy and for real purpose is what the defense has been a shell of what was right and he's had to carry this team throughout the season was at the big question for for a lot of fantasy owners and wringing their hands over some smaller shepherds from Stefan dig\nHopefully he'll five major today oh ... that's what I was going to my next question for you my comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside of you've got Adam stealing\nWho is the talk of of every NFL receiver discussion of both in fantasy and in real life because he's going for a record seven straight a hundred yard receiving games I Believe you spent six in a row\nAre looking for a seventh or maybe if it's eight what he's looking for eight yeah I'm so he's he's going\nFor the record and he's been unbelievable when you have somebody like that who's got a record on the line how do you how do you react to that as a fantasy owner because I can understand to two thoughts thoughts here you could say\nOkay I I definitely have to uh play Adam stealing because I Know they're going to try and get on the record but also wouldn't you think that would open up opportunities for somebody else if the saints also know they're going to try and get them the ball well\nThat that's just the right you're looking at the the number of targets rolling through an interpreter cousin he's at that point where he's got to be careful because he's tried to force it into the on a few times the last couple of weeks and and not the record purposes just when you got a guy that you know is going to catch anything are out there which kinda funny 'cause ... digs has a national commercial\nWhere he's got stuff sticking to his hands and people commenting on or so maybe you'll look his way and so he's the top twelve play again this week so I Would expect to see some fireworks to the guy that's been the forgotten man all this\nKind of Rudolph needs a little bit of love too he's he's gone under fed through the first half of the seasons to look for him to get right against the saints or the middle of Eddie that's\nMy comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside of you can get him on Twitter at swollen dome harass him yeah how they're handling it bugged the bleep out of him if you got a fantasy football question at swollen dome is joining us here on Fox Sports radio I'm Aaron Rodgers has never been this big of an underdog\nIn his career at the rams I I think that this is look I I have to bet the Packers just because the value is so great that you can't turn something like that down well last as\nWhat eight and a half I think it was right and eight and a half nine yeah it's a\nIt's a nine points but even with that rams defense I mean from a fantasy perspective who you plan on the Packers outside of Rogers well you get Rogers\nAnd you keep wishing and are you talking about play calling you just keep wondering at some point when Aaron Jones is going to get the ball yeah what's up\nHere it's like every team I played against his disintegrated when they played against me but I think my life is going to run out this week so unless unless Tom Brady throws like seven touchdown passes tomorrow night against the bills rooms just scored a touchdown\nUp and ... as the game was nine and animals ...\nProbably a twenty five yard touchdown pass scores\nCurrently twenty two Thirteen pending\nThe extra point right and if they do and by the way I mentioned at the top of the show you from there were like five games this week we're the lines really moved one of them was this game people were hounding the Packers as eight nine and a half point dog in fact the line went down to seven and a half or seven points\nAnd now they're down ten as the rams\nAttack on the extra points so\nAnother game was the colds and the raiders game this game started as a pick him suddenly all the money one on the colds as maybe a three and a half point favorite the Colts have now taken a seven\nPoint lead so this could be a very tough week for Vegas I mean the raiders at me [laughter]\nBy the way speaking of come back we're talking earlier about comebacks J. D. Y. Adrian Peterson ... what about Andrew Luck I mean today and oh yeah absolutely but who at thirty one three touchdowns marine even play last year\nAnd um you know I had\nFour hundred and sixty ... and they're losing a lot of games but at the same time he is putting up the kind of numbers that we expect a healthy Andrew Luck to put up and he's doing it right now in a coal seen as not very good\nYeah he he's definitely I'm putting them great numbers in the fingers hoping that the him and the coats is the emergence of a running game from Marlon Mac\nThey've never had a running game right whether Andrew Luck and doing more than a drafted Trent abroad and Trent Richard semi right fiasco goodness but it's taken a lot of pressure off ... off of him and he's not having\nTo throw the ball forty five sixty forty five fifty sixty times the game\nHe's right at you know thirty one or temps twenty to completion two thirty nine three touchdown buddies him the ball off thirty four times with two hundred and twelve yard that's\nThe recipe that they need to take some of the pressure off and look and now they're ... they're just got to turn over in the island and the raiders getting ready to go in and score again already of thirty five to twenty eight was born Nineteen left in the fourth quarter\nA in Oakland so it looks like the fourth quarter wolves for Oakland continues I think they've been out scored Seventy eight to thirty two and the fourth quarter and that's the worst point differential in the NFL\nAll right so a again a at a balance of games right now if you decided to go all in on the colds and the Packers the culture looking good there about the up their lead but the Packers seemingly in control and that Rand defense\nHas really shut down the Green Bay attack I I think that if you are looking at the rams right now a is they are more money for you to go in the third quarter so it's not over yet because we seen Aaron Rodgers a weight title games with over the years but if they do at the rams do prevail in this game eight and ... at the halfway point\nAre you still are they the best team are they better than the ... are they better than the patriots are they are better than the saints are certainly can't wait for that gave a preview that the Viking saints game a little bit later on but are they the best\nTeam I Would I Would say so because when you talking about the best team not the best off into the best defense but the best team you see what the rams have in terms of office of weapons\nWith you know would cooks girlie [laughter]\nEveryone a bigger bigger weapons everywhere but then when you talk about defensive well you know you gotta remember O'Keefe leave out he's not even when I went right now but you got Peters you got to sue you got Donald Marron Donnell you exactly\nAnd and so when you stack them up against another team they can do it on both sides of the ball and they're one of the few teams in the NFL they're going to make that an assertion\nBy we mentioned we have a a Sunday night game that could well determine who the second best team in the NFC is right now the Vikings hosting the St saints have not lost since they're opening game what's gonna transpire in that game plus\nA little thing called the world series or curse shark keep the Dodgers all live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios yeah so we got all the answers coming up next week\n[noise] this\nIs a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners are less ... can receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective pick on it airbags and their vehicles\nTo see if your vehicle is included and to file a claim go to auto airbags settlement dot com or call one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nIndeed knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring like finding a unicorn when you post your job on indeed it's easy to find people with the skills you need a nurse practitioner for ... experience acute care certification indeed have the huge pool of amazing candidates and screen or tools that help you find\nYour most qualified applicants and entire shortlist of unicorns see one more than three million companies worldwide using deet to hire poster job it indeed dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site source ...\nThat's when they were helpful\nCan't do it in Florida who's out there who who else would be out there right now think about these teams that have all these young quarterbacks out there's a lot\nOf them obviously wow what the titans me a much better team ... no\nI mean they got there in ... I mean they got they got to figure out how to figure out what's going on to the quarterback position by about the Cleveland Browns would you do it Oh absolutely I don't know if you go to ... the year I mean to get maybe on bill yeah absolutely\nWould he make that much of a difference with a team like Cleveland\nBy the way the rams lead a they got a field goal up their lead to twenty six twenty but there is Aaron Rodgers man he's just got to march right down the field the\nWow tell you about that Aaron Rodgers is something else we were talking about him and put 'em in Detroit right Detroit sophomore staffers got that huge control to more well if you dumped Flaco is contract\nWas I mean that's about to be up anyway so what about the bears you like Howard or you think that the bill would take them ... ... definitely a a great I Do like power to young ...

All right man someone's going to say something about Patrick ... but ah right now yeah the LA Rams are on the move there are only down by one point\nEarlier on today you have the eagles job but on the jaguars twenty four to Eighteen Panthers by Fifteen over the ravens\nAnd we've covered the bangles debacle but they go away and beat the buccaneers by three Seahawks on the road with the lines twenty eight to four team Pittsburgh comes from ought to be the browns thirty three to Eighteen James car two hundred and twelve total yards\nAnd also a pair of scores and Patrick moms for total touchdowns missed one three hundred three yards passing Kansas City thirty Denver twenty three guys got some major league baseball in about\nThirty five forty minutes from now from Los Angeles Dodgers looking to avoid elimination Red Sox and Dodgers David Price versus Clinton Krishna\nThe pitching match up scheduled for eight Fifteen eastern only on Fox where of course the Fox sports ... as well\nTo a girly by the way scored a touchdown and his eleventh straight game lemon straight game I got one better for you yeah every pitch that\nPitch yesterday that the Dodgers gave up and run yes every single one and there were seven pictures you voted out now but here's the amazing thing you're starting pitcher only gave up I hit yeah but at least three Ninety One pitch is yeah but there's a good thing they pulled him out because he said keep an eye on me All right I'll keep an eye on him [noise] I don't get me started\nDon't get me started over focus right now I thank you very much mustard gas gone for a company life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios eases eight fifty percent or more on your car insurance guy go go to guy that I Can't recall\nEight hundred for seven on all the only hard part figuring out which way is easier All right so we got three forty to go\nThe rams are in great position a nice run by ... Gurley as idiot yards rushing eighty one yards receiving that's a hundred and sixty nine yards from scrimmage and his second in ten and again the rams are trailing\nTwenty seven twenty six you know part of what's going on with if you're the rams right now oh you're in a pretty good position but you don't\nYou got to run some clock right All right and you don't want to give the ball back to Aaron Rodgers so a golf scrambles she slides there's a flag could be a whole on the rams\nLet's see if this one's coming back\nA little scramble or inside the tent yard line for golf or waiting for the flag\nAnd they were going there it is pretty much obvious when you had the quarterback suddenly scramble and the flag drops that's probably a whole probably already All right so that's going to move the rams back but that's not necessarily bad for the rams again there are only download point obviously and feel gold position that means they'll probably run a little more\nClock right now the only thing that would make me feel good about running clock as if it has zero\nOr with Aaron Rodgers [laughter] I mean I mean how many hail man he's the king and they'll marry the king of the hill I mean nobody throws the better Hail Mary so will the rents are back up to the twenty three yard line second in twenty three and a half minutes to go in this game and the rams are trailing by one and they are running\nAs no surprise that all round the clock down some more talk girlie continued to pile up the yards um\nSo when I when I get back to the saints Vikings game anybody in the ... or a bar in the injuries or anything else is this team basically take it into the super bowl been a ticket but they have a good shot the um\nIs there and and I mean last year they lost at home in their first playoff game is chalk that up to inexperienced but is there anything you could see the ... I mean look potentially they might have to face a\nAn Aaron Rodgers or you know uh Drew Brees or something like that in the first round again the games will be at the coliseum most likely I third in sixteen or right now\nAnd they're running the ball so that's what they're doing they're killing clock or just a part of the game I don't like but again there's two forty to go on you know my plan for fuel goes well you and especially\nWhen you're going to give two minutes of the very least I'm Aaron Rodgers and ... on on like that what happened what happened why ... I mean does he understand that Aaron Rodgers on the other team\nYou're going to give Aaron Rodgers at least two minutes or wouldn't do this for all he needs is a field goal to win the game I Would I Would have gone for the end zone\nAll right so the rams are attempting a forty three yard field goal again the clock is ticking down to the two minute warning to kick is good so the ramp steak eight twenty nine twenty seven laid there is too old five which is even better for the Packers is going to get a added\nA bonus of the time and it was happening with the forty niners\nOh my goodness\nOver beds map [laughter]\nIt is over so the Arizona Cardinals are too and the forty niners\nAnd oh it's six against everyone else races for Larry Fitzgerald like they just won the super bowl yeah that's what it feels like so Josh Rosen on that that was an oppressive come from behind when\nThe touchdown pass was right on the money so the Arizona Cardinals there was another game the forty niners we mentioned uh were favored on the road is a one in six team did not look at that's now are you kidding me\nWhat the heck is that CJ better running for his life and just threw it away\n[laughter] um if if you have a center that football and here's what people don't understand see we we watch these bad plays and you know guys making mistakes and everything else\nBut you spent Thirteen Years in the NFL in the film room with your coaches reviewing bad place how's the play like that covered by the offensive line cook goes crazy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Tampa", "day": "28"}
