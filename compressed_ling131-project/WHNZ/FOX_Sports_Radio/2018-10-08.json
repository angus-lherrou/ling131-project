[noise] download it now [noise]\nFox Sports trend being\nOr you're not really protected right you're going forward guys are going to be you know\nBasically basically a Spiro Agnew or ... or ... coming down in a in a direction with or download angle and all that so that's part of the reason I think the other thing is you're paying a running back now for most of these teams make him on some of that money is what you're paying a quarterback he's there to throw the football not run it\nBut doesn't it feels like the shortest distance though to get to the to the line is to the line you need to get you to get a first down would just be that quarterback sneak\nAnd then you were saying that they just this certain way that they gain planet like the thing that kills me is when you and I'm sure you see discovering college football as much as you do it will be forced into fourth in one third and one and a quarter backs in shock on\nI mean I it just it feels counterproductive to me and again I'm throwing at you because you've forgotten more about football than anybody listening in the show is except for me you've forgotten more football than anybody listening to show even as ever known it just feels counterproductive and I don't know if that's\nMe just still reeling from James Franklin decision or are looking at the patriots always have success with it or seeing the rams the you know seal a game up against the Seattle Seahawks in Seattle by using a quarterback snake\nI I don't know I Can't explain it to you because it's no different than it being you know force than one or thirty one and then being in shock and wanting to play\nBut also at the end the games I mean teams to Syria game will stay in shock John five yards back in the middle of football um and that has everything to do with the fact that they just haven't taken a lot of snaps from under center and that is something that can be risky if you don't do it\nUm so it you know there there's a risk reward there especially when you just try to seal the game so that's some of the logic to it\nBecause especially in the goal line and when you know going to run a quarterback sneak\nThe centers going to cut a position of self a little bit lower like his paths are going to be even lower from that standpoint\nAnd when he snaps the football he's you know really lunging out it so it becomes a different snapped in what you're normally accustomed to the ball handling it'd\nBe an issue when you've been in victory formation did you ever almost ... or actually fumbled the bond victory formation I Would be paranoid as hell about doing that\nNo but what you do is you basically just take the snapping or need out as fast as possible and then that way it kind of eliminates any hesitation of of whether or not you did 'cause everyone's just looking for your need out okay good\nAnd then what are our de Lima trying to slap the ball out of the centers hand trying to make him\nYeah they'll do things that kind of distract them a lot of times what you see at that point the game is a opponents wore bark out your cadence and try to get you to jump or they'll try to you know swipe at a face try to swipe at the hands snapping the football um those sorts of things\nThat this might be the most informative segment we've ever done to open up the show and I hope they will to inform but at the I think it's going to look man I it's not every day you can turn on a sports radio show and you can hear about how long the ... theme is for the center of the Seattle Seahawks like that is informative by the way thirty and she didn't seem\nThat that's not very long no I mean now no but I think a lot of us deal with that especially when it gets colder\n[laughter] ... Fox Sports radio comedy live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios coming up next we have got ourselves a an interesting little match up right there is an interesting matchup\nBetween a couple of teams one that I don't think is very good find out who we are talking about next nine of us are\nWhether you get us on Facebook on Fox Sports radio dot com\nOr if you could just to see it on your radio\nImagined that work in\nOf sports do you\nFox Sports radio\nIf you need anything from a simple home repairs to a major ... you need to know about home advisor isn't totally free service they instantly connected with top local service from\n... is a very easy way to find a home contractor and for me it's the only way\nYou can either for everything your house cleaning European hang electricians farmers handyman we've had nothing\nEvery single time just to let the type of working these on and home advisors pro find our technology instantly fines top pros and your area you can read customer reviews of the ... even ... guide to find out what hundreds of other repairing improvement project costs in your area\nI think everybody should have either in fact I tell everybody jeeze I'm In my home advisors a total solution to any type of work you would ever want to do around your house and best of all it's completely\nYou what though that he's he's athletic like I I think he's\nI go back to the game and just I I Can't understand how Sean McDermott couldn't see his athleticism his arm and everything that he brings that see him and say look at a roster look at our quarterbacks this guy gives us by far and away the best chance with\nWhat we have ... says he does have a track record at this point and not being able to figure out the quarterback position you know but as soon as you want to figure out defense I mean the windows low scoring games especially at home and that or if you're going to hold\nHold field advantage and you could win seven eight games at home here and it's still with you on the roads your journey contending for the playoffs every year they were wildcard team last year so basically Sean McDermott is rex Ryan without the foot fetish or the monster truck is what you're saying a guy he knows his defense but can't coach quarterback\nYeah [laughter] I I Would put it more she doesn't seem to be as as exotic as a as rex Ryan and it's just that the fed not office\nYeah uh All right uh about a lot of exotic woods he did he definitely did a lot of a lot about ...

national league division series where the Dodgers in Braves are scored listen to the bottom of the second inning the Dodgers lead the series two games to none in game three of the other end of the as the brewers led the Rockies six nothing with two out on the bottom line\nHere come head or\nOff her mother\nFor Mr baseball Bobby you could call on WGM Jay Milwaukee host gain one of the NFC ass on friday in the NFL Brett moderate just kick the twenty Seventy yard field goal to give the cowboys are three nothing lead of the Texas five minutes in\nSet up by a forty three yard pastoral jak Prescott\nTo Jeff sway in the lake games the rams won at Seattle thirty three thirty one the rams first five of those start this two thousand one the Vikings with a twenty three Twenty one victory in Philadelphia chargers over the raiders twenty six to ten the cardinals got their first when the forty niners to what the aid to Eighteen\nIn the early games the Panthers beat the giants thirty three thirty one on grand pianos sixty three yard field goal at the gun\nThe chiefs improved to five at all with a thirty to fourteen victory over the jaguars lions over the Packers thirty one twenty three\nGreen Bay kicker Mason Crosby missed four field goals plus an extra point the browns have proved to to to add one with the twelve nine overtime win over the ravens Isaiah ... ran for a franchise record to Nineteen and the jets thirty for sixteen whatever the Broncos\nThe Bengals would you pick six is at a twenty seven Seventeen whatever the dolphins Cincinnati sports one Steelers blew out the falcons forty one to Seventeen Atlanta now one and four\nAnd Stephen ... forty six yard field goal the gun gave the bills of Thirteen to twelve victory over the titans Jonas inbreeding back to you thanks ILO a company you live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to save\nFifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy go comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part is figuring out which way is easier\nSo I'm really couldn't listen I don't want to be a damper and I don't want to be so negative this early in the show does that's not worry about here we're ... we're not an optimism yes wholesome family friendly radio on a Sunday night look there the families are gathered around\nIt starting to get a little chilly outside yeah the leaves are turning colors and ... and they're listening to sports talk radio going and we love Jonas and radiate so safe\nBut I Do think it is time to uh\nBut you know it's [laughter]\nWhen I found I found\n\nOut and around and high above\nOn the twenty Eighteen Atlanta Falcons because it is over it is over ... by\nBy sigh in our uh adios peace or as my friends would say do says that's a wrap on this he's already [laughter]\nI don't see anybody says do this anymore Joe no\nNo no no ... trust me people still say do\nThis and they say ... what about this they say who knows our trade say trays anymore either do that\nYou had to be here with a joke [noise] okay have you with um let's just move on because I don't think anyone would give you know find a way it's not that this is a bad start to the show it's just sort of all over the place have you noticed that not only are best half hour\nBut that's kind of how we are but it's how we operate something tells me you're um you you got gas gone out in the parking lot or something [laughter]\nSomebody tells me that you might have caught the double and flew last night uh that when it went down\nWith doctors are doctors pat ... yeah the doubling flu no doctors pat and Jake uh over in uh that's that's a well we'll save that for Rick I'm back to what we're yes the Atlanta Falcons their season is over they stink done\nUh I I'm not going to say they stink every one half their football team is actually pretty good that they're often um but it's sort of defense or they're just so bad and I think in that division when you look at Carolina now who wants today you look at New Orleans they they seem they are having you know getting things together again playing better defense we all know\nHow good breezes and everything else like I just I look at them and say I I just I don't think the season's going to work out too well for them because the un Jones gentle Neal Ricardo and those guys are coming back which is not coming back anytime soon and they probably need all three of them to come back at this point\nSo it's it's really going to rely heavily on the fence we're from we're witnessing or right now\nYeah ... it's ...\nIt's like they're often can't overcome what they're missing on defense\nAnd I think that they end up until this game on Sunday where Pittsburg just put it on them up until this game they were in every single game or probably should have won every single game I mean if you look at the the close call against the saints if you look at uh Cincinnati coming back and beating among the last second if you look at that final\nDrive in and red zone sequence against the eagles in week one like you can make a case that Atlanta should be undefeated\nYou see the ... that it was before this past week's lawsuit Pittsburgh they were the first well I should say first name so genes that scores thirty six plus points okay at home and didn't turn the football over in NFL history of four hundred and two and four and the Atlanta Falcons are two of those for long [laughter]\nWhen I was\nThursday on by [noise] [noise]\nThere's a better way to buy home insurance with progressive new home\nCome in at great great poll on line for yourself how much you could say progressive ...\nMe is brandy ... I'm Joan is not this is Fox Sports radio I coming up here momentarily we are going to talk about what a liar ... [noise]\nI'll explain here I was confirmed after a game on Sunday so we'll get to that here momentarily do an update\nYou on the Sunday Night Football game of the week it is the Dallas Cowboys with these six nothing lead over the Houston Texans first quarter winding down a ... it should probably be a little bit worse than this wouldn't you say Brady jak Prescott looks like at least finding some success or down the field but then they get close and they just can't figure it out in the red zone\nRight uh and that's you know kind of how he had a ... that's how college football it's cut out the NFL's becoming a little bit um with these off put have so many points and the advantage of uh the officers have with the legal contact the points of emphasis and then the uh you know the rule changes and all that but\nIt's it's funny like this is a private she probably should be fourteen nothing right now but uh you know at this large part due to the fact that the reds and we talked about what the Texans just don't want to point man defense or they don't want the man which is kind of a kind of interesting because it used to be a lot better than the secondary and then they've just somehow gotten got off all over the past a\nLost four games so what do you mean they have the honey badger now\nRight that's done nothing for the three years ago it was all about the fact they didn't have a quarterback but everything else was there yeah they had a piece never bad timing man right and then that literally they were one of the best\nPast defense is Jay Jay ... have you on cloudy and back when the ... J boy a and and all that now it's like they cannot stop anyone I mean jak Prescott he was\nHe was the average like a hundred and eighty hundred and Seventy or the game he he'll probably for like three hundred yards tonight\nYeah it's uh so I mean early on at least we got a good football game at least we're getting a good one you know it's not like that that crummy game we got last week where Pittsburg no showed especially in the second half\nAnd it was awful football so at least we've got a good one so we'll be monitoring that throughout the course of the show are Brady Quinn 'em by the way real quick so you've got a somebody recognize you I'm I'm here reports already recognized you this past week or a brand and they ... they recognize you for a specific reason do hell Brady Quinn what\nHow will I Will so I I took my whole family up to do a new house did Indiana game and so I'm I'm at the airport with my wife\nAnd our two daughters which is chaotic right so all I'm thinking is get to the plane get on the plane don't piss anyone off on the plane and then get off and get your destination like that's all I care about and then hope we don't get scrapped on which we now and then which is very high possibility\nSo we're going through security and we're about ready to walk the line and I think I was grabbing something or I was like picking up slowing our oldest daughter\nAnd um I noticed someone's idle Alicia and then a guy approaches me says hey you're British Clinton right and I just yeah it goes I Love you and Joe ... that's what I heard right and so I'm thinking like oh OK thanks she's like yeah it was because every Sunday night and I was like oh he's\nOn his\nShoulders I Love your show [noise] and I was like I got I got to be honest the for the first time I've got to recognize that been what they've\nSaid oh that individual is listening out there tonight but ah yeah he likes to show 'em he you really didn't go in and you know go in depth about what he likes ah try to do is I I couldn't answer that question um but I also real so I'd like to rush through\nA series listen meant what look I've always told us eight so to describe your show what your show like well you know like it took a colds or just pops up every once in a while know what I mean\nI Know idea because I don't get colds or um but yeah I guess for people who maybe that's not ... well not a good thing though when they pop up\nI'm no I've as I ...

a great opportunity this happen it being a shorter week\nAlthough that present the chance for them to kind of put this past them and they are playing at home we talked about that the Home Depot advantage with football so I\nI'll I'll put it this way\nI don't think we get past October twenty second in Atlanta for Monday nights [laughter]\nWhich we personally football Monday Night football at some point he's going to go off\nIf you lived many can't pick up a hill is play and just to go back to kind of the doubt feel drawing look it's hard to do when you don't have good protection and that has been the case and now the un protection\nI mean did they even rush for over six yards today and I look I don't care a lot of defense is good\nBut come on man I mean at some point this season you've got to be able to put up you know better numbers running the football is more consistent numbers I'll put it that way\nBecause they've had you know times that had been over a hundred yards and then they've had thirty five yards and then over a hundred yards and sixty five yards like it's just it's constantly back and forth back and forth\nAnd and today now I Want to say it's like the second time second week in a row they've been well below a hundred yards it just goes back to the initial conversation of you took the call Berkeley He was supposed to solve all your problems if that's what you thought that you were sorely mistaken in the first was\nA patch or I'm right now is probably thinking oh so yeah a little different than coach in ah in Cleveland\nIs this a lot different like he's going to get hammered by the media I mean that's not going to cover man if you look if you're covering sports you don't want ate and ate and boring you want one and fire you want a diaper fire or you want a Super Bowl contender those are the ones you want to cover that's the most fun\nBut uh yeah yeah I mean like the fact that it's a New York's probably the best part I bet they took this job though with the thought by the U.S got a year\nAnd then after a year they can kind of figure out what they want to do the problem is is the quarterback class for next year if they're going to pick a

football players are like oh gosh ... baseball's on like they're not sworn they're going to watch football people were in our space for going to watch baseball I don't know why you feel like it's the same body\nLook I watch it all man I watch it all\nI Do so I mean you're degenerate gamblers okay you know what that is offensive and its factual when I'm sick of it All right so let me ask you this break when\nSo this is not a conspiracy theory but I Do wonder this because I Love picking your brain when it comes to the psychology of quarterback ... last week Brady broke down with the quarterback walk is one of the most bizarre descriptions I've ever heard of my life I felt like you were describing Encino Man like somebody waking up in a block\nOf ice in with somebody who will be by the way it's not that great a branch of the British or most of the actors so far it's it's not that great of a move faster guitars and it was just he was in ... poly shoring him eating microwave ... seven eleven and it's not that good of a movie you see no man stinks I'm Sorry I\nJust I think\nThere's a man like re watched that movie and then come back and watch the tape and then tell me how good that was it was\nAwful but if it's on right now I watch it um and you would probably watch it over baseball uh but [laughter] so let me so let me just say this\nSo Aaron Rodgers when I'm when I'm watching the Packers and you're seeing them compared to Kansas City and the rams or even the bears a week ago or even some of these raider games um that we've seen not the one that we saw earlier\nBut you're just looking at other teams the Steelers and you're watching these other teams and they're putting up these huge point totals\nAnd they're they're doing these these Rasul dazzled plays and they're sending a mismatch isn't all the play calling all that you didn't Rogers\nWe've got great news there is a quick way you could save money switch the guy to go to guy could I comment and Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance ten minutes from now top up next our a\nSneaky big move in the world a football was just made right a sneaky big move that's got a lot of layers to it including an NFL\nAndy college football aspects of ten minutes from now\nWe'll have the latest on that move that just went down in the world the football I don't go anywhere how's effort to ease huh that was a unbelievable he's leaving for you and you're good enough then they'll fill ten minutes from now just stick around everybody or for whatever reason your local affiliate makes a mistake and switches over to something else find this on the eye heart radio Fox Sports radio\nSite um so I got to ask you real quick before we hear from my bet Jesus or not that I control them or anything you just shows up when he pleases buttons yeah so the Houston Texans\nSo they're up ten to six on Sunday Night Football the first half was winding down and the Houston Texans have the ball the one yard line at the Dallas Cowboy one yard line as they are approaching halftime so so they're getting in to position\nTo try and scored a touchdown up tend to six already\nAnd for whatever reason below Bryan calls to play the Sean watching missed as a back out of the flat or who may have been covered the Sean watching then takes off with the football after they go forward on fourth down\nAnd gets obliterated by Jay Lynn Smith who made a fantastic ... met the guy from Notre Dame who suffered the unfortunate injury in the fiesta bowl a couple of years ago and so the Houston Texans turned the ball over on downs and the Dallas Cowboys get the football back on the one yard line\nUm what did you make it a play called and how much of this was below Brian getting crushed last week for taking the field goal and accepting a tie and his game against the Indianapolis Colts before Frank right given the when yeah I\nI don't know if that had anything to do is I I just think he probably thought there was going to be a good chance they were gonna be able to get it in right um there there were I mean it was ... maybe a foot or so is all they needed and I'm not necessarily play card thought hell of a play by by Jill Smith\nUm who looks like he's you know back to his old self back to the play we saw before the tragic and during the festival but um yeah\nI I don't I don't think coaches in those moments\nHave that kind of thought process because just as a player you don't either you know it's not like you go to the last week this is what we did and you know worked out but we weren't as aggressive we need to know aggressive this week I I don't think it works like that\nI think you look at it as saying come on man is the first half were up a word home what's go for this thing well let's go for punching and before you go into halftime and\nThe other thing is you know there's no ... you don't get it of them coming back at that moment because there's not much time left the half and they might be getting the ball coming out of half who started off the football game to the Dallas or the football yes\nSo usually that's what we talking about you say you want to double up there trying to get points there to end it and points coming out of half time and maybe they felt like it'd be more of a statement that they got a touchdown and then a touchdown out of it now you're looking at a forty point swing in the game [noise] nobody\nAll my [noise] my the lightning Jesus [noise] good God brain that was a big one [noise]\nEnlightening to unbelievable uh All right so the lights are completely pitch black in the studio um I Can't see anything all the TVs are out now that we could see those to begin with\nI'm there now that the computer light is out of their their the cars the ball stopped traffic has stopped momentarily it's almost frozen in time right now outside the studio and into the studio comes a beaming light\nShining down on the desk it is it is shining it is it is a glaring my eyes I Can't see anything except a piece of paper that it's falling down on top of me Brady is raining on me right now this piece of paper I Will open it up here on the air so you know this is not a radio bit here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nIt is tonight on the seventh day of October twenty Eighteen that I live that Jesus proclaimed me pick to be a\nCowboys plus five and a half so there is rainy cowboy Sunday Night Football are you happy\nNow you know they're going to lose all come on man say\nOkay Ben Mather here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot

zero call now eight hundred six Seventy two Ninety three for\nThis weekend with more helpful\nYou can listen to our for our radio ads [noise] downloaded [noise]\nYou have complete autonomy of who you recruit what you recruit how your team looks what the culture is I mean urban Meyer is the highest paid public employee in the state of Ohio you don't think you can do what he wants to with that program and how he wants to build our next saving for that matter with with Alabama\nYeah I mean there ... ... exactly and so it's it's hard then to want to leave that [noise] and now you have to go work for a guy who was a billionaire who's telling you what to do it probably doesn't have any clue especially with a track record of head coach is going to Cleveland\nSo that that's the tough part about that place Dallas different story different story because it is Dallas citizens stone that decided the helmet and you know given that\nLincoln Riley hails from a you know I just want the Texas Tech a given all those ties it'd be hard to pass up man I mean it would be really really hard to pass up that opportunity\nAnd there's also you can say whatever you want to buy Jerry Jones and he's a little kooky and he's kind of out of it when he goes on these local radio interviews and he says some crazy things but you know what he is he's a loyal guy and he's probably one of the more loyal owners in the NFL because a lot of teams would have already fired Jason Garrett by no\nHe didn't and he stayed with him so I it to your point if I'm choosing between Dallas and I'm choosing between Cleveland\nThat's gotta be heavy consideration thinking All right how quick is the trigger here I mean how like well how long is the leash on my job because if you bring them into Cleveland it's because\nYou've made the investment and Baker may field and you think that guy can get the most out of Baker may feel because he coached them for ... you know for so long in ... at the college ranks but then you've got to deal with everything that comes with Cleveland so yeah I Do think it's an interesting an interesting ah predicament for him to be\nYeah and but like hearing that he is that well thought of from Albert ... have you heard the same things that people have talked about Lincoln Riley and said this guy's on another level\nYes and now from Albert career I'm a ... not so much says on another level I mean look\nAt it to be honest it gets kind of like the hype right now fashionable homes every the quarterback and yeah ... ... ... it's not that it's copycat league it's just that we're like blowing everything up and we don't see them on a greater sample size that he's been the head coach now at Oklahoma for two years\nAnd this is a program that in some ways you could make the case All right it wasn't that hard to to keep it running at its highest level because Bob students gave it to gave this fine you know well oiled machine to you\nSo all you had to do is plugging in play and not mess it up and there's some people would say that it's hard to keep it at that level right I mean look at wind day for example the first three weeks at Ohio State ... urban Meyer couldn't be around that seem and all that\nWell oiled machine that worked out pretty well doesn't it yeah so um you know you don't know really what you're getting with with Lincoln Riley on a bigger scale because he hasn't been a head coach for that long\nI mean so there's a big risk and that I I Know you can make the case for shouting out there\nBut look there's a lot of other examples of young inexperienced had coaches who do get those opportunities that don't work out Yeah John just did not think about him well and Josh look he's a office of mind it's extremely bright and he'll get another opportunity rightfully so right yeah um but it it's like what's just pump the brakes you kind of see how things work out\nOver the long term and and in this case let's do this year ends up with them 'cause look\nThe other thing is who's going to be there to ... ... ... um assist had coach you could potentially be that for the for Oklahoma to kiss shoes alive backers coach he could maybe be that he's he's been to D.C in the past and then carry cooks is technically the assistant sets coordinator so\nMaybe he takes over the interim um because he's got that title but we're all still end up picking\nA breeding ... Knox Fox Sports radio a couple of your life here from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios coming up next\nThere is going to be a major change at quarterback for one of the more preeminent franchises in

boosting formula is powered by testifying a patented key ingredient clinically research to help 'em an feel stronger leaner more energetic and more passionate\nAnd guy [noise] shit like that this is two\nA very well I forgot his first year starting so NFL people will love that because they love the upside they love the fact that he's already planning this well early on that feel like they can continue to help shape and the mould him\nAt the next level or Clinton ... set a big win this past weekend over Michigan State he's the quarterback at Northwestern\nHe's the guy that you'll hear a good amount about ah in that regard uh Ryan Finley is the quarterback NC State their top twenty five in right now and defeated had employed anyone but\nHe's another guy you're kind of hear a decent amount about um as as we had an extra trapped in a shape Paterson's another guy quarterback from Michigan\nYou know you might hear some people talk about so that ... there's a bunch of names for you I don't know that anyone necessarily really jumps out because\nThe most impressive or players in next year's chapter all going to be defensive linemen and those are going to be the stuff that you see a probably taken off the board first unless there is no quarterback if someone falls in love with it as a big time need for\nA but that's the tough part I think right now at least if if your a giants fan is that that's what you're looking at\nI mean he can't okay so say you draft the guy and he's a project\nAnd he's somebody that that's going to need a little bit of time and you draft him who knows maybe early second round if they decide they want to go on a different direction and the first round does Eli Manning have another year that he can give you while you try and develop a quarterback because then we're approaching year three for ... and it already looks like this is the last year\nIt just it it feels like maybe they miss this one man like maybe this past rap was the draft to do it and you went was take one Barclay it feels like that was their opportunity to at least provide some hope with a brand new head coach instead they went with the same guy to be loyal and it just isn't working anymore he can't do the things\nThat are necessary to to to really maximize ... talent in and there are there is weapons on that team they do have talent on that often said just feels like they miss this one like like looking back maybe they should have gone to quarterback and set of St Louis Barkley\nI think so only from the aspect of it if you feel like you really love the one of those guys and maybe they did\nI mean look maybe they didn't maybe patched overlooked and said I don't feel like we should spend a number two overall pick on any of these quarterbacks I Know it's hard early on right now looking at it because they've looked pretty darn good but um maybe maybe that's how they felt\nFelt like steak on ... you could come in and give them an impact and they still feel like you I made it could play at a high level but I think this year so far and it's still early but it's been pretty revealing I mean it's just he's not going to be able to be the same type of quarterback unless things change dramatically\nOr you know quickly and I will say this the last thing just on the subject look\nAnytime you're working with a coordinator I Know pat Sherman runs west coast it's probably similar terminology to what he had been that McAteer before that [noise] it's tough it's tough for everyone to get on the same page everyone to get involved I think you could make a lot of cases\nLooking at teams this year that are struggling to offensive Lee and have had a change as as their play color or change that position and dealing with that so always keep that in mind like you're not going to see those dividends paid off to the second half the season\nTied so quick answer one answer one quarterback in college who you think makes the most sense for a patch or more often in New York to be the future of the giants\n[noise] ah one guy [noise] it's it's tough because I haven't been able to really like watch these guys on tape enough to get a good feeling what\nMost people do man don't research it just talk to your you know one guy [laughter]\n[noise] um I drew lock probably at this point um that they have the quarter back out of a ... but again that's that's just based on watching a sling the football around a little bit um and if that's what ... wants to do I mean he be the guy could throw into that conversation ...\nFox Sports radio I'm Still trying to figure out how that is not running the pastor and genuine\nFootball what I just saw oh unbelievable I'm All right so um I find that on the Internet find out Jay Jay watch it on on that jak

yours in the NFL right yeah his number two interceptions\nThese numbers Seventy six than touchdowns isn't that kind of weird it is it doesn't make any sense to me his forty three career touched our forty three forty three touchdowns a hundred games\nBut you've literally he's like the best ever and yards and reception\nAnd I and I could understand if it was one of these situations where he's all day God's you just double team that guy and other guys get touchdowns but they've got other players there like there's a lot of town on that team and for whatever reason they just can't can act in the end\nOf their deep I mean you've got a long long roster you know\nWe got this week right out of that quickly or the one we all over again on Monday she says Monday Night guys a Redskins at St so right so we're going to set the over under at four hundred and Ninety nine and a half\nFor career touchdowns by Drew Brees right so we call for Ninety six going into the game five hundreds of miles stone so

Michigan you beat Stanford you went into Blacksburg and you beat Virginia Tech the team who was beaten by Old Dominion I told you that it's going to happen Notre Dame is going to the college football playoff they're back baby ... how do you feel [noise]\nI feel good about the victory this past week\nI I don't I don't think their their work is done what everyone thinks they're scheduled looks easy because they don't have another ranked opponent as of right now they're scheduled\nUSC we'll be right by the end of the season when they play them at their place in northwestern tricky at Northwestern is very tricky they just be Michigan State you could ask them about that [noise] it looks Syracuse isn't easy you saw them go toe to toe with clubs and and I was upset him for a second year in a

I I Know it wasn't his fault today but I'm starting to buy that and maybe there's a little friction there so I think you could throw Green Bay slash Mason Crosby on there today\nI Know yeah and I'm about what that also but I mean would you say there's a little friction going on\nWhat more do you want I mean Roger's threw the ball fifty two times I knew I\nWas twenty four nothing at that time I\nI understand that what exactly do you want um you know that at all but I go to this that and you know what is interesting I picked up\nUm there was a critical for top play for the browns and they said and I saw a Jackson go just go for just go forth and Baker Mayfield look this is the place ... they run the plight\nHow come he gets to pick the play but they're still call it it is for Rogers and he has to wait to hear it to see what they're calling for them and that doesn't sound right you know this is not right about that\nOkay I Love you already because at this 'cause it's not right that's because taught Haley is on his microphone in his ear telling him what play off his wrist bay and that he needs to call them they need to execute bakers not calling his own place I\nThought it was certainly look like he was calling himself on that worked out play I don't know maybe I Am not because\nHe was saying I Am calling this book is jak to what's called jacks it just looks like he's a guy that that's a good seat I don't think he does but\nOther than that I see I I just think sometimes we don't go that just today I just hear because I got a free press pass up you know my my my mother in law's really run into the but I don't know it just seems like as a good seat for the game\nI I Will say this I Will say this\nWhen they had that issue on forts down and I think it was in overtime when they didn't get a pass interference call and I did yeah I I get it that it was an illegal contact and I want to catch up all the ... that's what they said that they didn't do the flag but I when he didn't lose his mind I think\nWe always joke on the show about there's a time\nTo go you know that regardless when whatever happens in your life something will be sad or something will happen it's like I got to throw hands here that's a moment where as huge acting\nAs the head coach at the Cleveland Browns Arnie you got to lose your mind right you got to show your guys you're invested in that and that that to me was a moment of stood out they still found a way to pull it off but I I don't think Baker Mayfield has more freedom as a rookie with the browns\nThat Aaron Rodgers does what the Packers does he\nTake away that rookie of the year trophy it MVP trophy for him also just going to keep it on to the side just for a little bit for for just a couple of board games Chris can we just do that can you do me a favor on that please\nIf I Would have taken a if I would've given you the over one win for the browns you might have taken the under a and I don't know man I think he should win the MVP already [laughter]\nNo you're right you're right just like we did with that Sam ... early on just like we did a oh my God what are you going to get it back now after what happened today starts to be out of\n... we ... we always been this I mean I Know you and I knee jerk yet we're literally right after the games we don't have time to sit here and think about it these people that have like twenty four hours after the game I think about it and they're still knee jerk and every single week come on guys\nAren't so are those are that's one of the teams that I Would I Would add the Packers but the second team is the team why thinks a coach is on the hottest seat\nAnd will die more in depth to the Denver Broncos next hour here from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios

Texas game you were like the only one\nSo which was very odd for me on Saturday or not if what if I start fighting with someone there on the sidelines when Twitter you're not going to win so get back to tonight dads doing\nSo on Twitter I don't get does he does he think for some reason that there might be an owner that I don't know John crews can look at and say oh man that's just really upset and others were the only way to design them\nI didn't know that didn't have a team yet I totally forgot about that I read his Twitter remarks I maybe we have about gotten signing him\nTo make that joke I'm starting to really really worry about how untouched John grew news of the game [laughter]\nI'm telling you what your turn to God I don't know if this was quick or not or any I did live through that you're Marcus Russell era I'm thinking about next week if they get destroyed by Seattle like they did this past week or today or by the chargers I'm thinking about retiring as a raider fan we can all rest garments going to retire\nI don't know if I can or not I think it'd be too hard to tell me like uh chief's fan I think I'm just going to become a red zone channel than I think I'm just not going to have a team and I'm just going to watch the red zone and play fantasy football and come on here and just spit hot takes every single Sunday night and I'm going to\nFire everyone out to one last and I'm going to I'm going to elevate someone to an end BP after two good games and just uh I don't know bureau media guy from here on out the building they use the president I don't think you could stop being a raider fan it's you're probably right black and silver\nBut a ... it's also I think it's killing me\nOh whatever take years off your wife like dog years you'll every year you root for the raiders takes like three years off your life\nAlready okay I can tell the story now it's it's it's past midnight yeah it was I was sitting in my living room and I I was watching the game and

bad for you there to everybody can only gonna get worse too\nWell no no in are you kidding me can only go up from here thinking about this I'm being serious Arnie or this isn't a joke\nEverything that could have gone wrong in my sports world went wrong this week it Dodgers lost tonight so they've got to play a game for which they'll probably lose tomorrow because of the way things are going\nSooner skits well they they rally made it closed they get their heart ripped out raiders gets smoked I thought Notre Dame was a fraud and they were done and they destroy Virginia Tech in Blacksburg although I may encounter was going to bounce back and he gets destroyed USC I mean I'm like the most right now this is not a good place to be I don't know what to do\nYour your your talk like that to me might giants give up who's on sixty three yard field goal wife oh I just why don't you just boot a hundred yard field goal to beat us I I don't know whether or not have it in the dolphins up Seventeen nothing a Seventeen three going into the fourth\nAnd you lose that throughout to pick six is well what are the odds of that I only I could root for something like that\n[noise] All right now when we

won't hear anywhere else by herself here with the audience blank on Fox Sports radio All right before we had the locker rooms and recap some of the big takes after today's game Steve the savior is in the house to put a bow tie on everything\nHe would survive on that ramp bandwagon I Know that huh\nNow they're saying or was it are you crazy he was on the chargers bandwagon\nYeah team that by the way they were passer Essure Melvyn in Europe today he had one sec one interception and one going Kerry\nAnd he thought he was he was insisting afterwards he was it that would have been yeah the\nUh

Freeman solo Homer in the six\nYou know guys the rookie pitcher who's had a great year Walker ... said after the game there's no excuse for that second at a bus he is correct\nBecause did you see they at first base open to out so they walk the pitcher to load the bases\nI mean walk to get to the pitcher I should say the Atlanta pitcher who was bad and Sean nukem has three hits ever in his pro career was about four pitches did they not yes to walk into a run a guy that was three for Seventy two at the plate and his major league career and then the next better hits a grand slam Ronald ... the Braves are still alive six five final\nNFL one will have game for tomorrow for thirty eastern\nMilwaukee has already done and waiting they want to Lebanon in a row and they're off till friday game one of the NFL cs Milwaukee sweat Colorado was six nothing today guys\nIf I don't do people in Los Angeles two tickets to the rams playoff game or two tickets to the bronze opening game in Los Angeles what do you think people would\nSay it's a thousand times easier to park at staples Centre\nWhile he was well I Will\nTell you I went to an as the UCLA game at the coliseum where the rams play I parked at staples Centre and hook a shuttle twenty blocks it took twenty dollars to park at the basketball arena\nYou just want to go abroad stop it you know that\nWell that also but I'm telling you avoid the coliseum during the construction\nThis you see that they'd rather going abroad to open the gate and they go to the round playoff game I I think you're basing it off parking right now so I'm actually getting what seeps throwing down here I don't really know what you didn't then you get to just go through the tube and get there there's still wouldn't do that\nBut I mean it in the defense of the options are giving gentle rinse it was like a start tracking you could just be down there they would still want the Lakers tickets but it is a pretty monumental moment in the history this franchise I mean the the greatest player in the game right now after\nWhat five straight losing seasons is coming to town so yeah I think I think that would be not just worthy of being\nThe worst five seasons of Laker basketball since they moved to Los Angeles\nWorst Arnie worst we come to life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nFifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance to visit Geico dot com now oh All right so I got some post game audio to get to ... speaking of the rams ... I'm sure you all know by now a very got to get a call to go forward on fourth down\nPeople were crushing Pete Carroll for taking time out so here's the situation is fourth in one the sea hawks are are down they get the whole they call a timeout\nAnd during that time out Sean McVeigh says\nAll right guys we're going for it's thirty three thirty one they're getting the ball\nBack is Seattle looks like with a couple of a of a minute lab maybe a minute twenty laps or something like that and they decide you know what we're going for Jared golf quarterback sneak gets there first down here it's golf afterwards\nOh what a lot of time to the side and he was kinda going back and forth I ... I was off that we're planning on going back on the field just to talk to one of the officials about something and uh some turning around officers running back home or in his room so I go to Sean I'm going to call the excuse me\n[noise] I got one question for you sure what does that have to be snap to the quarterback does he updates you take into this hands or get a touches hands that could you put it right back to the center\nFor him to get the extra yard or whatever I think there's a rule about that because you've read the fumble risky but they stopped it because it's something that\nWhy are you thinking that it because this worked so well they should have done something different you know I\nWell I I just think that sometimes if you're the quarterback you just get right up there on to the center the center takes the ball a hike to do or just touches your hand pulls it back to himself and and one just forward for a yard if it's worth it it's just you know\nOkay well you know I I don't I don't know if that's legal though I don't know the the legal I think it actually has to leave the centers hang out that is what I think the actual rule is but hey we've got a commercial break coming up and I can Google the hell out of that bad boy Sean McVeigh on his decision to go forward as\nWell I think really when you look at it initially to talk about putting it he looked at the belief that they had and how much they wanted to do it and because of their belief it made me feel confident and it made us as a coaching staff feel confident to make that decision and ultimately it's a good decision because they made it right\nAll right ... who would you rather hear from a hotel back him or patch trimmer all give us a motel back them first give me some that\nAll right let's start with ... with you I don't know and asked you if I don't think they have to report on things that have\nI don't think that happened here is more\nTo it on my ... honestly says the other thing that had been on my heart [noise] um and I think all the votes of his father just kind of came out in the wrong way um and I talked to them and I as I can have a minute to talk to the same goes\nFor like we don't we don't if we're not on the same page if it's not often it can ... and we can all understand each other and there's going to always be with you in case so\nTo be able to do that was big for me I was nervous to get done and these are your brothers you see every day but once it up there in front of all of them it's a little nerve racking so I'm just excited about the way we pull together I'm like I said we came up short but we refer to them\nAnd that bothers you that ... you know it's awesome yeah that's awesome\nUh it's and I know he's gonna listen I'm telling you I Know Arnie you're going to have to be a Twitter defended for him because he's going to get destroyed he's going to be called a prima Donna and he said you know I didn't\nUh I I didn't handle it it came out wrong is what he said and some of our you told you apologize like yeah that that that didn't happen and I know we all have our sources tell us [laughter] I thought that was pretty ... I\nWas All right I was equally is awesome to me was patch termer\nPart so I'm going to answer all the drama questions you\nWant to go back to what I said All right I addressed it without a doubt\nI addressed it with our team I've publicly declared that I didn't agree with his comments and I asked anybody that was interested if they wanted clarification\nGo to a hotel 'cause he's a big man now I'm not going to give the public a pound of flesh on this right that would make me small not strong and these are the kinds of things in my opinion when you have the locker room that we have\nThat well helped galvanize 'cause the lottery and took care of it and that's all I'm saying on it and eat though darn let's talk football not drama\nWhen he got mad at the media for why did you get it all done for you to talk about ... like that or like you are about the media\nIt never goes well when a coach makes it confrontational beach are tries to tell especially very aggressive very good I guess you could say solid media like New York you know you're not going to I don't think you're going to win that battle unless you're winning games and I don't know last I checked they were ... one in four right now\nYeah you can talk like that to the media I'd like to see him talk like that that there are other coaches and see how that that will get\nThrough what if that will if the rest of the Detroit first and how could they possibly give it to them that I don't understand\nThe replay official overturned it so ... do they go up on replay though so because it changed the plague changed the ruling on the field and I think his point was from ... perspective if you really want to work out on this would you guys know I can\nWas that the official even after the replay but yeah you know it it hit the guy first and then all of a sudden you realize oh they're getting a ball first the gold one so yeah it was it was a disaster from that point forward\nBy the way shut up to the rest of the Texans when today also the cowboys defensive completely forgot how to or what to do that they're being paid to do shake my head wait a minute that's that's from our ah our uh our technical director ... what he should be working on the show is sending out sweets I was just that space but I've got\nA size I shot a and Eric Holder oh\nWow wow oh wow you bought out\nBy ... ... ... do do that today is not the

would like to be waterboarded Tom Coughlin signed off on this that's that guy he's the big ... in Jacksonville he chose this path\nWhich is a dead end street for the jags they're wasting the prime years of these elite defensive players on Blake portals\nAnd again you can go next week pass for five hundred yards no interceptions it three times as it doesn't matter that I Know the real like border I Know the ... and Jacksonville did not have to give him\nA fifty four million dollar extension with that signing bonus and all that it's it's really a two year extension so this year next year for thirty six million dollars they didn't have to do it they did it and now you can watch that\nWaste away because it's pretty difficult I think next to impossible to consistently when when you're trying to make up for three plus interceptions and a whole host of horrible decisions by your quarterback and there were option\nJacksonville had to get creative they had to bring in Bernie made off

out perform his ability I eat to Tibet on that if you're betting on that that's a losing proposition but then yeah but cross of well yeah but you're Flaco did it for both yeah but Nick Boles did it

to hit the ground\nSo does that keeps going up ... says twenty fourteen Suzie enter the NFL borders has the most interceptions the most picks exits and the NFL and those numbers kept going up up up in

had to take a shot back at it\nYeah that's that's not by one point that's not why Jackson the last game I enjoyed some quality trash talk pretty good I usually the best of our show on Fox and I I I

half\nFrom the Houston forty two yard line so we're going to punt the ball away knowing that all Houston that has to do is go down and get a feel go we you'd rather have when you rather have your often get a yard with his IQ Eliot in the office of wine as opposed to putting the ball away and trusting your defense which\nNot not that great\nYeah I I hear what you're saying and I know especially ... to talk about a little bit later a head coach of your favorite\nTeam they're showing some ... limit all day ram it on the island and getting in not last flooding the ball and not\nGiving up the chance so ah I I get where you're coming from ... more often than not yes I Would uh\nI Would tend to want the the game in my hands and had my ... with it and try and hope the other team doesn't score because you know I mean the the ... the Houston Rockets wasn't exactly right in the world on fire I'm I'm going to say was the worst call in the world but I I like I said I Would rather die\nRather will go for it even very Jerry Jones whose whose son I'm convinced is illegitimate son is\nJason Garrett he's there and get some gets run his coach of the cowboys even Jerry was asked about the point in overtime and he took by Jerry Jones standards a shot at Jason gear\nUh Jerry Jones this is a quote you said again we were out playing they're not out of effort but we were we were being out played it's time for risk at that particular time Jones said that's not second guessing\nAnd then he said but we're all extremely disappointed\nAnd quote a when you say that it's time for risk you're calling out the head coach for not taking the risk my correct\nAnd I would agree with you yes he's not only that is what he's saying does that mean Garrett's fired on Monday ... he's out done [laughter] no not at all and we're not bring back Jimmy Johnson bring him back Johnson's walking through that door no no Jim Gail you might be available if you want him which Chan Daley doing these days I ...

markets Robert brings you relevant and with\nSeven to twelve on third down and get three of Steve is now that the party shut them is the the rams and chiefs who are going to play each other not an arrowhead stadium that at the coliseum in Mexico\n[laughter] I Know that the NFL did not think the rams or or the ... the Kansas City chiefs are going to be that great this year or else they would not have chosen that game to go to Mexico I promise you but anyway it's going to be in Mexico the rams and the chiefs are later this season but they're the only five and no teams there that they're the only want their eerily similar\nBy Kansas City now people send their defenses playing better because what borders is a bomb and he turned the ball over all those are those times\nBut between Kansas City who still bad defensively end the rams\nWho is the deepest you rather have you'd rather have the Ramsey for even as bad as the rams defenses\nRight as bad as the rams even just why would you rather have the rams the fans because they have players that have been good\nThat have been great in the past the rams got off a wonderful star they gave up Thirteen points to the first two games at a shutout against Sam Bradford and the cardinals the raiders they shut out I think in the second half of readers didn't score that Monday Night game the past three weeks though\nThe rams defenses allowed eighty five points\nTo the chargers Vikings and the sea hawks known a positive no\nIf you want to magic placebo to get things in a positive direction the rams habit date in Denver with case keen them and the Broncos so that should improve the confidence [laughter] how the ramps and then after that\nThey go to the bay area three road games and wrote a and she Jay battered and the forty niners now the forty niners one stat sheet\nOr they won the stat sheet against the cardinals but they kept shooting themselves in the foot so they end up losing the game is some bizarre stats that came out of that but Sean McVeigh\nAnd as a road coach in the NFL ... stunningly good right I think the rams in ten and one on the road\nI Believe that's correct under Sean McVeigh ten in one away from the Los Angeles memorial coliseum was ... as their their head coach so maybe they shouldn't want to get home field advantage in the NFC maybe they should want to go to Minnesota or Philadelphia wherever\nOr whoever ends up being the top of the New Orleans or the other top teams in the NFC high it's been out of the show and fuss here from some of the key participants this year from Sean McVeigh you what foreign on foreign down coach McVey yeah the smartest man in the world aren't you\nI think really when you look at it and actually talk about putting that you look at the the belief that they had and how much they wanted to do it and [noise] ah because of their belief it made me feel a confidante and it made us as the coaching staff feel confident to make that decision and ultimately it's a good decision because they made it right\nOr Jared golf I'm sure you disagree with your coach who did not want to go for it right you wanted a part in that situation is that correct\nOr with a lot of time to decide and he was kind of going back and forth who had I was off that were piling up just to talk to one of the officials about something and uh some turnaround officers running back home or Israel [laughter] so I go to Sean I'm and I called the\nExcuse me yeah he he was expecting a ... ... most coaches I played for pointing that situation a peak tell your team's not very good you're the coach of the ... what do you have to save yourself coach Carroll\nHope you can tell that uh our team has grown the last three weeks is really an extraordinary\nStep forward yes and we're we're jak about here we go a long season ahead of us and uh now we come out of this game and go to the next one will be crucial to says it will be the next week but there's no doubting who we are as a team and now we're trying to build this thing\n... yeah so he's excited 'cause they beat the cowboys and cardinals the last two weeks or not near one of those things is that good and now they play a good team and they lose us close last\nOh who's gonna win he's talking about raiders in sea hawks\nIn the bay area the greatness of the ... next week week six ... square the raiders hosting the Seattle Seahawks a lesson learned that's right that's in London that's\nNot even into the bay area New London you go to that game Roberta we'd be telling I'll be there you'll be there your correspondent yeah yeah sure be nice All right that's a that's\nThat's what the ... if they win ... games as I said earlier I think it was I said after the bears game figures because of the year as a bad\nFootball team but\nHey they they've got they've still got the visual game to play the forty niners and play them once they play them twice they could win both those things are bad and they play cardinals again so they could they've already got to get the five\nI don't know where else they're going to win\nI don't know where else do they get away to beat the chargers they put the charges in Seattle maybe they were in that when they play at Detroit it's going to be tough to get the eight wins horrible horrible ... ... a Russell Wilson who is like a\nPoor man rip off of Pete Carroll or she is also doing the ra ra speech after the sea hawks just lost the rams\nAll right we're going to be that's one of them were going to be in the game you know obviously they plan and great right now but I thought that we we we we showed up playing the way that we need to we want to every day and the way the practice and women been wanting to play a you know so a great things aren't store\n[noise] a great great see our football they give up for\n[laughter] while the collusion lawsuit\nA no no I Believe you\nKnow no clues lawsuit or because he did turn down the ravens right the ravens offered him\nA job I didn't actually I'm going to turn down the Broncos\nWell no that was before that was when he was still with the\nThe forty niners oh recoup booking but did you find a candy coup you did not go to ... it was a package here as well so it's very exciting Mr mail which we like you know when\nThis was delivered but oh I think it brings in candy for the rest of the scoop no\nOf course that he did get a beverage carbonated beverage\nThere was minimal candy uh and it was candy corn which I enjoy but I Know most people hate\nWas what was in the other container I think some lollipops and oh you didn't even look\nAt it waters really good by west corporate water so I asked him about what it tastes better than our water ... been way Frank and that box everything's

honest\nI think that they're going to be able to the Dodgers they if they get to see yes\nYeah that's an opinion not affect the fact is the Dodgers are going to win the national league pennant\nAnd

win the national league pennant again they're going back to the world series it's a nice story for the brewers and I'm sure they'll sell some souvenirs uh about making the CSP the Dodgers are going to
