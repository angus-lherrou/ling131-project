[noise] download it now [noise]\nFox Sports trending\nBut I always got the ball or they're in the neighborhood of their own thirty five yard line facing a third intense so Iowa on a drive absolutely must have a touchdown but if they do\nCould steal this one from Penn State who has struggled this year a with a few losses starting without high profile laws against Ohio State ... going to join us in less than ten minutes look forward to talking to him where are you right now on Lorenzo versus Rondo\nMan is a tough for me but having watched the Lakers because my son has become a Laker fan because he's following LeBron so every every night that his own we live in it\nSo here here here's what I say and I think the Lakers actually stumbled into something new to the suspension yup the Lakers are better teen when laws on the floor with heart is on the floor with coups was on the floor running with abroad because what they do is they're getting up and down the floor\nThere's kind of like a rhythm in symmetry to their office\nAnd log those been shooting it allows those hitting a couple of three how hard it sits in threes so my biggest issue with the Lakers had been can they keep up with these teams that love to shoot the three ball and they'll never out shoot them but they're getting enough three pointers to be able to stay with it and even saying that\nMade it takes everything for the Lakers to win a\nGame I was well let's remember that Brennan Ingram is not in there and he is supposed to be on their second best player that's supposed to be the guy and I think over time this year will be er that's been an underrated part of their story but here's what I Would say about Lorenzo ball all agree with you that right now simply because\nUh the entire point of this year is to figure it out figure out the roles what's the future going to look like Ron does not your future lawns or might not be either but if he if he's going to be let's find out so\nThat makes all kinds of sense to give Alonzo the reins if it appears that he can handle it and so far it does\nThere are two ... two ... one of them is\nI Would definitely go ... Rondo unless LeBron tells me otherwise [laughter] their head I have no qualms about saying that the brunt of the basketball savant you see like watch the Cavaliers game this year\nExit one player and walk what happens an NBA Finals team to team that I Can't even when a game he's a basketball ... if he knows something that's going on in terms of flow with Ron do that launch those not bringing I'm listening but outside of that\nAnd then outside of one other thing with all of a thing how beautiful and wonderful has it been with all of our so quiet [laughter] what we've seen the last three games\nThat the deal if Lorenzo ball's gonna work there are a few things and he's got to play well and show that he can\nThe shooter basketball he's handling that\nBut be his dad needs to be this library quiet stay in your land that has the scenario where Lorenzo ball actually becomes a viable potential good player in the NBA we've finally found our first three games stretch\nOf having it happen and I think for the Lakers it's got to feel blissful\nStaying hughley that's right I mean I Do I Do believe that there's something to that because the dad has been involved\nOr the dad has been preoccupied with the other stuff that he is going on the other uh interest makes you a big bowl the brand both doing it when it comes to issues but I think\nLawns though his kind of settled in I think we're seeing Lorenzo come to play the way we thought he could play than a little more aggressive I Believe LeBron is talk to my ... talk to him about being a little more aggressive seeking a shot\nThat has helped and when he is on the floor things have been going pretty well like he is another uh what I call initiate of the ... he's a play maker\nAnd man with a young guy who's on the floor they're doing a pretty good job I still don't know if it's going to be enough\nUm with with all of the stuff that's going on in the west but they certainly can make it interesting in the west when those guys continue to get more and more experience playing the gal\nNo doubt they're interesting I'll write more on that and many other and the items with Rick euchre who joined us coming up

through the day\nI went down to el Saddam and I got I got one of the big wet box burrito yeah and I every time I look at one of those um like\nI should eat half of the other half or tomorrow and then the next I woke up and I'm like it's gone for the parade on I mean have you got ...\nAnd all across the United states California Mexican food baseball or football on a friday night I think\nThat explains why tapped out in the sixties they always say well yeah how's it for everybody knew that I rocked a breeder that was bigger than my face when you're you've been like that no that's cool that

in Washington state cougars locked up at seven of peace gentleman back to you\nAre at Howard Dean\nIs what can you guys\nFor ... for ten minutes from now put those two side by side how wants the announcer and Howard Dean side by side and we're going to figure out who did it better or\nWhy would he brought our sports radio were to give your senior writer bleacher reports joins us now and we'll get into some of the NBA it's obvious Rick ... Iran do what what makes the most sense to you right now\nI understand why they would go with ... right now it makes LeBron more of a plane maker and\nA launch those doing a nice job of playing off the ball obviously Alonzo has more to do potentially with their long term plan so that should be the focus but this is this is the interesting part with this Lakers team got some veterans there on one year deals that\nAre not at the end of their run that think they can still play\nLands Stevenson being one Michael easily being another obviously Raj on Rondo and if they turn this into playing the young guys to develop the young guys which makes sense for the Lakers\nI just wonder how that's going to play with the veteran guys particularly if they think or no ... there the better players at this stage so I understand why the Lakers are doing it if I'm the Lakers\nI'm probably doing the same thing but because of the make up this roster it could create problems down the line\n... when you think about that Rick I'm creating problems and\n... Rondo after the fall out of the fight where to fear that it could be soon [laughter] testing is between maybe wrongdoing abroad because the brown went towards Chris ... how do you think ... or demotion coming off of the suspension\n[noise] well we'll see I honestly it's going to be how long they'll play how the team does I don't know that Raj on runs on not the kind of guy that if it works in the team's winning that he's going to take issue with it but if there's any question about how long does plan for\nHow the bronze playing then then I could see it being a problem in this regardless of whether they had gotten into it over cp three and you get all the photos of LeBron putting his arm around the guy who ... Rondo just had a dust up with\nThe fact that Rondo is completely out afraid to tell the brawn when he misses on the fence assignment which happens a lot or rotation or doesn't do the right thing\nI always question how well Ron was going to take that over a course of the season it's it's all well and good especially now that the broadcast are pointing it out looking Rhonda\nOthers telling everybody where to go oh lucky you tell them where to go\nLook kind of like ... doesn't like the image or the idea that someone is being touted as a as a smarter basketball player than he is so or even without that dust up I Would have had questions in terms of how that relationship is going to go 'cause I'll tell you this\nIs not going to hold his piece rather is going to tell you if you're not in the right place doing the right thing and we'll see how that plays\nRape you are with our said wreck what what's the ceiling for this raptors team I Know it's a a little early to get excited ... grades or what what what can they do is use\nThat can be the best in the east or potentially a lot of it are the big unknown for me as much as anything is they got some uh a young guys past call a few comments as as a first them guys with tremendous potential I liked the way they're built\nI don't know who Nick nurses as a head coach and when you're talking about being the best in the east\nWe're going to be in some big high profile games are ideally it's not even about the regular season it's about the postseason how's he going to handle those situations we we have no\nSample size we have no background on terms in terms of how the nurse is going to operate a at that level in that seat and so that is the biggest question but I Will say\nMan if I can get a ... Leonard going into potentially the year where he gets to decide where he wants to go and I give them more of an open system that he played in in San Antonio\nI'm going to look really smart ... going to give me a a game if you thought he was good before you're going to see the absolute best of of ... my son said to me he goes I think I caught it was good I didn't know you is this good yeah because he's just he's getting an opportunity\nTo play and honestly I think that might have been one of the things uh one one of several things that led to him wanting out of San Antonio is that they do have a very structured system and it's and it's a little bit complex expected\nIt requires a high basketball IQ and walk ... certainly functioned in it well a playing in a little more of a free open system allows him to do and show exactly what he can do\nYou know Rick uh I had this conversation we're more a couple of weeks ago maybe last weekend or the new Republicans are team that I think is dangerous in the west I Believe they can give you don't if they were just finished with their sauce and the way that they play am I crazy [laughter]\nNo you're not crazy when it comes to the the composition of the roster or a big part of this is going to be the addition developed for Peyton and continued play through holiday I thought was on run though was a a big influence on that team last year I thought he was a big influence on Anthony Davis\nI Believe it's the ... court and I also believe it's eighty or he's come out strong he's made a statement which I appreciate seeing him saying I'm the best player I Want to be known as the best player in the league I'm Glad to see that\nBut he's one of those guys that has all the talent in the world and there are times where he doesn't impose that talent on gang\nA I've had the same criticism at times about LeBron James you're the best player on the floor there are I I don't want to see you defer I don't tell me about the right basketball play this isn't college this isn't high school\nThis is the pros if you have an advantage if you're the best player if you're the most athletic player that you have to impose that dominant\nAnd there are just too many times including in the postseason where I just haven't seen a D say\nI got this and so that's what I Need to see I Need to see it over the course of the season obviously staying healthy has been a big issue and he has to do that\nBut I I Need to see it at crunch time I need to see it when when I Need a day to go take over a series to impose basically like again if you're talking about their side you're talking about a D you go back and you watch that playoff series last year\nPistons in the in the nineties and thinking now this is some great entertainment\n[laughter] oh I mean Dr let's watch everybody beats the tar out of each other this is really fun I never thought that they were good but I I've never understood like that's when the NBA was good no that's when it was that\nFrom the standpoint like Michael from it yeah yeah for Michael Learned how to beat it but the style of play was not entertaining\nKnows that there's any so here's the trick here's what I'm I'm I Can't wait to see when we get to the playoffs who is going to be the team that slows down like that\nRight to wing game for the grizzlies right now are averaging less than a hundred points per game\nAnd they are the only team in the NBA\nAveraging Ninety nine point five points per game I don't know if they're going to make the playoffs or two into the ... yeah\nBut who's going to be the team to kind of unlocks decode\nTo slow down these prolific offices massively slows down a little bit because becomes a little more half court\nTeams are kind of valuing possessions more so that you can spend the extra pass to make sure you get the shot that you want but who is going to be the team to figure out how to control the temple to slow it down so every game is not attract me because all teams are created equal all teams don't have the shooters that can keep up with\nThe Golden State warriors in Houston Rockets\nSo how are you going to win\nWhen you don't have that ability I Do applaud the Lakers for trying to do some different because I Do believe the only way you're going to be those teams is you can't beat them at their game do you have to make them play your game bright and your game may consist of\nRunning up and down and kind of focusing on defense and making them play different maybe they have to run off the spot\nMaybe but I mean they're given up more points than anybody in the entire NBA\nSo I figured out how games in a yeah there's only one team allowing less than a hundred points a game and that's Boston so maybe it's them\nMaybe it's the Celtics are ... yeah I might they might have the magic formula they measure I'm OK speaking to the magic this is the good stuff we got to get to it so I'm the politicians\nName years ago who did the big yell and therefore nobody ever wanted him to be a politician anymore\nWas that was Howard Dean and then they played a play by play by for us a short time ago that I thought sounded pretty similar now what was the play by play bite again what year that\nHe has said find\nTwenty five twenty five [laughter]\nSo\nOkay so Georgia, Georgia football gets a touchdown and that little primal yell at the end can we spotlight that and put it up against our dean\nTwenty five twenty five [laughter]\nI mean [laughter]\nI think we give him [laughter] I think we can give them a pass just because it's again\nWell no we don't I I'm not looking to do anything to the guy economic vows up her fixed impersonation [laughter]\nHoward Dean is calling Georgia Bulldogs games [laughter] I Wonder what happened\nTo his career after that big yell and we found him we have found Howard Dean he's the voice of the Georgia Bulldogs that is hilarious Nick one more time put just yell side by side\nWith say find\nFunny parts I think that five [laughter]\n\n... [laughter] I mean it was beautiful it's exactly the same\nAs you know maybe maybe back at that speech ... years ago what happened was Howard was in the middle of giving a speech and someone had a TV on in the back of the room and Georgia scored a touchdown [laughter]\nThat's all that happens you think that's what it was I don't know killed his political career but maybe that's you know that maybe that's what happened I'm All right you got give me a rainy production game five versus saints Vikings tomorrow night give me the gap what do you think the gap is\nA huge football this king yeah or is it doesn't matter doesn't matter what happens in baseball like they can talk about is all about is all about the football game\nYeah man I tell you what tomorrow night Rob Manfred pay close attention and realized the change in baseball is needed [laughter]\n\nAnd I know start with loans because Los carries the brands froze trust like E.O Smith in fact be sure to tell your customers to check with their local utility for possible rebates for AOL Smith EnergyStar certified hybrid electric", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
