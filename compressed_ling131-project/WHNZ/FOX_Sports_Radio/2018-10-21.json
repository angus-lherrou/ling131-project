Ohio State with all those five star guys that they recruited are getting dominated at the line of scrimmage it happened last week as Minnesota it's happening again today I'll say this I Know they got smoked by Iowa last year this is about as embarrassing as a ...\nIt was for Ohio State now I Know people will probably be screaming at me right now but what about after the game if you're going to go ahead and rip Michigan State for their shenanigans before the game what about after the game when Michigan celebrated it midfield jumping up and down\nI didn't hear horror by complaining about that now did he was all you know what's good for the goose is good for the gander air and you know what I mean\nWas it was it a little revenge for for ... maybe they will horse when did you think of course maybe they would have been a little more respectful at Michigan State had been a little more respect for I'm just saying you know\nIs that the way to do it though if they've just respect us we'll come back to disrespect them and started stopping on me because that can cause the riot I could I could achieve Michigan State come running out and you know all of a sudden there's there's just the cubs going on you know\nListen I mean if if I'm doing my show prep hearing you walk by and you just close line me I'm coming after you after I Do a good show that's all I'm saying\nAll right if you want to get a hold of them Aaron underscore tour as um ads stinking genius one Alabama wins big uh why are they always win big why are they so much better than everybody else that's what I really want to know how do you beat this Alabama team\nAnd who did what the coach saving at half time we'll get to all that that's covered up back here on Fox Sports radio\nWhat's the story of this story says we have opinions on the line who think they think hey I think is the most dominant Ron in the history of sports\nHave no fear but yeah but yeah but yeah but yeah but don't take it than you are asking me to believe the unbelievable for great sports talk we are Fox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know\nWhy did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or is that a war basketball's bouncer than the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles to get a game well here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nThrough ... also helps people get used cars that's right to car isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory\nAnd simpler buying experience when you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with two cars certified dealers\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car and enjoy more confident car by experience some features not available all states\nYou're not looking at at at the right way real quick just getting back to Alabama\nI'm I'm not sure what that tendency fan wanted but it was all Alabama and this one I'm not sure why there's so much but I Will get wiser better\nI just don't know why there's so much better that we don't even have a close gave me just dominate everybody out there they get a feel is going to happen in the playoff also\nI I agree with you or any I mean whether it's Notre Dame Michigan ... I mean Clemens in whoever it would be and I said LSU and obviously you wouldn't be LSU I guess in theory it could be LSU ... probably very very unlikely\nBut it's just really hard to find a team that that is going to to be able to challenge them and I think the biggest difference this year as we've discussed over the last eight weeks\nThey're getting great quarterback play and they've always been great on defense now they have the number one off at the college football they seem absolutely unbeatable um it it's just amazing to watch we can and week out I mean you know Tennessee coming up and went over ranked team on the road they beat they won at all burn and\nThey're down whatever it was twenty eight to nothing about eight minutes into the game was unbelievable\nRight we'll finish up all the other top twenty five a lot of action going on a couple of games still going on also so we'll check the scores on that first though let's check in with the savior see what's out there what's going on to say\nSomehow the Dodgers are going to the world series they take game seven on fs one going on right now too late on the bandwagon already hit a championship series is over\nThe Dodgers when a

last three outs ads he had done out of the bullpen the last two postseason\nIn deciding games he pitches effectively oh is that if they get us look at that I'm saying it has happened to me only three years in a row including game seven of the world series last year and the clincher against the national the year before where he got the save\nThis is a Dodger team that in mid may had a record of sixteen and twenty five they were already eight and a half games back in the division\nThey fought back and finish tied for first Indiana west\nWon a tie breaker game with Walker buell or on the ... game one sixty three of the regular season that got 'em home field advantage for the first round and now here on the road a game seven when to go to the world series in Boston for game on Tuesday night on Fox TV and guys the stat amazing as it is it's still true\nWhen the Dodgers had a lead a four at any point in any game they have always won this year the\nOlder you get in the world series Dodgers Red Sox\nRed Sox won a hundred and eight are you kidding yeah wow I mean the fake or because the one game the red Sox a hundred and eight that lineup is phenomenal and remember we're going to have\nBoth the ball was in the division through relaxes\nI agree that some of the wins that not all of the winter when we have the three games potentially three at Dodger Stadium next weekend JD Martinez the da and the peak Canada is going to have to be in the light up so they're already talking about him playing out field and runs the defensive great ... bad maybe in the second base to get them both in the light up in that\nEarlier in the year once ... used to be a second baseman in the minor leagues but he looks a little shaky out there are a little bit\nOf Houston second baseman Jose

about over and it includes the upset when of Perdue over a number to Ohio State\nForty nine to twenty wow also USC loses forty one twenty eight at Utah the Trojans are four and three and quarterback\nFreshmen star JT Daniels left in the second half within a parent concussion\nUCLA up in the late game ten nothing over Arizona in the second quarter of play earlier wins for Alabama and Clemson for LSU Michigan and Oklahoma in the top ten and there is a night in the NBA as we have Lakers at home home opener losing ... while his forty seven forty six\nRockets lead mid second quarter

just go to guy could come or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well let's figure out which way it's easier just for the ...\nThe sing off on the Dodgers Mike or tweets and\nYou guys are surprised that baseball manager over thinks some are not baseball managers over think decisions more than anyone other than maybe an idiot coach with those a pass on first goal from the one hand raiders and hash tag Seahawks nation that's Mike out there um\nYou know I look he felt comfortable upbringing ... does it make a difference it got the job done they're going to the world series or nobody's good talked about that but what a great world series we're going to have ratings through the roof exactly what will be needed Dodgers and Red Sox are great is that\nIt is how about the fact by the way as much as you and I've just spent the last probably what four or five ten minutes crushing Dave Roberts the guy that's basically responsible for the red Sox bracing breaking that eighty six year cursed Dave Roberts with that stolen base in two thousand four\nNow managing the opposing team I like that on bowl we look at you look at me about this stuff I've joked baseball I'm an AK ... or whoever\nChocolate or whoever or let's go through the rest of the top twenty five just a little quick notes on each game you make a little comment um let's get back to Ohio State they lose forty nights when the\nUh that is a fight or Haskins threw the ball Seventy three times I'm sure that wasn't the game plan for during seven yards two touchdowns they get clobbered Purdue twenty eight points in the fourth quarter they would've forty nine twenty this will drop Ohio State\nI'm not going to stay out of the top ten but probably the number eight I'm a debate if they're going to be out of Texas are not not a good look when you lose a forty nine twenty that's a hell of a lot of points that we always question that defense for Ohio State now we see is the true meaning of them right now\nYeah by the way last segment remember Arnie you mentioned why is Alabama so much better than everybody else I don't know what the answer is but if we agree that nicks that urban Meyer is universally the second best coach in college football\nHow about this that that your boy Aaron tourists just pulled up\nNick Saban hasn't lost to an ... ranked opponent since two thousand seven wow eighty straight games this is now the second year in a row that Ohio State has lost by twenty five plus\nTo an on ranked opponent last year Iowa this how many games how many games eighty straight Arnie or do you still had hair on the top of your head less time saving lawsuit on right component that\nIs unbelievable so you're saying it's all said and why their head and shoulders better than everybody else\nThat it is and you know it's amazing to about saving I was thinking about 'cause when you pitched you know we've talked about this on on other shows but I was thinking about this he loses assistant coaches every year to I mean he lost Kirby Smart a few years ago he lost lane kissing a few years ago he lost Jeremy ... at the guy that he faced with Tennessee today\nIt's the guy just keep losing assistant coaches he keeps losing players and he keeps on winning it's incredible I Know you're asking about Ohio State but I thought that was kind of a fit in kind of thing to bring a full circle\nI Want you to know something well everybody's watching the Dodgers go to the world series well everybody watched um Ohio State lose while everybody was watching a bronze season opener in Los Angeles\nFor some silly reason I'm like why can't I just leave well enough alone just enjoy against but no\nI have to put on the Arizona game at the same exact time where zone is running for a long touchdown and they fumble at the five yard line and they went to the end zone as the running on and just just for a touchdown\nNobody around them they bundled into the zone but nobody can meet grief over that was nobody's watching that one you know what I'm saying yeah I live about\nFive minutes from the rose bowl I think I Need a a clothes hangar to put on one of these TV to get that game on on the TV here 'cause nobody has watched\nAll by the way you be prepared to be ripped would you like me to start with that with David who tweets on an errand tour as arm in arm disrespectful thought that was a sign of unity stinking genius said that the Michigan player stopped on the logo sounds disrespectful to me arm in arm for stopping\nThe more post game stopping in our boss comments not an eye for an eye at all\nUh well it started with the arm in arm thing it wasn't they didn't do that\nAs a retaliation for stopping on on the um none that happened after the game yeah I mean it started with Michigan State Michigan was out on the field in warm ups minding their own business preparing for the game\nMaybe by the way Michigan State should have been doing their own warm ups because they didn't they didn't do much once the game actually started to take that David wow yeah\nYeah you don't bring there's a lot about what but but you know what a horrible for him to get all upset about it and then after the game his team does that how come nobody brought that up to him I don't know if anybody the media said well what about your team stop and I ... the arm line\nYeah all I saw was that a he said it was Bush league or childish or whatever and marked Antonio basically said yeah well it wasn't it wasn't a big deal at all\nI just you know look I I'm all for good rivalry but when you get your butt kicked you just kind of got to take it you know and exactly that's all I'm saying\nAll right a couple of the games concern with the forty one seven over NC State notice that were just ignoring quite having trouble Lawrence and not one twenty six thirty nine over three hundred yards at a touchdown I'm Still not sure the third best team and now they're probably going to move up the number two unless somebody seems a jump up and I don't see that happening but\nIf you need ... just go to for ... dot com slash better consultant licensed physician ad

Braun at least there's some buzz in at least there's some excitement and I will say this I Do think the Lakers it'd be really really interesting to see her with those young guys with ... with some of those vets that you know what what's the nice way say they're a little quirky I guess it'd be than I Would say like a\nI think at least be entertaining here over the next couple of months\nI let's just finished a couple of games and the top twenty five Oklahoma which was up I think twenty eight seven I'm next to you know it's close to half twenty twenty four and you're wondering if maybe Oklahoma with this one slip through the fingers\nThat you wouldn't even that far going into the fourth but did they pull away fifty two twenty seven ...\nI'm A L K gave it to Fort touches but only a little bit over two hundred yards passing was Nineteen twenty nine I'm but I guess good victory by Oklahoma they'll just move up maybe a notch or two a week maybe a notch or two or because of the Ohio State Los\nYeah what a weird game on it I don't know how close you watch this one I Know probably to poke your buddy cursed plank or you're probably watching closely but a\n... now what what what I think they're going to lose I'll watch it all at least I Know what I think they're going to win I'll move on to something else\nWas going to say it was a weird way because Oklahoma jumped out to this massive lead TCU makes a quarterback change cuts the lead to twenty eight twenty four and half time as you mentioned and all of a sudden it's a game\nAnd then she sees quarterback gets hurt and Oklahoma pulls away and it doesn't even look like it was close but it was closed and interesting there for a while before Columbus pulled away\nLike give it a little love to your mythical are defending champion yeah a central Florida because you're you know we've got to give them a little well got to give them or do we have to give them a little um I don't know well there's certainly better than Arizona I can tell you why are they better than Alabama Notre\nDame is it like that well they do well I don't know what I mean they'd be Auburn was yes you see champ last year they beat ... ... yeah they all born last year I don't know but I I'm just saying I mean like my whole thing is like I look I don't think they're going to get in that I Know they won't get in as a matter of fact\nBut I mean we're we're looking at a scenario it's almost certainly going to have to uh every team in the fact of has to last is\nProbably every team in the big twelve could potentially end up with two losses depending on what happens I'm just how many games in a road you they have to win before they get people's respect I'm not\nI'm not saying that they're Alabama I don't think anybody is what you tell me on a neutral field you mean to tell me they can't maybe play with the LSU and Ohio State the way they looked and I I don't know I just think they should be more in the conversation and they're\nI think a lot of people say we don't even want to give them a chance we don't even want to see 'em out there um but then again ratings isn't what central Florida is all about I we're almost into our one in the books I mean we just crushed our number one almost\nA you want to get in Aaron underscore tour as a match thinking genius one so send those in fast and furious lots to get through an hour or two here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nHey it's been matter here\nEverybody's got to do list drop off the ... he was an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you couldn't be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nMonster from Stephen King and executive producers David Kelly and jak bender and no one else I haven't talked to the original theory [noise]\nMystery new episodes Wednesday's an audience [noise]\nExclusively on direct TV channel two thirty nine and streaming direct TV Now\nReally helpful if you need to buy a car through ... also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network at nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simpler buying experience when you buy newer used\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience\nHe fought our first I ... [noise] download it now [noise]\nYou know it kind of plays back to what you're saying about with Michigan State earlier is if\nThey were at home and obviously there are certain luxuries that you get it at home\nThat you don't get on the road but again if Michigan State had done that pre game I doubt Michigan State is dancing and celebrating on the fifty yard line I mean because you know thing with Michigan is there a team that they're they're important games the football that matters for them is ahead of them\nI don't think they would have cared that much but you know when you make it personal uh you make it personal and that's exactly what happened and and so no I really honestly have no problem with the way the way that a Michigan handled things after the game\nLet's jump down a little bit down the top twenty five it's going to Washington this was billed as a mobster game was fourteen Thirteen to have\nAt the half against Colorado I've never watched it it was coming in three and one of the pack twelve Colorado was to in once obviously\nI'm mobster game for both especially of Washington wanted to go ahead and be one of the teams\nIn that four team playoff that a lot of climbing to do and some people think it's good to be too little too late anyway but Washington comes up with a big second after defense great job in Colorado and you want to talk about it being ... I was watching some of this is also\nA Colorado and Washington just drawing back and forth especially the uh uh the the Colorado quarterback has ... ... ... every time something why she did with the defensive backs by knock your way of past\nThey were jar with him and he would come back and jumped back I'm like you're the quarterback dude [laughter] don't pay attention to them but a very chip you could win for Washington though in this one\nWell and it's one thing to to to yap and run your mouth it's another thing if you're a quarterback\nAnd it's another thing if you're getting your butt kicked like ah like like Colorado did only two hundred and sixty three yards a total offense hundred and forty four yards passing for Steven monsters I mean this isn't one that when he tries tries out for the NFL next year is going to be on his real\nSo ah you know I have no problem with with talking smack but you got to do it when you're when and you've got to do it when your head and yeah it's just it's a bad looking and frankly it was a a bad day overall for packed twelve who now is\nBasically down to just Washington state has a potential playoff team\nOr no love for Penn State they when a when this close to the thirty three twenty eight score but it was a a good offensive output both teams they're ... not one that you're going to write home about two hundred and twenty yards no touch of did have the interception\nA big Soviet over a hundred yards on the ground though so that's what saved them\nBig effort here Penn State gets the victory so you know obviously they'll continue or what what they've got they're not going to make any noise they're already got two losses but\nThere are five and two two and two in the Big Ten good victory though all over it in Indiana team that gets overlooked a lotta times\nWell it's interesting because now they can play spoiler I mean if you look at the standings they are\nAre obviously out of it because of that lost to Ohio State and as you said back to back losses with Ohio State and a Michigan State\nBut next week they have Iowa which is is at sitting at six in one in three and one in the league you can basically knock them out of contention for the big west the Big Ten west championship\nAnd the following week you go to Michigan and Michigan has a chance to go to the playoff they have a day of a chance for a lot of things so Penn State really good team they could be an Ohio State and they can certainly be a spoiler over these next few weeks\nI Know I don't wear short on time and maybe we'll get to this later on I sent you an article about a memo that Yahoo Sports came across about coach leech a bringing up that he can't trust the pay twelve officials anymore you\nLay it out for the audience because I thought it was pretty interesting\nWell he had sent a memo to the ... twelve office saying that he feels like they're trying to manipulate who wins and who loses\nUm which is another way of kind of thing you're fixing games and that's not the first time I've sent you an article about the pact twelve officiating member we will send you one last week about the instant replay in our third non official decided not to throw somebody out for us see for targeting\nLook there's so much you get into but\nI there's got to be an investigation into what's going on with the pack twelve officials that they're not I mean where there's smoke there's fire now coaches are starting to get involved there\nAnd that's the scary part if you're in the packed whoa officers is you know if fans all the time they're going to say stuff like oh of course the big tent wants Ohio State to winter the pack twelve wants to USC or whatever\nBecause that's what fans do but when coaches feel that way when coaches don't feel like they're getting a fair shake you know that's something that from the league office has to come on down\nAnd in in you know there has to be something I Know that Larry Scott the commissioner has come out over the last couple of days and said you know we're going to read a review everything we do and especially based on what you mentioned earlier Arnie there was a a targeting non coal that was shocking if you see the video\nAnd so the the commissions made a big deal about oh the things are going to change but when you have a coach calling calling that is really really bad\nAll right uh well

yeah and it's hard to quantify who has the edge there you know I mean as far as the travel goes the professional athletes um is these guys are used the traveling granted you're changing times on you're going to another continent\nUm it it's a little different than going from the east or west coast but with that said it very difficult to quantify\nAs far as this is how many points it's worth ... and which team really does have an advantage over the other um with that said we've seen this line go up and down what I mean by that is it opens around six six and a half got up to seven at seven you salt Tennessee money come in from some sharp at six and a happy charger money from some sharp\nUm so it seems like that's the right number um that that the books have up there the public's going to be on that the chargers so far they're already getting a lot chargers one sided\nUm money that's the obviously really really early game and it's going to be tied into a lot of later games meaning there'll be a lot of teenagers on the chargers and money line parlay is with later games to weigh the chargers just have to win this game pretty much straight up so that's what they've been getting mostly on that one\nUh books are going to be open Tennessee could keep it much closer than they did last week against Baltimore\nBiggest further before it let's go real quick a extra money coming in on the Lakers but because of a bronze double the money triple the money nothing really more you told me\nI mean listen here's what's going to happen like we see all the time that the market overreact\nUm and and you don't make money betting and those teams that that everybody jumping on especially early on in the season when you're paying a premium and that's exactly what you're seeing with the LA Lakers win or lose it whether you catch your ticket or not right now you are not getting the best bet net team\nThere's definitely a ... attack because they're getting volume and money from the public every night\nI Know ... ... and say real quick I noticed you started is there money coming in on anyone other than the warriors or is there a hot pick right now with the other teams\nLook for in a way I I\nWouldn't say so somebody but sixty seven thousand dollars on the warriors just to make the playoffs the win six arguments [laughter]\nThat's what you're getting exactly what you're getting and actually it's been a negative it really has\nBecause people aren't even wasting their money where what the NFL even last year when we had it was kind of historic that the patriots win and it said in such a favorite they when they when the season kicked off they were down to around two or three to one a favorite to win the super bowl that's unheard of\nTired of the season and even with them being that Tom Petty um there was still a ton of future money because people thought their ... but with Golden State that's where the problem lies\nThat the rest of the the teams aren't getting money that most think you're not feeding them you know maybe we run into that second or third team at the most maybe getting a little money but that's it and I think that's been a negative more than a positive as far as MBA futures market the last few years with Golden State\nYou can get all the biggest one of the big moves dot com that's the big moves dot com you can tweet

[noise] download it now [noise]\nIs an alleged spit on the part of ... Rondo writing at Chris Paul right so that's why that whole thing transpires away did still no excuse\n... well it was it a purpose spit or ... just because he was talking in something came out you know what I mean as you get a question to um that's why cause you saw Chris Paul uh was all upset got bent out of shape you were wondering why he was all upset\nWell now we do know why so um jeeze I Wonder what the NBA how they're going to straighten this out the certainly going to be a lot of a lot of people shorts money uh and find after this route no doubt about that\nYeah it was going to say too is that in the NBA I mean we've seen guys suspended this that and the other thing rarely do we actually see literal punches thrown we see shoves we ... we see the fake hold me back this and that you know a little slap here and there\nI mean these were full fisted hunch is by Ruy John Rondo by Brennan Ingram and who else Chris Paul I don't know who else I'm trying to think of who who had happened with the rockets but it's not often you see actual punches thrown that was different\nAll right um let me get to some stuff on Twitter one next as really now you're going to blame LeBron James for breaking up a fight the wrong way this is athletes think that the media is nothing but a bunch of want to be ...\nBy the way brothers don't use the words like weeks sauce go sit down somewhere I'm yeah I'm going to blame a project for breaking up to the fight that way for putting his hand the rock Chris Paulson I see it and and you know a sympathizing with him and says sympathizing with your own teammates\nThat's what I'm saying I mean yeah and and so you want to talk about I forget what this guy said exactly as far as what's week sauce and what's not or what would I Would say is you want to talk about someone that you know if you've actually played athletics and I don't know if this listener has so I Apologize if he hasn't\nUm but you know when you're in the the heat of competition\nThe one thing you don't do as ever friend as with the other team and so I had no problem with LeBron breaking up the fight as I said exactly but well yeah well if you're right Sean Rondo and Chris Paul just shove you in the face and now you turn around and you see LeBron with his arm around Christmas I I Want to be very happy about that\nI totally agree one hundred percent um groves says obviously you weren't watching the game but the sound ... started at shaking my head well first of all we can't have the sound odd for doing the radio show so yeah you're not allowed to hear the game in the background that's against violations or you'll get shorter for that so I had her eyes but\nI did hear what was said and that was well a crisp fall when he put his finger in hand and run into space you said you listen\nTo already Spaniards [laughter] yeah and it forces you to and from oil heated man it got very heated like that\nBy the way by the way just one thing that stuck out to me out of all the punches being thrown the guy behaving the most normal in this whole situation was when Stephen ... Stevenson was the peacemaker in the situation why what what the F world there we went to planned Stephen since playing ...\nOr a peace maker it's so funny 'cause I just assume that was him throwing punches I I had no idea my God this puppy Stevenson a thought punched out there\nI was going to say by the way according Adrian ... uh I guess Kiki Evander way who's the NBA's yes executive VP of basketball operates yeah he's demand that ultimately makes the decision on\nSuspensions finds whatever apparently he's in the building tonight staple center so we might get it gets kind of an interesting though is I Know there's no I got a better side note oh late on me ... and the way when they retired is number palisades high school [laughter]\nNumber fifty I made sure I wore that number

first pick you asked me earlier if I'm going to get up for the six thirty Pacific time kick off in London I Am not and here's why Arnie [laughter] because I already know what's going to [noise] oh wow yeah you see the thing with the chargers is there the better team\nThere the more talented teams are used to I just got a first game over [noise]\nUCLA UCLA was ... and ... oh oh oh chargers paint dry right out so look everyone's going to point to the titans eleventh attacks last week everyone's going to assume the chargers that great defensive line that they're going to dominate I completely disagree I think tightens bounce back my concern with the chargers they left\nLA ... weeks ago they stayed in Cleveland then we went to London and they've been gone for a long time a lot of travel a lot of time away from home because of it I liked the titans getting six to that Chicago Bears\nOr at home coming off that was the ... when the patriots but what ten days to prepare for the Kansas City chiefs which is why they one forty three forty ... as I mentioned didn't practice with the team on Thursday I think he will play ... or was he didn't travel with his team\nFor the game bears the pets will make a difference in this one had\nWhat they put everything all the effort into the game because kids the city of Chicago plus the two and the upset over the ages of ... you can call it an upset\nVery good you know you mentioned how rock to over you mention the lion playing at\nThe dolphins I should have just done this right after you did it but I kind of jumped out or the year I actually am with you the lions the weird team as I mentioned that there are only to win this year against Rogers and Brady\nBut even in that when it gets to Packers if you actually look at the that they were out gained the Packers control time of possession it was a couple of costly turnovers that cost the Packers there I don't think the lions even at two and three are as good as the record indicate Miami at home they went against\nMy will pick up all over the Kansas City chiefs to bounce back up with all of the patriots way in six at home against is that why a lot of respect for but there's no way they're going to be able to keep up offensively with Kansas City given the chief minus six against is that\nI mentioned the Vikings have one or two in a row the jets by the way also to in a row I think the Vikings or clicking they'll look this is a team that has been up and down since the start of the year but with those back to back when I think they're finally getting right this is a game by the way that the Vikings need to win\nSchedule after this week they play the states they play the bears they play the Packers they play the patriots a lot of really good games outside of the division as well as in Vikings each when they get to win on that on Sunday again\nI'm taking the Dodgers over the red Sox in seven [noise]\nUm I Want to make the crew was evident last stay with

State somehow in the Big Ten championship\nThe chance to them upsetting them it's so much less than it was today because the ebbs and flows of a natural season in a playoff in the NFL in a championship game and college you're not going to see a lack of focus but I listen here last thing I'll say about the\nChance of the guys that they do win out\nI think think of the two narratives oh my God here's another Florida Ohio State team just got crushed against Clemson now two years ago a it's almost like who wants to watch that game Notre Dame comes in with one last\nYou know having the Michigan and that that wins looking\nBetter and better now you say okay\nI mean this is going to be exciting ... they're both going to be double digit dogs against that Alabama I think Notre Dame gets him in that scenario\n[noise] good stuff will see All right let's dive in a lot to get to somehow the raiders Oakland Raiders soon to be Sunday Las Vegas readers always managed to be in the news even at a by week you know RJ watching the readers conduct business much less play football is akin to watching a drunk cross the nice you street it's ugly\nYou know her met or fascinating could be an entertaining to hurt somebody murders what's said you play to win the game but you know Archie you had an interesting take this past\nWeek about perhaps another agenda involving the raiders let's take a listen\nI don't think they're trying to lose I think they love to make the playoffs the raiders\nSo it's not quite tanking here's why I think it is if the rumors are true and again pollen talked about this on their heard this week that it that the Mac situation clue Matt was about money there is a little known fact that\nAnd I don't have all the details on this to the decimal point but when you sign a contract and there's a guarantee a portion of that needs to go and ask grow you gotta have that money to put in the bank\nAnd let's just say and we'll say hypothetically allegedly if you don't\nNow you got to trade Mac\nAnd all of a sudden now the raiders aren't near as good as they would be with them so it's not so much you want to lose that you can't win because of your financial situation but you got to get to Vegas where the financial situation gets cleared up how do you get there well you get there through\nDistracting attention away from the wins and losses and it feels like if you like to me that's very possible\nReaders will play a game next week at home versus Indianapolis haven't seen a look ahead line but I think what you just said is is right there are a lot of moving parts here [noise] yeah and you know it was fascinating\nSo listen we picked up three taught twenty markets in the last month so we've been on the air ... during the week six o'clock eastern\nSo almost two hundred stations now and the day after we said that and just to paraphrase\nRaiders wanna win but the fact they're losing maybe it's being driven by some financial trouble ... and if there is financial trouble what is the solution to that it's getting to Las Vegas\nBecause the raiders going to be worth a lot more at that point and how do you get there if you're losing with the least amount of turmoil least amount of distraction is you distract\nYou create a distraction with a coach that's bombastic that's a media figure so in a in a weird way we're all saying oh my gosh I Can't believe Kearns doing so badly and what's going to be the consequences I think if anything\nThe possibility of this is why they hired grew in to start with and the very next day Bernie the very next day\nGrooming went in the press conference and so that we're not tanking no one else we asked everyone we knew did you hear anyone else talk about them tanking they said no so I think straight

God Bless him\nHe's argued bill I'm Bernie Fratto this was straight out of Vegas when we come and do you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios and I'll tell you the game I'm looking forward to tomorrow\nA lot Noonan visits\nA Chicago the parents yeah their own two on the road they lost that Jacksonville at Detroit but they didn't have Julian Edelman those games didn't have\nJosh board and yet by the way a lot happening around this game tomorrow Gronkowski didn't make the trip you won't play obviously I understand ... is horrible dealing with an ankle situation\nBut we all know that when the parents go on the road historically they've had a lot of success and RJ chronicle that earlier in the week let's take a listen\nI liked the pat Pat's are so good as well favors what's the danger of being a road favor\nYou overlook your opponent 'cause you're clearly better than the opponent that's why your favorite on the road right well the patch when they're favored by a few go for more on the road\nOr Seventy eight percent straight up they win the game Seventy eight percent of the time\nGoing back almost Seventy games fifty three winners Fifteen loser straight up [noise] no team in the NFL is even close to that good as a road favor as the patriots as a real favorite why ballot check a lot of answers and with valid check\nAnd it makes sense why he's meticulous he won't let the team look ahead has one of the reasons the patch or the right side against the bears\nAnd I brought what's your grass pretty good by the way if you're a ... fan you have to be happy that Julian Edelman is back I said two weeks ago on this show\nThe patch we're struggling on third on efficiency twenty five percent since element returned their third on efficiency is now almost fifty percent\nThrough twelve a twenty five but interestingly enough now ... there's an old saying if you had to agree only ... heads doing all the thinking and you're not going to get to better mine's RJ and physic the only two time champion hill now west gate super contest\nThey had an interesting set a chat on this patch bears game earlier in the week several listen\nI'm taking the bears what two and a half in this game RJ is all about the bears lost in the Miami Heat in my opinion being forgivable last week the bears were dominating that game until the fourth quarter and then their defense got gas and they absolutely got blitz and the fourth quarter and overtime and I so\nWhat you're saying is everyone's saying all the bears last we're going to undervalue them you're saying there's a reason the bears lost because of the heat in Miami and the fourth quarter\nIt did seem like the heat affected them that's you're saying okay the marketplace most people are overreacting to a lost it wasn't the barest fall which means there's value on the ... correct okay now I don't want to play Perry Mason but I'm going to play Perry Mason\nThere was such a thing called the look a headline we talk about that a good bet look ahead line is you can bet next week games now what's the point of that you can see what the games that happened this weekend how they affect the line\nIf you would have looked at the bears and the patriots last week\nWhat was the line New England was minus three New England was minus three okay interesting now you're saying okay everyone's going to undervalue the bears because of this performance but the line has improved further the bears\nAre now only getting two and a half so if anything the bears have been upgraded not downgraded [noise] hey listen we're back live\nYou might say why that tape cut off it didn't ... I had no answer [laughter] okay there was no answer and you're in no position that challenge my expertise but we'll see because the line has kept going down obviously ... new news right now it's patriots two\nFavorite only by to one and a half and some spots by the way this is and I'm going to be honest this is the pros versus Joes and here's how you can tell go to ... dot com click the game center\nTab and for free you get to see the ticket counter splits and the cash splits so right now live eighty percent of the tickets on the patch\nJust barely over fifty percent of the cash on the patch so think about it if eighty percent of the tickets are one way but only half the cash and means the big bats are the other way so ... is with the other sharp sea air I'm with Freddie fanny pack\nBut I'm feeling pretty comfortable I think the bears are bears are like that actor that was in a sitcom he's in one movie he looks pretty good now everyone's excited about 'em I'll take George Clooney patriots I I think the\nBarriers that exposed last week in Miami but to be fair the parents are probably not a deserving favorite Sundays Nobel checks\nTeam they're streamlining one against the spread when favored on the road after going forty or more points and their previous home ...\nI hear yeah it's just a number is just not big enough earning I mean it's it's it's twelve games no but in in all fairness and whether you are Jay I'm never going against Bill Belichick especially when you only have to weigh less than a few Ogle\nAnd I'll tell you this [noise]\nThe patriots won that game\nBut they still have multiple losses this season as you said they haven't won on the road on to the U.S you lose a third game out of ... you know your foreign three at that point I if the patch undefeated or if the paths only had one last I think maybe it could be a flat spot they don't want to lose\nThis guy's pretty good but now they got 'em on film RJ and so the browns will take a trip down to Tampa Bay and now that they've got this gentleman on film the question is might he gets him looks that he's not used to argue bill talked about this earlier in the week if I were you I'd take a listen\nBiggest question to me and I've got the answer to this one has the defense is caught up to a Baker Mayfield I said yes get magically oftentimes a rookie quarterback will come in the defensive coordinators we'll get some tape on him as they like to say and once they do they say he can do this but he can't do that\nAnd they start making them do that\nAvi may feel it's going to be able to pass the test but I think we're at that point where there's potential problems due to the way the defenses are learning how to defend may feel\nAnd I'm very worried about the browns and their energy level all those close games in overtime games early in the gear and now they play in eighty\nTwo degrees well the beauty of it is do they get to go into Tampa Bay with Tampa Bay quarterback James Winston\nAnd you know he may be the NFL's next you're markets rose to ... I Know the way he's going to you just want to hold on a second if you start if you play even for one year fairly effectively you're way past your mark\n... might have overstepped might be found [laughter] keep me out and I mean I'm going to win and fan or the air\nAnd I do think there's some real skepticism or or rightful skepticism about how he played last week because the the falcons who the bucks play last week might have the worst defense in the NFL right now and because of that is that the point total look good for Tampa\nBut boy I'm not sure if against a pretty good ... D it's going to be the same do\nTampa Bay open minded three favorite by three ... it's now three and a half yet at the big ... interesting you're burning up I'm Glad you brought up the point about Tampa Bay defence because\nThey were the worst in the lead giving up thirty four points to a game going into Atlanta last week and what are they due to give up thirty for once again the address recorded or gets fired yeah but which is actually if you think about it going into Atlanta\nThey've scored over thirty every game at home this entire season the ... that probably exceeded expectations for cameras ...\nLet me ask you a question because just to finish my point Jim is is one in ten straight up at his last eleven starts okay so this is not a stellar guy you didn't have brown and plus three and a half talk about that argument we\nListen on our super contests we got Tampa and some some of it is driven by the ... point remember guys it's all about the humiliation of half points is how you win at sports betting and there is no half point more valuable than three\nIf a spread is around three\nIf a spread is around three huh it's gonna fall exactly three with the favorite winning by that amount almost ten percent of the time you cannot underestimate how important that it\nAbout a minute to go on the show I Would have thrown some quick bonus coverage the rams visited San Francisco the third straight road game Margie by the way NFL favorites and the third game of with three game away road trip through just foreign ten straight up\nTo and twelve against the spread particularly division games if they were favored in the first two legs or their prior to games by the way the rams on that next week\nAgainst Green Bay I'm really not sure if the rams would find themselves looking ahead to the Green Bay Packers next week I don't know if they do that in the NFL\nWeather's another thing is the teams is not used to being a jumbo wrote favor can struggle because they don't know how much they can take off their hundred percent of effort and still win\nThe experience seems like the ad or able to do that\nAnd to me I think\nThe rams are in a real danger spot here I Do like San Francisco thank you I'm a ... that makes me feel good you agree with me because that's my favorite way of the day right now I Believe the rams are catching nine you could have got it it can earlier in the week [noise]\nAll right folks [noise] that'll do it for ... bill on Bernie ... don't go anywhere up next we got a gentleman who not only wrestled or Barrett age six he actually ... yeah it's my man Jonah snacks\n\nIf you suffer from eating and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off patent December eleventh in that scene the active ingredient that's in the little blue pill is now available and generic form available to you\nGet thirty dollars for a month supply that's a big discounts no more getting ripped off by the big pharma companies with poor hymns dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy visit and see huge money on your prescription ... just\nGo to Forbes dot com slash better consult with a license physician ad following their confidential medical review you can have the proper prescription deliberate directly to your door for a fraction of the price and today will supplies less you can get started with a trial wants to just five bucks that's right five dollars here's what you do just go to\nFor him dot com F.

you're thinking you know this guy could swing on me\nI think he just change the conversation I think he changed the entire narrative around him maybe not having a dog in amber maybe some people call them soft\nHe's always\nIt's quiet you never hear a upkeep at a brand new meaning room\nThey talked about when Brandon Ingram went to do kind of recruiting trip that he was one of the most quiet kids they'd ever had come through there\nThey couldn't believe how quiet it was because he was just watching kind of studying and kind of learning everything and then he gets to the NBA and you almost wonder if that was going to be a knock man maybe too quiet maybe he's too soft he just showed you not only does he embraced the physicality of it but he will throw hands if it comes down to it\nYou remember roof metal door of the Texas Rangers remember that fight a couple of years ago he fought Jose but these a couple of years ago and he cracked him with a clean right hand\nHow many guys have

I've got to tell you I haven't had a bad meal yet uh I I have had the fish and chips I've had the traditional English breakfast with beans\nOr it's all been good I I mean I'm not going to say it's the best food I've ever had but it certainly isn't the worst so so far that uh that reputation for the terrible food I have not experienced that happy to say\nSo the fish and chips are good then huh\nIt was fine yeah I mean like I said not the greatest regret but not not close to being the worst year this is good\nIs it better than the hot dog stand near Fresno state that usually go to when you go see a Fresno state game\n[noise] ah I don't know what you're talking about only eat healthy food I\nAm sorry about uh yeah I mean to pay you with a bad reputation eye to eye Eddie Garcia is that is live in London I see you're there for the chargers in the titans game what is it is there any bugs at all for the NFL in London\n[noise] you know what I Would say no I'm just from what I've observed just walking around I mean\nYou see a few titan sands you see a few chargers fans you know representing wearing their gear and stuff like that but uh not really no wonder you know like the the cab drivers or you know uber drivers we've had ... what are we doing here and then it'd be like oh yeah who's plan\nYeah so I I Would say honestly no and we'll be stadium is not in downtown that for people who don't know it's it's a ways away from downtown so you know it's not like all the activities around the stadium will be going on around downtown so\nYes I I Would say a plus look what are their three four games here this year in London so it's not as if this is a\nReal special events um but you know I mean people know of it but I Would say is there a big ... around it I don't think so\nMost obscure or odd Jersey you've seen thus far NFL Jersey that you've seen walking around London did you see somebody walking around like Stan Humphries Jersey or something like that\nI assume you know what this is this is hilarious considering what's just happened in the sports world recently\nI saw a Purdue football Jersey and this was before the Ohio State game and I thought wow that's weird [laughter] ah but other than the titans are the chargers I haven't seen any other jerseys I asked you know a lot of acts which is\nInteresting ah ... it was funny someone someone had told my wife you know it's all your husband don't work baseball caps 'cause you'll stand out like a tourist if you were a baseball cap or baseball caps London watch and I see based I see a baseball cap so over the place I don't know what that person is all\nAbout ... ... first of all nobody wears baseball hats more than any Garcia how many do you own\nOh I don't I don't know about first of all I don't know about that I I I don't think we're more than ... than other Arab but probably isn't\nOK you but I see where I'm a lot so the idea that that's not like a thing to do in London they just they just walk right is it raining there does it rain a lot there in London\nIt could well I'm as far as what I'm told yeah it's very rainy here but we have we've had almost no rain at all it's been the weather's beautiful um you know it's like high fifties\nTemp wise but the sun has been out every day we thought we were going to be in like drizzle and call ... ... and it's been gorgeous so we've really lucked out with great weather\nI'm Andy Garcia Fox Sports radio anchor of Fox Sports radio legend you here on Monday through friday on the ... show off her to many of these Fox Sports radio affiliates he's always antagonizing ... he's the guy who keeps Ben ... walking the straight line or at least he tries I he's joining us live from London here on FX are\nSo ... and I want is because you were talking about the obscure jerseys I can remember being in Albuquerque New Mexico on a road trip and pulled over to the side of the road and just randomly saw some guy walking down the street wearing a bears Jasmine Clark Jersey and I'm thinking to myself\nHow to how that happened I hadn't hadn't had as a producer here at the end up in London or you didn't even want to do just go asked the guy like came in are you from are are you from that neck of the woods or is that just like some guys I\nI was curious about the Purdue Jersey and again this was before the ... rapid so wow by sought after maybe I figured well some guy from that as a producer grab decided on the bus stop the Jersey just I'm so proud of my team\nBut uh and to be honest with you I haven't seen a ton of even like you know soccer jerseys or maybe that's not a thing over here where people were different ... I haven't seen any NBA stuff\nUh like I said I see a few Yankee hats which I thought was interesting but but other than that you know not not really much else other than the people that she here that are from either Tennessee or or you know Southern California\nNow you are a season ticket holder to the chargers is there a ... and are there are a lot of chargers fans out there I Know that's been an issue trying to get them to go to the games in Carson is are there chargers fans that that actually made the trip to London to go check this out and then you guys\nYeah we've had we've had a few on our our flight over and we went to a\nA NFL slash chargers sanctioned a party last night like a ... party a and I would say there were probably maybe three hundred people there and they were from all over the place I mean there were people certainly from Southern California but we met some people from Germany\nWere charger fan and I say some bird\nYou know there was a guy from Lux in Bergen I did ask him how he said well he's originally from Australia and he grew up when you're in it was hunting for the chargers [laughter] and and that apparently that was a huge deal in Australia there are a lot of charges that Australia because the air at it\nAnd now there's like I mean Australian ... and then if I think the Steelers even have a Australia punter it's not that big of a deal you see um daughter out of college football a little bit because they know to get scholarship but uh yeah it it is weird to figure out how someone becomes that absurd gee\nThat's amazing I now have you run into ... Travis I Know clay Travis is out there you're also al ... show here on Fox Sports radio uh he's out there with the titans have you run into ... you\nKnow I've got is I've got his number I'm going to text and when we get to the game because I Know towards the stadium at the same time so it's kind of seemed like laws logical place to\nTo meet up I've never met him in person so it will be kind of interest each finally be someone that you work with in London so uh yeah we'll see we'll see if that happens I'm guessing these sitting in a nicer place that I had put a mix a little bit more money than me so I get it\nAnd they already started to pre game Missouri tailgate going on our people already ... drinking like bonding tens or like a ...\nI at the time I said that's impressive a lotta people fold up a lot of people can't handle that I'm In the Atlanta Falcons Elkins figured it out give credit the LA Dodgers they could have easily just said All right we got all that way we got to a game\nSeven and we we weren't able to make it happen [noise] and instead they're back and so on and it's and it's good for major league baseball and that's not a shot at that the city of Milwaukee [noise] but\nMajor league baseball's got LA and they got Boston that's going to do big business and it's a it's a big win for major league baseball or what does it mean when I go says just Fifteen minutes gets they'd be Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance beach probably should have gone to a guy go dot com\nSafe gene minutes ago so we're talking about the brawl between the Lakers and the rockets if you're just tuning in\nUm ... brand in Ingram shoved James Hard and he was bothered by what had happened or in a play maybe felt like James Harden was taunting or whatnot or trying to say that he was they count the basket on an end one\nI shove them or they separated him then Chris Paul and Rondo started talking Chris Paul puts his finger in Ron does face or they're claiming that Rondo spit name but nobody can find proof of that ... Rondo popped in with just ate\nClean perfect to jab perfect left jab a couple of punches thrown but actual punches and then Brandon Ingram came over the top and he popped Chris Paul while the fight was going on\nAnd I said to start out the show I I Know that it's not a good look I'm not condoning Brandon Ingram popping a guy who's engaged in an altercation with somebody else but I'm telling you in a weird way he's gonna get respect\nThe knock on brand in England was always I soft he doesn't have a dog in him he doesn't he doesn't have that that bite to um eyes a little raw and needs to bulk up\nNow you know he will throw punches now you know he is capable of it it's like it in in baseball\nThrow behind the guy not not because you're trying to hit him what you're trying to let him know that you could hit him that that's a plus\nAbility and when you get them thinking about that then you throw them off their game and I'm telling you and you can think I'm Crazy but I've worked with and talked with enough athletes\nThroughout the course of time if you see something and somebody you just have to see a a just a small you have to see for one split second\nIf you see it you know oh so he's like that and\nI'm telling you players around the NBA or going to look at random Ingram differently after something like this\nBecause that was always the knock on um he saw he doesn't have the dog in him he's not like other players he's not capable of this and now you saw on a big time stage\nNot only will we get into a physical altercation but he will pursue the physical altercation and he will throw hands\nAnd you can call them a coward all you want and I get all that but my point is\nI sometimes stuff like that actually ended up working out in your favor and the example that I gave you was ... metal door ... metal door nobody had ever heard of\nAnd then he cracked Jose but these are where they clean right hand a couple of years ago nobody's ever mess with drew metal door sense nobody\nKyle Farnsworth of the cubs relief pitcher years and years ago slammed Kevin Wilson down on the ground a guy for the reds who charged the mound and bloody to space nobody ever stepped Farnsworth afterwards\nLike there's you can change your reputation it doesn't have to always be by the book\nBut you know it's like bon pitch perfect you can call them dirty all you want tell me receivers aren't thinking twice when they go over the middle and a game against the bangles\nAnd I'm not saying it's okay to do but but tell me we're Sievers aren't thinking okay worst perfect at at least in the back of your mind a perfect just got to find like a hundred thousand dollars or something like that\nAnd I remember having a conversation with a guy who played in the NFL for about ten years and he told me man you don't you're not thinking about when you take a helmet to the rib cage when you go over the middle you're not thinking about how much money you're going to make that game ... guys minds now and I'm telling you Brandon Ingram\nChanged his reputation you may not have liked how he did it but he he changes reputation on Saturday Night\nJonah stocks Fox Sports radio coming

the jags role I like Jacksonville MINUSTAH for\nJust say one pm eastern time kicked off in a game that should probably be in standard death every week it used to be back on the day every game would be

the toughest part about\nAny coach the first year especially though ... you know what I think he will eventually be there is a homeless guy just you know just just destroy everything and break it all down before you can build it back up\nAnd you know I I think that's the tough part for him if he's got to figure out a way of being able to keep everyone that the ... getting frustrated with what they look like right now because\nThey're so far behind everyone else and then it gets tough when you're the season like this to pitch to recruit\nUm which you obviously need they like how do how do you how do you pitch\nOr what do you say to those kids about the program that you're building a side thing you can come and play right away which who knows if there is a much truth to that and then they get into the battle that you face as you're playing a bunch of young players that you refer to come in and start right away it that means there's probably a couple of years from really being able to be\nCompetitive in a successful so I Will feed 'em and watch it there in the big can west I think go of your time coming back up in that position first they have these that's for sure\nYeah and you hear Brady talking about those Brady Quinn leaving last week when he was on the show like this is a bad situation Nebraska the idea that somebody throws out the thought that maybe it could be a one and done or what the school would oh Scott philosophy gets fired and members of college football media get outraged by it\nCome on man you got to look at this and and be and be honest about what you're watching nobody saw Nebraska being this bad\nNobody saw Nebraska being as bad they're terrible\nAnd Scott Ross comes up a week ago and and basically blames the defensive coordinator or blames one of his assistants for what happened I I just\nLike people to attach themselves cells to to certain coaches and certain people get free passes and I don't understand why there was nothing wrong\nWith bringing up the idea that a guy who was hired and brought in to be the savior of her program who is totally under wound and under performed at his job\nThe idea that he might be out of that job after a year I don't think that that's unreasonable and and you know if you listen to the show at all\nI hate\nAnd I will never say that a guy should be fired I Will never do that because I noticed like to lose your job and it sucks so I've I never played that game on the air and I never will but there are certain situations where I wouldn't be surprised if something like that were to happen and this would be one of them I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility\nBut because you grew up watching the guy and you saw him play football\nLike you you don't want to say that he's he's bad at his job or that there might be potential that he could be in trouble and he might lose his job but come on man\nI mean Jesus I look huge fan of the Easter Bunny huge fan of the Easter

who are getting two and a half points I hate doing that and the comparison I made was picking against the patriots is like when you walk into that dive bar in town the second you get in there you look at your buddy and you're like why are we here\nIt's the same people the same place\nThe same smell we continue to to think there's going to be a different outcome and they're never is why are we here that's the feeling when you pick against the patriots why are you doing it\nAnd then it partly the reason I'm doing it is because I think what we saw last week in Miami is a game that we rarely see not only in Miami but rarely see in the world of sports or anything that could happen did happen in one football game\nAnd there were a lot of circumstances in that game that led to what went down and why the bears fell apart down the stretch\nBecause\nThey go to Miami dealing with that humidity dealing with that heat dealing with that exhaustion and when did the bears start to get burned in that game by a backup quarterback they started to get burned late in the game when they were aghast that they were a little bit fatigue\nAnd they were running out and still even in that game the bears had an opportunity to win it but it was again conservative play calling by that nag e questionable decisions down the stretch and I miss field goal in overtime still they could have won that game\nSo I think it's going to be a good one ah the bears are not fared well historically gets New England patriots but I also in something that was brought up and it was a brilliant point of this week on straight out of Vegas I heard on a Fox Sports radio three to four Pacific time six to seven eastern time somebody brought this up\nWho to build bell a check just play a week ago just play the Kansas City chiefs where did Matt nagging come from Kansas City a lot of what the bears do is remnants of what they do in Kansas City and if there's anybody that can take advantage\nOf something like that it's Bill Belichick and I thought it was a great point that was brought up this week on straight out of Vegas Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox the phone number

so that is that are coming up next year on office are [noise] um\nSo we're going to do something we don't normally do here on Fox Sports radio we don't normally do this here on the show this is not normally done up we're going to break from routine and I'm going to tell you about an athlete who is using it may be the greatest\nOf all time as how not to do something find out who are talking about next year on officer [noise]\n[noise]\nOn the two\nPlayed one hundred sixty\nAnd now when for in your city is a world champion [laughter]\nWe live the Boston Red Sox the Los Angeles Dodgers World Series coverage righty [laughter]\nBut now they're here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why didn't you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we was another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car true car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide average or a of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simpler by experience what do you buy new or use and withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nThere also more likely to enjoy a faster buying experience by connecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car\nThan I think they got their guy but let's just be honest about it Sam Donaldson the best rookie quarterback so far\nHe just has here's the question when a pro I Want to pose to you if Kurt cousins were on the jets are they any better than they are now\nI Would say no\nI Would say absolutely not they're not a better football team I think they're kind of write about where they are a five hundred football team so not only a few of the New York jets did you save huge money on the quarterback position\nAnd so far it's not hurt you on the field all that much at all\nBut you also have bought yourself some time\nTo build the roster around Sam Donald because he's going to be on his rookie deal if you just look at this matchup on Sunday between the Vikings and the jets and you see how much differently things could have played out had Kurt cousins gone for the money as opposed to going for the better team\nI think the jets would potentially be in a worse spot than they are now a total wind for the New York jets Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox the phone number I gave me on Twitter at the Jonas knocks\nA coming up next it is time for a little

Debbie on climate or you've got all the pub and it pissed me off but never mind the way it works yeah everybody finds the favor of Israel do a little bit deeper that very ... very frustrating\nMelvin Gordon yeah what's what's the status of the plan is he not playing he was banged up it's questionable now what's going on\nWhy should well last reports still going to give it a go obviously will be monitoring that and we'll have all your last second uh updates as Dan and I get things going a little bit later but right now uh if you haven't uh Austin heckler was available and an awful lot of leads for a guy that touches the ball as frequently as he does\nAnd it's been so integral to what they do a you're looking at him as a back and number two and if he gets a chance to play it is a fulltime role\nMaybe that's the guy with top ten potential if he's the man so Gordon expected to go but this could also get lopsided ... sitting and and chill and having a nice you know lukewarm a Guinness before it's all done\nThey are they going to I Would think it probably maybe a bonding tens or any gross he I I Do like a ... yeah that's a good one Eddie Garcia got beer shame so Andy Garcia

both teams radio Cruz ready to go with Washington's call first we\nAre now\nIs all the way\nBoth sides now here's the call on cowboys radio from Brad Sham on one oh five point three to than Mars\nFifty two [laughter]\nRavens trail that saves twenty four to Seventeen scored a touchdown with twenty four seconds left to make it a one point game as Justin Tucker attempted the extra point for the tie on WBAL\nUp to this kick Tucker in and his entire career had attempted two hundred and twenty two extra points and had made two hundred and twenty two extra points suckers extra points\nTo tie the game they kick his op ed\n\nWhy Hi Justin Tucker has never miss an extra point in his career\nAnd the houses are literally shocked\nAnd finally in northern California the rams won at San Francisco thirty nine to tend to go to seven and oh Todd girlie to touchdown runs one touchdown reception for the rams guys back to you\nMad goodness gracious pickers are not\nA you know I don't want to be right now ... says he's really distraught right now and I feel you I feel I'm\nJust now sort of kind of sort of ... back out of the closet ... or ... to ... a whole lot of ...\nI Wish we were at the teriyaki place right now I Will get you some stock is [laughter]\nIt'd be it would be ... students just don't make no sense so you guys are going against who yeah what'd you were just discussing and ... because I Do want to tell the people that we are coming to you live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance visit with with a guy go\nGo to guy go to our comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier you guys want to discuss I I guess going for the way it was what you wanted\nTo talk about do you you you brought up a good point mobile\nAnd you said you know\nYou go for the tie or you go for the win right and I try to settle for the time you still had a timeout laugh right what come on\nSeriously go for the win so I'm not sure how many people saw the early early\nGame oh I Know what you're talking about yeah\nWith Tennessee and the Los Angeles chargers in London across the pond but Tennessee drives down the feel they scored a touchdown there within one point of time the game\nKicking the extra point time again similar to this situation\nJason a ... my ... my ... my credible\nThis as the head coach of the titans decides he's going to go for two\nHe's not going to kick the extra point for the tie he's going to run a to point play and win the game out right they did not\nThey failed they lose the game Tennessee Titans also game Nineteen twenty so I ask you in that moment do you think my ... made the right call for his team\nYes what do you for that specific team for this yes yes what about you a league\nKnow you got to tie it up you got to go to overtime they give the London fans a little more action okay so okay speaking to hold on leaf speaking not as a sports guy as a fan and let's say that's your team what do you want you want to uh overtime where you can possibly blow the game any way or just when it right now\nI I say go to overtime you got to force that over time see what you could do there you don't want to lose it on one play like that\nSo what you got to realize is let me set this up a little bit for you so\nThe second half of the game Tennessee Titans dominated right\nThey dominated they were able to move the ball at will they gave the chargers ... you know a trouble moving the ball so they were in in in farm control of the situation so instead of tying the ball a tiny ball game up in going\nInto overtime with the momentum you've built in the second half especially in the fourth quarter they decide hey look we're going to go for the win right now on a to point play\nInstead of putting the hands of the game of the hands of our defense you know in the overtime\nI'm Matt instant I'm thinking\nI'm On the fence right because if we just this is a great conversation because we just got both parallels at the same time right right we got one instance where they're going for two to win the game and then we have this incidents where they're going to try to tie to game instead of going for the win\nRight ... and\nThey both failed [laughter] said oh boy I Hope failed but it's all about what side of the coin ... my
