C.\nOne one left type and the message HVAC one and send it to the number three six to six zero\n\nHey let's talk filters for a minute\nAre you by being a cheap filter huh\nAdmitted just admitted okay well if you are you might want to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to completely disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely clean sanitize disinfected and put it back together and that\nCan get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your ... your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through okay\nIf you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a ... it's good for a golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay\nThat's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get one inch filter is a one inch pleaded\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouths your system just has a ...\nOur time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd to top it off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promised you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly your rock stoppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nYou know I Can't tell you how many people we talked to on a weekly basis have allergies or kids with allergies where we go out with clean up their system possibly pop in a better filter UV light and a system sterilize or or something like that for them and we get these calls\nMy kids aren't having the same type of allergy symptoms they were having before and we're not sneezing in the house and the whole process takes about an hour and a half to two hours to do the tune up\nNow look we've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've got maybe four maybe five of these left to give away at the discounted rate and I want to thank everyone who's called in today you know I don't think business people say\nThank you enough without people like you freedom

every single week here on bulls and bears is what's going on with this current market understanding how important preservation of capital is a lot of people a lot of listeners their four one K. their IRAs\nThey're up in value a lot of people are concerned about this correction and we got to talk about preserving capital and a lot of people think the way to preserve capitals just go to cash and there's so many other different ways of doing it checklist take a moment let's talk about it some of the other four one K. and IRA and capital preservation is a concern what are some of the options well it's\nA great time obviously since two thousand nine the market's gone up for year over year and so we've adjusted corrected you know we had the collapse in two thousand eight and we're sitting in on charted wars right now what's important to understand is that\nYou know long term there's only so high these prices can go there's only so high the Dow can do the rest of the U.S in these major indices there at all time highs\nAnd so what I Believe in what a lot of good successful traders investors believes that you want to sell it high you don't want to always be by it and the problem is a lot of people are still buying because of the complacency that we see in the market is very similar\nTo two thousand seven that great round the real estate market and you know houses were just going through the moon and value and it was so much demand and everybody qualify for a mortgage and we had this euphoric state of complacency where everything went up\nAnd we've had that again the financial markets especially the stock market the U.S market since two thousand eight or ... actually march of all night and the bottom of the market and it's gone up almost three hundred percent\nAnd yet people are still wondering where the top as well we were at the top or near the top and so the goal obviously is we don't want to give all those returns bag if we'd been diligent and stayed in the market now are up where we were before the collapse of overweight\nBut we're still could lose it all back if the market correction it will and so the key thing for people is how do I preserve capital how do I manage risk how do I take what the market gives me more importantly it will not get crushed if it goes against me and that's what capital preservation is and that's why a lot of people have to understand you need to do something when the markets at a high like this\nTo protect against the class because when that happens you missed the opportunity than it's too late\nExactly a lot of people miss the opportunity a lot of people miss the opportunity because it's not a priority gotta ask yourself what was the last time you sat down and said what are all my options in my four one K. what are some of the things I can and cannot do in my IRA account\nIf I have cast it on the sidelines is there an opportunity and a lot of people don't realize that you can protect your four O. one K. your IRA you can put insurance on that that's one way of simply doing it no different than having insurance on your house or your automobile you're going through your portfolio utilizing option strategies are hedging with a different asset class a lot of people don't understand this gym\nWell and they buy the lie of Wall Street Wall Street shells and they're not smart enough to manage their own money so put it in a four one K. let somebody else do it for you and that's a myth they don't want you competing\nUnderstand something folks it's a money game and Wall Street plays a different way than main street and you need to play like Wall Street and no to play like Wall Street you got to understand the process and see for a lot of people they don't understand that when the market goes down that's an opportunity to profit\nOr at least protect against loss and the masses get crushed in these moves down and Wall Street cleans up\nAnd so the markets gearing up for a collapse of correction overall the broad market that's where most of the four one K. money sitting it's all along it's all owning stocks that are in these mutual funds that everybody onto these four one K. positions and when we get that correction and that significant move down because prices get to hide things are overvalued\nThat's one of the give back comes in a lot of people that made money give it all back and here's the thing if it took ... years to get back to where you were before the collapse of overweight\nAnd now you're back where you were in a collapses again where are you going to be and now you're Twenty years old or Thirty years older and you know better off than see that's the problem the Math Doesn't work\nAnd so capital preservation becomes key because it allows you to sustain and keep them half work and so they can eventually get to the goal you set financially and many people never hit that go because they don't understand how to manage risk and how to preserve capital and that's a key on the success regardless of what you think the market's going to go up or down just being smart and smart about your money\nWell I mean the average person doesn't want to lose money they don't want to lose ten twenty thirty percent of what they have they don't want to you know just give money back to you know the market they want to be able to be smart and they want to protect it but the average person doesn't know how to do that and that's a simple thing is just a matter of saying and addressing you know I don't know what I'm doing I Need help\nAnd what you find is that it's a simplistic process it's really not hard complicated thing to learn how to protect your money\nI mean that Wall Street does or can sell to you as a product like an annuity or a whole life insurance any kind of institution that can sell you a product that's designed as an investment product for you you can create that product yourself\nYou can with a small base the knowledge learn how to get the same result that product gives you if you purchase it from them without pay and then the huge fees and all and tying up your money and having the full last full use of your own money it's it's just a different process is all about self directing its learning the skills of preserving capital\nUnderstand that when the market turns it shouldn't crush you you should capitalize on at least protect against loss in a market that changes and more importantly it's going to help you reach those long term goals use it for you and your family\nExactly an online training academy to sponsor ... and ... they understand that the average person wants to preservation of capital they just don't know how to do it that's why they have a class specifically taught on Capitol preservation this is for someone with a four one K. and IRA maybe you just have cash in the mark and you don't know how to preserve it\nIs a great class for you and the thing is is when you understand that you can protect your capital you'll sleep easier you won't be worried about market direction there's five hundred dollar value class I got a few seats to give away we're going to take callers right now Fifteen\nTo

monthly basis on a weekly basis let's take a while but let's talk about that ship what does it look like for someone to trade for short term income rather than long term invested\nWell let me tell you about a path that I Would say somebody down a senior coach on trade academy I Would\nFirst of all figure out if they had specific goals of their time available to utilize maybe an hour a day half an

technology available to us in this day and age wouldn't even have to be in the market live to execute trades and execute\nFrom a traitor investing standpoint we can literally just do it and set it\nTo automatically put us in a certain price get us out a certain price so we know what our max losses and our ... before we even get in so many ways that we can approach the markets from a standpoint of
