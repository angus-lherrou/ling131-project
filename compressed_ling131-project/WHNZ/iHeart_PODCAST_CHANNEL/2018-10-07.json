Campbell we've got a fascinating program for you today or yesterday says that their use use molecule in the human body and he says this molecule abuse happens to be concentrated in our skin\nHair eyes and joins he says this substance not only dramatically influences are appearance in other words how young are how healthy we look but more importantly our physical strength are flexibility and mobility\nIs our ability to do things ... things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it as we get older [noise]\nAll right here's our gas the health of journalists to bill ... here bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about ... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan\nWhere people maintain high levels VJ and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with your pet and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic acid supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support in particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offered today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule and the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age now you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nAmazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more and of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies\nWe have what we call baby fat it's really baby ha it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice\nThey never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly around a gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see this skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course ... products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints to people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone that's\nWhat age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones we lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically used pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... flew it\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule pat it's big you can absorb it and\nPurity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at a laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe prove that it's orally absorbed and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but purity\nProducts is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternative for their joint health and of course this isn't it\nGets a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as we think of it\nNow bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough and what exactly can do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time\nAnd that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our self\nBegins to

two and thanks to my guests today bill sorority author researcher an expert [noise]\nThey're proceeding was an advertisement by purity products these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA this product is not intended to diagnose treat your will prevent any disease [noise]\nThe proceeding was paid program paid for by purity products be opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those up W H ... am its staff management or parent company I our media incorporated [noise]\n\nThat's all it does the compliance test it really doesn't indicate that there were any practical application or knowledge of how to navigate the markets\nThere just license to sell you something they pass the test on compliance and what they can and can't say and do\nAnd so the problem with manage money and you know what what I Love about bowls and badges that\nWe're trying to separate ourselves from manage money a lot of people on the radio or talking about come down and we'll give you a portfolio analysis we'll give you a pie chart will tell you how to diversify and that's all fine and good but the reality is is that they're going to charge you\nAnd I love it because some of these people on the radio the talk shows they say well we've got these relationships with people that we've had for Twenty years yeah you've been building them for Twenty years\nAnd you call them family but a lot of times if they weren't paying you would you really consider the call them family\nAnd so manage money a lot of times is misunderstood because people think that guy that girl who's licensed knows more and knows how to protect me and how to put me in a position where I can get the best returns possible and that's not always the truth that's the live Wall Street is that you're not smart enough for sophisticated enough to imagine handle your own money\nUnderstand something folks a lot of people out there pitching annuities to you you need an annuity it's a fixed income proud of its pension is what it is essentially creating your own pension and that I knew that gives you a fixed rate of return for significant amount of time which is nice and a lot of people want that but here's the problem\nThe upfront cost the loads the commission on the front end a lot of times anywhere from four to ten percent so if you put a hundred thousand dollar nudey anywhere from forty grand goes to that guy that woman that license professor who just sold you went to the unity understand that\nNow here's the other thing a lot of times there's a term in other words if you want to liquidate your money you get liquidity out of that position you can't because you have to pay a penalty you have to pay a surrender charge up front that takes money off the bottom line as well and then there's early redemption fees and a lot of other things that come into play and I'm not saying there's never a need for these I'm saying there oversold\nAnd it blows up is we believe that you can create that same annuity the exact same thing that that license personal going to say it because they're representing Wall Street because they have a license and there was sponsored by a institution\nSo you're letting some institution manage your money and they're competing for the same way that you and are competing for there's a divergence of interest right there but what happens is some Wall Street firms not going to manage your money\nAnd the person who's actually making the decisions is Sonia what's in their inventory so for Newt he's in the image where they can sell it to you they get paid a large commission for that\nWe had ... and ... to tell you that you can create that same annuity that they're selling you yourself\nWith the same products that they use in the financial markets 'cause we can use those same products we have access to those you realize you can create a bond fund\nIn other words a fund that can give you a five or six protect return with very low risk and not pay any loads or upfront commissions and literally be able to create that yourself and get the same returns that you need to get out of it uh nudey without having to pay all those high fees and more importantly having full liquidity in your position needed cash out you can't\nThere's so many things out there and we're trying to separate ourselves because we don't want to manage your money is not what this is about this is about you learning to manage your own money you learn how to self direct you will and if you learn the skills it allows you to make better returns\nFor less cost think of that and that's what we're really hear about and that's why if we don't tell you this no money is going to tell you that you should put your money and self directed they got to tell you put it on a management with me with us of course they are because they have a vested interest in your participation\nBe careful folks you can learn the skills of self directing is not a complicated process you have to go through a learning curve but it's available and what I Love sponsor\nThey teach people how to do it more importantly learn it somewhere learn how to self directed make better decisions yourself because ultimately if you don't get the returns you want and you know hit those retirement goals\nAnd you have no say in the decision where are you then a lot of people are worried about run out of money that's a real risk in this country and that's the problem that a lot of people are facing well\nHave you know a lot of individuals they think they don't have enough time they don't think they're smart enough they think you know they don't have enough money that it's you know they should be focusing on it and people make reasons and they make excuses all the time when they don't miserable money ... realistically you know how much time as again take somebody six to ten hours a month I have students that I might try to get him that I personally coach it's managed their wealth in six to ten hours a month\nThey don't have to where they get the same returns or better returns\nThat all those products available out there and he has a beautiful thing they can make money when the market goes down to the problem with a lot of those money managers that they put you in some sort of a position where if the market was up make money the market goes down you give it back\nAnd if it doesn't go up dramatically enough the fees that they're charging you take up the profitability that you do get so we've got a plan in place where you can make money regardless of direction more importantly\nYou'd have to pay all those fees and ultimately get those returns you want and what's great about that as the increase\nProbability lowest cost that's a no brainer that's why self directing is becoming so prevalent and so many people looking for a chance to learn how to do that exactly in our sponsor online training academy they teach a class specifically on self directing\nNow whether or not you have a four one K. and Iran maybe have some cash in a in a trading or invest in account managing your own money that's unique for you understand there's a five

radio a lot of content let a behind the scenes stuff\nWe're getting out their social media to yeah it's great and we've got some uh advance that we do we got a YouTube channel that's going to be launching here soon so a lot of great content deep depth and a dive in some of the things that we talk about we take a deeper dive into it so uh yeah well once that's available that YouTube wall is ...\nIn ... and we traveled the world I've been all over the planet talking to people about trading and investing and what's universal is that people want to make income they want to generate additional income and the markets are a great way to do that and the problem is is that a lot of people when they hear the word trader\nThey check out they think will for Wall Street the movie Wall Street greed is good some guy in suspenders sitting on Wall street overlook in Manhattan and that couldn't be further from the true some of the most successful traders that I Know people for income to generate an income in the markets on a daily or weekly basis\nOr people just like us that you blue collar white collar stay at home moms I mean pizza delivery people barbers I mean scientists we have a lot of surgeons that have had success in the market so what's important is that it's a skill set that you learn over time but once you learn the skill set think of the benefits there's about forty million\nTrading accounts in the United states you know a trade Schwab GD marriage rates got trade and most of those traders based on our knowledge are not successful they love the sexiness of the opportunity of being able to sit at their home and speculate on price change in a marketplace they loved that but if they don't have a good system in place are good set of rules\nThey normally aren't
