{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "H. I. V. A.\nC. one one left side bend the message HVAC one and send it to the number three six to six zero\nHey let's talk filters for a minute are you buying a cheap\nFilter huh admitted just admitted okay\nWell if you are you might want to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to come ... Lee disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely clean sanitize disinfected and put it back together and vet can get expensive\nWe're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through okay\nIf you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay [laughter] that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a ... it's good for a golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at\nFiltering your air and it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay\nThat's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money okay\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police raided\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and\nIt can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six and Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive then the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them\nAbout every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock steppers you're saying ... votes and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nYou know I Can't tell you how many people we talked to on a weekly basis have allergies or kids with allergies where we go out with clean up their system possibly pop in a better filter UV light and the system sterilize or or something like that for them and we get these calls\nMy kids aren't having the same type of allergy symptoms they were having before and we're not sneezing in the house\nAnd the whole process takes about an hour and a half to two hours to do the tune up\nNow look\nWe've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've got maybe four maybe five of these left to give away at the discounted rate and I want to thank everyone who's called in today you know I don't think business people say\nThank you enough without people like you freedom heating and cooling just flat out wouldn't exist All right\nWe know that

supplements out there not Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides a good multi vitamin insufficient oil maybe a few other things\nGo into the three super hot nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... there trawling apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated the isn't there a host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor ... I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza there a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that green tea Kirk human from to recruit\nAnd ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super foods the green tea human different spiritual why didn't you want to combine this re there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other work better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to put them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kinda like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resveratrol in one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging\nBut what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood unify on you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity\nIs really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume ... don't actually wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the end\nI or world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body\nFrom premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glued a sigh\nOn when we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue to science so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue the thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula really offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most\nPowerful supersedes on the planet you can positively influence our DNA maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of Kirk human\nWhich seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know that term Kirk human\nThey may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor Rick and its derivative ... humans since the Nineteen seventies\nWell I especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver\nAnd we know that Kirk human protects the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps it strong\nFrom a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart it's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief and stable inflammatory activity\nBetter joint mobility as a result of taking ... I like the brain protective studies as well I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind\nAnd Kirk human delivers solve this so I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware pat but most people are not going to eat enough rock tumor Rick route to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated curriculum and extract\nChris I don't want to get to technical here but these anti oxygen green tea or classified as police females and there really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists but in his green T. C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea it's got the ... the spiritual to be talked about\nClass grape seed extract pine bark bio flab annoyed vitamin C can you talk to me about this is ray of really super anti accidents and Polly feels that you put in the formula\nOkay we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here grape seed extract in pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described\nBut also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for extra boost in antioxidant activity additionally the bio flab annoyed and\nHence the overall activity of vitamin C.\nAnd vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen if we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C.\nWe realized that we would have an utterly superior formula and just to reiterate pat I Want people to experience dynamic health and this formula the green tea CPR

can people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking this formula\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort\nI think they'll feel more energy\nBecause these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control I think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality when you detoxify the body\nWhen you have a more highly functional immune system\nYou just feel more energy and better overall it's kind of you know like those days when you get up and go wow I feel great this is a while I feel great formula\nNow Chris the green tea see are limited history to provide you bought three cups worth of green tea and each to cancel

Thursday and and if you haven't already you have to check out our radios newest podcast twenty ... this is the show where we sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around us\nThis week we got real with Melissa Etheridge has we discuss what does it mean to be family family's family ... you can make family family's loss that you bond\nWell that's a beautiful thing about the financial markets that are broken will allow layers of their inventory into the market before price falls\nWith the goal of us than buying it back and giving it back to the broker after price fall so let me give an example I say in September eighth of tens of right around that time you decided to use the clock was going to fall in price and you went to the markets and you said I Want to sell a hundred she has a clock\nNow it's a hundred and twenty bucks a share so your broker would basically say okay we have inventory that you can sell and we'll let you utilize our share of clock to sell into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share so what we're doing is we're going into our trading platform we're executing a short sale\nAnd what that does that sells a hundred shares of ... into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share on our behalf\nNot understand we don't own the stock broker owns the stock they're allowing us to utilize their shares to sell into the market at the market price which was a hundred and twenty so we do that now with considered short the stock now here's what happens\nWe believe prices gonna fall well\nHere seven weeks later clocks at Ninety and it's it's actually happened so we're using a real world example it clock at Ninety you decided at night and you're gonna bite back so when you go into the market and buy it back it costs you Ninety bucks this year to buy it back when your soul that you took it a hundred and twenty\nWhen you bought a back because you're Ninety\nNow the moment you brought it back the sheer that came out of your brokers they've been toy originally now when you buy back immediately go back in your broke his inventory in other words they're made whole with their shares of clock they got their stock back\nNow what did you do well you sold at a hundred and twenty seven weeks later you bought it at Ninety think about that you bought low and sold high you just sit in reverse order that's the beautiful thing about the markets we can do that\nIt's a real strategy it's called shorting short selling and that's why we're talking about we banging the drum every week you need to understand how to make money regardless of direction and because of that you just made thirty bucks a share on the stock that fell that you've never owned think about that\nSo in a hundred years you made three grand on a thousand shares you made thirty grand\nThink about that folks that opportunity is real and exist and it happens all the time in the market and we get movement down like machine a lot of lately there's tremendous opportunity in the market now imagine if the ... falls forty to fifty percent like a lot of people are calling for magic view is short that position what could that turned into and your financial life see the beautiful thing about the markets is\nUp is good and down is good once you realize that it's a game changer\nAnd that's why online trading and kept me the sponsor bulls and bears they teach people how to short so\nThey teach people how to capitalize on a downward moving the market the average person knows it can happen they don't know how to do it\nAnd that's why they teach those classes a five hundred dollar class that they teach at the campus and we actually have a few seats for this class to give away the losers right now now if you have money out there

lot of great people that have tuned in and said man the stuff's really helping us\nYou guys are making the impact with us You're showing us the true\nWay the markets work the lives of Wall Street which we always talk about him most embarrassed understand something folks you're smart enough to imagine self direct your own money we believe that when the market goes down that's not a bad day diversification doesn't mean that you're safe\nAnd the trend is it always your friend and those are the things that Wall Street teaches the masses and we're here to break that down show you the real Wall Street show you how institutions approached the markets and more importantly how you can profit regardless of what's happening exactly and you know a champ\nOne of the big things right now is a lot of people are concerned you know this is reminding me of the market in two thousand seven I met a bunch of people in those seven and people are like the market's up\nStarting to get shaky I don't know one is going to collapse I don't know one I don't know what to do should I go to cash and I buy more and really the ultimately comes down to we got to preserve what we have and a lot of people have had a good run since March of two thousand and the markets gone up\nAnd now all of a sudden everything's ... around and people are freaking out a little bit let's talk about how they can protect how they can preserve the capital that they have eerily similar to two thousand seven record high\nStarting to get these big moves daily big intra day movement in the S. and P. and the Dow in the Russell I'm it's just a repeat of the film and here's the thing\nIn two thousand eight many people lost a lot of money about forty or fifty percent of money and the four one K. and manage diaries was transferred out of those accounts and that wasn't lost\nJust went to somebody else some understood how to make money regardless of direction so there's a lot of listeners right now and if you're driving down the road right now and you're hearing us in two thousand and if you're four one K. got hurt badly because of the collapse\nHere we are ten years later we're expecting other collapsed and many of you probably most of you haven't done anything different you're still not four one K. you still get all that money at risk think about that and I'm going to be blunt shame on you this is your wealth\nAnd you are not changing anything ... things you can do to protect and preserve capital this things you can do even in a four one K. or an IRA to not lose in a collapse of the market at least

stuff that doesn't quite make the stuff that goes on the editing room floor [laughter] out of that though\nJay handles all that by the cuts slices places and then we got to get ... you'll see the real reality when you go to the ... exactly\nDon't forget to check that out she had one of the things that you know it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there\nThe average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know working out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... raise the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success\nIn the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really to self direct to self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough to manage your own money 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that maybe they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money into management you gonna pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nIn the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA craft there those trust you have your phone K they they wrote that shorter they wrote that prospect is and you pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not\nThe only guaranteed return your phone one case the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the lord you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money champ it's not free money because now you're gonna have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you're going to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money in one direction\nThink about that you bought that you you you went all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're gonna hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self directly you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key it's long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them one day when you want to retire and their answers now said well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's this there's working\nWell the average American is way short financially of ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem is the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s managed diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students at all I ... that's been six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that if you can make one percent among wasn't my goes up down and said we can do that consistently over time\nYou put a compound in calculator it gets powerful and the problem is is that many people can't make one percent among because the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price of the marketing these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing a learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people will see in this Adam\nAre coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die the Math Doesn't work and I need to change the formula and you know that former means no change in that formula means\nSelf directing taking control that bucket and making the decision to self 'cause who cares more about your money then you you should be in control of it you should be making those decisions and ultimately you could hit those long term goals if you get the consistency and that kind of an monthly what trend that we're focused on\nAnd that's key the long term goal that long term goals are going to separate you from the masses\nOnline training academy they have a class specifically on self
