pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just sit back for a moment I Know you've been working with purely products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now that your co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as Missouri's role especially your heart healthy and you'll see some ways it's got even more evidence so let me ask you this who needs you know what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what our co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell ... is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful antibiotics and and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten in your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient stay your heart and he's co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle your brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver\nSo needless to say we need all of this energy\nThat case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential well\nNothing better than I Do you told me that it was time to bind to ... and the reserve control now why is the problem is cutting edge combination purity goes if they're huge super boost formula what can actually do people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called it the advantage I like that so I adopted the term\nIs combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits\nBenefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and enduring center robot capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on beat a boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nYou know we're talking with Dr Allen must know that you tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten decisions\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire well the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is a key nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nYou know I Know you've used in recommended you tend to patients for decades but now the story is better we funds researcher merging on reserve patrol\nSoup you tell your in these combined ... blended with co Q. ten you hope you do you want them to give away a full size bottles for free and they finally agreed but how would you distill the benefits and you had to list the top three or four reasons formula what would they be\nRoad number one without a doubt the energy the door and the
