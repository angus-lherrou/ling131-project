Marshall okay good well then it\nYou know all these things sound really good to me when you wake up in the morning in bed or the feet enhance still cold yes they are okay All right then let's go to circulation\nSo circulation the number one thing you would try at first just to see if it's an issue is you can go on to something called Cirque you go this promotes micro circulation throughout the body\nAnd that your body weight I Would just go to for pre meal and just see if in two or three days you have a difference for your hands and feet if you do\nThen I'm going to recommend that you go on a biofuel diet and use strictly follow it so there's no oil nothing that says occasional are rarely you don't eat any of those things for at least thirty days\nAnd see if it now promotes a better circulation to their hands and feet if it does then it's the food that's doing this to you and it sounds like that's the case because it sounds like you've got all the all the things the adrenal is need you could try\n... be and see if it does any good for you maybe one or two teaspoons per day and just see\nIf that benefits you at all and when you wake up from sleep you feel rested\nDraw okay well if that's true in all the adrenal things except maybe the beat vitamins should be good in ... that would rule out the adrenal those in my mind so um get a copy of the biofuel diet what I Would do is just\nBe very strict for thirty days and see if it changes the game if it does then wow since\nChildhood then I Would agree that the something or some issue with circulation and I'd get to work on it as\nQuick as you can okay thank you sir you will come by now right this is Dr Bob\nMarshall PHD this has helped blind live that don't miss today is really great specials\nYour chance to if you're

U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it\nBut scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful supersedes on the planet you can positively influence our DNA maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this patented\nB. C. M. Ninety five\nFormula of Kirk human with seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know that term Kirk human\nThey may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying ... and its derivative ... humans since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied as there's\nCouple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidants we know that it\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective it helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that\n... actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this and specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so when you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we talked about the green tea in the human in your new green tea GR liquid soft formula which purity is giving away for free today but tell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines and the science behind her spiritual\nI Know it's from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like\nGreen tea and also like Kirk human extract it's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin insensitivity\nResveratrol helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator\nAnd you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this\nIs why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health but ... appears to be key in that and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like there is with the Kirk human with blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resveratrol you get rain blood flow\nThis means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused so this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nIt again we're talking with Chris killing all you needed the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Christmas laser in on this wonderful formula you greeted to judge Judy ...
