today packed today we're talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYeah this is an exciting topic talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea Team right but for those that don't know about pre teen it's mainly use in the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders\nCollege high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger\nMore powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle to shoot as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pet great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nYou share some of the science and tell us\nWhy you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nSure pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system and its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power\nIt's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most it powers up the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction and it's important help maintain strength\nAnd muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis or anything like that it keeps your muscles powered up in their higher energy state so they're strong and ready for action packed\nHere's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies you see we have lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had ... stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies meet a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't\nDo that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles now the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps South Korea teen in your muscle tissue\nAnd you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance strengthen performance and tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used it body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coaches of course\nThey knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed and I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes\nTo enhance their performance and now\n... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity\nHas this incredible new formulation we call it ever a strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger and stay stronger with hundreds of human studies and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and he's like four pounds of red meat and most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient and I put 'em on average strong\nThey noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp stay vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus there's like you and me pat let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals okay\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American University is a group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we know that's not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that\nIt shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their chest pressed by seven percent they increase the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationary bike pat this happened in one week when I think that it's really quite incredible\nAll right but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies gets stronger to\nAbs Luke ... let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women published in the European Journal of applied physiology
