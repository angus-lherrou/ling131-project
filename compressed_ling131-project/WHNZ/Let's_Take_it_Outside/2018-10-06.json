Believe you have a list of questions you want to fire\nAbsolutely a bill you're on a mission to help people correct this issue we're faced with an an adequate in teak magnesium seems like about half of our population just doesn't get enough that means millions of Boston are assigned to do so let me read the list you're the magnesium does about ten things in the body\nWill simply amaze you a spinal for energy ATP production healthy bones joins healthy heart rhythm and cardio health\nHealthy blood pressure blood sugar managing inflammation promoting circulation sleep mood bill how can one mineral do so much\nIt does well every cell of the body has magnesium in it and there are lots of things that regardless of magnesium anything for him and assets dire addicts even lots of calcium which competes with magnesium so the more calcium you and take the Martin ... magnesium you need\nIt it's kind of missing from our diets it was there a hundred years ago before we use phosphate fertilizers and so I'm deficient and uh we're paying the price for it we can get it back but the problem is dietary supplements\nLoaded with magnesium aren't very absorbed and so now we have a little breakthrough in Maggie vantage from purity products magnesium ... what it means is\nThe wonderful magnesium ions combined with ... and amino acids so it's ... and its buffered and it's easy to take and it's highly absorb mobile and we're going to be telling the audience more about it\nAnd of course we need it we have to have it for life and we're not getting it fortified foods out of what's

... white can eat and also a little bit of sneaking vitamin D so talked about this breakthrough formula magazine in age from ... why do you like it so much\nLike it 'cause it's highly observable that's the problem I like it because it has the right dose three hundred and fifty ... milligrams when they said this on label it needs to be the elemental forms that key later the miss class in this case you'll see magnesium ...\nMagnesium sulfate make Newseum oxide the last part of that is the key later well here we have ... the issue is is that they frequently give the\nTotal amount not just the elemental magnesium and so this is full three hundred and fifty milligrams of elemental magnesium and it's combined with vitamin D that helps you utilize it better\nAnd of course for on or on his little mineral you just give about three milligrams of it and it tends to maintain high levels of minerals particularly magnesium\nAnd so we we it's a normal lives are so we want to have it in their
