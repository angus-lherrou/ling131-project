said you know business can do better if we keep our national debt\nUnder control foreign and going way back they said there shouldn't be any national debt well that's the only couple of times but is

I Lived in a different state for my father at the time so it didn't really know what was going on at home\nYeah um and and the work that you do at\nA a ... tell us a little bit about the kind of a day to day uh involvement that you have with the organization\nSo I'm a teacher as my job I teach kindergarten um but this is my passion and this is where I volunteer\nI'm chapter board chair so we basically our chapters us and we have eight board members and we all have our little next that were really great at and I kind of just manage that\nI'm communicating a lot over email with people who are interested in having trains or want to be at our then to reach out to people to come to our events and I also\nUm do save talked trainings where I go around and try and people in the community and suicide prevention\nAnd I also do advocacy that's my passion smoker so I go to Tallahassee every year for the state capital day\nAnd speak to legislators about suicide prevention legislation and mental health share my story with them briefly and then talk about why this is important to us and me as a constituent I Need your support on this out in the past we got a bill passed that would\nNot mandate teachers they get training that's what we're going for originally but they didn't like the language of mandate but it would highly\nEncourage school districts to make sure all of their teachers are trained in suicide prevention wasn't incentivized or the only incentive what's to be a\nCertified as a suicide say for school\nSo my goal eventually is to get it where this has mandated that all teachers must be required to take\nTraining and suicide prevention and it needs to be\nSo they can spot the warnings on such exactly and it and he's like another level of uh you know awareness\nAnd prevention I mean if you really think about it so again\nI'm never to killer of argue as suicide and they spend more time at school than they really do at home right so\n... that story you've heard from ... as well as myself as if we had known the warning signs we might actually be in a very different situation with so the the value of the individuals that are spending more time with our youth in their own parents is really their\nRights and and let me ask you this this might sound like kind of a dumb question but very moral here to learn a your situation Randy your situation Hannah you had a fourteen year old son you had or forty seven year old ... forty six year old father\nIs different in terms of the warning signs or how you deal with individuals like you know a a teenager compared to a grown adults\nMan is does that play a role in in all of this\n[noise] I think sorry go ahead [laughter] I think every person displays different warning signs and it's more of like what you know if that person and how their character is\nDidn't big changes yeah that's the constant really yet\nReform from our eye out radio studios here in Tampa this is best of debate highlighting the people and organizations that represent the best of the Tampa Bay area\nI'm your host running dormant in this episode we're joined by the American foundation for suicide prevention and with us in Studio ...

S. S. P. dot org and when you go there or you can see you can look for these specific chapter here in the Tampa Bay area it's very easy to find and you can find out more information about the events that are doing including the upcoming out of the darkness\nA walk let me go to you brandy I'm ... ... what are your thoughts on some of the more important parts of the programs that you guys do\nAnd what I was thinking about my own experiences and what I gained from al ... and I really think a lot of it comes down to awareness in education in our communities I think\nSuicide and suicide prevention isn't necessarily the most common topic of conversation so I think that's probably where this organization drives the biggest value\nUh we are the largest private funded organization that's really driven ... mental health and suicide prevention\nAnd this is an issue that lately has gotten a lot of attention and has been a lot of focus on because some of the more high profile suicides and we've seen recently\nWhen you have a celebrity like Anthony Bourdain or somebody like that who winds up committing suicide and then the bad news becomes front and center how does that impact the work that you do and the attention that your organization gets\nYou know so it's always sad when you lose a life um and we would never want a celebrity or a non celebrity to live their life or the west side so I just want to put that out there first there's obviously benefits when it is something that is being talked about it a national level because it's a\nIt's bringing the conversation home yeah and really opening the door to to actually mentioned the word suicide and have those conversations so I think whenever there is\nA a celebrity that has died by these means on it's a time for us all to recognize that this happens all over the world and it's actually very common and we had ... over forty one thousand death by suicide every year just in the U.S alone\nWhile do is there a specific\nIssue or need here in the Tampa Bay area that you see we have a very large military community and veteran population here we know the suicide rates among those groups are are extremely high or what is unique to the Tampa Bay area\nAnd you're working in either of you a hand or brandy can can comment on this or that you've seen ... you know working with Tampa Bay chapter\nIs really interesting question obviously we have a very high military presence in the Tampa Bay area and veterans are at a higher risk for suicide and\nSo that's always something that's really prevalent in our area and and it's very important to all of us I can share myself I lost my fourteen year old son to suicide on and suicide is the second leading cause to use at our country so um I see I might be slightly invested in the fact that\nI'm understanding suicide rats for all categories of our population is really critical\nWe're talking to the American foundation for suicide prevention here on best of the bay in Studio with me I have had a giant brandy Pauline and when you when uh the website is a F. S. P. dot org they've got a great walk what you're going to talk about and just to be coming up here in the Tampa Bay area\nUm let's talk about you and if you don't mind uh going through your story renting in particular so kind of step us through how this took place in your life and and how you know eventually you wound up working with the organization\nSure absolutely and so as I mentioned I lost my fourteen year old son to suicide actually almost five years ago five years in December and and I\nSay that we are a normal family we have good jobs you know we don't we didn't necessarily struggle and it was our we were had a teenager at home which is always challenging when you have a a teenager at home and and\nThere were things that Tyler really enjoyed and we started to see some some warning signs that um where he didn't want to do the things that he enjoyed on his grades started slipping on he was I'm\nUpset all the time and so what was really hard for us is whenever you go out to Google or talk to any of their parents are like that's a teenager for you yeah and so\nIt seemed almost like even handle teenager just going through some things\nExactly and you know as a mom as a parent in my gut was telling him he had something doesn't feel right here just doesn't feel normal for the person that I knew 'em and because I was an educated about the arrest signs\nIt was really easy for me to say okay you're right it's a normal teenager behavior and I think what's really really important is that we always trust our guy and we always err on the side of caution sure so if there's a risk there um\nAnd I know I'm getting a little off topic but no all the way up on that rats but I did not because I liked the idea that this was this was just a teenager I Am a normal family of course suicide isn't going to impact me unfortunately suicide did impact me\nUm and that's what got me to be involved in a F S P it was actually really ironic um because the Tampa Bay walk\nWith on the one year anniversary of my son staff or while it ... it really hit home so it really hit home and what else am I going to do but I'm going to go and fight for suicide prevention and through my efforts with a F S P I Know I personally become educated on those warning signs and what I\nCould have done differently but also recognize when you don't know you\nDon't ... ... what are some of the things looking back now and knowing the warning signs that the standout to you\nI I really think it was the drastic change in his behavior and the swift ... change a so he wasn't enjoying the things that he normally enjoy he had a very negative view on um everything's so and then it was this um\nHe thinks that he didn't care about he would give away that's a huge sigh over the army's giving away cherished items yeah um\nAnd I think no one really big item for me is when I started seeing me is what I Know now as I actually should have confronted him and it was okay to say I recognize that this is not your normal behavior\nAre you thinking of suicide\nAre you considering taking your life\nIt seems like that's probably a really big leap for somebody to make it's almost like you don't want to mention that ... was that kind of what you were feeling\nAbsolutely out as a parent of you I'm In being an educated I was afraid to say that word because I was afraid that that might place the idea in his mind which makes sense which we now know six six so that is actually very inaccurate sofa so think about us as humans\nWhen we have our mindset on something it's set on something if you're not thinking about suicide at all and you're just going through a hard time someone suggesting it isn't going to just put that idea in your head unless it was already in your head\nAnd so when you asked directly like brandy was sane it opens up that conversation it frees the stigma it let that person know wow\nThis person cares and they're open to talk about it and then that's where you can prevent suicide and if the person is not thinking about suicide and you ... it's still okay because it's still shows that you care for that person\nSo I think it probably also says something about my understanding of my of my trust and and my relationship with God and those kinds of fear\nIt seems to me that fear could also be a result of uncertainty not knowing where things are going to go and so you fear what could happen\n... exactly yeah I'm I'm One of those people that I I I'd probably do myself a harm by thinking about all of the possible results of a situation you know so I can imagine like forty different horrible things that could happen\nYou know I'm so uh I I tend to I tend to let my mind think through those things and sometimes I noticed that that will that will actually\nImpact me emotionally that I Will be fearful about a consequence that I have determined to simply be a possibility in my mind and trying\nTo realize that there's there's plenty of real things to be fearful about instead of just being fearful about the thousand things that I make up [laughter]\nIn his sermon Dr Hoffman says when fear is so thick you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is a God and where God is\nNo fear now I couldn't agree with that more you know as we're talking about this I only thought of the illustration as I was coming down here about the story of when I was a child but\nThinking about that statement and also thinking about some forty six and that he's using it as that of a mighty fortress you know kind of thing I thought well I Know of course I didn't know this but uh in a way I was kind of building a fortress ... directs yeah with prayer\nBut that is true in the darkest times God is that defense he is that light that cuts through that darkness we also know from scripture that a lot of times we don't necessarily see the light of God and unless it's dark\nOr to put it another way we see it more clearly are more brightly when it's dark\nSo ... it's interesting that when you talk about faith and you talk about people's relationship with God through Christ that if you ask them to tell you a story about it many times are going to tell you a story about darkness\nA story about fear a time when God made a difference in their daily life so in many ways without these times of fear without this times of broken it's without these times of darkness\nMaybe we wouldn't understand God's graciousness and provision as much as we do today\nTo learn how you can
