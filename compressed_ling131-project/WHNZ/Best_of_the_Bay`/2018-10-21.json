radio [noise] download it on our radio\nStudios here in Tampa this is best of debate highlighting the people and organizations that represent the best of the Tampa Bay area I'm your host Ryan doormen in this episode\nI'm a child as a thirty percent chance of dying and and that's kind of becomes your focus throughout this journey and we never want a family to feel that if they lose a child that they're not part of our pediatric cancer community because they most certainly are\nUm we offer financial assistance emotional assistance um where they're from the families from the time they're diagnosed\nOn depending on what program that go into we have massage therapy um dog therapy on top of our horses we have an incredible pet therapy music therapy\nWe also offer kidding around yoga which is a certified program for moms and caretakers to\nParticipate in yoga with their child which is another very special program we kind of let the doctors do whatever they need to do medically and we kind of filling the rest and if we can't we love to collaborate and partner with a lot of fellow charities here in Tampa Bay will make sure that we get it done\nOr second focus is research we fund and operate the only pediatric cancer research lab in the Tampa Bay area\nUm we work under the direction of Dr tabby who is full time with no compensation in his lab he's working on the vaccine for leukemia or wildlife to eradicate leukemia like we did polio\nAnd never have to say your child has cancer a lot of funding goes to the cure which of course we all want but if we could prevent\nA childhood cancer and not have to put another family through this is his goal it is a five face study he has just started the force face so it's very exciting and we've moved down to our my study and we've partnered with the Moffitt Cancer Center our lab is not licensed for live animals so we are partnered with Moffett\nWho work with Dr teddy on the vaccine so but a very very exciting year in that respect Kathy Castor came down from D.C she she loves what we're doing and is very supportive of the research effort\nBenefit I was like a lot of progress is made of you're already in the ...\nIt does um I Will tell you it's been forty years but ah [laughter] they're slowly but surely projects access getting there and that's because doctors have he has also been a fulltime treater\nA gets up in the morning and takes care of the children was teaching at USF and in the lab but the last uh Eighteen months he's been fulltime in the lab so we're seeing a lot of progress or their focus is our legislative effort um we travel up to Capitol Hill twice a year\nWe bring nine or ten of our families with us and we'd share stories we ask Congress and the Senate to please give us more than four on average um cancer research dollars four cents\nOn the dollar goes to children Ninety six cents on cancer research dollar goes to the adult cancers\nSo what part of a national campaign to\nChange that um so we bring the kids up with us and we were very very excited and I'm not getting political here don't yell at me but I'm On June fifth President Trump did signed the star act which was exceptionally important for pediatric cancer and increased um our research dollars by thirty three million dollars for pediatrics so\nThat is extremely that took us eight years but we got there so um that was very exciting our fourth focus is our partnership with the Hillsborough County schools one of the things I'm as a pediatric cancer social worker I never thought about\nWith school I'm never thought about it until it was my own ...\nRun a Kennedy executive director of voices for children the website you can go to to find out more about what we're talking about on the show is children across borders\nDot org thank you so much for coming in and you let me start with you share a meal or tell us about children across borders before we get into how all three organizations are are connected or tell us a how children across borders got started in in the work that you guys do\nShow 'em so up the way it got started with uh some years ago my husband and I were a considering me going back to work and um [noise] I um when did you do something more meaningful and some to give back and so we decided as a entity to the doctor and cross borders which was I'm\nA dual idea of getting back to\nA local community or the country but I'm a in a way we live and the country if a bug in there and um and so that's why the named children across the borders because um the idea was to help children that will disadvantaged under privileged\nUm ... uh education health shots when bonus\nAnd a Tupac now like with like minded organizations like the one voice and voices for children\nI'm and I'm to bring in a funds to help these children grew and um and done so education we've got many many different uh put programs in education\nUm health we do can so and one is um with um housing we have shelter programs and then when the programs or you know king drinking water for example uh basically so we started this program we started the organization really for me to uh go back to work for\n'em but didn't have a meaningful way yeah and um and it has grown since we started in two thousand and I got an international coach from the IRS\nAh in two thousand nine and it'll be ten years next year prefer um it has grown tremendously we had we started off with full organizations\nAre now we have Fifteen oh ... wow ah Fifteen programs to countries and over two million raised so um so that's the gist of the organization so a mission really is um bullets to support financial and non financial um uh programs within ... nations\nAre in these full edits education health and wellness or children focus I'm helping our community first nationally our country and then getting back to India where we're from\nOkay great so let me ask you this you started in two thousand nine or two dozen Eighteen now um how is the need grown or lessen during that time frame\nA you know that's a tough question um I think it grew and if you ask me and of course India is very different from the United states has you know the need in India is probably ... times more um\nBut the accountability is all of a tough so it's it's it's a tough it's a tough job but the in the United states um it depends educationally I think we've come full what's a long ways but he also have a lot more\nYou know to give 'em in our local community community they amount to finance the ... that gets done is so tremendous that there's always a need to give\n'em health as you know has grown tremendously we write issues from cancer to anything you can think of his that didn't exist you know\nAs an epidemic now didn't exist centuries ago is a big deal now of course it's grown I'm ... again it just depends like foster homes like you know one voice or I'm studying right now has issues with kids in the street but\nParents in jail you know so that so it depends on the issue really but I Would say it's grown\nHow do you kind of break that up a kind of clarify that for us in terms of the local community or the ... the country here the United states in India how do you break up a where your resources go and how your programs help people\nSo it's very simple actually um it was give back to your um your community to get back to your country get back to the world\nAnd so we're able to address location and to get back to your community is Tampa so we've got nine programs I'm actually eight in Tampa one in New York okay that the United states and then get back to you to the world is India at this point it may grew to other countries to India at this point have you been six programs that\nThey would the way it comes in is I actually the only word of mouth\nNothing comes in from the cold um somebody knows somebody that says this person or this organization is doing tremendous\nTremendous job go check it out\nSo that's how I meet a man you know on me to run out and we sit down and we talk and we took but you know what they would not say she does and what it needs help life and because we do look for national non financial it truly is that partnership so they tell me what you know what the need is we sit down with a budget based on how much fundraising we've done that you know how many\nFunds we've we've gone to do with the the couple of years and then we try and fit into a sudden program that makes sense everything to flee saying it's all program funded and specifically said that if he wants to make it a accountable from start to finish\nYour teacher right want to make sure it's tangible so that the the funds up you know given to the children and so that ways you know the impacts made boats community life and to the child\nAnd we want to sustain this program so uh and the organization so if the program is doing well with in the open as they should we sustain that and if the openness action is doing well itself we sustain the organizations it's a it's an amazing partnership\nAnd how do you determine whether or not an organization or program is doing well is there a criteria but yes\nSo we definitely have criteria and there was an accountability former report\nThat the organization has to fill in on the basis and that tells me based on that budget based on how many children are impacted how many children out you know when the program um there was that all of these like you would allow for that to be accountable\nAnd if there was an issue which sometimes that can be that you know I made myself a well known that that there is an issue that the ... the money or the funds\nNot utilized appropriately then we talk about it a little bit and make sure that they know that that is only full of those four areas and for the children not forbidding expenses or administrative expenses because I'm not in for that I'm I'm raising money isn't getting donors to give me on this um this money and I want to make sure it's for the child itself\nOr makes perfect sense we're doing our best to debate issue here and we're joined by children across borders one voice foundation and voices for children in Studio with me you were just listening to Shaun ...\nCo founder of children across borders real so Marianne so we'll executive director of one voice foundation and run a Kennedy executive director of voices for children the website is children across borders dot org or Mary I'm going to go to you next tell us about one boys foundation or the organization itself and how it came about\nSure the ... foundation is celebrating its tenth anniversary this month as a matter of fact I'm I Am a pediatric cancer\nSocial worker for about twenty five years and the one place foundation came to be from families themselves who have been personally affected I lost a nine year old son to cancer three years into my career\nAnd realize what it's like to sit on the side of the desk and realize what it's like to be in the parent lounge versus\nThe Seth lounge at the hospitals so from my own personal experience and um professional experience\nI'm the one voice foundation was created and we have four major focus is\nThe first of course our families we have twenty five programs and services that we offer\nTo pediatric cancer families here in the Tampa Bay area we service um family said I'll children's John hopkins I'll children's Tampa general St shows and the adolescent program over at the Moffitt Cancer Center they also have um an affiliation with Ronald McDonald houses so we bringing dinner\nAnd supplies for parents who are here\nMaybe from out of state or out of the country because their child is being treated right so our programs consist of our little ones which is our tops program together oncology toddlers are our youngest patience because you don't typically have your child in a daycare center when they don't have an immune system\nSo these young moms and dads oftentimes they're single parents or they don't have a lot of support so\nThey do through our tops program we have a ... program which is specifically for siblings it strengthened brothers and sisters siblings take an incredible hit throughout the whole process and\nI think they're kind of sometimes the unsung hero and feel that the sibling that six getting all the attention we have an eighty percent divorce rate families fall apart and the siblings are kind of floating there so having the opportunity to be around other siblings to share that journey is a very powerful program so it's very special\nWe have Seventeen um amazing therapy horses\nWith our um a contract with quantum leap farm it up in Odessa that go on to the bathroom that vast Johnny Cash our favorite horse um the children um called quantum leap in actually schedule everything through the farm and we pay for it so after school they do physical therapy they do occupational therapy speech therapy\nUm it's also for the siblings all of our programs are offered to both the page out of ... um we never leave a sibling out at all whatsoever [noise] um and we also do our family fun days or holiday parties everything is done with ms ET up at the farm and it's a very powerful program we've seen some pretty incredible things\nOr we have a bereavement program statistically they say that a pediatric cancer has an eighty percent survival rate and we have a wonderful survivor program but we want to make sure we take care of the other twenty percent as well um you know you go into this and we'll tell you your child has a Seventy percent chance of survival ... what are you here as a parent\nI'm a child as a thirty percent chance of dying and and that's kind of becomes your focus throughout this journey and we never want a family to feel that if they lose a child that they're not part of our pediatric cancer community because they most certainly are\nUm we offer financial assistance emotional assistance um where they're from the families from the time they're diagnosed\nOn depending on what program that go into we have massage therapy um dog therapy on top of our horses we have an incredible pet therapy music therapy\nMessage and just a heads up for our listeners I think this is going to be a case of active listening being called for on your part it's this is not going to be the sort of thing where you can have it just kind of\nGoing in the background I think Dr Siegler really captures and engages your imagination and requires you to follow along carefully because he's going to take you on a journey yeah with his sermons\nYeah your salvation spree but with a little work you know I'm no he's a he is engaging and to follow along with him and I was I was a seminary professor for a number of years so I you know I think I've heard a lot of things but the way that he presents the message I think okay\nI haven't thought about it like that before and my only problem is that while he's preaching I start thinking and I started going down these well okay I Wonder what that's like and then I have to remind myself to keep listening because he's brought up these topics that are so engaging\nIn presenting them in ways I haven't heard before so um he's he's a gifted preacher but whereas we like to say he's also in many ways challenging\nAnd the fact that he's not going to say the same thing in the same way\nBut that he's presented in a in a fresh way and engaging way in a stimulating way\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a blue so
