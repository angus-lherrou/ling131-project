{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Let's say theoretically Jimmy Carter did have the power to change that isn't it true that politicians might do the wrong thing and not raise interest rates when they should\nYes that was the fear that was exactly the fear and and this was the reason why the Federal Reserve was going to be independent of the government but\nAs it seems to me looking at the political situation as it currently is unfolding faith for example within the FBI which is clearly the executive branch and what's happening is the president is telling them to do things and they're saying now that's not the best interest of the United states\nIf it works on that level then why would it work it's certainly something if it's common to all of us has our money\nDraw we've never tried to put it that way and well I shouldn't say that either because in monetary history uh we did a Abraham Lincoln issued the first green decks\nOf James Garfield a highway McKinley put us back on the gold standard heck even John Kennedy uh changed the monetary system by the issue of the United states votes in Nineteen sixty three so there have been presidents who have tried to modify the way that our system works\nAnd they've not had very good luck if you look at what those four presidents have in common I I don't think I Would want to be the fifth one\nI I sometimes are like in the do the Teddy Roosevelt and you know he came in with a big room and a sure he he was a people have compared him to sort of uh\nRandall lying and he room to the territory but never violated the presidential uh laws but it's the government has grown so big it it doesn't stop on a dime and you can't turn it on a dime and is that people don't understand how difficult it is\nTo get movement out of our government\nWhen you're so right on that and and the one place that we all expect the government to do its job is in monetary policy now our founders were so very specific\nAbout what a dollar it in fact article one of the constitution says quote no state show make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender and payment of debt\nAnd that was that we wouldn't know what the standard was and the Congress was charged with\nSetting what the standard is so they decided back then okay a dollar is point seven seven three four ounces of silver or one twentieth of an ounce of gold so you knew what the standard was imagine going to buy a gallon of gas and not knowing what a gallon well with\nA short one store could undercut the other by making a gallon a little smaller and so forth so this is the real problem we don't know what a dollar is but yet we're expected to save them at\nTheir contracts for them or this is a law ... dramatic flaw in the system\nYou enter into a contract today to pay ten thousand dollars over the next ... years and by the time you get to the end of ten years of dollars to value or a rich substance standard has changed so dramatically\nThat you you can't even recognize the first hour that you borrowed\nThis is a very very\n... it is absolutely the most important critical our states monetary system what is a dollar if we don't know what it is as our founders intended us to know that it's impossible to responsibly contracts for future obligations we need to fix that right away\nI Know I've advocated for Thirty years let's go back to the gold standard or a silver standard\nI doubt that we can get there from here as we say in New York but you can do it slowly and I think that the President Trump's policies are a step in that direction\nAndy we've got about a half a minute here again give them the Web address the phone number and your offer or three\nThree CDs that'll get you started if you don't if you're one

[noise] download it now or\nShe said to him you know historically this is true ah in this in this circumstance there's no options but some kids got to be the first you know there's gotta be there's got to be a first kid that actually does beat this why not well\nAnd so he said you've got to focus on that she was young and her career I'm and typically it's hard to do childhood cancer research there's just not a lot of funding right and so he said look\nI'll I'll fund it you've got to do this and ride around then just as several months later is when uh my wife and I had found at our non profit and we all kind of linked up all of us parents\nUm we were doing separate non profits for a while okay and then in June of twenty sixteen uh four separate non profits from across the country all merge together to become what is now being and\nBe and how did you guys come together and did you find out about each other and being that you're in different areas across the country\nAnd ... is a community where we we do have a tie community yeah we we all find each other we would run into each other at conferences you see each other on the Facebook groups\nAre and the people who are active in saying I've got to do something about this uh those people tend to find each other because we wind up in the same places and realistically there was only a couple of pockets of places where\nUm this disease was having a real change made and\nUh so we all just kind of congregate in those places and and when ah when we all merge together I proposed the idea and said look I think it makes more sense for us all to be a single group doing this or strength and um and I was surprised to find that everybody said a that's a great idea\nBecause three of the groups including my own had our children's name and the title or so there is a little bit of a thing to let go by but we all knew that um you know for me it was it's not because of as red just anymore he's he's gone we've lost him\nA it's because there's so many other kids and so now our mission is are named ...\nAnd how is the situation when there are blessed DOMA hearing the Tampa Bay area there are a lot of cases of it do you know the families who are dealing with it here\nYeah we know are pretty much all the families there's about seven hundred cases a year I'm In the U.S a which is [noise]\nUh it's actually the most common cancer in infants um but because of that each treating hospital only see four or five cases a year of and so in in Tampa there's generally anywhere between you know foreign ten kids a year that are diagnosed so we do wind up meeting each other and many of the kids here are actually on the clinical trials that were funding\nI'm treated by the same doctors same hospitals that my son was and are are beating cancer now because of the work that you know in part because of the work that were driving\nSo are they going to the people who were who were going through these trials from here in Tampa Bay area they going out to other hospitals are you partnered with hospitals here locally\nSo John's Hopkins all children's is part of our research can source and also kids can go there and then Arnold Palmer in Orlando is also part of the consortium\nSo we actually have kids kind of from all over the place coming to Tampa ... yet to be on this clinical trial because we're one of those hospitals that actually offers it right right here in St Pete\nWere doing best of the bay I'm your host Ryan Gorman with us in Studio we're joined by beat and be and Thirteen ugly men we have ... executive director of beat envy and David ... president of Thirteen ugly man the two websites for ya\nBeat and be dot org and Thirteen ugly men dot com so for your organization be can be um your your main focus\nIs is research and finding a you know things that will help\nAnd potentially a cure not so much the there's a lot of organizations out there that are\nI'm trying to assist like the families in a variety of different ways you're ... kind of explain a how all of that works within your organization yeah of course so we like you're you're you're working with the local families I mean you certainly in contact with them absolutely but the main focus is on on the trial\nYeah so we focus specifically on clinical trials and within that we are only find what we term patient affecting which means they're either out of clinical trial now or they can be within six to twelve months\nUm we when we started the organization we had been benefited from a lot of the groups who do kind of the make a wish style um you know will will introduce you to a hockey player lined Disney World these kinds of things I'm ... and we felt like that area was pretty well taken care of\nHearing the Tampa Bay or yeah a lot of um we've had on do great work\nThey do great work and I think our thought was that's covered and none of those added an hour to my son's life\nUh and that's really the the guiding thought that we have is how can we make a difference so that no family has to fill this hole that that Robin and I have now in so many other families that we have this this this um intimacy with tragedy that we carry\nAnd so we really focused on those clinical trials and I think a big difference between us and a lot of the other groups that that uh do clinical trials as\nWe found researchers who we knew could make a difference very quickly for families who are going through treatment right now um and we know those people we we we share dinner with those people we have phone calls and emails often with our researchers\nAre to make sure that this is making a difference now you know we don't fund this pie in the sky Twenty years from now this may or may not have an effect on what we're doing is and what we're funding is having real effect on kids who are fighting cancer right now\nAnd that's always been a driving principal for for how we operate beat and be a and we've we've seen some really incredible results just one paper that was published earlier this um this month\nOr just last week actually showed\nA kid's on one of the trials that were funding a at two years a Ninety seven percent survival rate 'em so some of those kids may have relapsed I'm ... and that means that\nUh but they were still alive you know so we can continue to treat and find a better options and that's compared to a close to eighty percent with the last um best option that we had which is just a couple of years ago was published so this is a huge jump\nBefore you started beating be and you guys came together and he started finding all these\nClinical trials what was the clinical trial landscape for neural Blackstone or was there one or ... was it a pretty uh boy did a area of research\nWhen my son relapsed which was in August of two thousand ten um they essentially told us pick a trial and they knew of two um one was not even something that but they would treat they were just trying to figure out the correct dose for a drug\nUh and then the other one was a clinical trial that you know maybe had some hope\nI'm there really wasn't much in the way of options out there um and kids who relapse had a single digit survival rate so it was it was essentially a death sentence and that is what happened to my son as a\nUm to date now eight years later I'm you know there's a there's a significant jump up for the kids who are on our clinical trials and even within relapse where it used to be that single digit cure rate\nUm survival rate we're now seeing thirty to forty percent survival rates for kids that are on the trials were funding which is you know you say forty percent to a mom a versus too for that\nUm that's that's a lot of hope and and that is the kind of thing that we're doing so there's a lot of work left to to drive that to standard of care to get things FDA approved to make sure that you don't have to know about and enter a clinical trial to get this treatment\nIf it works we'd like you to just be able to walk into any hospital and they say oh no less DOMA yeah we know how to deal with that or you're going to be All right\nAnd clearly the researchers must be excited about this I mean it's giving them a chance to do something I'm sure they want it to do and that's that is find a way to help families dealing with is a disease and it sounds like a ... based on the results that you're saying you've got some pretty good researchers working for you\nYeah our our uh our lead researcher Dr sold her doctor just showed her out of Grand Rapids Michigan I always say she's a medical rock star or she really knows what she's doing and now there's you know thirty or forty different principal investigators at all these different institutions who are who are part of that as well but\nUm yeah it's it's a unique partnership in that um it's not just us writing a check a and handing that off once a year we are involved with\nPresident of Thirteen ugly man how are both of you doing good great great to have you both a back here the two websites are B. and B. dot org and in Thirteen ugly men dot com or we've got a big event coming up the Halloween event which we're going to get you in just a little bit uh let me start with you David First Thirteen ugly men\nWe've had the guys on number different times for all of your big events because you keep helping all these great organizations out across the bay area um but give us some background on on you know where you guys came from and what exactly you do\nAbsolutely yeah so it started with Thirteen a gentleman who are back in the nineties were throwing parties\nAnd uh they were doing it they're their own houses and just became such an overwhelming says so many people were common\nAre they decided to find bigger and better Venus and use the proceeds of of those funds to start donating charity\nOr which has taken us to the largest uh event spaces in Tampa Bay um garnering over a thousand people to each and every event and uh raising over a million dollars to local charities and Tampa Bay and our goal and mission is about a hundred thousand dollars in donations of locally\nPer year and these events are really big deal to the organization that you help out because sometimes you know this kind of puts them over the top in terms of their uh funding for the year\n... yeah absolutely besides you know just the donation itself uh we are cheerleaders and supporters and really promoters you know so some people have never heard of the the the charities and questions so\nWe like to be the the spokesperson over the course of the time we we typically have for events a year\nUm and we have a great social media and email following so we're able to uh not only discuss our parties that people come to love but also a showcase new uh and and really well worth charities to to bring to\nTo our guest and it's not just Thirteen well first of all the men are all ugly so I didn't but but that that's the ... and the guy with a little cough there in the background and granted you know good looking guys are doing this and Thirteen there's there's far more than Thirteen at this\nPoint now ... expand it yeah I\nI Believe are at thirty four maybe this talent into thirty six uh we we we have a new members are kind of provide a applications and as we've grown\nOur we're growing younger and newer and fresher concepts in parties or ... is our Halloween has been our staple\nA these are twenty first annual Halloween fire 'em and the white party has been one of our biggest events but we've kind of have some new concepts that the derby party has taken office will be coming out of our third year of that uh we've been doing a decade's party so we had a nice party and then the vinyl parties so\nReally some different mixes where um we're able to kind of keep fresh and new and\nChoose even better Venus now that would downtown growing our new spaces\nAnd you guys have even branched out a little bit right I I Know you are previously were trying to get into some new spaces across the bay different areas ah hits them different places to to you know get a different audience to\nAmazon or yeah I mean it is great for us you know we're very flexible and we're just looking for you know Venus and ah restaurants and bars and you know wherever these locations are to to help us uh obviously raise money for charity\nAnd in terms of how charities are chosen for these events tell us a little bit about that process and I know some of the charities that you guys do better ones that you guys\nUh the the people who are involved and Thirteen ugly men are passionate about or have a you know history with and there's some other ones that are you know you've got an apple you know gotten information on and all of a sudden it's worked out\nYeah so annually we have a way of applications on line and uh this year we had thirty five requests and we have a committee specific to help vet and communicate with the charities and understand what their needs are what their expenses are what their administrative and support\n'em there's charities that we do not select because they're they're already there they're big and they really don't need our support yeah these are all Tampa driven\nUm and uh where how they get selected as we narrow them down in our board of does make them vote now I'm would beat and be they actually sent an application years ago and they still been in the fold and um it just really spoke\nI'm One of our members are Jordan who was was leading the committee was really passionate and that suggested we really put a beat envy into the consideration at the time uh it was a as their organization and\nUm you know it was something that he would know personal ties so that that's you know I think the difference where yeah sometimes of member dictates how that is because\nThere is something that affected 'em all your person in the ... or they're just some relationship that does help us make that decision but in this case it I don't believe that was it was more about the passion of the charity\nThat spoke more higher than any of the connections relationships right or help to help\n'em and uh that's one of the things that comes true with the MBA is you really when you hear from Kyle you're going to understand exactly why that they're telling me man chose this as benefiting charity\nAnd so you have a four events may have been throughout the year there's a Halloween and then is there one more usually we've\nBeen in the last two years we've grown and ugly sweater yeah already on we had not made that formal decision on it or a different concept but we are certainly looking to just kept the air with a another special event um and\nBut a Halloween party this one year and year out has been this has yeah one of we had a home at at at at\nDistrict a district three which is now are owned by the Vatican a strategic and that's going to be their new home base um so we were forced to find that our spot in and it came to mind the Cuban club which had been the evil are wobble wean and they kind of a stop doing it and it open door for the Cuban club given club\nIs actually known to be his uh his historic it haunted and you I mean you've heard online and look down it there's people who've died there apparently\nAnd what's great about the Cuban club has than ... of Halloween it has ... spirit and then um it has parking there the parking lot\nIs where we actually focus our party on because it allows us to do so much was down in light enjoy eating this year we're expanding to two parking lots um so our capacity the capacity to be over four thousand people out of indoor space so if there's any weather concerns we just moved to Bari directly inside\nUm but by you know this is going to be a a sound light and the people who come to our events dress like that yeah\nThey get dressed up by we're doing best of the bay on your host rank or been with me in Studio we're joined by beat envy and\nThey're seen ugly men we have ... executive director of beat in ... and David Morris president of Thirteen men to websites for both organizations beat and be dot org and Thirteen ugly men dot com let me turn to you Kyle so we had you on probably about what a year ago or so yeah we're in that timeframe\nUm first time that than we ever had your organization on the show you guys are having a big event or back then uh and ... what was that there was something specific about that event that stood out to me was was it a live band karaoke that was it yeah I I yeah ... that's how much it stuck with me\nAnd I'm ... and I heard the idea that is a fantastic idea and there are been to a function like that before at first of all how does that have been go well if it was amazing yeah it's always one of our\nUm so give us some background on the organization a beat envy what it is that you guys do exactly and how it all came about sure are so beat him be is a national organization\nOf five on the three nonprofit I'm based here in Tampa and we we do a lot in Boston as well\nUm we fund childhood cancer research that is that is all we do um specifically what the type of cancer called ... which is one of the ones that we're losing our kids to um although we focus on some other cancers as well\nUh my wife and I helped to found um the group and in two thousand ten after we lost our first son as ... to narrow by stomach cancer at that point we looked around and felt like we had to do something um you know this wasn't good enough there were other kids we knew who who their family was in that same situation that we're just going through\nBecause as you're going through and I'm assuming you're meeting all these other families exactly\nAnd you kind of get close to these people and and learn their story and\nUh we realized that wasn't really any research um that was bold enough that was going to move forward from this fifty or sixty percent cure rate us we partnered with an incredible researcher out of the University of Vermont her name is Dr ... shoulder\nAnd long story short we founded a alongside her ... what is now a national research consortium forty six hospitals that are involved in clinical trials\nSpecifically around neural blessed DOMA um but again now expanded some of those other childhood cancers\nOr that started with with one uh one hospital one clinical trial three kids and has grown to treat over a thousand kids directly am I'm forty six hospitals across the country and across the world now our in the process of opening six in Canada there's a couple and Europe as well so\nIt's something that has been a completely driven by the passion of parents and some really incredible researchers\nStanding up and saying look this this isn't good enough fifty or sixty percent survival rate is not good enough for our kids and we're actually seen some some real differences and survival rates and new treatments coming about it's it's been incredible over the last eight or so years\nHow did you initially link up with the researcher that you kind of started this all\nWith it was another parent or who was looking around his son his name is pat lacy and his son will had been sent home\nA from Boston Children's and told hey ah you know there's no options left for your son go make some memories kind of the same thing that I've been told and ah he found Dr shoulder and said\nAmazing she is like she has to work so much harder than everyone else to achieve the same task that we all achieved quite easily\nThere is so much rejoicing rejoicing over little tiny things that you would normally take for granted\nThose are the things that I feel like God has taught that through the well and when I watch\nThe way that our children are older children are with her and the patients in the acceptance that they have learned and the way that they have grown in their opinions are people with\nDifferent [noise] I just feel incredibly blind what's\nBeen incredible for me to realize and and I think it's a good reflection on a simple conditions [noise] we get very caught up\nIn looking at the ... the dark clouds of uh\nThe potential of something that happened\nAnd so you can get very focused on the challenges of bringing up a a child who has Down syndrome and and and really just get so wrapped up in the old you're thinking about and\nWhat we we fail to see is that there can be more going on\nThan needs are so you know some people might not see a\nHaving a child come into their home is a blessing but she was absolute blessing for our home and continues to be today because you know she became the sunshine\nThat we all were able to revolve around and be blessed by and and this you know the little person who is just beaming love you\nKnow she has her over to my younger brother or something like that but I more often than not it is just about\nI I Want to love you I I Want to be happy with you I Want to smile I I I Want to make you happy and\nWe all uh we're there for her you know\nTo help her with the challenges and so we learn more\nCompassion and care and all these things and and that's what God was giving us was this opportunity to love and to serve\nIn and we may not realize that at first but wow what a blessing we've been given and it was so thankful for it\nYeah and even the blessing now of being able to share our stories with other people and hope that we might somehow encouraged someone else who is at the beginning of their journey\nUm you know just finding out that they have a diagnosis Down syndrome like a child you know prenatal a year after they're born or someone that they know that going\nHere that that hopefully it will just help people to open\nTheir mind to reframe thing think about things a little bit differently that this isn't a burden or a tragedy\nThat her life it's a little bit different but it's a blessing nonetheless and um you know especially with all\nThe talk lately about\nYou know prenatal testing and eradicating Down syndrome in certain countries in the world and of course that's not what they're doing their job killing all of the baby that have Down syndrome before they're more\nUm which is just heartbreaking and so to have the opportunity to go and he kept linens and all that you speak I think that group they're alive and um and sharing\nYour story which is really where we\nAre one Noel found like a beautiful gas and shy\nAnd want to thank you both or sharing a little bit of your story sharing your family\nYour beautiful family today and the gift of your way the gift of the message that you brought\nA pastor and thank you very much thank
