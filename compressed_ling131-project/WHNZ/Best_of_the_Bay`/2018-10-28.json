[noise] download it already is\nWas that the biggest issue that you couldn't find somebody who can really understand what he was going through because look at you know we've talked about this time and time again when I've had organizations on helping veterans or even active duty or members of the military\nAnd and look if you haven't been there and seen what they've seen and done what they've done you really can't relate to it\nNow and he just felt very misunderstood I mean yeah he um he he was diagnosed with PDF ...\nIt was how he was diagnosed with the issue which was his issue so we went to the VA and the lady sat with him from maybe less than ten minutes and she said you have ...\n... how do you know it couldn't be something else like how do you know it's not like my mood today or they're not like he was just okay your military PBS the that that they just don't really we are you for you and you know oh you'll be deploying saying okay we can't parts ... he didn't want to take medicine and risk is a\n... a deploy ability rate for um [noise] so he uh\nHe kept quiet and we we actually went out of them out of like the network and so we saw like a personal therapists and\nThey just didn't know how to relate to what he saw what he'd been through the issues that he was having a rather than just saying like you know this is common like okay it's common thank you I understand it could be common but how do we fix it yeah I Do I get better and those were\nThose are questions that people just who haven't been through it haven't seen the things that could relate to that seem to things that he saw\nHe just didn't have answers for them and so he he lost hope and he didn't want to go to therapy after so many times of trying he just kinda wash his hands with it\nAnd uh well you figure this isn't going to help me out here I mean how many times you got to go through it doesn't work or they're not listening to your they're not relating to you and you say this clearly does not work and not for me exactly a cheap this kind of goes to that personalized care that we were talking about a little while ago doesn't it uh in in in terms of\nHaving people again who can relate to watch a veteran or has been through and is currently going through\nWell that's absolutely right and you know it's kind of speaking to the issue of of\nYou know getting treatment or or getting treatment that that's not effective\nYou know the the uh the system we have we follow up to make sure that that our clients actually receive the care that we help them lift him up with and you know if they didn't weeks for the reasons why if it if they did and it's not working\nThen we work with them to find a provider that will meet their needs\nUm you know and so I think that's that's where we differ from you know some other uh providers whether it's at a national scale or or locally is that you know our\nOur client is who we invest it and you know their needs or what our priorities isn't you know being a non profit you know we don't have any other uh competing interests are quotas or anything like that it's all quiet focused to make sure they get the care they need for\nDoing best of the bay and with us in Studio or from stop soldiers who was on ... and and keep total over the phone the Holland G. R. P. dot com is website where you can find out more about the five kc coming up honoring sergeant Eric landing and benefiting stop soldier suicides it says keep that\nOn your website or when you talk about the impact of disorganization makes that the sixty percent appliance or service members are veterans thirty two percent are a military family members talk a little bit about that aspect of the work you do\n[noise] sure I mean obviously there there are part of our overall mission but the importance of that is often times and I'm sure that Rachel can relate to this\nIs it's a family member who may be a concern for and may be willing to reach out where you know their loved one for whatever reason um you know just as a willing or able to do that and so you know even though\nYou know the you know the love when they're calling about may technically be our client you know often times we we work through in with the family members to try to provide that um you know their military spouse or son or or\nEven father or mother depending I you know gets to help that they have\nReal talk a little bit about the family aspect\nOf all of this you know obviously as a spouse and then uh you know the family and how they're affected by both the the the PBS the issue and then obviously after a suicide takes place\nOf course I'm well of course without saying much is that there's a lot of grief yeah there's a lot of grief also before suicide whereas with the DSD it kind of makes the withdrawn at your\nYour end with yourself you know some things that you've done before that you absolutely love just an appealing anymore it's like a depression yeah so and I think people are more aware and more um\nOr they can recognize depression a little bit easier than PDF sea so even kind of related to that um so sometimes you kind of feel like you've lost that person before you even awesome\nYeah I was going to I was going to follow up and ask you about that in terms of the dynamic there or you know again that must be hard for you to relate to what they're going through just like anybody else who hasn't been through what a veteran has has been through so that's\nGot to be a I'm sure you want to help and you want to understand but it could be difficult\nVery very and I think that's why ... suicide is a great outlet because it's an organization that you know\nYou can speak to another military wife that is going through the same thing can connect you with these resources that they that worked for them or their husband or their ... or\n... one of their loved ones what works for them it's it's just like at a community and you're helping each other out which is really really special\nAnd and when did you really discover stop soldiers who was how long was it after a or the suicide of a surgeon landed took place that you discovered this organization and the work that they were doing\nI I'm discovered it probably about three or four months after okay yeah\nAnd and tell us a little bit about that initial interaction and how you started to get involved\nSo for my grieving\nA technique is always kind of to focus on other things\nAnd whether that may be right or wrong that's what I Do yeah so I Want it to poor my heart into helping other people that was going through the same struggle that I was going through and also help people that have children because I ... a ... and I have two beautiful daughters um\nWho are now seven and four so they were um three and fifty\nFor a stop soldiers suicide and on the phone we have the total the chief program officer how we're both of you\nNot getting paid they get so much Keith how are you\nI'm doing great as well Ryan thank you\nThanks so much for being here this is an important topic that Rachel you were here last year we talked about the organization and the race that you have coming out before we get to the event itself which will spend some time on\nA let me start with stump soldiers suicide and the great work the disorganization does recently just a couple of weeks ago we had on the American foundation for suicide prevention so the topic we've covered quite a bit lately because it's been in the news so much lately unfortunately um let me start with the basic overview\nIt's pretty much self explanatory based on the title but a little bit more about what stopped soldiers suicide is all about\nShowing 'em well for starters stopped soldiers genocide is on the first and then ... founded in lead nationally um organization ... aims to preventing military related suicide um keep you want to take this one\nYeah keep it tell us a little bit about how it got started and how you got to where you are today\n[noise] sure um well it was started by um a three military are folks who are friends and they saw you know after day I'm a mustard out or\nFrom active duty and back to the states they saw you know an alarming and unacceptable\nA number of their their friends and colleagues that you know we're in the military and losing their lives to suicide and decided that it was something that they felt passionate enough about\nUh to form this organization and work on that problem and try to our mission is to see a day when our military uh brothers and sisters are no greater risk for suicide than the average civilian\nYeah because veterans are at greater risk correct in an active duty members as well\nYeah absolutely so you know our veterans are significantly higher ah you know risk than uh you know the average American you know at least fifty percent higher and and\nMaybe even a more than that depending on um you know what steps you look at so it's a you know it's ... suicides public health hazard epidemic and the United states and when you look at the rates of a military suicide if it's just something that um you know really needs to be addressed and it needs to be addressed a you know at a national level\nKeith how did you wind up getting involved with the organization personally\n[noise] well I actually came out from Wyoming I had been doing doing suicide prevention for roughly Fifteen Years\nAnd let the state of Wyoming suicide prevention efforts are at department of health before I transitioned to a nonprofit that was doing all the prevention in the state of Wyoming and when we lost our our funding earlier this year was looking to see you know what made sense for me [noise]\nUh and got hooked up with a a Nick and Brian who are two of the founders and was absolutely committed in sold on this program and moved out to North Carolina and I'm loving every minute of it so\nYou know you've been dealing with this issue for quite a while like you just mentioned a is even worse now than when you first started Fifteen Years ago [noise]\n[noise] well I mean I I think what we've seen is a steady increase of of rates across the country so for you know it's gotten incrementally worse from year to year despite um the efforts and the funding that have been a you know put toward the effort so um you know there's there's that piece\nOf it which is you know kind of a national level I issue but then when you look at at the growing number of I'm veteran suicides in and military suicides um you know that's even more disturbing and problematic I think\nAnd let me ask you how the organization is set up obviously we're doing doing a run here which we're going to get you in just a bit um to benefit the organization but how how does the organization worth is just a national organization with local chapters tell us a little bit about the structure\nSure so there's a couple of components\nOf uh the work that we do what stopped soldiers suicide of one of them in the piece that's been in place\nUm you know for since the founding of the organization eight years ago is a what we call a resource center which essentially you know takes any veteran any active military or family member who has a a need 'em and we hooked him up with an individualized case plan\nOur case management plan and provide them with you know access to whatever resources they may need if they're a homeless veteran you know we try to work on that problem with them if it's a\nA veteran that that needs that connection because of a mental health condition or substance abuse problem we work with them to try to find to a provider that um that is in their area that would be a suitable a good match for them so it doesn't matter what the problem is ah we work on it and we do it in a way that\nIt leads to our knowledge no other organization does which is to provide those folks with individualized one on one a case manager management for up to two years and with with numerous follow ups and call backs to make sure they're doing okay during that period of time\nAnd how critical is that both the personalized care and the follow ups\n[noise] well we think it's absolutely\nCritical I'm One of the [noise] one of the things we see is that veterans in an active military are coming to us from other providers or systems where they're not getting any personalized attention or there's you know huge waiting in line\nUm that doesn't exist with us we get back to folks right away and uh\nAnd begin to provide them with the resources they need you know tailored to whatever their needs are I'm immediately and so in that way I think we're different and it's also important\nBecause you know as we get veterans who are at greater risk than even the average veteran because of whatever circumstance they may be in that follow up that connection\nYou know really kind of provides them with a safety net over that period of time to make sure that somebody is watching out for them somebody cares somebody is there if they need them and you know that kind of personal involvement and personal touch is we think really critical to empower invest\nAnd improving um whatever their circumstances maybe over the long run\nThis is best of the bay with us we have\n... soldiers suicide in Studio racial land and an advocate for the organization and on the phone with us the total a cheap program officer these stop soldiers suicide veterans' day five ... honoring a surgeon Erik land and is coming up uh it's gonna be on November eleventh and um\nThe website if you wanna find out more about the run itself is the Holland G. R. P. dot com or\nRachel I Want to bring you in here before we get to the details about the run strict gun obviously give us the backstory 'em to how you became involved and came up with this uh this event\nSure well I can say that um some soldiers you aside for the past three years I've been has been a very big part of my life um when my husband started in ... and he passed away he took his own life um July thirtieth of two thousand Fifteen and when\nHave a a couple of months after and everything that everything kind of settled down\nI really tried to understand why and I would look at all these statistics of twenty two Veterans Day commit suicide and I would just kind of beat myself up about it of how did I not now how do they not know the signs and it I think awareness is really key and\nI can say that when I Do talk to people almost every time I say ... veterans a day take their own lives they say wow I didn't know yeah and it's a subject that Israeli spoke about and it's a huge epidemic we need to find a solution to\nTell us a little bit about insurgent lemon story and and you know where he served and and kind of bring us a up to a point that obviously change your life and and started your work with this organization\nShowy he um was in the army or as an infantry men for ten years he did two combat tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq\nHe um he came home and you know he went to school he um was Army Reserves so he would go um once a month when he came back and um\nOh one month out of the year he'll be gone doing training as well so he lived to civilian life as well as the military life okay and he was fine for a while and then\nUsually it wasn't a difficult adjustment\nYou know I think it was an adjustment but he may have kept quiet about it okay because there's such a culture in any male driven organization military or what have you with your strong mentally physically you don't talk about you know we're not hearing about feelings\nMan up buddy you'll be fine so I think he had a lot of internal issues and he just kept quiet and when he came home things are good and then months later years later that's when things started to really get difficult for Eric and we went to\nWe we tried numerous therapists we tried a the VA and don't get me sorry about the VA job [laughter] but it was we just can't find a good fat and I wish I knew about ... soldiers suicide back then because\nAs veterans helping veterans people that could relate to him yeah and could understand the struggle that he was going through and we just didn't have to\nAnd that's a lot of us who go to church every week and so to try to speak to wear those to come together where a someone who goes to church but it's not quite sure if they really believe all this and and then the some someone who's completely skeptical about at all how can we\nReach them and saw what I Hope from from the listeners is that we'd be able to create something that they could share\nYou know you you send send this to the the pod cast linked\nTo your grandson to your granddaughter your niece or nephew and say hey listen to this and let's talk about me for coffee [noise]\nThe world wide outrage ... run our ministries Goto Lutheran our dot org oh\n\n\nOh\n\n\nOh\n\nOh oh\nOh\n\n\n\nOh\n\nOh oh\nOh\n\nOh oh\nOh oh oh\nOh\nOh\n\n\n\nOh\nOh ooh\nOoh\n\nNow doctors egg were invites you to join a gym in praying the Lord's Prayer our father who art in heaven\nHow we would be dining\nLiking them come by will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us the state our daily bread\nAnd forgive us are trespassing says we forgive those who trespass against us\nLead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\nDesign is a kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever in\nThe lord bless you and keep you know the lord make your space shine upon you and be gracious to you the lord look upon you with favor and give you peace amen\n\nThis has been a presentation of loose run our ministries proceeding was a commercial program\nPaid for by Lutheran our ministries the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W H ... am its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporate originally from our eye on radio studios\nHere in Tampa beer is best of the bay highlighting the people and organizations that represent the best of the Tampa Bay area I'm your host Ryan Gorman in this episode we are joined by stop soldier suicide with us in Studio ...
