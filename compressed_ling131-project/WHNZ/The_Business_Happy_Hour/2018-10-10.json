get liquidity out of that position you can't because you have to pay a penalty you have to pay a surrender charge up front that takes money off the bottom line as well and then there's early redemption fees and a lot of other things that come into play and I'm not saying there's never a need for these I'm saying there oversold\nAnd it blows up is we believe that you can create that same annuity the exact same thing that that license personal going to say it because they're representing Wall Street because they have a license and there was sponsored by a institution\nSo you're letting some institution manage your money and they're competing for the same way that you and are competing for there's a divergence of interest right there but what happens is some Wall Street firms now going to manage your money\nAnd the person who's actually making the decisions is Sonia what's in their inventory so for Newt he's in the image where they can sell it to you they get paid a large commission for that\nWe both have to tell you that you can create that same annuity that they're selling you yourself\nWith the same products that they use in the financial markets 'cause we can use those same products we have access to those do you realize you can create a bond fund\nIn other words a fund that can give you a five or six protect return with very low low risk and not pay any loads or upfront commissions and literally be able to create that yourself and get the same returns that you need to get out of an annuity without having to pay all those high fees and more importantly having full liquidity in your position you need a cash out you can't\nThere's so many things out there and we're trying to separate ourselves because we don't want to manage your money is not what this is about this is about you learning to manage your own money you learn how to self direct you will and if you learn the skills it allows you to make better returns for less cost think of

they're smart enough\nThey think you know they don't have enough money that it's you know they should be focusing on it and people make reasons and they make excuses all the time on the don't miserable money ... realistically you know how much time as they can take somebody six to ten hours a month I have students that I might try to get him but I personally coach it's managed their wealth in six to ten hours a\nMonth they don't have to where they get the same returns or better returns that all those products available out there and he has a beautiful thing they can make money when the market goes down to the problem with a lot of those money managers that they put you in some sort of a position where if the market was up to make money to mark goes down you give it back\nAnd if it doesn't go up dramatically enough the fees that they're charging you take up the profitability that you do get so we've got a plan in place where you can make money regardless of direction more

I got it so it is one of the best parts of the week ... having a good time but you know what one of the things that we need to talk about is there are individuals out there that are trying to figure out how to generate additional monthly income there are people out there that aren't financially where they want to be\nI mean husbands and wives all the time they're like man if I could just make another five hundred or a thousand bucks a month\nThings would be so much better for me let's take a moment let's talk about how someone can utilize the market really and talking about trading for income how someone can do them\nWell most people being seen ... travel the world and all over the planet talking to be about trading and investing and was universal is that people want to make income they want to generate additional income in the markets are a great way to do that and the problem is is that a lot of people when they get a word trader\nThey check out they think ... the movie Wall Street greed is good some guy in suspenders sitting on Wall street overlook in Manhattan and that couldn't be further from the true some of the most successful traders that I Know people for income that generate an income in the markets on a daily or weekly basis\nOr people just like us that your blue collar white collar stay at home moms I mean pizza delivery people barbers I mean scientists we have a lot of surgeons that have had success in the markets so what's important is that it's a skill set that you learn over time but once you learn the skill set think of the benefits is about forty million\nTrainee a couch in the United states you know eat trade Schwab Judy marriage rates got trade and most of those traders based on our knowledge are not successful they love the sexiness of the opportunity they love being able to sit at their home and speculate on price change in a marketplace they loved that but if they don't have a good system in place are good set of rules\nThey normally aren't successful and those are the stories you hear so people think the market's a casino and it's not if you understand\nHow to play the game it gives you a unique advantage\nAnd the problem is is that many people have this preconceived notion that the markets are nothing more than throwing your money and hoping it works\nAnd it couldn't be further from the truth is ways to generate high probability low risk decisions\nAnd if you do that consistently it could turn into a compound and growth curve I've seen it personally I've seen people that have come through the process and learn the skills and transform their life with trading and they had no knowledge coming in they didn't understand the first day and even notice the difference would have stock and bond\nAnd yet they learn the skill and what's great about that as it opens the door for people instead of having to get a second job punch a clock somewhere go wait on tables not that there's anything wrong with doing that I've done all of that\nBut what's important is if you could generate that income from your home\nYou know in in your spare time that's the opportunity and many people don't get it because they have this preconceived idea what a trade or is it couldn't be further from the truth one you know what a lot of people\nThink that it requires a lot of time they think it requires this high IQ and it's just a skill it's like any skill you say it all the time you used to be a framer champ no understanding how to use the proper tools of professional grade broker dealer understand how to actually minimize risk increase probability just a checklist of things that keep you safe in the market and a lot of people think it's just so out of reach that they can't do it\nIt's not I mean I tell people you can drive a stick shift you can learn to be a successful trader because it's nothing more than learning the skill and repeating it over and over and over again one of the most important things I tell people is trading and investing shouldn't be exciting if it's exciting you're doing it wrong it's just a decision\nAnd when you have the ability to make that decision what's great about that is the doors open anybody I mean I mean people that literally have very low capital I mean they might have a few hundred bucks to work with\nAnd they're able to go into the currency mark and start to make money and make consistent money in a decent amount of money futures market such great opportunity to trade futures and in this country people don't understand the power of those assets we focus on stock stock stocks in this country futures a tremendous assets and sometimes that can use food is a trade stocks\nAnd I can use reaches a trade stock indices like the S. and P. and make a bigger ... less capital on the same moving price there's so many opportunities out there and when people start to realize that they can generate an income in the financial markets it's a game changer for them\nAnd it has nothing to do with your IQ or where you went to school what your GPA is I tell everybody you don't have to be smart to be successful in the financial markets you just have to be a teachable and this living proof in this studio [laughter]", "show_name": "The Business Happy Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "10"}
