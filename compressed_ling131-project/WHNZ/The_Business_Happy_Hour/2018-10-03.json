all about people don't understand that there is money being made every single day and the financial markets whether the market's going up or down in a lot of individuals don't realize when the market goes down and we are coming up on a down market just don't know exactly when it's not an if it's just a when\nWe got to be ready a short sale shorting is capitalizing it down we're moving the market you know it let's talk about how can the average person take advantage of that downward move\nWell even when the market's going up as a whole is things within the market that are falling in price and there's opportunities that are late into the market will we can profit regardless of direction one of the lives of Wall Street we speak of bowls and bears is at\nThe masses are convinced that when the market goes down that's a bad day when the stock loses in price it's a bad day and it's not\nThe problem is that you've been programmed to think that up is good and down his bed and once you begin to realize that when the market falls that's just a natural moving price action\nAnd things get over value and sometimes it's more sellers and buys it creates a supply imbalance and that causes price to fall\nAnd imagine if you could see that on a chart imagine if you could have a rule based system where you could see was something was gonna fall before fell that's what we talk about it bowls and bears that's a system\nOf trading regardless of direction and see when we look at the market we say okay the dials up the SATs up but there's things that are down within the up in other words not everything falls when something rises and vice versa the majority of stocks tend to track the market as a whole we got some great opportunity to take advantage of movement down in price even in the

sitting back and relax and just having some fun having some laughs hanging with the fellows don't forget to head over to Facebook lite gets that bulls and bears radio see some of the behind the scenes\nWell it's great because we've got a lot of Facebook Live stuff that's been posted now and you just get to really get into what we're all about bowls and bears which is\nYou're smart enough you can make money regardless of direction of the market Wall Street lies we think that there's a lot of things out there that you can do better yourself if you manage and self directing money you know your money we talk about that all time no your money that's a key part\nIs known your money champ I mean one of the things a lot of individuals don't understand is the money that they have sitting aside at a checking account or a savings account everybody has a rainy day fund or a slush fund or the emergency fund and a lot of people don't realize that money that's just sitting in a bank can be used for income\nAnd a lot of people want to utilize the market and they don't understand how they can have consistency more importantly they don't understand that they can do something a couple of hours a week on a part time basis and trade for income champ let's take a\nMoment talked about that well I referenced in the earliest session imagine if you could make money regardless of direction of the market and we can do that individually we can do with stocks we with futures encourage these options there's so many ways that we can play in the financial markets\nAnd more importantly there's things that we can use that allow us to use the leverage in that process which we can make a good return with a little bit of capital\nAnd understand something folks and people always talk about risk and risk management and we're big proponents of managing risk one of the most important aspects of being successful long term whether you're talking about managing your own nest egg self directing or trading for income is risk management\nAnd so paramount to that as understanding that there's ways I can manage risk and still get good returns without a big pile of money and some of those things are futures and it's amazing how\nI was an orientation I might trade academy just recently and we asked around the room how many of ever treated and virtually every hand\nThat said they treated before they trade stocks and there's nothing wrong with that equities but they're very capital intensive they takes a lot of money that control woman on them you know so there's other instruments like futures encourage these where we can take advantage of pricing would just like we can and stocks\nWe don't have to have all that capital and we're all that capital tied up in our positions and so it was a real eye opener for a lot of people because when we look at the size of some of these global markets stock markets relatively small the futures market on a global scale and the currency markets immense\nAnd so for a lot of people when they begin to realize that\nThe market could provide them an income in their spare time probably Seventy percent of the students have on line three academy have full time jobs and careers outside of trading and investing and they do it as another stream income\nAnd so for a lot of people it's just basically a way for them to make extra money and they can do it in their home now the key thing and ultimately what's going to help you be successful in this process as you've got to learn how to make good decisions what is it good\nWhat is a good opportunity and so a skill set is built overtime and having a plan and places paramount\nBut once you start to get that down it's not a really complex system you can start to make money consistently and we see people at the academy that\nTheir stay at home moms are school teachers and they supplement their income with a nice return every week simply by utilizing the market for short term income and it's not hard process people think you have to be some sort of guru brilliant or a technician or shortest or mathematician to be successful it's really just seeing a picture\nAnd when people start to understand that and they can see that picture\nAnd what's it's built around as just following the strategy of what that picture tells us they can be successful and we see it over and over again people utilizing the market for short term income when you know champ\nI mean a lot of people don't understand that it doesn't require a lot of time doesn't require you know ... the knowledge is just a skill that you got to learn and you always say this is a skill building process and want someone to have that skill\nNo one can take it from now the problem is is the average American when they trade they don't have consistency and if someone's going to trade for income where they can count on the pay either their mortgage or to pay a car payment they need to have that consistent\nWell not consistency come as a repetition and time and more importantly\nHow to manage risk and so one of the key elements and I people always ask me what they hear assembles and bears they say what do you do you know they say what is on like trade academy to sponsor and I tell people they teach people how to lose money the right way\nAnd they say why did you did you teach people how to lose money I said the right way because in order for you to make any money in the financial markets you have to take risk that'd be a huge risk but you have to be willing to take on some risk\nBut if when you're wrong you get back on very little amount when you're right you made more that's the key to long term success and if you could do that with a small amount of capital in a curse you kind of features account and you can learn a skill set from the ground up over three to nine months learning curve and then you could literally go into the markets daily weekly and get paid\nThat's life changing for people and that's what the opportunities and people get confused or think that training takes way too much or I have to be way too smart and that's the lie of Wall Street we believe that both of bears that anybody to listen to us can be successful you just gotta learn the skill\nAbsolutely and that's why the sponsor bulls and bears online training academy as a class specifically on trading for income and there's a class taught right at the campus at the five hundred dollar value we only have a few seats to give away if you want to utilize the market as a second stream income or mainstreaming come
