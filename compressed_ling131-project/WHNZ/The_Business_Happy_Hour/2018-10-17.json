insurance on your house or your automobile you're going through your portfolio utilizing option strategies are hedging with a different asset class a lot of people don't understand this gym\nAnd they buy the wall street Wall Street cells and they're not smart enough to measure on money so put it in a four one K. let somebody else do it for you and that's a myth they don't want you competing\nUnderstand something folks it's a money game and Wall Street plays a different way than main street and you need to play like Wall Street and no to play like Wall Street you got to understand the process and see for a lot of people they don't understand that when the market goes down that's an opportunity to profit\nOr at least protect against loss and the masses get crushed in these moves down and Wall Street cleans up\nAnd so the markets gearing up for a collapse of correction overall the broad market that's where most of the four one K. money sitting it's all along it's all owning stocks that are in these mutual funds that everybody all of these four one K. positions and when we get that correction and that significant move down because\nYou get to hide things are overvalued that's when the give back comes in a lot of people that made money give it all back and here's the thing if it took an eight years to get back to where you were before the collapse of overweight\nAnd now you're back where you were in a collapses again where are you going to be and now you're Twenty years old or Thirty years older and you know better off and actually that's the problem the Math Doesn't work\nAnd so capital preservation becomes key because it allows you to sustain and keep them half working so they can eventually get to the goal you set financing and if you will never hit that goal because they don't understand how to manage risk and how to preserve capital and that's a key on the success regardless of what you think the market's going up or down just being smart and smart about your money\nWell I mean the average person doesn't want to lose money they don't want to lose ten twenty thirty percent of what they have they don't want to you know just give money back to you know the market they want to be able to be smart and they want to protect it but the average person doesn't know how to do that and that's a simple thing is just a matter of saying and addressing you know I don't know what I'm doing I Need help\nAnd what you find is that it's a simplistic process it's really not hard complicated thing to learn how to protect your money\nEverything that Wall Street does or can sell to you as a product like an annuity or a whole life insurance any kind of institution that can sell you a product that is not as an investment product for you you can create that product yourself\nYou can with a small base of knowledge learn how to get the same result that product gives you if you purchase it from them without paying them the huge fees and all and tied up your money and having the full last full use of your own money it's it's just a different process is all about self directing its learning the skills of preserving capital\nUnderstand that when the market turns it shouldn't crush you you should capitalize on at least protect against loss in a market the changes and more importantly it's going to help you reach those long term goals you sit for you and your family exactly\nAn online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears they understand that the average person wants preservation of capital they just don't know how to do it that's why they have a class specifically taught on Capitol preservation this is for someone with a four one K. and IRA maybe you just have cash in the mark and you don't know how to preserve it\nDoes a great class for you and the thing is is when you understand that you can protect your capital you'll sleep easier you won't be worried about market direction there is a five

know quarter one of two thousand Eighteen this market will correct itself is that an if it's just a when\nA lot of people don't understand the idea of shorting the market they don't understand how to capitalize on a downward moving the markets let's take a moment let's break it down for the listeners what is short selling\nWell simple as is the markets overvalued I mean there's certain times when it's a good time to be a buyer the market the low of two thousand eight when we collapsed into those price areas and two thousand nine that was a time to be a buyer and many people wouldn't buy consistently since then our these record highs\nAnd things are overvalued I mean things are priced too high it's just the nature of the markets\nAnd so if you continue to buy it and go higher but no tree grows to the sky and ultimately\nThe market is the correct because things can't sustain at a evaluation that's overvalued\nSo we talk about fair value we talking about undervalued over these are all market terms and when the markets overvalued we want to be looking for correction want to be looking for a price to fall down to a normal area where it's supposed to be trading it\nAnd we haven't seen that we haven't seen that since ... Marshall was the low of the S. and P. and the market's up close to three hundred percent since that time\nAnd people are still buying in those four one K. people you're just\nBuyers every four days you buy what no matter what prices at\nMy neighbor was asking me when should I get out of the market I said you should already be out of the market so this thing could collapse of correct at any time that you might make a little bit of moving higher in price but those fees that you're paying a eaten up any growth 'cause we're kind of shopping around in a ... market right now I said but if this thing collapses twenty percent you're going to give twenty percent twenty says the dollar back\nI'm Jessica ... the NBC stocks really struggling this morning after yesterday's rally and the ... that they're having their worst month since December twenty sixteen but let's look at the Dow it's now down two hundred and one points\nOut that is just under one percent the NASDAQ is down to half a percent it's down forty points the U.S and pay down half a percent\nDown sixteen points IBM shares are lower by seven percent this morning the plunging on a week quarterly earnings report US Steel Corp workers are set to get their biggest pay raise in a long time uh fourteen percent increase\nOver four years and no cuts to health care benefits Canada has become the largest country with a legal national marijuana marketplace Sam began early this morning a Newfoundland no pot shops are open and some of the largest city though like Toronto and Vancouver\nMcDonald's is testing cold brew coffee in San Diego area restaurants\nJessica ...
