B. O. C. uh looking to inject more cash in the financial system\nThe central bank has announced that they will cut the reserve ratio for most ... uh by most commercial lenders are by a hundred base points or one percent a and this is certainly very worrisome especially the people have exposure to China\nThe central bank making big cuts\nTrying to increase liquidity surely speaks to how weak the growth rate is in China and or maybe you're pulled back and economic growth to possibly be negative now we don't know the third quarter numbers are and we don't know necessarily the forecast the fourth quarter numbers\nBut making this sharp reversal\nBy one of the largest central banks in the world ... certainly speaks again to the pain that the Chinese economy is in and obviously they continue to have trade conflict with the United states which you have to think the\nTerrorists that the Trump Administration has put on Chinese goods and certainly had a negative effect on their economy and that they're starting to feel uh the the uh the cause and effect to this to these respective tariffs\nWell during the break down and I were talking about their their their head of the Chinese Interpol with the with the Chinese ... admitted Chinese administration of public security\nHe was arrested or he just disappeared again you know we follow these they're thirty one missing billionaires at last count and who knows what's going on in China\nUm you know this is something that you know they don't play the play the game they have their own set of rules unlike what we have in the ... and it's going to be really interesting to see how this the dynamics with China how it's gonna wash out because if if it is hurting them\nThey're going to make sure that no one really knows too until it's bad I I heard one one commentator once they with China Chinese analysts say that\nBut if the Chinese admit that it's bad then it's really really bad\nAnd I remember all the ghost cities and what have you so what what should listeners be looking forward to this week\nWell there's a whole host things obviously keep an eye on interest rates especially considering\nThe the big move the interest rates took on the long interview curve large you the ten year treasury you'll get quoted the most\nBut keeping an eye on that it's something you absolutely should keep an eye on it continues to move higher uh you're gonna see equity prices continue to move lower\nUh and again I think that is certainly the primary uh news maker or the primary metric though a lot of people should keep an eye on secondarily energy prices I Know that might that might be the narrative for our respective or a day to day or our our conversation we're having now\nBut it is very important I think that's why the president has been so outspoken I'm trying to curb interest rate expense\nOr interest expense and how much people are paying at the pump which is crude oil prices up petroleum good it's going to be very very important and I think a lot of people should keep an eye on energy prices this week to see if they move\nTo the mid to upper seventies it'll be the first time in four years we've seen oil prices in the mid ... upper Seventy price range\nBut what's frustrating about it is thinking about this American production was up Fifteen Percent last year and it's still the price of oil is going up like that I mean what can we do as a society as a country to not have to be so dependent on on the middle east\nWell we're already doing a lot of production now you're seeing a lot of refineries are that are that are you know keeping busy uh and so again we're producing a lot of good\nIt's a matter of ah companies in the high energy sources they try to use we've spent plenty of time on the show talking about natural gas and how energy companies have been moving to natural gas that's still relatively cheap\nEven though I Would mention on the side no natural gas prices right three year highs their train about three twenty five for British thermal unit\nSure such as always we appreciate your advice and we'll be talking to tomorrow take care now ... you know Ted we're now in the longest bull market in us history and for most people that raises a question you know should you be taking money off the table well let me just say if you have a wall constructed financial plan\nAnd your your personal circumstances seven it really changed there's probably no reason for you to do anything you just spent your entire life trying to save money and it's called wealth accumulation but when you're getting close to retirement retirement investing and planning is completely different it's called wealth preservation the focus is to never lose it\nBecause you know you don't have the time to remake it ... retirement investing is something you have never done before your advisor hasn't explained that to you you need some help just go to our website scheduling appointments its gram capital advisors dot com it's going to wrap it up for us\nToday we'll see you again tomorrow at the same time I'm Thirteen twenty am in Sarasota and a twelve noon at twelve fifty W. H. Gen Z in Tampa have yourself a great weekend or have yourself a great Monday we'll see a Tuesday [noise]\n\nProceeding was a commercial program paid for by Graham capital the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M.\nStaff management or parent company I heart media incorporate and Z\n[noise] Fifteen when federal\nShe's said you know I talk to my some financial person that she knows somebody was and they said they could get her a point one a one point eight percent return as you said how does that compare that so that's pretty good but we\nThat other considerations look at here is a very large amount of money are you going to put all that and one bank account\nRemember FBI savings you know the federal government's insurance FDIC insurance FDIC insurance is only a good up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per person and two hundred fifty thousand per per sons on the account so the first thing that I I explained to her that she didn't understand yet\nBut she went back to a financial planner and through this animal is is that if you have more than one person on a savings account which could be you your spouse you can even put your kids or\nYou can have up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of insurance per person who would get the money out of that account if you would die so in other words if you um defined as beneficiaries of the account\nEach person that would be beneficial ... of that account\nWould have the government ensuring up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of that account so I said with a large chunk of money you have I'm going to have to give you about five different accounts that one's okay one point eight by I gave her some over two percent\nMoney I gave her to present money I gave her one point nine five gave her at one point nine they gave her one point eight five shrubbery at one point eight and I said you need to spread this money out over these different account so that you get the FDIC insurance\nAnd if you spread it out far enough right you're going to have that insurance because you can put your your yourself your husband your kids or whatever you want to put on there's beneficiaries and get that insurance and so we figured that allowed or they but they what was interesting was after that it always turns around to the same conversation I\nHad this conversation Curtis ahead with everybody I've talked to and that is that money in that bank is not earning you anything even if it's\nTwo percent interest which is three times what point six is right it's over three times it's a three hundred percent increase from we're normal people ...\nEven with that three times earnings power it's nothing care to compared to a piece of real estate\nSo today what I Want to do is I Want to look at what is real estate do how does real estate make you so much money so much more money than traditional investments I also want to debunk myths\nAnd the myth is the stock market out performs real estate this is a myth discourage only by people that are completely agree at trying to sell you stock right the stock market does not outperform realistic\nI've never met anybody\nThat got rich by owning stocks\nI Know rich people who own stocks but I've never met anybody who got rich by owning stocks I Know people who have gotten rich by owning real estate\nAnd I also know rich people who put their money back into real estate so it's an oxymoron it's the same thing with gold I Know people that are rich you own gold\nBut I've never met anybody tells me that they got rich by owning gold\nGold stock market\nThese types of things are place holders their place to put your money because you don't know what to do with it\nWears you and your money ... if it's not real estate guys it should be in your own personal business\nBusinesses make large amounts of money for people who own them the richest people in the world let's talk about oh Bill Gates yes it was talking about ... uh it was talking about Warren Buffett these guys didn't make their money in the stock market yeah the whole stock\nThey went public they made their money by owning the companies that went public and benefiting from the rise in the stock when they owned already billions of dollars' worth or hundreds of millions in a small company\nBut people don't get that they seem to think that they got rich because we're in the stocks no\nThe stock market is a place to raise capital to make ... rich so whenever I'm not buying real estate I'm starting companies\nAnd I've got many different companies and that started many many many companies over the years some of them didn't make any sense I let him go some of them worked out really well kept them going you know but companies make money\nReal estate makes money\nStocks bonds\nCDs\nSavings accounts they're just a place to harbor your money to put it stored and\nHope that there is some increase the reality is the increased might not even keep up with inflation now sometimes is really good run up some stocks that that occurs there's no doubt about that but there's also times when there's run down\nAnd I guess if you were smart enough to stay in the stock market crashes\nAnd not lose your cookies over it you probably could be okay if you're just stuck it out because of the long haul the stock market like real estate values go up and down up and down up and down but most people get freaked out when they see the money go in the stock market because it might not be at the right time in their life\nBut a real estate we don't worry about that time because

back now here's some more conventional wisdom says you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time my mom's like\nWhat about your data lousy radio show today I'm Talking about six different reasons why real estate\nOut performs the stock markets bars earnings and or any other investment that I Know a per se um we've talked about number one which is equity capture which is over the hill I mean it's unbelievable number two is cash flow\nNow this is an interesting concept\nThat I've never understood that many many people live don't have any expectation for cash flow from their investments and I ask you this\nYou're on a single family home how much is a pay per month\nFor that you know the privilege of having all your family's equity in the answer is nothing if you own a four one K. what does it pay you per month for the privilege of having all your money's equity in it and the answer is nothing and IRA what does it pay nothing\nNow is a good stocks most dogs pay no distributions some however pay dividends\nUm so if you got like one of the best dip it in stocks out there which most people don't most people have nothing coming up with this dog as far as the evidence but if you're one of the best dip it in stocks out there you might or four percent right that's a pretty hefty number considering nothing is the average so\nIf you look at that and then you look at CDs\nRight now CDs you can earn up to three and a half percent on a CD\nAh saved his couch gearing up to two percent of the savings account right now\nUm and by the way when you go CD for three and a half you're going out I think five years to get that pressure I'm tied up your money so you've got all these ways earned income but then when you look at real estate our worst deals the ones that you know we consider our\nBread and butter you're just going to get what you get type of deal is going to\nProve out to be somewhere between all cash flow bases between five to Fifteen Percent\nAnd on good deals and this could be anywhere from ten to twenty percent\nNow in some rare occasions when you're buying single family houses you can get even higher than twenty percent I've seen twenty four twenty five in the old days we get thirty forty fifty percent but that's the old days is not today's marketplace and you know remember these are the deals that are there's the exceptional deals\nAre they still out there yes they are still find them yes we do but can I say that we can get you won every single day the answer is no these are the exception deals but you can go out there all day long it's when you're golf club and come back with a ... single family cash flow\nUp ten percent Fifteen Percent that's easy to do a apartment complex as you can earn\nYou know anywhere from seven to ten percent of the first year\nAs you own them you get them in better shape you increase their income controller expenses I've seen those casualties go from seven to eight nine ten I've seen some or go to twelve Fifteen Percent um some deals\nThat are rehab deals I've seen them jump up into the twenties per se mid twenties\nType of a deal so what does that really mean well it means if your money sitting in a savings account like as I spoke with this latest was let's get your money into something say that you won't lose your money it's yeah FDIC insured will get it up to two percent at one point nine one point nine five one point eight five\nUm that's something to do it safe concerning small amount of money it's something to do but just as soon as you can get that money back into it eight percent return think about what that is if you're earning too\nRight if you're earning too\nAnd you went to for you would have an under one hundred percent increase in the rate of return if you're earning too and you could get to six that's two hundred percent\nRate of return in increasing rate of return and if you could get the eight that's a three hundred percent increase and ready to return I think about that that's a massive increase in rate of return\nThree hundred percent better not as you're seeing it\nFive percent yes it's five percent higher return but percentage return increase is three hundred percent wouldn't you like to increase your profitability by three hundred percent\nVery simple get into real estate get away from all these other investments your rent because real estate pays those kinds of dividends now\nHalf the time with this something that is really the six benefit but I Want to make it clear that this six benefit spread out multiple different ways across these different benefits across these different gangs and that is tax wise\nIf you earn money from a CD or a money market account or a savings account or stocks that David is taxable as ordinary income\nSo let's say you make\nTwo percent of those things go\nYou lose thirty percent of that now you're down to one point see that'd be six off at one point four percent\nRight let's say you make four percent in stock dividends now you take thirty percent off of that and thirty percent of for seven and it's going to take you down to two point one to point two percent\nRight that's that's what happens with ... with taxation and so when you look at that to spread\nIn return is even larger because of the tax consequences of the way real estate gets taxed compared to other income and the way they get taxed so you just you get to see that to understand what it's all about so", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa",
