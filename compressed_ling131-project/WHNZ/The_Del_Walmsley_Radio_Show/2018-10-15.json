joins does grim as the opening bell dot\nCom [noise] we're opening bell on third deemed twenty and twelve fifty am\nDead Web and a ... gram and we're joined by ... there were some of the newsmakers is [noise]\nWell certainly the big one and this is what I have to think is is something we talked about preparing for listeners on the show but it is certainly dominate headlines early this morning a Sears one of the largest and and certainly most well known retail\nNames of the last four to five decades in particular\nHas officially filed bankruptcy a chapter eleven bankruptcy\nOr certainly this brings an end to a to a to a franchise or or not necessarily franchise but a brand that is widely widely known a it's not necessarily surprising to a lot of people I Know we've talked about six years in that respect that situation\nUh for the better part of last year but\nTheir bankruptcy filing happens at a time that they were due to pay a hundred and thirty four million dollars a within the next week and it was pretty clear that shears did not have the cash to to pay and subsequently filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy\nDidn't didn't at Sears is so one of their assets were that they owned a lot of their property their own real estate so even though they were either\nSo a couple of years ago they spun off and the company's called Sarah teenage or the ticker symbol is S. or gee a and a few years ago they spun off the real estate or as a way to generate cash\nFor Sears holding company now ... certainly come under focus obviously because currently they're about to take us through this respective restructuring uh a lot of\nShears facilities now it's important that listeners recognize that chapter eleven is different from chapter seven chapter seven is a cease operations and liquidation chapter eleven is your restructuring and that's how it is as a right now\nBut there is some some concern that if there might not necessarily be enough to restructure and ultimately liquidation or would have to happen but\nAgain this is something that you want to keep an eye on I'm we believe that they filed chapter eleven Judy Chu allowing them at least in the short run to try to get through one more holiday season\nBut with that being said they are restructuring of bankruptcy restructuring court and will ultimately the uh how this uh gets resolved\nRight well they employ sixty eight thousand people and\nYou know again it's it's it's been around a hundred and twenty five hundred and fifty years for generations and it's just really a matter of saying how can evolve\nUm you know I I you know a lot of people have worked worked at Sears over their lifetime to you know our generation that was a store that you you went into your show and I believe in your grandmother work there you know\nBut but that ... we got well we got the news are there any other newsmakers\nThere are two full or there are two ah newsmakers it certainly are catching the eye of of people this morning and and first this is\nA another situation that we have a a talked about quite a bit of brags it a negotiation over Britain's departure from the IV suffered a setback\nLate in the day on Sunday\nAt the two sides are failed to resolve differences largely a or chiefly over how to avoid the re emergence of physical border in Ireland now Arlene Foster the head of the northern Irish party a has made the comment that\nFrankly speaking they don't like where are these negotiations are going in Northern Ireland would really want to remain as a part of the human be subject to the regulations are and they're looking for themselves maybe ... and uh uh from Theresa May and Britain\nAre but again this is certainly another step back\nOn ... does have a fuse where again you figure this has been now a multiyear process\nThat frankly just doesn't seem that close to finish and this is something that can be worked very worrisome and five or six months if there's still no agreement met and nowhere close on terms then you can start to see a whole lot of pressure uh in in the European markets\nSure well that's that's something that you know we're you know you when you look at it and see where it's going good gosh who knows what what's your listeners me looking forward to this week\nWell continued volatility weather up or down surely want to keep an eye on that\nI think a lot of what people are going to keep an eye on our interest rates and they want to see where the ten year treasuries gonna move uh we did see some volatility over the last two weeks obviously two weeks ago we saw interest rates really spike higher\nAnd we saw a spike higher early last week but then we thought trail downward a as people bought more treasuries are in the face of the declining market so I think a lot of people or keep an eye on how interest rates are going to react this week especially in the face of corporate earnings\nAnd again we're now in week two of corporate earnings and we're going to get some of the major heavy weights and we will report those earnings here on the show as they come in\nBeautiful well star shows always we appreciate your advice and we'll be talking to tomorrow take care now ...\nOh I'll tell you to you know there's a lot going on here is a quick indicator Morgan Stanley ... cheese ... equity strategist he says we reached the tipping point

I think I'm just going to get some money would get a four O. one K. American IRA and all of a sudden they got all this stuff these cars and the debt in this house these kids and stuff and the man\nThis plan isn't working whatever play it I think I had to go into college I did it but it had a flaw at the end of college there's no real plan past that and\nIt's going to fail and it is failing or broke I'm In bad ... bad credit or even if I'm not broken have bad credit\nOr putting money into a four one K. this paying me nothing I'm paying off houses paying me nothing putting money and I raised paying me nothing I have nothing doing anything for me in my life financially but I'm going through these motions he's blind sickening repetitive motions that are getting me nowhere\nAnd so I just quit you just give up and you do what I did I focused on something else all of a sudden you know you you'd say well I'm I'm going to get a hobby I'm going to do this somebody that [noise]\n[noise] I'm going to focus somewhere else because I Know I Can't be rich I just can't be rich 'cause I don't know how to be rich the stuff that I've done I thought would make you rich didn't make me rich and so you just give up so I gave up about\n... a couple of months ago three or four or five months ago though I'd sold off so many apartment complexes that I had so much money I just you know what I'm going to go to the best trained design company in the country and they're already met bender them I'd already met them but they wanted some really expensive it was really expensive to get them to build your traits it in\nFact this company built Warren Buffett strain set for him buildings lay out when he bought being a south so Warren Buffett bought you know south Burlington Northern Santa Fe and\nHe had been billed as a lay out for him that replicated be in the south\nAnd so I went to them and I went to their their office in Dallas and met with the people that are real nice people would come up with a little bit of his either showed one already had the actually drove down to my house in Houston it looked at as I've already had and we're going to put together a plan build this thing and then when I got the price back I go my God I could buy three houses with that\n[laughter] I could buy myself two or three cars with that I could buy a house that I could probably use it for a down payment on apartment complex so that's just not worth a damn set of toy trains\nYou know and so I put it off again\nHow many times did you look into how many times did you go to Dave built out of rubber down ... with the ...

conventional wisdom to send you the man on a mission to retire American one version at a month and he\nWill come back to go on the radio show today we're talking about why do we not have a plan in our life why is it we we run around and spend our entire lives\nJust taken while shots at stuff we're no long term plan and I'm using this example of me trying to do this this railroad are seen as an example of what most people's lives are like there is NO PLAN in place\nWhen we ever sit down when we were younger and go who do I want to be who am I modeling\nYou know I think some young kids do that and they go I'm going to be a rock star I'm going to be an athlete and they modeled those people and that's probably what the end up being that because they bottled that\nBut we're working with an issue here where it says you can't be everything you could have anything but you can't have everything you've got to pick what you want there's a limited amount of resources in your life to be able to get things done and to build a life like I'm trying to build a railroad bottle\nYou have to follow some steps but the first step is figuring out exactly what it is you try to build what kind of a life are you trying to build you know things like where do you want to live when I was younger\nI decided that I wanted to go find my fortune somewhere and I lived in Madison, Wisconsin they do there is no way of making a fortune Madison, Wisconsin there's nothing going on here this is the liberal bastion world of the whole world I mean there's nothing but school college and government so the entire city ran on call schools college in government\nSo I knew there was no chance there when I Do is find a place to live I actually got into research and found out the five fastest growing cities in the country\nThinking this was a this is where the opportunities going to be this is where we're going to be to get rich is being in one of the five fastest growing cities and country and I literally made a list of them and I decided I'm going to go see all\nNow interestingly enough I only got through three of them before I get stranded here in Houston ran out of money I never got out to California to see LA or San Diego or San Francisco which were also fast growing cities but\nI got I ran out of money here in Houston made my life here but at least I was in one of the five\nAnd it worked out I made my fortune but I picked to where I was going to live in today you know all the time I you know my fiance was always ask me why don't we go buy a house here uh buy a house here go here lived there there and it's just\nIt doesn't make any sense you know you you pick a place and you build your life there and so many people have never lip left the neighborhood they live and I used to live in burgers or if you know where that's in spite St Louis and that's where all the rights were a year ago and I just look at those people and I think oh Leigh\nI'm so happy my parents just moved I mean it's all you have to do is move if you're living in a life of quiet desperation or in that case a loud desperation\nJust pick a better place to live\nYou know it's like it's insane where do I want to live is a major question your life and most people just they were they're born\nNever venture up or or maybe go with their job drops them and they just stay there next when what do you want to look like\nDo you think do you got up one day and go you know I really want to be a three hundred pounds if that person I really think that'd be right and then I also think I Want to smoke cigarettes have yellow teeth I think there'll be something I'd like to look like also yeah what are we are outdated clothes don't fit\nBecause I'm too fat or at a movie out of style at all times definitely out of style um\nWhat else about what it looked like I Want to have a weird here I Know what I Want to do I'm going to\nStick holes in my face and put pins in them I'm going to put ... nails through my nose and I'm going to put on gold on my teeth and I'm In a\nPure myself from head to toe with wait a minute that wouldn't look as good as it would if I had that and tattoos I'm of the cat to my body or something that can never fix the rest of my life but it looked like this stupid tat to\n[noise] do people actually sit down and think that stuff up\nHow do you decide who you want to look like what you want to look like right\nIt's a choice it really is in every way shape and form it's a choice after seeing those sixty year old guys up there\nI I came home and said you know what to do a few less meals a week a few more exercise programs a week and you're going to look like a sixty year old body builder as it might as well do it it's worth it to be that that\nA couple of hours a week more than what I'm doing right now 'cause I'm doing some now but a couple of hours a week more eat a little bit less drink a little bit less and boom\nIs it worth it what do you want to look like next how much money do you want to have\nNobody ever system thinks that right that they want as much as I can get that is not a goal\nI ask a lady yesterday on the radio show I said did you when you first came in you never believed any this was true\nI said now that you've been around all these people and I said now that you've been doing this for a while I Want to ask you a question tonight
