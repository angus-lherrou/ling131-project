H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporate dot com\n[noise] Fifteen west horse helpful\nOn our ... our radio ads [noise] downloading\nFor a change to happen well\nYou know and I think you actually just hit the nail on the head when you explain explained how change happens and it's going to happen regardless of whether we'll compared for it or not and I also think you hit the nail on the head talking about how we have core beliefs and core values that are instilled in us from the very early age and we grow up with these\nParadigms this thought process of we must do this this this as a life where it's just a checklist and we're just checking things off as time goes on\nSo I think that that's the big thing that a lot of people hit this moment and I think the most common one is when we get members to come in and there\nHas done all of those things they followed the checklist they did all the things they were supposed to do in other words they adulthood well according to society you know they went to college they had a job they work nine to five and they saved and they saved and they saved and luckily a lotta times I don't have to hear stories about\nOf traumatic thing that happened they lost their job or they're scared of losing their job or a ... a divorce or something to that effect usually it's just a stark realization that they're starting to look at what they have set aside and the life that they want to live and that you are not going to be\nCohesive together it becomes a situation where you know we work hard and we put all of\nOur money into savings and you realize that you're not going to be able to retire and you feel loved you feel cheated you feel like\nYou have gone through life and you did everything you were supposed to do and you're not going to have the wording retirement that you thought you were going to so I think that's probably the most common reason why people decide that\nSomething needs to change is more so in their spending habits\nUm that they want to continue to live their lifestyle as if they're still getting a nine to five paycheck every single month\nAnd like it's at the retirement accounts and whatnot just aren't going to be able to cut it anymore\nSo I think that that's the big reason why a lot of people feel that a change needs to occur and they're willing to step out of their comfort zone\nAnd they're willing to say hey you know what I wasn't raised but I Need to acquire a whole bunch of rental properties in order to pad my\nPortfolio is but I can have a decent retirement I think that they realize that that is what they want to do and honestly that's what they deserve to do they earned about money the right way and they pay for it so now they want that money that they worked so hard for it to work for them I'm\nI'm a rare occasion I Do get numbers that come in and they have lost their job and they're in a situation where they're saying you know what I never want to feel so helpless again I never want to be at the mercy of a business owner of being able to tell me\nThere's no way that you can come into work day we're downsizing and suddenly you feel once again Rob do you feel like you've been cheated even taken advantage of and in reality you know you\nPut in a lot of time and effort into the company that you worked or in your ...\nYour expendable so once again they come into my office and they want to have a conversation about how they can never be expendable how they can be their own boss how they can be at the masters of their own destiny and that is empowering and honestly I think that\nThe one thing that holds true and people that have not never invested in real estate and the thing that holds true in\nSeasoned investors is you know we liked the idea of having dot control and we definitely want to not be\nNothing is going to determine what our outcome is going to be except for our own choices so that's the one thing that you have to change you have to be comfortable with change so that you can create a lifestyle that it change happens you're prepared for it\nAnd that that can be the first step that we help people with and that's really what I Want to talk about today it's it's harnessing that fear of change in order to drive success instead of allowing yourself to sink back into old habits to sink into depression with that\nThat feeling in your gut that you know what you're doing isn't going to work if you have a question especially one for Jillian since we have the the pleasure of having her on the show with us today\nGive us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty to a lab and that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven were happy to talk about anything having to do with why for real estate that you want to talk about\nThat decision to do something different\nIs challenging our our brains don't don't like new in New information ended the older we are you know that that old adage of you know old dogs can't learn new tricks we know that's not true most of us have had an old dog that we've been able to teach something new to a very literal sense\nAnd um many of us have learned new things later in life and and I'm a good I've got a good ten Fifteen maybe Twenty years on you I think I could be your mom Jillian [laughter] um but you know I I learn new things every day\nAnd when people come to us and they've made the change in their\nRoutine to include us in it\nThey have sought out education and mentoring for real estate they have come and participated in the program they put themselves with a new group of people they're already beginning to make very significant changes\nAnd they're doing this with our minds that resist that change so in a moment when we come back I Want to talk about that change and how we support that change and harnessed that change to drive success and not let ourselves get derailed\nBecause changes something people are afraid of ... I've heard people say that people are just as afraid of changes they are speaking in public and so we want to make sure that we give people the tools they need to drive success from that fear you're

lifestyles\nUnlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIt was one version bumps and\nWelcome back to the Dell wants the radio show this is Len ... infidel today with Jillian Garland a successful real estate investor and single family mentor with lifestyles unlimited and we are talking about how to harness your fear to drive success and make the changes in life that will help you\nCreate the wealth and passive income you need to live the lifestyle you want to live in retirement and we we see those advertisements all the time right you're you're watching TV late at night and you see the couple walking down this beautiful pristine beach and they're talking about some\nYou know investment that you can make that will give you that life in retirement and that\nParadigm that core belief\nThat if we save our money if we put our money and a four one K. and we dollar cost averaging to the market no matter what's going on in the world that will be walking on that pristine beach holding hands with our loved one and we'll both be healthy and fit and trim\nAnd that isn't the end result for most Americans we see it in the statistics most Americans actually cannot retire they cannot stop working and this is a paradigm that we have to face we have to\nUnderstand that it's not working and so then that forces change on us and this is that realization that bubbles up from the subconscious\nAnd creates that underlying fear that stress\nAnd what you're doing things that you know we're not going to take you to the place that you want to get to it does cause stress you know you're driving down that road maybe you're driving home in a storm and your your typical route is flooded out and suddenly you're on auto pilot and then you're faced with\nA road close fine and you have to now engage\nAnd you have to make a decision do I turn around do I make a right to make a left how do I actually get home from here using a different route and this has happened to me in the past year I've lived in the same place for four years now almost four years\nAnd I actually had no idea how to get home via another route [laughter] and those types of road blocks of life cause stress\nAnd how we respond to it is going to determine the rest of our lives it some people respond to that by going around the roadblock and going through the water\nAnd end up on top of their car being rescued hopefully yeah by rescue teams in the storm other people back up\nGo back the way they came you know fortunately now we have GPS and we find our way home eight so that choice determines or outcome whether we are going to go home and get warmed by the fire or whether it could be sitting on top of our car hoping somebody can come get us out of this torrent [laughter]\nThat we're now caught in and it's really similar to the the situation we get into and it's not our fault\nRight these are core beliefs that developed through our childhood their reinforced you know you were talking about your mom right I mean so you grew up with her investing in a four O. one K. her you're working for a company her talking about you know the value of long term employment and it just isn't a reality for your generation\nAt all at all\nAnd the thing that I find it amazing as these things are so powerful taxes the fact that it's taken out before you get your paycheck\nPeople don't even realize how much taxes they're paying I talked to people Jillian who are very high earners they're very well educated I asked them how much Texas did you pay this year and they tell me oh it's great I didn't have to pay any and I know they're not real estate investors\nAnd if they could you just do me a favor I'm just curious go back to your taxes here's where you'll find the line of how much you paid over the year out of your payroll checks before you actually got a hold of the money\nHow much is that\nAnd they are really surprised\nTo see how much money they actually paying taxes for one case of the same you talked about your mom be excited that her four one K. balance went up well she's been dollar cost averaging into it for how many years\nSo it's going to go up even if the market is is flat and if she takes a hit and that's what's happened you know with your mom she's taken four or five significant hits those were her career\nTo that four one K. and and you ... you know if she had invested in a different investment vehicle something that had a longer you know track so she could see what was coming she would have a lot more money and be a lot more prepared for retirement [noise]\nIf you have a question for us give us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven children can you talk a little bit now about\nSome of the steps that people take\nTo overcome their fear to get out of these paradigms and to learn something new you know I I Love something that you say all the time you say you know especially because a lot of people we need are highly educated and they're very very successful in their careers and you'll make the comment of get over yourself and get educated and you talk a little bit about that\nYeah [noise] so send me going into lifestyles and learning the entire um those are real estate investing\nKind of became a no brainer after the fact I Know that sounds silly but I I'm super really skeptical at heart and I'm a glass as half empty kind of guy can take it on any level of gloom and doom", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "year":
