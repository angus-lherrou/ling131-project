pretty strong statements specifically in this issue of how technology companies are monitoring the disinformation\nA issues that are starting to play a what a lot of people believe are are are a balanced politics\nSure ... here's something that you know the media is picking up quite a bit you know Nike took a hit yesterday\nOn social media especially and much less I guess the and I don't know what the stock prices doing today over this Kaepernick deal and you know the backlash started dust almost immediately\nAnd one what would you think they're thinking was\nWhen they decided to come up with that advertising or believe in something you'd been it means sacrificing everything and all that business what's your take on that\nUh well you know it it my my thought is largely muted uh in regards to business in particular stock prices Nike's up today but it's it's not much there are\nLike point seven percent a that pales in comparison to selling pressure that they saw yesterday or they were down more than three percent for most of the trading day\nUh it talks about how businesses and then if they do get\nA political in nature whether they believe maybe they weren't uh they they are and so when you make decisions like that\nThere is the possibility you're going to suffer the consequences Nike is not the only company a that gets involved in these types of of situations remember there was a very big merger\nThat just well it was ruled in favor of a team team Time Warner and their merger gets apartment a justice that a lot of people believe that merger was very politicized than it did\nNot like CNN and he did not want to see the merger goes through\nThe judge ruled in favor of Eighteen team Time Warner said there is no case law that's preventing or or preventing this merger from happening and really slapped down that department of justice a in a very very one sided ruling and its fearful among a lot of people that\nThe damage that happened in the ruling against the department of justice even though they're appealing to right now uh the damage is done against the department of justice will uh restrict its ability to go after other mergers that maybe would be seen as\nMore of a a more of a risk to overall anti trust business matters\nSure no sewers several analysts said that that might Nike did that sent a strong signal to their current roster of athletes and and positions Nike that's kind of a savvy risk taker is there's not a move that any company can make\nThe NYC for for a Nike it was definitely a a smart business move 'em you know ... you know namely who buys your shoes this to me you know I guess just about every minority kid in the country was Nike shoes ... and and uh it was obviously a risk but it was also by doing that and we were making a pronounced\nPolitical a political statement to themselves so\nThat'd be said as anyone else out there\nRight well in addition to the situation of forty with Nike and in addition to what we're

[noise] downloaded that\nWas to find out the basis for being in shape and\nMany people believe that exercise is the secret they believe going to the gym and working out makes them healthier makes them look better and you see these guys got big arms and big bellies at the gym and they're puffing and huffing and screaming and yelling and pick it up heavy weights and drop them on the ground\nBut are unhealthy their fat and out of shape and they don't realize in their brains they're working out they're healthy but in reality they're just ... was a little bit extra muscle\nNow what am I saying I'm not saying this to pick on anybody don't get me wrong what I'm seeing is their basic premise that if I lift weights I'm healthy is wrong\nAnd so they will never be physically fit and they will always be fat even if they work out that they stop working out to be fat with multiple with less muscle if they work out will be back with more muscle\nBut their fat has nothing to do with exercise\nI Know I get ... kicked where I go when I Do aerobics and do an hour two hours a day of aerobics just 'cause I get crazed\nI Know that aerobics isn't the secret to what my body weight is I Know that diet is the secret to what my body weight is I Know the road which is good for your heart and your lungs you circulatory system I get that I Know that's true but an hour or two hours a day every day is too much in fact right now like I got crazy with that last week and my knee hurts\nBecause overdue did like in two hours of treadmill the other day and now my over extended my knee and you know the problem is when you start with the basic premise of the wrong you're can't hit highest potential at all [noise]\nBut I Want you to understand is when you start basic concept when your base assumption is wrong\nThe level of success you can accomplish will never be anywhere near as high as if your base assumption is correct in fact in almost every case what's going to happen is is that your\nBad based assumption is going to stop you from being able to accomplish what you want to do a given another example I um\nSigned a couple of years ago when I had cancer that I was going to start playing with toy drinks and build myself lay out\nAnd got a lot of information same thing I Do everything else in life I go get a lot of information I read a study of learn and then you know you're dying to jump in and get started and I put together man this train layout that\nWas really unique unique set the right word for it was large companies for the large and\nIt was interesting as I went along and I continue to read more material\nI found out that I had made some basis options in the very beginning were just wrong just wrong and because of them I hit sticking points that could not be overcome\nI picked the wrong gauge trying to get the maximum amount of lay lay out of shape and size uh I picked the wrong types of strains\nAnd had to sell them all back I bought a whole bunch of trains sold them all back and bought new ones because\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd so forth so now I've got\nTens of thousands of dollars a track that I'm going to have to sell back\nAnd I'm buying new track to replace it um the base platform that I built for it\nOr I built it as just one big model at the base which left for no ability to create really mountains and terrain and valleys and rivers\nAnd so instead I didn't know how to do open open construction construction girders construction whatever they call it to be able to build this lay out with all these different levels and things that I really want on it\nAnd I thought I could do by just starting with a flat piece of board but the world is flat flat board doesn't represent terrain and beauty and so really I have to take the whole based apart back to re doing all the track all we did all the trains already but we do all the track a then I'm going to have to go back and redo the base\nAnd then redo the track and then\nI'll be the new level where now I can make some more mistakes right above all kinds of power I thought I needed lots of power to run these strange about way more power than when I Need but it may not be the right power it may not be set up the way I Need to send there's all kinds of things I Will not be able to accomplish because I started this thing\nAll wrong or friends how's your fitness how's your finances how's your family life ask yourself this question what base assumptions my starting with the don't work\nThat's the basic question we need to start with today to short

he\nWill get back to do on the radio show today we're discussing the topic of how you see the problem is the problem and you can't solve the problem with the same level thinking\nThe problem was created it and what are the basic premise that I'm trying to make here today for everyone to pick up is that if you start with the wrong basis the theory that you're working from is wrong then everything you do is not going to lead to success it's going to somehow stop\nSomewhere along the way to stop you for becoming success with what you're trying to accomplish and I've said this is true and everything for businesses to financed family health\nOr whatever topic it is whatever it is a life you want to accomplish you were going to fail if you start with the wrong base theory on this thing\nNow I'm going to take one step further make it even more complicated right or the next level complication I Want to bring to use it in in our lives\nWe all have personalities and\nI don't know if this is true I I'd asked this question more than make a statement but I Would assume most people think the personality is the right personality in other words they created demeanor that they think is six\nUp to ... acceptable and successful for them to get through life so some people think the friendly as the way to go through life some people think that means a protective are angry um you know they think they're going to get more by approaching the world this way and so they have these personalities\nAnd that based personality itself\nIn my mind has a limitation I mean how far can you get as a grumpy old man how far can you get as hateful person a but see that's my belief system\nI may be wrong on that may be a hateful grumpy person can accomplish way more because they don't have any outside um distractions they don't listen to anybody else that you know maybe that is the right way\nI have is they can get more flies with honey\nRight but that's an assumption and the point I'm making to you is not only do we have\nAssumptions about specific things like finances right and the assumption that like you to think about today about find as as you don't have to work to be rich you don't have to work to make a living my assumption is you can create enough passive income\nTo replace you earn income and retire in two to five years that's a pretty strong base assumption now I've been teaching it for twenty seven years\nAnd for the last twenty seven years it's been working for people that put it to work and who actually except to remember what the polling hill said whenever the mind demand conceit and believe it can achieve so we can see and we believe that we can retire between two to five years\nMight take seven I used to say it was seven because I didn't know that we could do it even faster after we've proven that so many times over and over again people started on why am I going to wait seven\nI'm just going to go and get it done and two that's my goal and since we told stories of how I retired in two and a half years people going well team doing two and a half years I can do it in two I'm you know he started with no money he was you know working at a health club\nSo these base assumptions but now I'm taking it even further your base assumption on a factual things like how to make money\nWhich is very very important right\nLet's take that back one step and say okay what about just the general overall assumptions in life wow now this brings me to an interesting topic in my summer I talk about the tale of two ... two types of people that I run into\nAnd being a teacher and mentor or I had to figure out how to deal with each of these two different kinds of people because they bolt failed on their personalities and it was just based personality failure it had nothing to do with the material I was given the same material to both people\nBoth people were failing but we're failing in a different manner so I like to talk about the difference between the type a personality type B personality type a personalities someone with instantaneous gratification disease they want everything they want and they want it all and they want it right now\nAnd they have these needs\nTo get what they want it that they're driven when they want something they are insane uh my fiance is one of these type bass and stuff she does base theory is if she wants something shooting on her phone get on the Internet and she will shop for twenty four hours straight until she gets what she wants\nI mean it's just to watch or it's ferocious now on that same side of her that ferocious knows when she goes into tax a problem\nLike when I sat around to a health club or a ... apartment complex was an operating effectively she used that same ferocious ... to attack that problem she's a problem attacker challenge\nShe gets bored so whatever it was she bought that she loves she bored with it no time at all and want something else she needs constant new stimulation to keep going\nTo go further on type a personalities type\nI said basic belief systems one of them is if you stick thrown up mud on the wall something's got to stick so they take the shotgun approach to doing things whatever it is they do they're doing a lot of things all the same time try to eat it all done has what happens with a type a personality their weight almost everything they do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "02"}
