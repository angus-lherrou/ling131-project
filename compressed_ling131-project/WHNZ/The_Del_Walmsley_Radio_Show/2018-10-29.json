where he was absolutely you're listening to the opening balance ... are you getting ready for retirement and you want to do with the right way we have officers on main street in Sarasota Kennedy boulevard in Tampa, Florida even on K Street in Washington DC\nCome to his letter show you how to do it correctly or website address is Graham capital advisors dot com\nWe're going to check on on some of the newsmakers and also what listeners should look forward to this week coming up as\nHigh time the most iconic brand in the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I PO now by time magazine dot com\n[noise] [noise] you're listening\nTo the opening bound on third deemed one AM in Sarasota twelve fifty am in Tampa and we have ... on the line right now or some of the newsmakers dash\nTeddy we have a few and certainly looking back at what what\nIt's a very very difficult week I think a lot of listeners would not be surprised the first thing I'd mentioned would be corporate earnings now\nThis past week was the third week of for a week that you see the major or the S. and P. five hundred the NASDAQ and the Dow Jones industrial average uh companies report their third quarter earnings [noise]\nThe one of the major reasons why we saw a sell off this past week or more selling pressure uh was we got disappointing guidance is from a whole host of companies\nCompanies like Amazon alphabet also known as Google companies like caterpillar or three AM and then other types of companies in the semi conductor ... chips face like western digital or Texas Instruments [noise]\nIt was very interesting to know and maybe this goes back to my comment in the previous segment that the guidance is we're receiving from businesses are bad now some of it's due to\nLack of demand for products slowing economic growth now they're still economic growth but not growing at the same pace a end or in the case of a few companies the tariffs\nA but all in all the disappointing guidance is from major companies across a whole host of sectors and we haven't even talked about homebuilders will come under a lot of pressure in the last month\nA you're starting to see again I I think an investor sentiment that's really starting to dry up where the only buyer\nCould possibly the the businesses themselves and so what do you do in a market where the businesses are the only viruses shares\nRight very good points the option you know again because slow enough a Goldman Sachs has said that we'd have over a trillion dollars of stock buybacks this year and then it's slowed up now that the market's dropped ten percent they're going to be back in there again by and chairs\nBy insurers and that will then from the market up not as high but it will still bump it back up again and in a way you could you could say this this whole economy to take away the fangs stocks and all this financial engineering where would the stock market really be\nReal that's a very fair point that's a very fair point the only variable that has been mentioned that I Know we normally talk about this particular entity are pretty much on a maybe every other day basis\nUh ... what will make businesses buying back their stock difficult is that the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates\nAre at and maybe it's weird that we've gone twenty five minutes and our segment and we haven't brought up the Federal Reserve\nBut the Federal Reserve also the minutes they're meeting in September also produce selling pressure it during this respect the month of October\nAnd I think it will continue to be that way one of the major concerns is that that becomes more expensive the\nFederal Reserve will not care what the economy is doing a their primary concern right now is raising interest rates that when there is an economic pull back\nThe Federal Reserve has the ability to lower interest rates to stimulate through monetary policy stimulate economic growth\nAnd it works both ways the economy benefited the stock market benefited even more during President Obama's years uh do do a quantitative easing in a low interest rate environment which has produced a lot of wealth for people since the stock market is up about three hundred percent\nSince the great recession a and a lot of that had to do with the Federal Reserve being very accommodate of\nThe Federal Reserve now for the last two years or last three years uh it's not been in the opposite and so it'd be very reasonable uh for a casual observer to say well wait a minute\nIf the stock market is up three hundred percent since two thousand nine and we've had GDP Growth in annual average GDP Growth over that eight to nine year period of approximately one point eight to two percent\nHow does that happen a well I think a lot of people could point to the quantitative easing or the Federal Reserve being very very loose and supportive with their monetary policy\nBut that casual observer can say well wait a minute if they're doing the opposite now shouldn't that have the opposite effect\nSure well what's your listeners would be looking forward to this week\nWell we're getting our last week of corporate earnings I think this will be a very fascinating week we're not going to necessarily have the same amount of heavy hitters but we are going to have\nFortune five hundred companies or provide their respective earnings are to finish up the third quarter right now numbers had been good guidance is had been weak and we talked about that earlier in the segment we believe that will be more the same\nWhich could possibly and I know we're open up a strong this morning a but what we have noticed this month is even when the market has opened up strong\nTowards the end of the day more often than not the market has sold off and giving up a lot of those games we've only had a hand for days this month right stock market opened up strong and maintain that shrink throughout the entire trading day\nSure stuff as always we appreciate your sage advice and we'll be talking it tomorrow thanks now they used to ... take our guys Bye bye now let me get this and it's hard to believe it's been almost six years but by

as a kid I was able to save quite a bit of money and I saved up what I Would consider quite a bit of money hundred thousand two hundred thousand somewhere in that range um can't remember exactly it gets very hard for me to think back that far because I don't really care\nAnd reducing its history is something everybody makes up anyway so [noise]\nBut the reality is I had some money not a lot but to me it felt like a pretty comfortable until I lost it all the stock market\nAnd I say all that wasn't all that but it's a good portion of it was a good bike or and then I started buying houses in my thirties twenty five thousand dollars a house and I did that all the way up to house has got to fifty thousand dollars per house\nAnd when I was buying them at twenty five it was because they were they were on sale from fifty so the median price was fifty but we could buy stuff in foreclosure twenty five when he got back up to fifty I go you know there's probably no reason to be in real estate anymore it's over\nSo I got out and didn't really engage in anything at the time and this was only for a year a few months to you I'm not sure really might even not even been that long but I decided I'd better go do something else I looked into multi family and I started by small apartments\nAnd um because I could buy them cheap I could buy them ten thousand dollars a unit eight ten eight nine ten thousand most expensive ones I republic Thirteen thousand a year when it first started I thought that was really over paying [noise]\nPrevention I got up to Nineteen thousand a door and then I knew I was over paying\nAnd those same properties today was self or fifty or sixty thousand dollars a door but at that time I thought I was over paying because I'd started it you know eight nine ten thousand door got up to fourteen then I went to Nineteen was the last one I bought and oh man I really overpaid for this um\n[noise] and now I think about it and I think back and think I should have bought everything I could have bought\nI could have gotten my hands on more money I could have syndicated more deals I could have done you know stuff if I wanted to because I just sort of took it at whatever pace I could take that thinking I didn't want to overextend myself or make a mistake but the problem is now that I'm sixty two years old the problem is now\nThat's thirty forty years later older protect your well I could have burned I bypassed\nNo don't get me wrong you do well for myself and ended up trying to put myself down a notch tried to brag I'm just trying to tell you the truth that no matter how well the I Am right now I'm\nI bypass no that's pretty amazing I could have had ten times more and more and a half and I I Believe that if there's a blame I Would um pencil in that\nI didn't want to go backwards rule number one don't lose money last Monday the stock market but I had been trained into believing that failure was a massive option that you know it could happen and I didn't want it to happen that the markets go up and down up and down up and down up and down that could take somebody out\nBut I Lived through all the market's going up and down up down up and down and it never took me out in fact they never even really hurt me when the markets were crashing down I was happy because I could buy stuff that the central to the dollar increase the income of my portfolio\nI was not scared because I did not need to sell in nearby old portfolio there was no reason to because I was living out the cash flow not off\nOf a job that I lost\nAnd so why would I get rid of it it was cash flowing\n[noise] so I had to overcome that each and every time the cycle cycle up or down so you go through that and\nWe get out there are two thousand eight market crashes again and all of a sudden I can buy real estate prices I was used to buy get ten Twenty years earlier and I did buy everything I could get my hands on or at least I didn't I bought everything I thought was exciting enough\nTo get my hands on and I bypass it again\nAnd ah you know I bought probably a thousand units in a year or two when I probably should've bought ten thousand units during the year or two\nBut again just conservative middle class American been trained to believe that you know you don't have to really go out there and kill it just sort of get by and I did that and ended up making millions of dollars on the stuff that I did buy but I couldn't make\nHundreds of millions I may actually to make tens of millions on the stuff I bought I couldn't be hundreds of millions would have been more realistic if I Would have done it at a more aggressive pace so here I see now in the markets back up again and people are saying well\nNo need to get it now prices are too high we need to let it go back down again and then I've got other guys like Curtis changes sitting here going like I've got a ... got forty apartment complexes nine thousand units\nA herb announced every other real estate guru out there in the world who says they're superstars Curtis\nHas eight hundred billion dollars worth of real estate [noise]\nSo for all the guys out there screaming yelling our number one I

wisdom says you know the man on a mission to retire America One version at a time bomb sleigh\nLooking back to do on the radio show um today we've been discussing how we've been educated out of success\nAnd financial freedom we talked about how the schools have turned to some new drones but we can't think critically DeSalvo problems so I read an article about a family where both of them were teachers they both made sixty nine thousand dollars a year each\nUh they couldn't afford to live in San jose and so the husband is over driving at night\nSo let's talk about this for just a second\n[noise] isn't it your responsibility to take care of yourself\nAnd if so they put themselves in this situation they're living in a problem that they created themselves will do what do you mean they create the problem the the the cost of living has gone up no no no that's the cost of living ... out the problem\nThere the problem see that's what the liberals don't want you to believe they don't want you to believe it's your problem you created it they want you to believe that the rich people created ... ...\nSo let's talk about what the problem is number one problem is they want to live in California\nSixty nine thousand times too\nThat's uh Seventy seven hundred and forty thousand dollars a year you could live in Texas and you could live just fine but why can't you live in California well state income tax is one thing but here's another\nFifteen hundred square foot home costs six hundred and eighty thousand dollars why do you want to live in a state or a house that size costs six hundred and eighty thousand dollars that home in Houston cost a hundred thousand bucks or less\nAre you out of your mind believing that you have to live in California and yet you pissed and moan and write articles about how teachers are suffering\nThe problem is not teachers are suffering the problem is no one has taught them how to supplement their income\nAnd so if they want to do something you know what if I wanted to be I just love cleaning toilets what if that was going to be my career\nWhat if I loved helping people out down at the shelter that's because that's what I wanted to give back to society\nI have the right to make that choice but I Do not have the right for society than to be for me to demand of society to allow me to live like someone who went out and got a good job made a lot of money or had great investments\nSo it is then thinking it's not their fault it really irritates me I Know you guys are list is right now you're going oh that's so mean it's not mean it's human leading normal to believe you should take care of yourself\nTo think otherwise is a brainwash situation that you're educational system is put you into there is no way\nThat a teacher producers as much value as somebody that makes a million bucks a year somebody making a million bucks a year it's helping thousands and thousands of people get a product get a service gets something of value have a place to live\nAt a teacher's taking kids and teaching him at the same thing that we do right here in our home this week we have our annual\nChildren come to grandma's house and we've got all the children here and the grandchildren so all the children are millennials my fiance Melissa ... generation action I'm an old dude\nSo we've got people in the house or sixty two we've got people that are fifty we got a bunch of kids that are under thirty five hundred and thirty four and then we got grandkids\nAnd it's so interesting to see how each generation believes more and more and more so they deserve everything\nThe babies the kids scream and yell if they don't get their way and you know that's how they're going to grow up you know that's just society they're growing and joined the parents are ...\nThey know no better because they've been taught punishing your kid is bad you go to jail for spanking your kids you can't you don't punish kids anymore you know it takes a village to raise a kid you can't do it by yourself or blah blah blah blah you are creating disaster within your own family guys\nThese people solve their problem by either getting invested in real she now think about this what do you have ten years ago when they decided they wanted to be teachers or Twenty years ago when this either going to be teachers they bought a couple of rent
