AOL downloading\nIt's a known fact\nThat stocks are better than real estate as investments it's a known fact\nFirst of all it's not a fact real estate is ten thousand times more profitable than stocks are in every way shape and for you make money in real estate five different ways and the stock market only by appreciation real estate income tax free when done correctly which means even if we get half of it\nWe'd be equal to that but we do five times as much income as they do and yet it's tax free which makes it really ten times more profitable now I'm just throwing numbers out there those are not specific back I'm just\nRight now they're getting the fact that these idiots don't know what they're talking about it's so common when they had the new tax laws in place an idiot got on the radio on TV it started venting what are these reporters that now you could get all this income tax free because he changed the tax laws\nNo we've been able to get an income tax free for Thirty years but these idiots don't even know it\nAnd so what do they do they come on TV and they were ... Tate how stupid it an educated about the topic they are\nHow you get to be in Fox News or CNBC or an NBC or any of these stations CNN it'd become a fact reporter when you don't even know the fact\nThat what you're getting to me I'm going to cover the facts are today but what irritates me is that these guys get on T. V. spewing the lives and then his representations so that the electorate ends up with a median\nSavings account a five thousand dollars and an average savings account to Ninety five thousand dollars this is just ridiculous let's start out this article says there's seven reasons why stocks are better than real estate let's just take them\nOne at a time by the way the idiot wrote this articles name is Shawn leg Oh yes and this is from market watch the articles out of marketwatch shot if you're out\nThere listening please please come on the radio with me let me take your at off and show you how embarrassed you be to talk about stuff you know nothing about I Will bring facts figures people's deals financial whatever you need if you think you could stand up to even one tenth of the proof of what you're saying I don't think you could stand up to any myself\nSo let's talk about liquidity\nHe using the number one reason the stocks are better than real estate goes stocks are liquid if you want to get out you can get out All right let's explain to you\nThis is a misrepresentation the reason you can get out of stocks is two reasons one there's a liquid market for it there that's granted but to you have to get out at the price they're willing to let you out at\nIn other words if the stock market you bought a stock or a hundred dollars a share and it went down to Seventy five dollars a share yes you could get out immediately at Seventy five dollars a share\nBut that's not what you're saying what you're saying a real estate is I bought this piece of real estate for a hundred thousand dollars now it's worth four hundred thousand and it took me thirty days he said forty five days to sell it\nOf course it took forty five days so we're looking for a greater fool they don't pay four hundred thousand for something you paid a hundred thousand for you're going to wait until that person comes around but\nWould it be offered that piece of real estate that appraised for four hundred thousand for three hundred thousand\nThat piece of real estate would sell overnight instantly I cashed it out in a second I Do it all the time in seminar I say if you could buy this apartment this way cash flowing there's much who would buy it today\nNinety percent of the people that were raised their hands they would buy today that's how quickly I can sell piece of real estate when you're not trying to rip off the person you tried to sell it to\nIf you had a fixed market where whatever the appraisal was the property itself or you could sell real estate just as quickly as you could sell stocks but that's not what's happening people are trying to make massive capital gains are real estate or the stock market\nYou're happy to take whatever it is they're willing to give you the day you want to sell it is that liquidity\nIs that really liquidity\nWow let's say that you lose half of everything you're worth\nBut man you did it with such a liquidity [noise] that's so important isn't it I think if you think about what I'm saying you realize that they're not comparing apples to apples oranges Georgia's they're comparing somebody is letting their stocks go for a non premium price\nAnd that's why they sell so quickly real estate if it were sold for a non premium price would sell instantly also approved it many many times\nIt happens that some apartments don't even make your mark don't even make the market for even a day or two in fact and how has the same thing if you had ten rent houses we sell ... houses for you less than a week\nThat's how liquid real estate is compared to stocks it's as liquid if not more liquid because number one would you buy stocks yo nothing but a piece of paper and hoping to prayer they're going to go up but when you buy real estate you were getting\nCash flow the second you buy it so just like you want to bond or CD for one percent or two percent right now exciting see these two percent\nYou buy a piece of real estate deterrence ten

to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them right for\nCall today and we'll start\n\n\nWelcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom says you bring the man on a mission to retire American one person at a time bombs and he\nLooked back to do on the radio show today I'm dismantling an article written by somebody who knows nothing about what he's talking about the article is seven reasons why stocks are better than real estate and some Sean ... or something like that all those guys marketwatch\nArticle and um so we started to me and that would have shown there so you know picking on some guy I don't even know but the bottom line is if you read his material you can tell he doesn't know what we do at all he has no idea at all and he has no idea how to be rich and rich is because uh you can't be rich justify saying\nTells me he can't be rich there's no way could be rich\nI mean he's talking about things it's such an ignorant manner all he could do is make money saved money make money saved money because you're not making any money invested in the way he said this thing up his mind\nThe next ... and he says number six reason is because real estate or stocks are safe for the real estate when the market starts to go down you can get out of stocks easier that's absolutely alive here's the way I Want you to see it I Want you to vision this\nI Want you in addition that you're standing there\nHolding stocks and the guy's got a gun to your head and he says the stock market is going to go down today three hundred five hundred points your work can you get out\nThe answer is no you're not going to be to get out the middle but three or four or five hundred point drop you take to take the gun\nAnd shoots a bullet at you and you're dead you can't get out of the way of something that moves that quickly the stock market moved very rapidly now let's take real estate let's say somebody says okay interest rates are starting to go up\nThat means there's going to be some point where the cost of real estate with the interest rates involved is going to not allow the price of real estate to go up any more um\nThey start tightening up the lending requirements are they let the lender requirement get too loose and people start to falter loans over a long period of time you can see that there's going to be the loosening of the market to where it becomes um safer is a bubble people pay way too much real estate I Want you to think about that as being a train tracks and the guy standing there with your going look\nAt trains coming\nAnd it's going to run you down\nThat's there's no doubt about it it's going to run you down and you know it's not I'm just a step off the tracks\nYou can ... come in and you can see that trade to come in\nAnd when we had the real estate drop of two thousand eight two thousand and the only people lost money where the people that didn't know what they're doing they're paid way too much for the stuff they bought there were speculative buyers and the market to buy and flip type stuff that's what they were doing they're stuck with this stuff\nIt was people who lost their jobs couldn't pay the payments on the real estate they bought which they shouldn't have bought because they couldn't afford to pay it you know if you can't afford to pay for your real estate\nAh and I'm Talking about what you live in\nEven if you don't have a job for six months to your then you've got too expensive a piece of real estate you're limited and you know so these people they they they lost this money over a ... year period of time because of ignorant decisions where they didn't listen for the train coming down the tracks\nDuring that very time when everybody else was losing money we were making a killing\nProbably the most profitable two years I ever had in my entire life was two thousand nine two thousand and uh just on golly gosh great investing and everybody else to say well oh my God real estate is taking us all down no it took us down\nRight so think about that would you rather have a gun to your head as a threat or train down the tracks as a threat I was just the train is what I'll take every day that they will wake up tomorrow and having by noon to stocks without Bible reports I Can't live that way\nOr you know I'm too old I could have a heart attack and that kind of stuff that I don't know how you keep them when you wake up one day and thirty percent of your wealth was gone every person bring on the radio that you were listening to the story is always the same why did you come to real estate\nBecause it's safer because I lost forty percent of my network in stocks\nThis guy is so wrong his argument is so upside down and silly you wonder how he even gets published\nMaybe he pays to publish his stuff I don't know whatever and number seven fewer taxes and fees are you out of your mind have you totally lost it does this guy even bother to do any research report he writes something Sean Sean Combs Sean Sean\nReal estate investor when done correctly don't pay any taxes on their income you pay taxes on everything you do every single transaction that you make money and\nYou're paying taxes on how the heck can you say there's less taxes would be oh there's there because there's property taxes they don't have property taxes you don't need property taxes because you don't own anything you own a piece of paper\nAnd the only game and you get is capital gains and that's all taxable by the way even if they threw out some dividends that would be tax\nBut the property taxes\nWe pay come out of our net or gross proceeds to allow the net proceeds so what we're talking to you about the rate of return that net of the property taxes you dumb completely ignorant person writing articles\nThere's no way you should be allowed to write articles hey if I were going to write something I Would go look up the facts before I let it wrote something it made a fool out of myself this is just the most ridiculous article I've ever seen in my life there is no seven ways why stock you're better real estate he named up seven reasons real estate is better",
