up to the one that convened in November on the Russian election interference\nBe very interesting to see Capitol Hill for the next month month and a half is going to be very busy or before the midterm elections are and with that being said this will certainly be a very interesting day because you've had several officials from the government\nWhether the president himself or leaders from the from the majority of them in\nA minority parties come out with some pretty strong statements specifically in this issue of\nHow technology companies are monitoring the disinformation a issues that are starting to play a what a lot of people believe are are are a balanced politics\nSure ... here's something that you know the media is picking up quite a bit you know Nike took a hit yesterday\nI'm On social media especially and much less I guess the and I don't know what the stock prices doing today over this Kaepernick deal and you know the backlash started just almost immediately\nAnd one what would you think they're thinking was\nWhen they decided to come up with an advertising or believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything and all that business what's your take on that\nUh well you know it it my my thought is largely muted uh in regards to business in particular stock prices Nike's up today but it's it's not much there are\nLike point seven percent a that pales in comparison to selling pressure that they saw yesterday or they were down more than three percent for most of the trading day\nUh it talks about how businesses and then if they\nDo get a political in nature whether they believe maybe they weren't\nUh they they are and so when you make decisions like that there is the possibility you're going to suffer the consequences Nike is not the only company a that gets involved in these types of of situations remember there was a very big merger\nThat just while it was ruled in favor of a teen teen time Warner and their merger against apartment a justice that a lot of people believe that merger was very politicized than it\nDid not like CNN and he did not want to see the merger goes through\nThe judge ruled in favor of Eighteen team Time Warner said there is no case law that's preventing or or preventing this merger from happening and really slapped down that department of justice a in a very very one sided ruling and its fearful among a lot of people that\nThe damage that happened in the ruling against the department of justice even though they're appealing to right now uh the damage is done against the department of justice will uh restrict its ability to go after other mergers that maybe would be seen as\nMore of a a more of a risk to overall anti trust business matters\nSure no sewers several analysts said that that might Nike did that sent a strong signal to their current roster of athletes and and positions Nike that's kind of a savvy risk taker is there's not a move that any company can make\nA night for for Nike it was definitely a a smart business move 'em you know ... you know namely who buys your shoes this to me you know I guess just about every minority kid in the country was Nike shoes ... and\nAnd uh it was obviously a risk but it was also by doing that and we were making a pronounced political a political statement to themselves so\nThat'd be said as anyone else out there\nRight well in addition to the situation of forty with Nike and in addition to what we're seeing right\nNow uh with the uh the big tech companies coming to the hill\nSaudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants oil stay between

week nights at seven\nTwelve fifty W H in the sanction welfare\nWhen one way or the path of helpful\nYou can listen on our first I ... [noise] downloading now\nYou've CBS News on the hour sponsored by their works really\nAnd I I say that because you can't even see the difference between working in a business and actually owning a business and today I'm going to go through that by the way this was a cheese if you'll stick with me through the whole show I'm going to take you through the kinds of money you can make a single family small apartments medium apartments large apartments were going to go through\nThis growth process uh which is a natural growth process of a real estate investor and show you how life changes but what I Want to frame this with\nIs that there is a life cycle\nThat fits around some of this stuff and maybe you can change the dates of the life cycle like we have some young students that came into your job will react comes to mind you just came here around twenties I think\nBy the time he was mid to late twenties already own apartment complexes now he's in his early thirties and I'm sure he's a mega millionaire by now old multiple multiple apartment complexes\nUh so he changed the ... the dates that the times structure when she got into entrepreneur realism and really skip working for somebody else he never really had a job he came out of\nHigh school is dad asking do you want to go to college or do you want to start a business and he elected to start a business so he skipped the one that most of us get stuck in for most of our lives so let's look at this one here we are\nGetting up every day I was working twelve hours a day six days a week\nOr getting up everyday and going to work out before I worked at the health club which actually liked even though it was twelve hours a day six days a week I worked in finance company so I learned a lot about finances money loans and debt and all this stuff working in the finance company but it was the most boring job and the whole I remember sitting there watching the clock tick away\n... when do I get out of here so I could go do something like ... worthwhile\nBut I quit that and eventually became a truck driver\nAnd as a truck driver I go boy this is just hell on wheels man this is the worst life in the world get up at four o'clock in the morning load your truck drive around and unload stop all day long you get done you know four o'clock after you have to unload trucks clean your truck there are five six o'clock at night exhausted\nNo energy to go out and live your life to exercise fitness or anything so I had to give that job up I got rid of that would very quickly and then I should you know what\nIf I'm going to live a life of hell if I'm going to get up every day and be miserable and work all day long\nAt least let me do it in something I enjoy doing so I went to work at a health club which is really my hobby was bodybuilding power lifting Olympic lip\nAnd so when I wasn't a health club at least I liked what I did most of the day\nIt was interesting there were some things I didn't like like I didn't like to sell had to learn how to sell memberships that wasn't something that was to power or to\nPositive at the time although I learned to do it in order to do it well it was something that I had to wrap my arms around because any business they want you to do things sometimes those things are ethical sometimes they're not ethical\nSometimes the relevant sometimes they're not relevant and you know when you're doing you're wasting your time that this is a gigantic waste of my life\nAnd I did that for twelve years but during that time had all kinds of other aspirations one contest power lifting body building contest during that time so I was able to keep my mind\nStayed off by just by going out here and saying what's important to me in life is is these bodybuilding trophies you know and I I I joke about the trophy stop the trope the trophy means absolutely nothing got tons of them from both Olympic lifting power lifting body building\nA and other things up one wards that just about everything over done of always strive to be the best I could be at\nAn deal wards are really nothing\nExcept the representation that you put full for\nPut forth all one hundred percent of your effort to accomplish something where everybody else just sits wipe out they sit on the sidelines and they produce the minimum necessary to get by\nAnd I think that's important to realize when you're living that life of mediocrity when you're living the life of quiet desperation getting up and going to work every day and that's what was to me and I truly believe I don't care who you are\nThat's what it is to you you're living alive a quiet desperation you've got nothing in your life to get up and look forward to yeah you've got something to get up and do\nThat has to be done I get that but you have really nothing to live for there's no future being built for you there is no growth process there's no end all be all result it's going to change your life position\nAt the end of all that is just simply getting\nOn that little wheel\nAnd that little mouse cage and running the little we'll round and round and round me go where we stop nobody knows that's the kind of thing that I see happening to people and as you go through that and you see these things happening to people you realize that they don't see it\nThat's the problem when I was in it I felt it many of you are in it and you feel it but I don't think you see it\nMy goal why I've been put on this earth is to get out the message they stop feeling it and start seeing we'll be right back with the Dell wildly

myself\nTo live day to eight eighty you've got to ask yourself you know where you're at your\nDynamic and what I Want to get across to use that want to get across to you that when I started\nBuying real estate it was because I knew that I needed a business that pay me instead of me working for the money my money was working for me so I went out bought single family house made about two hundred dollars a month positive cash flow any child when I first started about over a hundred houses I ended up with about ten grand a month of positive cash flow\nThat was tax free\nTen grand him up was way way way more than I was making in my job I made Seventy grand a year after taxes will bring home probably thirty five hundred four thousand a month and year I was making ten thousand dollars a month there was a no brainer for me to quit my job I make more money in real estate that I did my job\nNow for you you have to think about that I had to break the seal I had\nTo step outside of my comfort zone and go by an asset and get a mortgage and go into debt and learned to manage a red house I didn't have lifestyles are limited to teach me how to do it I didn't have any mentors I read some books that you know I took some took some video courses but they were\nPretty shabby to be honest with you back then but still I had my way through it ended up with a hundred houses\nThen I decided to get rid of the hundred houses start buying apartment complex was I bought small apartment complex\nI remember having attenuated apartment complex was making me two thousand dollars a month I was making two hundred dollars a month in each unit will see ... types and those two thousand dollars a month twenty four thousand a year tax free\nWas phenomenal I did almost nothing to run this ten years it was simple and I was making additional two thousand dollars a month tax free then I went out and bought myself\nA from the twenty I went and bought a thirty unit the thirty unit was making me tremendous amount of money three thousand four thousand bucks a month or something like that uh and now what was making more money\nYou know tax free that I was making you know\nEver at my job by double that I went and bought a forty unit made some money and then I went and bought a sixty sixty four unit was really the that was the ... and that was the turning point for everything the sixty four unit was making me about ten thousand dollars a month by itself forget about all the other stuff this one\nProperty I put a hundred and fifty thousand dollars down to buy that today you'd probably have to put\nProbably five hundred thousand dollars down to buy that property [noise] um but I bought it and after I bought that one I bought the one across the street and I bought the one
