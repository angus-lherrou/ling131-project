disruptions in energy was able to move up and down the eastern uh eastern coast without concern\nBut again from an energy and her energy independence perspective we're absolutely there are the world's movements and natural gas in liquid five natural gas is very important in that uh because as we use\nLiquefied natural gas and natural gases energy substitutes for crude oil and coal ah it's only

description of the economy or the economic outlook saying quote unquote it's remarkably positive\nUh and market watchers are certainly on the lookout for more quote unquote fetch speak and remember fed speak is again as we just mentioned a what a lot of the voting members of the Federal Reserve come out and do their public\nOther public speeches overall or seen seven fed officials or speak today a loan or about where they see the economy where they see the growth and ultimately where they see the Federal Reserve\nWhich is certainly again very very important when people are determining asset prices now\nDefending OPEC oil market strategy at the Russian energy week going on right now Qatari energy minister a spoken hit back criticism from President Trump he said quote\nOPEC is not trying to manipulate the price it's trying to bring the market to balance he declared now we don't think this situation is going to end anytime soon obviously the president is very very outspoken especially on Twitter which is where he's been making a lot of his comments against OPEC it was just last week that he took his comments\nAre about OPEC to the U.N General assembly a that really started to push the issue I don't again I don't think this issue's going away anytime soon the president knows the president's economic team knows how important it is\nTo keep energy prices down because it allows consumers more money to spend on good maybe to invest maybe by other discretionary guts because energy prices\nYou need to fill your car up it's one of those expenses that you have to do if you have a

to process cold ... own in [laughter] on retiring and the main reason they choose to return to work that isn't surprising it's all about money they haven't saved enough\nOr recent retirement study's report estimates that the average American that's the average the median average has a retirement savings around Seventy one thousand dollars and that is far short of what experts say is needed to retire comfortably only thirty percent\nThirty percent experts say has had more than a quarter of a million dollars and meanwhile the number of older Americans filing for bankruptcy it has increased five fold in the last Twenty years so what does this mean the sooner that you start saving for retirement the better\nYou take the initiative you take the initiative you know we're going into a crazy month we talked about this this is October October and I can't stress enough this is the most multiple months of the year historically anything could happen at any time\nNow and all the crashes that we've had from black Monday to the to the actual crash itself the great depression started in October\nThe great the financial crisis started we can go on and on with us\nBut the fact of the matter is that it's October now anything could happen we have mid term elections coming up\nWe have these tariffs kicking and we have interest rates that are rising who knows what's going to end this ten year

kind for the study was done it back to back years raising twenty thousand dollars for for the Susan Komen Foundation\nOr maybe those are things that just the beginning you know donating suppliers going on a mission trip to Guatemala was another thing we did last year I mean these are just some of the things that we want to be able to do because as you say we've already hit our financial freedom liberty it that it's about now leaving a lasting mark so um it's very very important for fraud that trucker for you\nKnow we say we Robert that interesting because I I don't know who the we in your group is can you share that with everybody who the we is\nYeah I mean I might companies my team you know it's my work family I mean these are people that started business with me these are people that um\nI identify with the business\nYou know that that are are there when I'm not fair that believed for me when I'm not believing I mean it just it it's it's it's the company in the street that every business just like in your business if the people you know the continuity is that\nThe that commitment to excellence when you're when you're not watching ... having the tell them to to commit for excellent I mean it it that's what we have it so we feel very blessed and what we've done at the company as a group um you know we want to be able to leave that lasted legacy\nFor you know that that that brand name that would that we're trying to build\nYou know I Know that your employees mean a great deal to you you've ... you've expressed it and showed it not just ... physically and so many different ways\nHow did you develop that where did that come from for you to believe that that was the basis of your business the employees as opposed to the success of the business what what was it that drove you to that\nYou know um I I've thought about that question a lot because I've I've asked myself you know where to start and I think it started with my father I think it started you know he worked to water for forty five years\nHe was a company man that he was a builder teens he got the very best people you know I and I never I don't remember him sharing less on the one to one basis\nI'm too often it was just more just like listening to the conversation while he was on the phone or going to do mystery shops with him and and\nYou know read in the backseat or from water to water burger at two in the morning three in the morning as who joined us being a graveyard shift mystery shop you know and just watching him talk that to everybody that I think that just in my DNA\nYou know I've always felt that my natural coach a natural developer of talent and being able to get the bad side of people and and I I realize\nThat that started first before I understood what I was doing you know being able to help somebody out and find out what it is that they wanted what it is that they value most and try to help them get it I had no idea that that would translate into a building a business\nI just thought it was being a decent human being you know just trying to add value in the world trade trying to trying to give back without any kind of\nExpectation of getting a return I I think it just all started there you know and I credit my father for having that that generosity and him um that that I think he passed down to me um because again maybe look I I don't want I'm going to get to the top of them out I Know that but I don't want to get there at low\nI Want to make sure that people around me people that we can slap each other on the back and give out how they might share the memories and the dreams that how we got here\nYou know and I think that's what we're doing here and I think that's what separates our company for many others is that it's a special place to be where everybody's pulling in the same direction you know when we lose we all the way we all win you know and nobody likes to lose so we're we're going to our best to not let the other person down it's a dirty as a family atmosphere\n[noise] what did you learn from your mother Robert you talk about your father all the time what did you learn from your mother\nMy mother I've ever ego my mother my my mother is extremely strong with your typical Hispanic mom you know very strong she's the leader of the family she always reminded me to play the plate of where you know she always reminding me to go out there and and\nAnd play for yourself and play for others around you but don't ever not try\nYou know and and I think I think that's where I developed for her my dad had a lot of this you know incredible intelligence and and as you know generosity as we may be but my mom had had the had the attitude you know the added the expectation of excellence and the and the and the winning and I I think I think that that that's what I got from my mama\nSo that sounds like the matriarch type family would would that be true\nYeah yeah absolutely after you didn't want to I didn't want to disappoint ... uh uh either one of my parents you know I feared my father I respect that my father I loved in feared and respecting my mama you know I just I don't I didn't want to let them down either one of them\nWell that's an interesting question because you know you you want to look at you and say you were obviously patriarch society family\nYou're you had a matriarch mother and um that's got to be difficult when it comes to things like relationships and so forth so it's interesting how you've tried to take that we'll take a short break Robert us you've got so much to talk about

with me here today is rubber Martinez one of the most successful rules to investors lifestyles\nI'm Robert his compost tremendous amount in a very short period of time\nAnd yet he's continuing to grow is process Robert as we look back and you think about things I don't think winters like yourself ever really fail they don't ever really lose\nI'm I really hate self help people to tell you you have to stay with the times if you haven't filled in the times you know if you're not where you want to be the field of the times I don't really believe that that's not my belief system at all although every cellphone guy says that stuff\nI don't think you've ever failed but what I Do think is that as we get into this process\nThings become self evident they cut it uncovered it's like wow now I understand and you look back and you go if only I had not made that decision by this way do you have these deals things when you look back and go\nMan I Wish that would have turned out differently I Wish I Would have done it differently do you have any of those types of that now that twenty twenty hindsight vision that you would have changed\nYou know I don't I I I agree with you I don't eat people fail I think though that definition and everybody has a different definition of it\nEverything is a learning experience for sure um I I Can't think of like some magical you know example I Do think it's very difficult uh when you hire people um and maybe you had more insight\nYou could have made a different decision certainly you know we as we get older we get more ... more wise and you get more experience right but that ... that comes from making mistakes\nOr or that comes from you know I'm I'm going through a situation and and maybe not everything going out the way the way you expect it so you know I I don't think I have a ... a particular example where oh I failed and I wish I had done this or you know something I Wish I could undo I I Wish I had um\nHad a little more confidence but he's not in myself early on and I wish I'd gone a little bit faster I think if I had you know and you were there telling everybody to you know to buy and you can't get rich going slowly you know I never understood that until I got to a ... a appointed experience where like dang it\nYou know I he's right I mean I if I could have bought or deals\nOff earlier in the cycle you know then they'd be worth so much more today and what have you but at the same time I don't I don't I don't dwell on that because I think you know you're you're an operator and you know what you're doing you're going to create value you know and so whether you're buying stuff that twenty thirty thousand a door you're buying as when stuff is\nFifty sixty Seventy thousand a door as long as you're pushing ... as long as you're doing a good job and you're keeping your property is all you're going to push rents rents means that ... going to go up\nYou know and you're going to keep your expenses down because everybody's renewed right so you can create the value but you know certainly I Wish you know I was buying a little bit faster\nYou know I as we were kind of learning our processes you know we're very methodical and I didn't want to go and go quickly whereby about one deal year you know and that was that was fine I think the deals are a little too small\nYou know in hindsight I Wish we had pushed up a little bit higher than we've got a little bit more\nEconomies of scale a little bit better unit count and the more unique how means more income more ... more more opportunity for overhead and getting getting a a you know maybe better people more quality people I'm more experienced people but other you know so there's no real example I think everything is just you know experience\nI Want you to share it with his little learning curve of when you bought the class a downtown Houston in that\nYou system firmly in place and I thought you were going to be able to pick up that system stick it on top of that property making conform to your system you've told me many times you had to completely re learn the business can you share that with people what you had to go through to to\nTotally ... a different situation ever run into before\nFor sure how much time do I have left out on this\nOr you've got six minutes\nOkay perfect okay so I was wondering if that's the example you were looting too you know when you're asking for like something where maybe I Do that you know I\nReally actually I actually wasn't Robert I wasn't thinking that's all kind of guy who wasn't okay I I don't consider the saluting situation I considered one of the turning point to your career where you told Olson stuffed ... out of you that I'd never heard\nBefore\nYeah you know for sure I I think finally class they you know reaching you know you go above and beyond the model our model\nIt's up by working class property being the property you know buy properties where my mom was the same as most everybody else as well just some some refinement here and there but we're gonna fix anything that's going to break or the next five years we're going to make sure that there's no reason to move out right we're going to take care of all the air conditions because that's the number one maintenance headache\nAnd if you're residents if it's not eighty six degrees in their apartment in August and it's a cause Seventy two they're more than likely to renew right and we make our money in the renewal game so it's it's a you know that process it's a little bit different when you're going to live in a market where everything's already knew\nRight where where if they can afford the rent level at that number than to than they can afford the rent not written that rent number at other similar properties which are also knew\nSo I think the the the business model of you know fix and everything that's broken and and getting the renewal is very different than the a market um I I think I think you have to it's a it's much more um\nThere's a higher emphasis on leasing leasing East St because you're you're dealing with people who have more options money gives you an option to use a lack of
