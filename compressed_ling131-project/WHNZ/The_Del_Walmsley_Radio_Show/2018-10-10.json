is stealing a learnt electoral property but but it's been going on for a long time so I guess the question is should we manufacture anything over there for the safety or security of our country or do you think that's going to have any bearing on Wall street\nOh I think eventually once they're able to figure out a what exactly\nIs is going on and I think that's a big concern it certainly doesn't help trade talks when you have concerns of espionage in in in in in in tapping\nInto some of our largest companies especially companies that have a lot of ties with US government and business or Amazon Google they have a lot of contracts or with the United states government\nRight when we scale disrespect of space and we study it it it ... it brings a very very difficult situation a very

be I'd be curious and the next show you can get some data that some information on that and and see that because when you're thinking about here's Amazon they were creating a highly secure the cloud

[noise]\nYou see the news on the hour sponsored by their works releases I'm Steve cave [noise]\nJust an automatic emails that went out that at all linked to a a file in it and I got sort of the mailbox money would come in and my inbox thing you just made a sale and it was all automated on the site and are from\nThere I have actually started to turn my attention to real estate a little bit I'm One of the first things that I did was I bought a course by somebody I've heard you mentioned before Carlton sheet and uh\nIt was probably a couple of hundred dollars probably saw it on a an infomercial one night and thought you know I'm going to go ahead and buy this course and it was one of those no money down courses and I don't think I ever used any of the techniques that he really was talking about in the program but it really was sort of a primer for me to help me to get started and\nJust to understand some of the basics of real estate investing and um so that's sort of where I began\nSo at what age was is and where did you finally take action why what made it possible for you to go out to buy your purse property\n[noise] uh I was\nProbably I'm guessing in my late twenties early thirties when I started to do some of this real estate investing research and at the time when we were doing this my mom was actually a realtor she passed away in two thousand nine\nI bet she was a realtor hadn't been involved in any rental properties herself and we saw an opportunity to get into the market by purchasing a four Plex and so we went out and um\nIt was a deal where my mom was the three quarter owner and I was a one quarter owner um we\nPut down I think Fifteen Percent back at the time on a five hundred and fifty thousand dollar property and uh\nWe each put down somebody we took about thirty thousand dollars of the down payment on the line of credit and so with that partnership we we purchased the four\nPlex which I still own today which is appreciate it quite a bit in value and that sort of how I have been successful in real estate at the beginning was really just managing some properties and and holding them for Fifteen\nYears in Southern California which of course with the appreciation that didn't really show that I was a great real estate investor but just that I was able to manage some property and hold onto it for a period of time\nDid you have any cash flow at that time were\nUh when we first bought the property it was it was for unit and we pretty much had to have all four units or rent it at\nThe time in order to make sure we're paying the bills and paying the\nMortgage and the cash flow is very small the cash on that building now because we've had quite a while\nUm is is pretty good um although you know when you look at Southern California real estate\nWe have a couple of single family homes I'm One of them we just sold a last week it just closed and if you look at the value of the home and the cash flow that it's putting off it was it was not very strong and so that's one of the things that I took away from\nA lifestyles unlimited teaching was to get that equity out and start putting it to work in a place that was going to\nGive a much better return so that's one of the reasons we sold one of our single families is to be able to read a ploy that money and get it back into a multi family investments and investments that are going to have a much better return\nYou know that's such a true fact in California is like the epitome of that as the capital gains a value goes up who called just appreciation California as you appreciation goes up the value goes up\nThat's more and more data equity when you look at the return on equity in the deal the returns get low very very low very quickly so you need to be able to pull that money out and go do something else with it which is what you've been doing a very successfully let's take a look at um\nThe the concept that you and your wife got married and you had a house and she had a house there's just so typical of how people that were really on purpose to get into real estate investing\nAnd up in real estate investing by just shuffling houses between family members and so forth tell us how that happened with you and the wife and you guys had all these houses back and forth between the two of you\n[noise] so uh we had just bought that for unit apartment complex I'm probably the year before we got married and then I met my wife Julie and when I met her we were both just about closing on our first personal rather than if I owned a condo and I was\nTrading up out of that into a single family home and she was purchasing a town home her town elements in Irvine um my single family homes in Costa Mesa\nAnd so we ended up getting married and we decided well we're going to only be able to live in one of these so we decided to live over in Irvine and her town home\nAnd uh we rent it out the place in Costa Mesa which we still have\nAnd we lived there for about two years and then uh we got pregnant and we're going to have our first child and the house in Costa Mesa had a much bigger backyard and it was just a little more conducive for raising children and so we went ahead and\nYou know moved out of the vine place but instead of selling that and you know using the money on trips and fancy cars and boats and whatever we said no we're going to keep that house and we're going to transition over into the coast of Maine is south of so we did that so I've really only the four Plex that we purchased\nMy mom and I purchased together is really the only investment property that I'd ever bought on my own the other two homes that we have um we currently live in Huntington Beach and so\nAlready act we're going to take a break broke this was a perfect

at a\nMom's back to\nDo a show with me days Martelly mark is a investor out of a California and mark is also a Southern California bastard or to get into that later right now what I Want to cover up recover here is that a way more came here for the expo\nAnd the bus tour she got to meet\nActual investors I Want to see real estate industries but that's real investors but that's too close to real estate goes so actual investors that had done multiples of deals and that gave him some insight into it's interesting a mark as I talk about this\nTo me as a reader of character is really what I Do more than anything else in life is that you a mathematician\nLook more too personal touches to make big decisions in your life and those personal touches made a difference that you decided you can change your path to get into this or multifamily stuff in this past and stuff so as you made that decision how did you\nUm decide which lead investors you wouldn't do that by the way mark is now in seven passive apart multifamily apartment deals and he's been doing this a shit what two thousand the beginning of two thousand eight teams when you started by multifamily mark\nWell February's when it came to the two day in a Palm Springs so I've been um a preferred member for about seven months and you've already done seven deals right\nIt's outstanding as you get into this tell us as an investor which that asked this question of everybody this is common question which is more important to you the lead investor or the deal itself\nHow they got on the horse hey I've\nHeard you asked that question before um I definitely am going to go with the lead investors more important to me because ah as I've heard people say before you know at a top lead investor that really understands what they're doing\nCan take a property that uh maybe somebody else couldn't do that much with and they can do a tremendous things with it um whereas somebody that's not as accomplished as a leap um might not be able to do as well so I'm definitely I'm writing whip delete investor and I have to tell you sort of a funny story when I first came to the expo\nUm I had asked at the two day someone I think I even asked you at the meat Dell and said you know I don't mind putting down to money for this a preferred program because I think it's well worth it but am I going to be able to get in any deal\nAnd that was my fear is I'm going to put down this money and I'm not going to be able to get in the deal and so um\nYou know I came to the expo\nAnd are on the Thursday night right for the bus tour a I got an email from Robert Martinez who is one of the leads that I really wanted to get in with and and I had heard him on this radio show I had heard him on the podcast\nAnd so I had heard him talk about how out of all these apartment complexes that he has he has returned over a hundred percent too I think ten or eleven different groups of investors and I thought I Need to invest with him and so\nI actually got an email from him on that Thursday night when I went back up to my hotel room saying we've got a new deal coming up if you're interested please or respond to this and let us know and so I I put in my information\nAnd it asked how much I wanted to invest and I said well I Want to invest somewhere between fifty in a hundred thousand dollars and when he when I saw him the next day on the bus tour he came on the bus tour and he told us what his minimum investment was and\nAnd it was a hundred thousand on that kind of a deal and I said oh I just said fifty two hundred this isn't gonna be right and so I went up and talk to him\nAnd he said now it's no problem you know send me an email back and fix that up and belonging sort of the story is I ended up two weeks later are getting into my first deal a maple trail with Robert Martinez and\nUm you know I think he carved out a spot for me as a new investor which I really appreciate it and I I told him as much and so that was the first deal I got into and and the second deal\nI also made a contact through the expo and was able to um get into my next feel that way as well\nIt's interesting that um I think a lot of people believe the same thing a mark that going to be difficult to get into these deals I Know that when I decided to go passive or just earlier this couple of months ago\nA bit out of nowhere\nHired like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom is they're they're out there they're all over the place is just a matter of getting involved with it um\nSince you started I Know there's no most of these deals don't pay off in the first couple of months so we won't go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan developing here [noise]\nWell I'm like I said I could be if I worked until I was sixty five I could be teaching for another\nYou know nine years and I'm thinking that uh as I mentioned earlier maybe I can shave seven years or so off of that so I'm thinking I may work for another year or two in my really my plan in the meantime has to\nRead the play as much money as I can out of these other properties that we have to go in addition to the house we just saw that we also or refinanced our other single family home um about three or four months ago\nAnd I was able to already take that money and that's part of it allowed me to get into some of these other deals and so really my goal is to get as much money working for me as possible in the multi family", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley
