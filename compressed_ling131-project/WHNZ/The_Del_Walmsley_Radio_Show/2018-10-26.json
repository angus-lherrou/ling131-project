CEO Jack Dorsey are going to testify before the Senate intelligence committee about how the big technology companies are preparing for the midterm elections\nOr Google executives were invited to appear but declined the offer that vicious hearing is a follow up to the one that convened in November on the Russian election interference\nBe very interesting to see the\nCapitol Hill for the next month month and a half is going to be very busy or before the midterm elections are and with that being said this will certainly be a very interesting day because you've had several officials from the government whether the president himself or leaders\nFrom the from the majority are meant a minority\nParties come out with some pretty strong statements specifically in this issue of\nHow technology companies are monitoring the disinformation a issues that are starting to play a what a lot of people believe are are are a balanced politics\nSure ... here's something that you know the media is picking up quite a bit you know Nike took a hit yesterday I'm On social media especially and much less I guess the\nAnd I don't know what to stock prices doing today over this Kaepernick deal and you know the backlash started just almost immediately\nAnd one what would you think they're thinking was\nWhen they decided to come up with that advertising or believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything and all that business what's your take on that\nUh well you know it it my my thought is largely muted uh in regards to business in particular stock prices Nike's up today but it's it's not much there are like point seven percent or that pales in comparison is selling pressure that they saw yesterday or they were down more than three percent for most of the trading day\nUh it talks about how businesses and then if they\nDo get a political in nature whether they believe maybe they weren't\nUh they they are and so when you make decisions like that there is the possibility you're going to suffer the consequences Nike is not the only company a that gets involved in these types of of situations remember there was a very big\nMerger that just while it was ruled in favor of Eighteen teen time Warner and their merger gets apartment a justice but a lot of people believe that merger was very politicized ... did\nNot like CNN and he did not want to see the merger goes through\nThe judge ruled in favor of Eighteen team Time Warner said there's no peace law that's preventing or or preventing this merger from happening and really slapped down the department of justice a in a very very one sided ruling and itch fearful among a lot of people that\nThe damage that happened in the ruling against the department of justice even though they're appealing right now or the damage is done against the department of justice will uh restrict its ability to go after other mergers that maybe would be seen as\nMore of a a more of a risk to overall anti trust business matters\nSure no I saw or several analysts said that that might Nike did that it sent a strong signal to their current roster of athletes and and positions Nike that's kind of a savvy risk taker is there's not a move that any company can make\nThe NYC for for a Nike it was definitely a a smart business move 'em you know you know namely who buys your shoes this to me you know I guess just about every minority kid in the country whereas Nike shoes vacillates and and ah it was obviously a risk but it was also by doing that I mean they were making a pronounced\nPolitical a political statement to themselves so that'd be said as anyone else out there\nRight well in addition to the situations of forty with Nike and in addition to what we're seeing right now uh\nWith the uh the big tech companies coming to the hill\nSaudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants oil ... between Seventy and eighty dollars a barrel for now according to a OPEC a release that came out over the weekend\nAs the world's largest or as the world's biggest crude exporter or they're looking to find a balance between maxim fighting revenue in keeping a lid on prices until the congressional elections and this is very interesting obviously it's one thing to see in a release that they like to keep all between Seventy and eighty dollars a barrel\nThat's another thing for sources to say well they're going to wait until the congressional\nLecture and see how this is going to take place very interesting situation obviously big ramifications here in the United states is we've seen a lot of uptick in energy

B. day to Durham and suggested he brought on to talk about the topics that he is trying to promote today are holding now to the break was Doug and Doug's here with Jennifer Doug why don't you pick it up where you took off or before the break and we had to cut you off\nOkay do\nBasically just learning about real estate to lifestyles unlimited really changed our lives\nAre we were able to grow the money that we had staked tremendously in the things that we've already done that wouldn't have happened if we hadn't gotten the education through lifestyles much like in dentistry would go continuing education that usually leads to growth in practice\nIt's the same way with lifestyle if not when it's all the\nEducational event lifestyles puts on watch the videos\nInteracted with our mentors or met other people who were successful and that just political light years ahead of where we would have been had we not gotten the information\nOn how to invest wisely in real estate so I Would encourage you know anybody listening is a professional to treat this just like they do there's continuing education in their profession except it's a new venture for you you got to learn what you don't know but\nLifestyles makes it easy makes it very understandable and then you can really go on you wrote success you this map the Dell and lifestyles provide a it's made a huge difference in our lives when we were really bad situation so\nDug it as you say you were in a bad situation get clarify the little bit more how did you you know what happened and how did you pull yourself out of it because obviously our information is is effective for what we do but you know being in a bad situation is a personal thing\nHow how and what do you climb out for that show that with the the recipe but\nA long story short you know practice for twenty five years maybe and then as severe auto accident was almost killed my right side was paralyzed couldn't walk so I didn't know if I was going to be able to practice ever again I was in a coma for almost two weeks\nI'm I'm great watching\nMe through all that all of that time we have and then finally some surgeries made it possible for me to be able to use my right arm it that's the on the practice with but it made me realize\nI Can't practice forever even if I didn't have an injury you know there's going to become a time when\nI Can't I don't want to so then what do you do well real estate gives you that passes stream of income that still brings in dollars throughout your life or that will would not happen if you're a professional lawyer doctor of some sort and you're the key ...\nDoug I'm gonna cut you off how many doctors lawyers attorney CPAs professionals do you think have only their own earned income and don't have any backup income on the side have never thought about creating a second stream of income in case there's a downside ever\nWhat percentage of your of people that are like you do you think that is\nI may maybe ten percent I think you get eighty to Ninety percent think they can just keep practicing their whole career and retire by saving functioned money which usually doesn't have to say and\nI invite my colleague it come out to the case studies so that they can be a different view the world are we were fortunate because we had the two single families when I was injured so we knew that was bringing in money we just didn't know how you could smell\nIt or not the point I'm trying to make your point I'm trying to make it before we have to move on is that most highly compensated individuals do not have a backup plan would you agree with that\nI yeah I Would absolutely\nWell I'm Glad that you did and I'm Glad that you work through yours and Jennifer thanks for supporting I mean that's the\nThe recommendation Doug
