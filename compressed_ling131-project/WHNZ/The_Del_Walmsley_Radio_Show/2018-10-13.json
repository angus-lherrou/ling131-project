here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire American one version at a month\n[noise] so today we've been discussing\nWhy most people don't become successful and that is because they really believe in the back of their heart\nThat back in their mind and there are that workers the secret to becoming wealthy that if you have the right job you get the right education you have the right job you're going to get rich\nWhen none of that is true and it some people take some till they're thirty to figure that out and it had their midlife crisis some it's forty some it's fifty\nSo much one job two jobs three jobs before they finally figure it out but when you tell them there's a way to go out there and make millions they can't believe that you could actually mean that because in their mind they live with the type of mentality that's called a lack mentality\nThey believe in the zero sum game of this world where the Democrats believe\nDemocrats believe that for a sector of our society to have more money they have to steal it from another sector now think about that what is taxation there's nothing fair about taxation a man or woman goes out and producers\nAnd should they lose what they produce will just a ticket poor guy should I come take a pork rupture crop uh sharecroppers farm away from it more shake his income away from it you wouldn't think of taking and come away from a poor parts of why would you think you're taking and come away from a rich person or a middle class person for that matter\nWhat is it at our society that makes fifty one percent of the people out there believed that you have to steal from another man to put money in your pocket\nAnd that whole society politically believes that that old society morale more moral Lee believes that right and then they wonder why they're broke now the other end of the world the other opposite end is the people that have the abundance mentality\nAnd the abundance mentality says I Believe there's enough for all of us and I'm just going to go ahead and produce a lot\nAnd then the more I produce the more the risk for every body yeah and even when you tax me I'm Still going to try to produce even though I don't think it's fair I still believe in abundance I Believe in production\nAnd that's what's gonna happen now the Trump has been elected and you're going to see it is the world's going to believe in abundance again and the country's going to prosper right and you're going to the middle class and rich people get rich again\nAnd you see the people that have the lack mentality remain poor\nAnd they're never going to be anything but poor because of the way they see the world how you see the world is the problem is I typed on Stein said\nIt's not what is the problem is how you see the problem that is the real problem and if these whack mentality people would ever get out of their lack mentality and get out and get some abundance mentality they could change their own lives but they won't let me read the rest\nOf the email it says I'm sure if you are not teaching real estate and kept this info to your inner circle of friends and family there would be amazing deals for you just sitting and waiting for you to snatch them up such no one would be aware of what\nThey're passing up you say the real estate pies big enough for everyone but it's not the whole world is confident and educated enough to spot great deals\nNo it's not if everybody can spot the great deals what he's saying no you're absolutely wrong first of all the deals that we do it lifestyles many of them could not have been done most of them could not have been done if they weren't done his partnerships\nSo if it wasn't for a group of people being educated like mindedly to are they all understand the investment in a business they're not working in the business is not a job they're investing in a business is an ongoing concern that\nAs a product it's pretty hard to outdated self because think about it for just a second whether they're getting that way for us to vaporize ourself to go to bed at night and sleep we have to have a place to lay out head down at night to eat our dinners et cetera et cetera so until they have vaporize Asian\nWe have housing that were the vapors Asian guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian\nRight but until then housing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer okay so\nHere it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't do all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals now the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this\nThere is not going to be enough deals no here's a reality I've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years and we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done about before", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley
