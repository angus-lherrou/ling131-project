of well known companies like ...\nAh in their largely backed by Saudi money or there's a lot of Saudi money there are a lot of American tech companies that have a Saturday ownership and so over this past week you do have a lot of American business owners right a little concerned about the news in regards to what's going on with Saudi Arabia\nRight hold up the next segment you're listening to the opening bell is brought to Bagram capital advisors need I'll go to our website it's Graham capital advisors dot com going to find out who some of the newsmakers are as the openings dot com\n[noise] here in tune to the opening bell on June twenty am in Sarasota and am flown since the ... in the morning and ruin 'em dead Web these David Graham and we're joined by science Graham stash a welcome back who were some of the big newsmakers as best we can all three\nWere certainly we have a few ah corporate earnings that that overall I think\nSurprised some people are in one of the bigger ones in the toy makers space has borough of his down five point seven percent after reporting weaker than expected third quarter earnings\nThe toys space and we talked about toys are us probably about a year or so ago on the show\nContinues to show weakness or a lot of people thought has borough when when toys Ross went bankrupt and allow them to focus on their contracts with with Wal Mart or in some of the other toys or big box retailers a with their online presence housebroken able to stem the tide\nBut Mattel and has for both found it\nMore difficult uh to to find a bottom a and their stock ... if you look at their stock price it certainly shows companies that continue to struggle\nNow with that a consumer discretionary overall has been a very very weak space\nAmazon we talked about a ... or the fame stocks earlier we talked about Netflix and the previous segment but Amazon Amazon was down a weapon point nine percent and is down almost ten percent for the month of October and this is after reporting or at least providing\nFairly good guidance uh and so this is really worrisome as we approach the holiday season that the retail space the consumer discretionary retail space continues to show weakness and this again does in fact\nWe briefly mentioned it uh uh in the previous segment but shears and their bankruptcy really dominate headlines on Tuesday and Wednesday when it became a parent or actually when the filing for chapter eleven bankruptcy did happen was Sears it's just a very difficult time in the retail space\nAnd I think that is one of the primary newsmakers again as we approach\nTypically uh what is some of the best couple of months or a few months for the retail space\n[noise] well I guess you know when you look at Tommy's changing uh buying habits are changing of the old traditional mall\nSpace you go to malls today and a third of the fourth of them all be empty in some cases even in the better neighborhoods because people are buying more and more on line when you have Walmart now selling online much less Amazon\nA Facebook you name it everyone is selling on line now and and\nAs people start doing that they're not going to need to be going into stores so there's going to be a radical radical\nChange and I think this is just the beginning when you you know you look at stores like Steve Sears it's those you know it's a generational change and and you got to change with it you know if you try to keep bucking it ... you know these stories to keep doing the same thing they're going to get the same result and and uh you know you can't do anything about it what\nIt is very true and I and I think it's one of the concerns the administration has a ... because he do see consumers not spending as much as one would expect when you have an economy that in the second quarter grew over four percent\nNow we're not going to get four percent growth for the third quarter and we'll get that in a matter of a few days I think a lot of people are expecting the mid threes maybe mid below three's a boy we're not going to get four plus a GDP Growth\nBut the president was at a rally this past Saturday in Nevada and he was pushing or or trumpeting uh a middle class tax cut in I'm looking at the quote right now in in verbatim quote unquote we're looking at a major tax cuts for middle income people\nNot for businesses at all\nThe administration the president recognizes\nThat the tax cuts that were placed last December a again we're for largely businesses as President Trump really recognized in his statement a that this next tax cut is not going to be for business at all and that's what he said verbatim a buddy he's looking for a tax cut for middle income people\nAnd right now the middle income person is very very stretched\nDelinquency rate came out earlier last week a an error four to five year highs are and when I mean by that is delinquency rates\nAre of credit card debt or just that in general household debt in general that linked with she rates for middle income and Americans are now increasing a and it's a four to five year highs\nAre in that is a concern because if you have someone who's more likely or the chances are that they're going to be the link went on that\nThat means they're distressed are going to become a distress bar or a and that's how economies ultimately get to certain top and they're just not able to grow anymore because that consumer can simply not by any more they're having a difficult enough time making payments on good they've already\nBy with that right well I'm looking at Bloomberg here it seems that Paul Ryan and the good part of the Republican tax policy makers they knew nothing about this tax cut and it shows you how President Trump and the consummate politician he knows that\nIt's needed because people have not gotten anything from the first ... the average person hasn't gotten anything from it to speak of\nAnd of course it's in the election going on and shouldn't be kind of interesting because like we were talking about how much the segment that you know you could see him standing himself across the aisle to get something done before the end of the year on this thing so\nBut that is such as always we appreciate your sage advice and we'll be talking tomorrow but it's not just us\nAbsolutely take our guys are ... let me ask you this if you invested your entire savings and the Dow Jones average on February sucking them this year how much do you think you would have made so far ... percent zero did absolutely zero nothing [laughter] and if the is the second\n... definitely nothing okay that was eight months in three weeks ago nothing so what am I missing what is your financial advisor telling you to do\nYou know don't worry look this is all you guys\nDon't lose it let us help you go to our website Graham capital advisors dot com\nOn behalf of the Graham family I'm dead Web telling you will see again the ... same time same stations limit of

includes criminals and unknown\nOr so for that data\nNow we've got this situation set up to where people can try this software out for free is and not true\nThat is correct yeah the seven day trial let's just collect though\nSo why don't you tell them how to locate that and then just kind of go over what they're going to secret you're getting access to a lot more stuff than we started with in the beginning this is really different piece of software\nYeah that'd be happy to so I'm a uh gosh now I live on like a [laughter] ...\n[laughter] right lifestyle at ... dot com\nYeah that's where you can go get Seventy or try just kind of lifestyle ... dot com and there's a button right on that amount of mine up and you can use that as much as you want to many value what she says she wants to um you know I'm sure on that for once you're on that trial\nMany software's I Believe charge you per um evaluation you run today not\nYeah in fact I'm the they they do and it's a real problem because I estimate that it takes about a hundred evaluations for each property that you actually purchased a because you have to find out you have to do the initial\nAnswer to the question of trying to make an offer on the property it doesn't look like a good deal and you have to go through ... through quite a few property and you don't get every day of it\nBut by the time you actually purchased some he's done maybe fifty two hundred evaluation and if you're paid by the evaluation get very much so um and in fact\nThe one of the state of horses that we use is called written range because I got our like every rental data provider in the country that had nationwide data and by far and away they were the they had the best day that it was amazing how accurate the rental date of what\nThe problem was that when you go to their website and wanna purchasing the valuation of dollars for one just to evaluate one property\nUm but we were able to work out a deal with them so that when people subscribe to lifestyle discovery they actually have a limited access to many ran range evaluation as they need to have\nSo we've been able to eliminate that issue [noise]\nWell if we had no but I don't think this thing would work because it's just too expensive to go out there that price now the other thing that I've seen other software programs uh require you to sign up for long periods of time six months to a year or whatever or we're not doing that are we\nCorrect we're just we're just doing a month to month of having to use it when you ... you can stop your subscription ended up with it and and now that the work really well for people so that they're not walk into some kind of I'm kind of contract\nOil it's absolutely um\nOh what's the word for word it's very beneficial for them and not very beneficial for us\nBecause mostly to sign up for his his low prices what we charge you got to sign up for a period of time to make it worthwhile words you're probably I Would probably see divided up your ... your time\nAs in looking for property you might spend a week or a month or two months at the most to go out and buy the property you want and then you got to back off for a while and then you come back and say OK I'm ready to buy another one then you go back on again\nThe building for them to sign on and then stop and then sign on again\nIs a massive benefit that no one of the program that I Know of or of ever heard of a is allowing people and I'm Wondering just out loud between two of us that may be a problem some day I mean because of that that's something we're you know they'll sign up and it'll quit and they'll send them to quit and\nYeah we we have to really look at that but I Do find that a lot of people just keep their subscription because they they keep all will be like you know maybe they're in a war or not do something and then all of a sudden they just get that that drive that fire under their feet\nAnd so they you know when I look at the usage pattern in spite of discovery a it's a lot of people just get tips not if they may want to hop on and evaluate their own property for tax you know protesting their their tax or [noise]\nYou know their their taxes on the house and they want to I Can't remember the work for but the ...\nRobert ... protest station will call it probably dragging protests days yeah\nYeah so they may even be using it for other things than just finding an investment property a but it's not of all the time and people jump on the jump off of it it kind of a ...\nI remember when we first came out with ... it was kinda funny that um my girlfriend at the time\nShe picked picked up the quest program started looking up all the bosses and her friends to see what they paid for their home\n[laughter] I was I don't think it was designed for that kind of beside get worse [laughter] it is interesting to see what people pay for certain older you can go into any neighborhood and find out what the hell's whistle for that's a powerful powerful piece of information [noise] yeah it ...\nOr ... it it is kind of fun to do that I mean I I Know where you live and I write in your house on the plane 'cause I was curious actually knew what ... told me um but it it is kind of fun to do that actually don't\nGo well we're going to have to go to a break your per second I Want to get you back one more second because I Want you to tell people

some more conventional wisdom sets you free the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time\nWill go back to do on the radio show um today I'd like to discuss with you I'm this concept of savings for retirement or saving for retirement and how much the average family has said\nNow I read this article is really good article had a lot of data I'm not going to try to go through all the data but I can tell you some basic concepts the younger people are\nThe less they say that's a simple one you know the older you get the more people have saved 'cause they had a longer period of time to save\n'em but there seems to be a differentiation here in data and I'm going to have to see if I can go through this with ... says\nRetirement accounts savings are inadequate and unequal retirement savings of families age thirty to sixty one\nRight uh for makes thirty two to sixty one are different than what the other ages are so that that piece of material right there to really nothing for ... years the the real interesting part they're talking about\nThe means savings of all families so if you take the me what is the main\nThe main says if you add up everything and to abide by the number of people in the uh survey if you add up everybody's retirement and divide by the number of people to survey the demeaned is Ninety five thousand seven hundred and Seventy six\nDollars now they go on and this long article to explain that that's almost in ill relevant number because the people on the bottom have almost nothing and the people on the top have massive\nAmounts of money saved up so they talk next about the median savings with families that have retirement savings so you look at the median is if you were to take a number of you late all the numbers outlet in a row\nAnd you found the very center of all the numbers from the lowest to the highest out saved and you found the center the center is sixty thousand dollars so the average person from the fifty\nPercent del bracket down has less than sixty thousand dollars but actually if you only take people that have retirement savings if you do the same thing with people that do not have retirement savings and you take the media and again\nThe media and drops to five thousand dollars so think about if you took every American out there that was every retirement age\nAnd you live in them up on a roll out along street maybe I ten freeway from one side of the country the other and you went to the halfway point\nTo the halfway point half of all Americans and below have only five thousand bucks saved up that's pretty scary when you think about if you take out the people that have zero savings and you do the same light up\nHalfway down the line half of all people that have you been tried to save only up sixty thousand dollars now that is on believable\nJust unbelievable that anybody out there fifty percent of the whole country has five thousand or less the people actually believe in savings who have saved ... percent of the country has sixty thousand how could you retire on sixty thousand dollars\nI have no idea how to even think that that's going to work it blows my mind now [noise] when you're at age too that\nIt really skews the numbers because elderly people have way more savings and younger kids et cetera et cetera et cetera so as you go to your age groups which are here by age group\nAnd what you'll see is that there are different age groups that believe differently in saving so if you get to the age group the working age group of thirty two to sixty one\nDid you find that the the mean that we talked about\nOf Ninety five thousand dollars but if you look at the people from fifty six to sixty one in other words not the whole group of working class people right now but only people from fifty sixty sixty one the last five years quote unquote their average or they're mean as a hundred and twenty four thousand dollars\nI'm Sorry a hundred and sixty three thousand to do with my dad or if you go from fifty to fifty five hundred and twenty four thousand um and it goes down precipitously from that point on as you get younger and younger and younger [noise] um [noise] but these are people\nThat are saving these are not everybody these are just people that are saving so even the wealthiest right the wealthiest age group which is the senior citizens about ready to retire\nTheir\nAverage is only a hundred and sixty three thousand bucks folks I don't know how your retirement or\nSixty three thousand dollars you're going to take the money out of your four one K. and rightly or going to have to pay taxes on it\nRight you're going to have to pay taxes on that money is still in your four one K. it's still in your eye ray you're going to pay thirty percent taxes
