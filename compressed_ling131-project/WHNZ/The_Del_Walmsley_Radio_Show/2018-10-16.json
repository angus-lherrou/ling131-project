V. spewing the lives and then his representations so that the electorate ends up with a median\nSavings account of five thousand dollars and an average savings account of Ninety five thousand dollars this is just ridiculous let's start out this article says there's seven reasons why stocks\nAre better than real estate let's just take them one at a time by the way the idiot the wrote this articles name is Shawn L'Engle yes and this is from market watch the articles out of marketwatch Sean if you're out\nThere listening please please come on the radio with me let me take your at off and show you how embarrassed you be to talk about stuff you know nothing about I Will bring facts figures people's deals financial whatever you need if you think you could stand up to even one tenth of the proof of what you're saying I don't think you could stand up to any myself\nSo let's talk about liquidity\nHe using the number one reason the stocks are better than real estate because stocks are liquid if you want to get out you can get out All right let's explain to you\nThis misrepresentation the reason you can get out of stocks is two reasons one there's a liquid market for it there that's granted but to you have to get out at the price they're willing to let you out at\nIn other words if the stock market you bought a stock or a hundred dollars a share and it went down to Seventy five dollars a share yes you could get out immediately at Seventy five dollars a share\nBut that's not what you're saying what you're saying a real estate as I bought this piece of real estate for a hundred thousand dollars now it's worth four hundred thousand and it took me thirty days he said forty five days to sell it\nOf course it took forty five days so we're looking for a greater fool they don't pay four hundred thousand for something you paid a hundred thousand for you're going to wait until that person comes around but\nWhat if the offer that piece of real estate that appraised for four hundred thousand for three hundred thousand\nThat piece of real estate sell overnight instantly I cashed it out in a second I Do it all the time in seminar I say if you could buy this apartment this way cash flowing there's much who would buy it to de\nNinety percent of the people in the room raised their hands they would buy it today that's how quickly I can sell a piece of real estate when you're not trying to rip off the person you're trying to sell it to\nIf you had a fixed market where whatever the appraisal was the property itself or you could sell real estate just as quickly as you could sell stocks but that's not what's happening people are trying to make massive capital gains are real estate\nOn the stock market you're happy to take whatever it is they're willing to give you the day you want to sell it is that liquidity\nIs that really liquidity\nWow let's say that you lose half of everything you're worth\nBut man you did it was such a liquidity [noise] that's so important isn't it I think if you think about what I'm saying you realize that they're not comparing apples to apples oranges Georgia's they're comparing somebody is letting their stocks go for a non premium price\nAnd that's why they sell so quickly real estate if it were sold for a non premium price would sell instantly also I proved it many many times\nIt happens that some apartments don't even make your mark don't even make the market for even a day or two in fact in houses the same thing if you had ten red houses we sell ... houses for even less than a week\nThat's how liquid real estate is compared to stocks it as liquid if not more liquid because number one when you buy stocks yo nothing but a piece of paper and hope and a prayer they're going to go up but when you buy real estate\nYou were getting cash flow the second you buy it so just like you want to bond or a CD for one percent or two percent right now exciting see these two percent you buy a piece of real estate deterrence ten right out of the blacks is way\nMore exciting especially when you realize that we do a short break we'll be right back that don't want the radio\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the radio you know we'll
