newsmakers [noise]\nWell the first big news maker and it's something else world watching today in addition to the ... some ... in between us and Canada trade officials about getting a master replacement in inform big\nTech big tech is going to Congress Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey are going to testify before the Senate intelligence committee about how the big technology companies are preparing for the midterm elections or Google executives were invited to appear but declined the offer that this hearing is a follow up to the one that convened in November\nOn the Russian election interference be very interesting to see Capitol Hill for the next month month and a half is going to be very busy or before the midterm elections are and with that being said this will certainly be a very interesting day because you've had several officials\nFrom the government whether the president himself or leaders from the from the majority of them in a minority\nParties come out with some pretty strong statements specifically in this issue of\nHow technology companies are monitoring the disinformation a issues that are starting to play a what a lot of people believe are are are a balanced politics\nSure ... here's something that you know the media is picking up quite a bit you know Nike took a hit yesterday on social media especially much less I guess the\nAnd I don't know what the stock prices doing today over this Kaepernick deal and you know the backlash started dust almost immediately\nAnd one what would you think they're thinking was\nWhen they decided to come up with that advertising or believe in something you'd been it means sacrificing everything and all that business what's your take on that\nUh well you know it it my my thought is largely muted uh in regards to business in particular stock prices Nike's up today but it's it's not\nMuch there are like point seven percent\nA that pales in comparison to selling pressure that they saw yesterday uh they were down more than three percent for most of the trading day\nUh it talks about how businesses and then if they do get a political in nature whether they believe maybe they weren't\nUh they they are and so when you make decisions like that there is the possibility you're going to suffer the consequences Nike is not the only company or that gets involved in these types of of situations\nRemember there was a very big merger that\nJust while it was ruled in favor of a team team Time Warner and their merger gets set apartment a justice but a lot of people believe that mergers very politicized ... did not like CNN and he did not want to see the merger goes through\nThe judge ruled in favor of Eighteen team Time Warner said there's no case law that's preventing or or preventing this merger from happening and really slapped down that department of justice a in a very very one sided ruling and its fearful among a lot of people that\nThe damage that happened in the ruling against the department of justice even though they're appealing to right now uh the damage is done against the department of justice will ah restrict its ability to go after other mergers that maybe would be seen as\nMore of a a more of a risk to overall anti trust business matters\nSure no I saw or several analysts said that that might Nike did that sent a strong signal to their current roster of athletes and and positions Nike that's kind of a savvy risk taker is there's not a move that any company can make\nA night for for a Nike it was definitely a a smart business move 'em you know you know namely who buys your shoes this to me you know I guess just about every minority kid in the country where Nike shoes ... and and uh it was obviously a risk but it was also by doing that and we were making a pronounced\nPolitical a political statement to themselves so that'd be said as anyone else out there\nRight well in addition to the situation of forty with Nike and in addition to what\nWe're seeing right now uh with the uh the big tech companies coming to the hill\nSaudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants oil stay between Seventy and eighty dollars a barrel for now according to a OPEC of release that came out over the weekend\nAs the world's largest or as the world's biggest crude exporter or they're looking to find a balance between maxim fighting revenue and keeping a lid on prices until the congressional elections and this is very interesting obviously it's one thing to say in a release it they like to keep all between Seventy and eighty dollars a barrel\nThat's another thing for sources to say well they're going to wait until the congressional\nLecture and see how this is going to take place very interesting situation obviously big ramifications here in the United states is we've seen a lot of uptick\nIn energy related ... a a a spending\nVery good stuff as always we appreciate you said you'd vice and we'll be talking to tomorrow thanks now drinkers or ... thanks guys or let me ask you are you going to an advisor at our local banker brokerage house for retirement advise if you are just remember they work for the bank

having some company telling them what to recommend to you so if you need honest retirement advise\nWhy don't you send an appointment with the number one retirement planning company on the west coast of Florida to Graham capital advisors we're attorneys that specialize in as the preservation elder care lawyer\nFinancial advisors that focus exclusively on retirement investing certified to stay

appointment it's grim capital advisors dot com and that's going to wrap it up\nFor us and the opening bell joined us again tomorrow in am Thirteen twenty in Sarasota and am\nThe proceeding was a commercial program paid for by Graham capital the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated\nMark living here I'm Still on and Tampa Bay now for three hours joined me tonight from seven to ten at my new home twelve fifty WHM Z I call registry\nWelfare when step one way or the Tampa fail\nYou can listen on our ... our radio asked\nSo I think that that's the big thing that a lot of people hit this moment and I think the most common one is when we get members to come in and there\nHas done all of those things they followed the checklist they\nDid all the things they were supposed to do in other words they adulthood well according to society you know they went to college they had a job they work nine to five and they saved and they saved and they saved and luckily a lotta times I don't have to hear stories about of traumatic thing that happened they lost their job or\nThey're scared of losing their job or a ... a divorce or something to that effect usually it's just a stark realization that they're starting to look at what they have set aside and the life that they want to live and that you are not going to be cohesive together\nIt becomes a situation where you know we work hard and we put all of our money into savings and\nYou realize that you're not going to be able to retire and you feel loved you feel cheated you feel like\nYou have gone through life and you did everything you were supposed to do and you're not going to have rewarding retirement that you thought you were going to so I think that's probably the most common reason why people decide that something needs to change is more so in their spending habits um\nThat they want to continue to live their lifestyle as if they're still getting a nine to five paycheck every single month\nAnd like I said the retirement accounts and whatnot just aren't going to be able to cut it anymore\nSo I think that that's the big reason why a lot of people feel that a change needs to occur and they're willing to step out of their comfort zone and they're willing to say hey you know what\nI wasn't raised but I Need to acquire a whole bunch of rental properties in order to pad my portfolio is but I can have a decent retirement I think that\nThey realize that that is what they want to do and honestly that's what they deserved to do they earned about money the right way and they pay for it so now they want that money that they worked so hard for it to work for them I'm\nI'm a rare occasion I Do get numbers that come in and they have lost their job and they're in a situation where they're saying you know what I never want to feel so helpless again I never want to be at the mercy of a business owner of being able to tell me\nThere's no way that you can come into work day we're downsizing and suddenly you feel once again Rob do you feel like you've been cheated that you've been taken advantage of and in reality you know you\nPut in a lot of time and effort into the company that you worked for in your ...\nYour expendable so once again they come into my office and they want to have a conversation about how they can never be expendable how they can be their own boss how they can be the masters of their own destiny\nAnd that is empowering and honestly I think that the one thing that holds true and people that have not never invested in real estate and the thing that holds true in\nSeasoned investors is\nYou know we liked the idea of having dot control and we definitely want to not be\nNothing is going to determine what our outcome is going to be except for our own choices so that's the one thing that you have to change you have to be comfortable with change so that you can create a a lifestyle that it change happens you're prepared for it\nAnd that that can be the first step that we help people with and that's really what I Want to talk about today it's it's harnessing that fear of change in order to drive success instead of allowing yourself to sink back into old habits to sink into depression with that\nThat feeling in your gut that you know what you're doing isn't going to work if you have a question especially one for Jillian since we have the the pleasure of having her on the show with us today\nGive us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty to a lab and that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven were happy to talk about anything having to do with why for real estate that you want to talk about\nThat decision to do something different\nIs challenging our our brains don't don't like new in New information ended the older we are you know that that old adage as you know old dogs can't learn new tricks we know that's not true most of us have had an old dog that we've been able to teach something new to a very literal sense\nAnd um many of us have learned new things later in life and and I'm a good I've got a good\nTen Fifteen maybe Twenty years on you I think I could be your mom Jillian [laughter] um but you know I I learn new things every day\nAnd when people come to us and they've made the change in their routine\nTo include us in it\nThey have sought out education and mentoring for real estate they have come and participated in the program they put themselves with a new group of people there are already beginning to make very significant changes\nAnd they're doing this with our minds that resist that change so in a moment when we come back I Want to talk about that change and how we support that change and harnessed that change to drive success and not let ourselves get derailed\nBecause changes something people are afraid of\n... I've heard people say that people are just as afraid of change as they are speaking in public and so we want to make sure that we give people the tools they need to dry success from that fear you're listening to the Dell wants the radio show this is Lynn ... infidel today if you have a question called\nEight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty to Lebanon and moment Jillian and I will be right back\nTo the to do with what we're supposed to just\nLimited real\nEstate investor education in red torn group that has been taking people by by hand and teaching them how to invest in real estate for ... hours to clean up after them in their\nLocal and national invest more will ... will tell you why make real the magazine may end up back and we will be\nGoing to drop dot com actor somewhere where you are scheduled\nMy limited gives you on that and their retirement money is your land and we return\nFree online wow how to get enough property among reevaluate you need to identify the very beginning the dot com bust signed up today\nGetting the math deal dot com\n\nBust in real estate you money five wave cash money in your pocket\nMoney equity captured thousands of dollars when you have them read the Bible white property using the right man appreciation realize the increase in Bellevue overtime equity bill the restaurants down more than a month and finally the tax advantage when done correctly realistic but no taxes\nOn our cash flow and capital gains at lifestyle unlimited these are the five we we make money in ... which is why real estate accounts for more millionaires in the world today than any other investment vehicle you should have some real estate in your portfolio to learn how to attend a lifestyle when limited\nWorkshop Colby six Ninety seven one Seventy more lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com and register for the ... best six six Ninety\nOne eighty nine Seventy or go to lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\n\nHow they work and that's part of what drives the fear and if we can harness that we can drive success instead\nThis is Len borough And Julian Garland on the ... radio show if you have a question get on the line eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven and if you want to find out more about our activities across the country we\nWere supposed to\nDo in your voice and what will happen in something you never want to be about walking and so you dropped your job will retiring involved\nTwenty five years ago I Do want we bonded lifestyle modeled dissolves jump when you apply for financial freedom national radio shows emotional ...

[noise]\n\n\n\nDo you wish that the moon mission\nAnd\nWelcome back to the Dell wants the radio show this is Lynn ... infidel today with Jillian Garland a successful real estate investor and single family mentor with lifestyles unlimited and we are talking about how to harness your fear to drive success and make the changes in life that will help you\nCreate the wealth and passive income you need to live the lifestyle you want to live in retirement and we we see those advertisements all the time right you're you're watching TV late at night and you see the couple walking down this beautiful pristine beach and they're talking about some\nYou know investment that you can make that will give you that life in retirement and that\nParadigm that core belief that if we save our money if we put our money and a four one K. and we'd dollar cost averaging to the market no matter what's going on in the world\nThat will be walking on that pristine beach holding hands with our loved one and we'll both be healthy and fit and trim\nAnd that isn't the end result for most Americans we see it in the statistics most Americans actually cannot retire they cannot stop working and this is a paradigm that we have to face we have to\nUnderstand that it's not working and so then that forces change on us and this is that realization that bubbles up from the subconscious\nAnd creates that underlying fear that stress\nAnd what you're doing things that you know we're not going to take you to the place that you want to get to it does cost stress you know you're driving down that road maybe you're driving home in a storm and your your typical route is flooded out and suddenly you're on auto pilot and then you're faced with\nA road close fine and you have to now engage\nAnd you have to make a decision do I turn around do I make a right to make a left how do I actually get home from here using a different route and this has happened to me in the past year I've lived in the same place for four years now almost four years\nAnd I actually had no idea how to get home via another route [laughter] and those types of road blocks of life cause stress\nAnd how we respond to it is going to determine the rest of our lives it some people respond to that by going around the roadblock and going through the water\nAnd ended up on top of their car being rescued hopefully you know by rescue teams in the storm other people back up\nGo back the way they came you know fortunately now we have GPS and we find our way home eight so that choice determines or outcome whether we are going to go home to get warmed by the fire or whether we're going to be sitting on top of our car hoping somebody can come get us out of this torrent [laughter]\nThat we're now caught in and it's really similar to the the situation we get into and it's not our fault\nRight these are core beliefs that developed through our childhood their reinforced you know you were talking about your mom right I mean so you grew up with her investing in a four O. one K. her you're working for a company her talking about you know value of long term employment and it just isn't a reality for your generation\nAt all at all\nAnd the thing that I find a maze and uses these things are so powerful taxes the fact that it's taken out before you get your paycheck\nPeople don't even realize how much taxes they're paying I talked to people Jillian who are very high earners they're very well educated I asked them how much Texas did you pay this year and they tell me oh it's been great I didn't have to pay any and I know they're not real estate investors\nAnd if they could you just do me a favor I'm just curious go back to your taxes here's where you'll find the line of how much you paid over the year out of your payroll checks before you actually got a hold of the money\nHow much is that\nAnd they are really surprised\nTo see how much money they actually pay in taxes for one case of the same you're talking about your mom be excited that her four one K. balance went up well she's been dollar cost averaging into it for how many years\nSo it's going to go up even if the market is is flat and if she takes a hit and that's what's happened you know with your mom she's taken four or five significant hits his or her career\nTo that four one K. and and you ... you know if she had invested in a different investment vehicle something that had a longer you know track so she could see what was coming she would have a lot more money and be a lot more prepared for retirement [noise]\nIf you have a question for us give us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven children can you talk a little bit now about\nSome of the steps that people take\nTo overcome their fear to get out of these paradigms and to learn something new you know I I Love something that you say all the time you say you know especially because a lot of people we need are highly educated and they're very very successful in their careers and you'll make the comment of get over yourself and get educated can you talk a little bit about that\nYeah [noise] so send me going into lifestyles and learning the entire um those are real estate investing\nKind of became a no brainer after the fact I Know that sounds silly but I Am and super really skeptical at heart and I'm a glass as half empty kinda got I can take it on any level", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "12"}
