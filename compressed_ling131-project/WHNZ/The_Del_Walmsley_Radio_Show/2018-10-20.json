H. N. Z. A. M. S. staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThere were always patterns you know there was maybe five or ten different things people want to do and they pick one or two those patterns do you find that\n... yeah I Would say so and I've seen several different things so my first person I met with actually had five single family houses that he had purchased on his own before finding lifestyles and he heard a better way on the right from the radio show on how he could be doing what he's doing and decided to come and join up and and uh get a little deeper and things\nHad a pathway he thought when he came to me actually came to me for multi family counseling but as I looked at what he was doing and what is Gulf War I realized that he knew what he was doing a single family and we certainly have plenty of members who have gone from one to I don't know what our topic is I think I heard somebody has fifty or maybe even a hundred\nOr single families out there and they've got an unbelievable system for how to run those things\nAnd I realized that this guy for what he wanted to achieve he was already halfway there and I said I could I don't know single family but I can tell that you could be where you want to be in a year just by doubling down on what you've already done with what he told me that the money had to invest was I said I think it'll take you longer to get there\nGoing the multi family route but I'll be happy to take you there that's really what you want to do and are made him rethink what he wanted to do and and so that was one thing that happened the common thing I think is passive investors\nWho are trying to figure out how to juggle getting involved with lifestyle while working in the job that they enjoy it and as you know paying for the themselves and their lifestyle as it is and these are always conservative people they're like minded as we are they're just looking for a better way to do a kind of what they're already doing and\nI really find myself emphasizing to them that I call this a contact sport and that is you've got to get involved you've got to get to our parents and meet other people doing it because they will accelerate your ability to get involved in deals to do your own deal whatever it is that they're trying to do\nAnd the three people that I can reference that are already up and running as passes and are going to be closing on their first deal within maybe by the end of this month I think\nUm those are people that took that advice and they started showing up at the road trips the case studies I started shaking hands meeting people that were doing deals and uh got caught up in a very quickly\nNow one of the themes I ran into and I don't know if we run into this as much anymore and you've only been here six days so maybe you haven't been through a large enough cycle yet to see this happening one of the things I used to run into all the times got somebody come to me and say you know I Want to do single family\nBut then they went on a road trip and we next week they come back you know just change my mind that procedure what is on the road trip I Want to be ... family\nAnd you know the a week later this hour we'll start out as the past have been in a week after that to come back because now you know one after seeing this I think I could do this to I Want to be and I wrote a you know and then they'll come back and say you know what I'm looking for these smaller deals that they just couldn't go ahead and go up to ... you know\nI'm a lead investor you have written in ...\nAh yeah the one that I'm working on they actually came in to be passes but there are retired and they have seen enough now where they're going you know what we could do and we have the money to do a forty in a deal on our out maybe we should start doing that\nBecause they're uh they're kind of being picky which uh I don't blame him for probably not a bad idea on who they invested with and and that cycle takes time to understand what makes a good partner for your specific situation\nAnd finding somebody that has the same goals are is on the same track that you are and uh yeah so they're swinging back around now and we started talking about them just doing their own deal and part of that actually was me telling them look I've already got two people that are buying twenty minutes and this is just happened in the last you know forty five days\nSo ah they realize that that could happen a little faster and uh and I think you know sometimes you just got to push people off cliff little once they get to the edge [laughter]\nAnd uh so I I think those that couple will go that way but all the other cycle she I don't think I've been around quite long enough to see the transition that you have a twenty seven years or however long you been doing this\nWhile the next one is um a more difficult question I'm you've done some due diligence so far [noise]\nYeah we actually did a deal a Monday ten days ago now um for a guy he's actually out of central Texas a but the deal is in a camp out which actually false and our Houston a territory so it came to me\nUh we went on site didn't know I'd never stopped capital I've driven through it on my way to fishing trips down on the coast but I've never stopped there so I got to go down there for a day they had done a nice job of pre shopping the market we walked all the units are had some contractors they're looking at everything to decide how much work\nNeeded to be done on it before going in so they knew how to properly budget for any deferred maintenance and things like that gets thing often it's dark\nAnd I'm actually I just got a text from two minutes before we got on air here and he wants to talk this afternoon he's read on his business analysis and he wants me to take a look at it and kind of play devil's advocate on what he's missed and whether I think the deal still work or not\n[noise] well I think there's probably a good place to take a break we'll pick that up on the other side also when we come back\nWe discuss this guy's bill just discuss saying yes or no deal [laughter] we'll be right back with Scott been offering the dome ... radio show\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] you're listening to the radio you know we'll be back with more like the

have six months a year ago you were taking your foot off the gas\nAnd starting to pump the brakes and now all of a sudden you got it shifted into high gear hear what's going on does what has changed\nYou know the uh I I think I've heard you use this phrase it and it's very true the thing that can keep a lot of people away from a great life as having a really good one hand I think ah when you and I had that conversation I was having a a very good life I um [noise]\nYou know I was always pretty financially conservative and getting out of college it Twenty one twenty twenty three years old I Would get money magazine and read it cover to cover the day it showed up I Do all the little worksheets that they put in there on how much money you need to retire and all that sort of stuff and [noise]\nAnd my first job out of college I immediately went after Eighteen percent I was donating to the four oh one K. to really get ahead of that thing I didn't believe Social Security was going to be around it I wouldn't count on it forty five years later [noise]\nUm and I one of those worksheets set a number how much I needed to retire and a couple of years ago we refinanced my first two deals and had to sit down I only redo my personal financial statement to really look at\nAll that stuff when they make me to get a loan done and I did my a deal in a way you know what I'm over my number now or do I do [laughter] do I quit or I'm too young really to to totally quit but you know these things will keep throwing off cash flow for as long as I keep all and I thought\nNow's the time to start focusing on the lifestyle issues and stop worrying about money\nUh so I really didn't have a need for more deal I didn't need them to feed my ego I didn't need them to feed my my family\nOr anything like that and I also at that same time two years ago I had my first two I have twins and a there'll be juniors in college and a couple of weeks here uh but they got into college and I realized it didn't hurt me as bad as I expected it to um\nHaving that extra money going out so\nUh so I really I I was wondering what I Do next what would I Do for an encore and uh [noise] at some point and this really a leads into why Mitt lifestyles now back\nAround New Year's I'm not a big New Year's resolution guy um but I had said you know what I Need to re combat and\nIt just so happened about that time a a deal kind of fell into my lap that's the one I did back in April and about the same time John Ridgway came to me and said hey I'm moving up to support this national effort that lifestyle just got to have your taking my job [laughter] and\nI don't know if you know this but I turned him down twice a week when he came to me no I didn't know that event\nYeah and then eventually sick Curtis on me and and you do know that Curtis when I started in the gallery of pretty much together about the same time so we used to have lunch once a week and compare notes and help each other out and uh we haven't been doing that he's got busy doing his thing and and doing the lifestyle mentor thing as a I don't know too much for two years ago when he took the shop\nAnd uh I got to do on my deal and Curtis called me and said come on man will be like old times of need your help [laughter] so uh he's the one that really convinced me to to take the position\nAnd uh yeah it's it's just been a real commitment and um and at the same time I'm doing more of the things that I Know that I used to enjoy helping people tending road trips things like that I kind of falling off the map uh for the lifestyles are things for a while there and\nIt's got to be reinvigorated re involved and uh and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for him it's just that being more active again things kind of pop up and I just had my eyes open and you know decide which ones you wanna do\nAbsolutely now I Want to throw in other curve ball at you along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which are knows when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all this came about you've found this deal out eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to us for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not going to guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money\nAnd sophistication and the experience that we're the cumulative in this group and take some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or without being insulted elites they have less experience than we do",
