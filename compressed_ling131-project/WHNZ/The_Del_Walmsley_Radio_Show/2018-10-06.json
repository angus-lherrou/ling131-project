H. N. Z. A. M. S. staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] well\nWest hell\nOn our first harboring download it on\nYour priorities at all so you have momentary priorities in your life but let's think about this he's saying don't set unrealistic goals every goal out there is unrealistic every goals unrealistic for example I Want to retire\nWell let's talk about that for a second you want to retire so your goal is basically unrealistic\nSay well I Want to retire and by the time I'm thirty by the time I fifty sixty Seventy years old now you're saying well that's not so unrealistic right but if you say that to yourself I'm going to retire by the time I'm sixty five years old I guess what will happen\nExactly that you're giving yourself a very realistic goal that you can meet and when you meet that goal it's sixty five years of age and retire you have completely become successful being mediocre\nYou are now a mediocre human being but what's wrong with that as you've been mediocre your entire life\nBecause you never stressed your abilities you'd never kept into your real power\nBecause you set with the goals if you sit wimpy goals you get with the results\nSo I Would like to suggest you that this guy is getting it wrong and maybe we can help them out by just give him a little more information that\nThere's really two types of goals in your life there's short term and long term goals there's big goals and then there's monitor or momentary steps in between where you take that goal you break it up into bite sized pieces\nSo if I were to say I want to retire in five years or less that's probably an unrealistic goal according to this guy I'm sure to most people that's unrealistic yet we have people who are lifestyles do it\nOver and over and over and over again now once they decide that that is their goal didn't get to sit down with some short term goals right\nAnd the short term goals are going to be set up to get something done in a time period\nA short time period in other words guy the other day said his wife told me if you can do this stuff I Want you to buy the first house within thirty days and he bought the per se within thirty days she told if you're going to go out for apartments I Want the first apartment complex within forty five days or Ninety Days whatever what any he ... he got within Ninety Days\nThose short term goals where he focused on one topic of the time\nBut that did not and we're not in our not even today is long term goal is long term goal might be you know I think he said he wanted to be like Robert Martinez so he wants to own apartment complex or better there or have an incredible business have incredible employees have an incredible life\nAs a big unrealistic goal for a guy that only own nine houses and even four years ago didn't even know nine houses now he wants to own Ted apartment complex wow so here's this guy tried to convince people in a seminar in a video that was set out\nThat you should have wimpy little goals\n[noise] man let's think about this for saying\nHow do you set a goal set a goal you got to ask a question and you have to ask the right question for example I Want to lose weight I can tell you how to lose weight if you ask yourself how to lose weight it's very simple stop eating\nRight you'll lose weight but does that really what you want I can tell you another way\nWorkout twelve hours a day every day and you'll lose weight but does that really what you want so you're not asking the right question you could lose a hundred pounds or you\nCan lose twenty pounds and gained it all back the next week so losing weight is that really the questions that really the goal the goals to lose weight and then to gain it right back again that's not really the goal is but you have a defined the goal and if you don't find the goal the goal will define itself\nSo how many of you start on a diet and exercise program and say I'm going to lose some weight and you do you lose five or ten maybe Fifteen or twenty pounds\nBut you never get all the way to where you really want to be\nAnd you don't in most cases maintain what you've already accomplished she asked the wrong question\nA better question would be how could I lose\nFifteen pounds how could I lose twenty five pounds a very specific about\nAnd that would be a better question because you know whether you succeed or not when you lose Fifteen pounds you've succeeded right but that may not get you where you really want to be\nA better question is what if you lose the Fifteen pounds and gained it back\nA better question is going to be how do I lose Fifteen pounds and then maintain\nThat loss that's the key asking the right questions is going to create direct results but they've got to be giant giant goals because if you shoot for the mountaintop you're going to hit the ... if you shoot\nFor the stars you're going to take a short break pick this up on the other side will be right back in the film on the radio show\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to their monthly radio you know we'll be right

dot com lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com [noise]\nHigher [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back you know here's some more money conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version at my mom's\nBack to the radio show today was disgusted with you a different concept the concept is one of the dead equity and what it's doing to you as a human being or as a family with your investments and I do this and\nLived seminars in a way that really probably doesn't work on the radio but I go through it for you because if you listen to the park as if you drive and you're probably not going to get this but if you listen to the podcast and by the way if you are driving listen to the shows you should realize that there are a pod cast\nOf every show I Do that you can go back to and listen to again if you'd like to so if you miss the slide but\nWhat everybody do is add up their total network so that'd be the value of you know the value of your home after you take off the mortgage uh you're throwing K your irate your savings accounts here uh stocks and bonds\nYour cash savings all your assets\nIncluding Billy's college fund all of your money at it all up what are you what is your net worth most people don't even know that that's the first thing you should you know what your network is uh you can't\nHave a goal like we are talking last segment about a goal or something you don't even know what it is and your network is really the secret to wealth um ... you got to be able to build that network and secondly you not only do you want to build and protect that network you have to have a return on it\nAnd if you don't have a return on that then it's useless even having a 'cause all you're going to do is you get to spend it one way or another whether you spend it now he's been later just spending it so the network has to have a return to what on what you do is add up your network then what I Want you to do is take an add up all your passive income\nFor a year ago two thousand Seventy and passed the income is going to be you know interest income\nRoyalty income net rental income that's the net about after all the costs expenses that goes with it a net rental income\nUh it's those things that come to you from investments know by the way\nA a retirement account is not passive income that are in deep for earned income in other words you've already earned it and now you're getting paid it\nRight this deferred compensation so that is not earned income uh not passive income a third one K. money you're pulling money out of four one K. that is not passive income because of four O. one K. is earned income you put it in there you're Puerto matched it because you had a job\nSo what'd you gotta ask yourself what\nIncome producing assets do I own and how much income that I own even if I didn't go to work how much income would I earn\nIn two thousand Seventeen\nNow the next step is to take the income and divided by the network and what you have is a return on your net worth\nWhat most people but when we do this live is it Ninety Ninety Ninety five percent of the people have less than one percent return on their network\nNow how do you expect your family to get anywhere financially when you're making less than one percent on your network\nThat's a very scary thought to try to figure that out how you think you're going to get rich on that are going to live off that even if you had an idea where it's the only made half a percent or tend to ... percent I mean you're talking about they don't even have a percent return they had a cat up ... percent return\nIs what you're looking at now that's about Ninety percent of the people and then some people\nHave some investments said another night another five percent to six or seven percent said more so you're up to like Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven percent and they're making somewhere between one and five percent return on their network\nAnd that's because they employed this capital to do something\nRight now the problem is some they might even be making deals and make a hundred percent return on a real estate deal but that hundred percent then is divided out across\nEight hundred thousand dollars with a network than it doesn't really mean anything because it's a very small percentage so they have lowered this return even though they're out there doing stuff that's very successful investments\nBut they lowered the rate of return of those are the best ones by having too much equity\nSo the number one thing that kills an investor is dead equity that's money sitting there doing nothing what are the worst culprits the worst culprits are your personal residents your four one K. and your IRA now I Know you think that you've got\nFour hundred thousand your irate or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't because you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you wait until you're six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusional you you're thinking wow this things making the money but it isn't\nBecause you never got it if you don't get the money you are earning the money this is something you have to understand in Chile you earn money and get it where you can spend that you haven't dared say well it's on a piece of paper called my four one K. and I see that numbers on that piece of paper getting larger sure and they will into that", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
