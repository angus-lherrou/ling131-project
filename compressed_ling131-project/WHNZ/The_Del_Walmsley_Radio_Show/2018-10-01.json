I think the market is certainly liking or at least precious metal investors or liking the most recent developments overnight as we talked about United States and Canada able to reach agreements what what is happening is the U.S dollar is lower today\nOr the Canadian dollar is higher against US dollars so that's producing a little bit of buying pressure and precious metals Racine gold hired by point four percent silver ... by point two percent\nRemember a lot of this concern about trade wars in trade conflict\nHas increased the flight to safety US dollar is generally seen as the international uh uh the international safety net and so that's why we've seen a lot of lot of dollar binary last few months since these trade costs\nAlexis came through what makes us interesting teddy as as as these trade agreements come off you're going to see the dollar even though this is good news for the overall economy you'll see the dollar ever so slightly weekend now the\nBiggest development yet to happen if the United states and China are able to reach an agreement before the midterm elections that would be very very uh good or for the economy but weeks the dollar\nA but if it's week for the dollar then that should be good for precious metal prices so gold and silver if you don't have any exposure and you have a moderate level and you think that the dollar will continue to weaken as good news or on the trade front happens throughout the rest of the year than gold might make interesting investment\nWG I as we mentioned sitting in the mid low seventies it's above\nW Shiite west Texas intermediate is about Seventy three dollars a barrel or energy companies are surely enjoying this uh now remains to be seen if it will be able to stay here I Am of the opinion before the end of the year we will see sixties again made until mid to upper sixties will probably be where we stay\nAgain I think we're pretty close to the high watermark maybe we can get to Seventy five but I don't believe we are going to see eighty in the next three to six months I think it's more likely to go the other way\n[noise] well when you see you know Brent Crude now at at least three dollars a barrel um you know it's essentially the markets I guess in getting ready for the impact of all these energy sanctions against Iran\nUm you know the average price of gasoline now in America is two dollars and eighty seven cents and that's up a couple of points just from last month\nUm how long do you think it's going to stay up stay like this and as I guess the question is\nEven if we have this with Iran is there any other source of oil\nThe lower the price\nIs ... this Iran country you know have that much of an influence on on the the energy market\nIran does to Iran does to a certain degree I wouldn't necessarily say it's a a primary factor in the grand scheme of things uh because Iran does have agreements with other countries yes United States might be putting economic sanctions\nOr at least threatening to put on economic sanctions a but you do have European countries you've been very outspoken or against what the United States did a few months ago in terms of point out of the agreement or who said that don't make up for what the United States is leaving in the agreement and they've held\nTrue to that word since then so I think that that angle or that story is probably a little overplayed we've yet to see if there is going to be further sanctions a put on Iran but again the United states is one party or\nIn this agreement there are much there are many more other uh parties involved and they have been willing to stand any agreement with Iran for at least the time being\nSure but I notice President Trump at the United nations you you actually set it outright OPEC and OPEC nations or as usual ripping off the rest of the world and I don't like it\nWe want them to stop raising prices we want them to start lowering prices and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on you know basically\nYou know we're we're spending billions\nKeeping their societies are monarchies in business and at the same time you know they're they're trying to make you know golf courses in the middle of a desert I mean you know there's a limit to in the meantime Joe the plumber and Joe six pack\nAre paying you know fifty cents more for a gallon of gasoline in this little knobs so it'd be curious to see just what that happens but she hit a very very sensitive subject that most people agree with so it's been kind of interesting to see how that that continues because that'd be said who's similar newsmakers\nWell continuing to stay on this international front and I think this is a one big one Italy Italy right now is going to be at a uh certainly a course where they're going to butt heads with you on October Fifteen it's highly likely the ... going to reject\nItaly's budget they're set for a to point for a percent a deficit of GDP this is well above what\nThe e would want to use much more concerted you would like Italy to start paying down some of its debt this is only going to grow it instead of the new coalition that vying for leadership in Italy or is certainly on a collision course with the EU and that's something we definitely want to watch going\nInto the winter months beautiful ... appreciate your sage advice we

it stays under twenty degrees for four to eight hours a whole night\nTheir debt they all die and so every year I was replacing all these players along with all the annual ah\nThat had to be replaced every year because we planning the gardens these ... because they're they come in and stay to the heat in the suburbs and those guys who die off we had to put in other words you can handle the heat but when he got to be whether they would die off\nSo this is the annual thing so\nWhat is inside of was is that we're going to change the plan from my home and I changed the plan to go away from tropical and go to an English garden where I can fill it with plants that will survive the winter here and survived the heat of summer\nAnd so I drew up a whole new plan of what I wanted to put it in the yard Melissa that I worked on it for hours and hours and hours and came up to a conclusion what we wanted and then we paid a landscaping company to come in and put the plants and so forth and get it to where we want it to be [noise] now\nAs we did that we ran out of energy and money before all of the particular gardens and this house has like ten different lawns\nA few of the house you got a front yard a backyard and they're both probably not that big this is ten dry law it's and then it has hundreds of bats flower beds planning beds stuff just blows my mind\nUh there's probably a at least a million dollars with the landscape materials planted in the Charlotte right now and I go through ten twenty thirty thousand every year to try to change that get it back down to some realistic you know um so I changed the way I was going to do the plan you're going to have to change your plan\nIf you want to get financially become financially free you're going to need to change your planned now in the apartment complex overlooking yet or that we have purchased\nWe had a plan to vote in\nThe lead invested is doing the deal had a plan he can see what the other guys players how the other guys play I was wrong and now he has a plan that he's going to put in place but even as he puts that plan in place there's tremendous number of obstacles\nAnd so she's going through this thing this first week the obstacles are becoming clear to him things some of which that we're clear before we purchased a property others that were hidden very well until after closing you find about and again it's all the due process of getting to the obstacles\nAnd I kinda wanted to work through this with you today because as a working through this yard thing I sort of figured out\nThe ... the process here and hopefully you can learn to take something from this process it put it into your process to make things better so the first thing I did was I when I looked this up oh there's a secondary problem the landscaping company that I had put in my steps of plants they did such a poor job uh and\nThey tripled\nThe charge of my landscaping weekly monthly landscaping fees and so I had to let him go so I had no landscaper for about two months and just had somebody mowing the yard and so all of my bed all my plants were destroyed\nThere was nobody watching my yard and all of a sudden I woke up at I looked out there to go man my arch destroyed looks terrible\nIt's all had to take on the project or would have had to do is I had to put it into perspective something I could deal with is what I did was divided it up into areas\nAnd like I said there's like ten different environments ten different areas in my yard each of these ten different areas has different plant types\nIt has different son ratios from the day or night or from you know all day long what part of it's all of a sudden full sun parts son park shade and shade\nAll those are different everyone so everyone has to be dealt with completely on its own you can't just go in there to I'm going to theoretically get in your fix everything 'cause you can't so I took on the very front part of the law and first because it was almost completely dead\nAnd the beds we had just put in we're looking weak\nUm\nI had a flooded out area there were some sprinkler heads were broken there were flooding the yard\nAnd so I had one part of this zone\nWas all dead because they had no water the other part of his own was flooded because it it too much water now trying to figure that without because you can't fix it by turning the zone this bleaker sprinkler heads on fixing it because if it was all dry you would just water more if it was all wet you would water less\nBut they're in the same so\nI just wanted to go out to investigate head by head by head on the sprinkler system you know what was wrong and what I found was two of the sprinkler heads were completely broken and that's why that all these two areas were completely debt because district or heads were broken\nFound on the other one the sprinkler heads were leaking and I also filed by research that some of the ... way too large for the small amount of area that they read because when we did the yard\nWe had to redo some sprinkler head to head combinations problems so we come back we'll talk about how we start hacking through this stuff and how it relates to your

process engineering situation where we have to change the process completely route so we were talking earlier about you have the right plan financially\nYou got to get the right place and that's where you come to ... you get to play and how does how does this stuff work what should I be doing what does it work what does work and then you've taken you've worked through all these different suggestions in your personal situation\nAnd see what's happening like\nWe're talking about income you're in a minute which probably the most important would but the easy one his expenses what what are you wasting what is being wasted in your life and uh I find myself you know looking\nAt my life in my process in my home and my business has the same way I look at what is the dead weight dead weight in my life takes up my life so I was given a thought process early ought to lie for my dad\nUm it's not what it costs to buy something what it costs to maintain that something so you look at your situation go from where you're at financially in your life right now is it worth it for you to have that big drive home\nIs that really the right thing to be doing at this point you know\nMaybe the kids are all God you don't need that big home anymore why not shed that get rid of some of the expense and the maintenance both time and energy and money in maintenance of that big hope you get two or three or four cars do you really need two or three or four cars I'm it's ridiculous I've I've had as many as six cars\nI'm Down to four and I'm thinking about getting ready to one of them I've ever drive it or the other three are completely different vehicles that I actually need all through different kinds of vehicles the fourth one is a sports car I'd never drivers sports car I'm sixty two years old I Am happily relationship\nThere's no need to go out of the town and show off or I don't need to prove that are successful as a business person so I don't need to have a Porsche Ferrari or mine is of a Mercedes F cell\n... whatever sports a convertible five fifty whatever just unbelievably fast car with the ...\nComes off or actually removes itself whatever convert a convertible roof and shit I showed no real interest I don't even know the names and stuff in it because I don't even drive and I picked it up one time 'cause I could steal it 'cause I had something else the trades I could care for in this brand new and I figured Okay Michael pick it up [noise] um\nAnd I drove it has a problem with it but just really a waste of my time uh I go out to my garage the same thing I got stuff in my garage that I never use I've had it for years um it was a project started that never finished a project to finish for stuff left over\nA all that stuff she's kitchen your way just slows you down and you have to take care of it you have to maintain it you have to moving clean around and clean hundred um\nWhen I was going through the irrigation situation but I thought was is it I was actually wasting water I was irrigated above and beyond I figured you know see your thermostat problem\nYou know you sit there and said to the temperature you wonder well an irrigation system you don't really know what that about is and so you either seen your places to dry and turn it up\nWhere you see the places too low you turn it down I'm Sorry you you got too much water and you turn it down the problem is you don't know how 'bout you turn it either direction the wise thing to do is to start out\nAnd start moving slowly but surely not crank it all the way up again now you generally crank it all the way up to if you got to really drive all you want to make sure gets enough water tried to come back\nBut you can't leave it there you got to crank it back down again because once you've got it growing and saturated now you're going to get it or you try to keep his silhouette that you're going to get mould and so on and so forth so it's a it's a balancing act guys you got to stay on top of the we're talking about this just one zone in my house so I now\nI'm working my way out of that so right so you're working your way out of okay what are we going to do with this extra

really need all that are just\nAll this stuff in your life you're wasting money is just a waste that you don't really need to do [noise] um\nAre you going out to eat too often and now it's on to a little bit too much like Dave Ramsey but the bottom line is there is an expense sides of the equation now when I got back to my yard here after I had stabilize this front area\nHad to let it sit for a couple of days a week or two and see what it would turn into I had to let the fertilizer take effect\nI had to let the change of lawn chair companies take effect has its ... like the change of a rotator heads on the sprinkler systems take effect [noise] um\nSo I set that one off the side as sort of watch that I made it a point every day to go out and watch it look what's happening see what's going on and then it went on to my next his own\nAnd the next so it was truly a watering problem that the heads sprinkler has one of them was buried underneath the plant there's growing like a hundred times the size originally planted it so the sprinkler once I was on the edge of the bed or now it's you know ... ...\nSix feet under a plan so I had to trim the plant away so the ... like you get to
