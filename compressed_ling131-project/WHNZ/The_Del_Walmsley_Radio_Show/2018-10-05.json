fifty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo it and where you go and and what I Need to do to get there and uh but me as far as the entrepreneurial spirit in any of that man that was so or you know I'm just not even in my ... at the time\nSo where does uh where did you start to get your legs and yourself and figure out who you were which is a high school or college or work where did you start forgetting Kevin was\nA late high\nOh I guess you know you start to ah\nYou get that first job out there you are making a little bit of money to realize what's possible and\nGet a little bit of that customer service experience which I think is is sorely lacking now a days in a big part of what we do nowadays but um I I think certainly a part of that was that first job and and then then my yeah my wife had our first job and she was she continues to be a big big part of that and we've been together for very long time\nAnd uh she she put up with me and uh but certainly college I mean college was was an experience in itself I mean I\nFirst one of my family to go to school go to college first one to graduate and even even today extended family or otherwise I'm Still the first and only right now to make that happen and and that that's that's big that's saying a lot and\nThat that really kind of open the world up to me\nYou know what I mean just just kind of made me realize what was out there and um everything's been kind of a everything's been a learning process you know you get a little bit of that you think that's it you know you think that okay I Need it you know do it we're always taught you know we go to school get a good job we work and we say and I was doing my\nPart to make that happen then I think we're really start to happen was was certainly with a graduated from college now would you go to college for\nA engineering believe it or not yeah so uh probably like a several people here you know it always seems like we would come out of this this is pretty common mix but yeah I I went to school for engineering graduate with a bachelor's and a\n... pretty quickly through that whole corporate America process that I really did not need any more than that I'm\nA big thing for me was was was time uh and then we can talk more about that but um I I realize that to to get to where I Want to be I really didn't need more education more school bachelor it was fine and and that's what I got so\nYou know it's funny I've I went to college and I've never had anybody asked me why entire life to see where\nThey need my grades school records I don't even know if you do they ask you have you gone through college or not but I've never had anybody actually care that's what's yeah what you make it as a ... it's really true there's nobody really cares you went to college or not I know a lot of guys have jobs that you have to have a degree or something to get but\nOther than that you could be the last guide your class you still got to get through you know it just doesn't matter so uh\nYeah and I tell you not just the just the degree either but it's the resume I mean that's where a lot of people are it's all about the resume I got to have the resume that I have to have that TV that just tell everybody what I've done and we're at the end what and we don't care about that\nYou know we don't do resume you know we don't have that kind of stuff that would that that kind of defines who we are you know that's not what we're about as real estate investor so it's a it's a one eighty ship short from what I think the majority of people especially in corporate America folks believe in and and live by every day you know\nSo at what age you get married that where we get we were in college or after conscious talk about where you start\nHim after college it was a thousand three we were uh you know living the lifestyle and just you know enjoying life with friends and partying and you know having to get time then you know experiencing that and I have in our first job and having a little bit of cash you know so we were living\nIt up a little bit and taking a lot of vacation trips and stuff like that with our with our friends that were we we still are still closed what so a family really didn't start until uh two two thousand seven right so I mean we were you know\nUh we were you know having a good time up until then and even now I don't mean that that way but about seven we had our girls the twin girls and a\nAnd that was a that was another big experience right I mean that's that's a that's a lot of change or for sure you know having one is enough to at the same time it's something different and so uh that that's where you know\nNot necessarily reality they're thinking then but your priorities definitely ship and you start trying to put together a plan you know for for what you want to do or you want to go off for\nYour average is quite a judgeship have twins of her death and quite a\nFew you know what have we didn't know the different we didn't know the different you know a lot of people a lot of people say that too and we're like I couldn't tell you what one is like for me one like do I know I I Know [laughter] it was a lot of lawyers item that\nYour boy you feel nothing anymore right now I always heard that one would wake up soon as one would cry the other would wake up and that would cry which other went up to go but whatever\nI guess it's like anything else in life you you're going to learn to get through it is it's going to be okay so um we we've got the family now and we've got the job the corporate job when we come back from the break what I Want to do is to start talking about how you found or no to start with why did you start looking for
