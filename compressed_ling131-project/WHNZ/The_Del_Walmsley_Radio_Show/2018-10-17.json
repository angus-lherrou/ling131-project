company and\nWhat happened is a he would come across these particular deals and my father in law or is looking for for a no investments they buy you know\nCows and and that didn't work out too good at best and some other stock and that wouldn't work out too good but\nIt was my uh cousin ended up he was fading in from the proper term and I was watching them I saw where they were making money and both month Bob ... cash would've known this maybe would have gotten in commercial real estate ownership business before you know there's some benefits to it\nTony was that I went to college I got out
