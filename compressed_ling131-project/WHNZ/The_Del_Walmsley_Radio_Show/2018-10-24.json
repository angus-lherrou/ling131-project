Gen Z in Tampa\nI'm dead Web these David Graham and stash grams on the line with us than issue or some of the big newsmakers ah yesterday\nWell first of all start internationally more than one of the story lines of we've spent a lot of time talking about teddy in in keeping listeners a a\nAbreast of the current events but brags that a British prime minister Theresa May will face another breakfast showdown with their party or later today this time confronting a gathering of this so called Nineteen twenty twenty or she mean Nineteen twenty twenty to a committee um\nHer strategies sold over a disagreement on the Irish backstop cause I'd it churns policy to ensure that there will be no return to a hard border on the island is a future trading relationship is is not agreed upon and time this is very very worrisome I think a lot of people are surprised\nA with how this situation has unfolded a is certainly after the referendum vote and there was maybe a little bit of\nBuyer's remorse per se after the vote happened uh with\nCitizens and with the voters a in Britain there certainly seems to be a a sense of of of current insurance that they might not actually have an agreement a place after two years of negotiations\nUh if you look at earlier this year a lot of people thought okay they were coming around to a number we know that you want to bigger number in the u._k. a wants to smaller number but they were gonna come and meet somewhere in the middle it sure looks like the email has been holding a hard ground uh and not only that\nBut there seems to be infighting in more in fighting than expected a within the u._k. and that's really makes any type of negotiation hard when you of one party that doesn't really know what or how are they are going to get what they want\nIs Boris Johnson going to challenge the may for the uh the the leader I Wonder\nI Wonder teddy I I Would say is typically it's probably pretty unlikely but considering all the other events that have happened so far in the last year and a half\nI certainly want to put a passports Johnson if that's if if something like that were to happen again I think that just ugly it's highly unlikely ah or it's unlikely a but nothing would surprise me in this instance again because it's only a matter of a few months now uh the we have\nA an agreement that needs to to get done and needs to be in place and we're talking a very very large a variety\nAnd then lastly or in the retail consumer space or in a bid to win shoppers over rivals like Walmart and Amazon now target is entering the online retail fray\nFor the first time ever it is offering free to day shipping with no minimum purchased required for this holiday season\nTarget also said it's dried up service or shoppers can placed orders on line had them bought directly to their cars will be available at nearly a thousand stores we spent a lot of time over the last couple of years detailing\nBig box or older retailers that never were able to adapt to the online space and they've gone bankrupt Sears most recent toys are us last year target is trying to stem the tide or in at least capture a fair portion\nOf online shopping I think this is going to be one of the biggest things to keep an eye on one of the biggest metrics to keep an eye and within the retail space this holiday season\nDoes online retail continue to grow and continued out these people buying goods which is still the majority of how people by their goods for the holiday season but does it continue to outgrow or are people that buy good with in the store\nYou know it's gonna it's gonna be interesting to see because we're going through a change of dynamics now with online purchasing across the board is going to be going more and more so um and\nThen being things to deliver to your house before you know what you're going to have drones dropping newspapers on our heads in the morning if they still have newspapers I guess\nBut the world is changing on is changing radically and it's going to be interesting to see the dynamics of technology or the generational change going on between you know aging baby boomers like teddy and I hear who have smartphones smarter than we are and\nVersus your your generation that just trying to get a handle of who's on first than have to deal with all this debt I noticed Paul Volcker\nHad mentioned that you know he's still alive in Ninety One years old and his memoirs he's writing now he speaking the other day and it was interviewed by Bloomberg and he said the world is a complete mess right now with debt everywhere around the world from South Africa to China or\nSouth America our country and and how's the how's the world going to deal with all this debt that we have presently out here and how they're going to handle it ... the solution we forgive everybody's dead\nForgive everyone's that are getting less start fresh all over again and I think we should have guaranteed income so you think I don't know about that stuff I appreciate your sage advice is there anything else out there now that you can think of off handed there's so much going on\nWell I'm just out of curiosity with what's the recount out right now I noticed that will prices are dropping a little\nBall all prices as we talked about in the previous segment oil prices have been dropping but it's largely due to the softer we've seen the markets which surely brings a concern that we might see an economy that is already a global economy was already hit\nPeak growth and I think that's one of the major concerns uh with any type of investment with an energy space in particular fury trader of energy futures in addition to that then Saudi leadership announcing that they might pare back\nUh the supply restrictions that have been put into place so to allow all the countries and some of the larger non OPEC countries to be able to produce freely but there are ... up for that's not necessarily a big number right now\nVery

Leo are sharing their story we've heard about their childhood and entrepreneurial families and their experiences in corporate America\nThat led them both to see the need for massive change Peggy retired and Leo sold his business you know those were bold moves how did you\nDecide what to do next I you know sitting there thinking about that as you know you've you've worked where Peggy Burke the way up\nIn corporate America to the point that they said hey don't expect any more money over here right we're done\nAt the system is that you're going to make and then Leo you know you'd built that business until the point that you're going you know I I don't want to expand that's I don't want to have employees I don't want to do this somebody offered you a great price and and you said okay and you sold your business and and you found yourself now\nI'm looking out at an uncharted uncharted voyage why don't you do next\n\nWell when we started um selling stock options so we buy the stock and we'd still the options\nAnd ... had been listening for years on the radio to the sperm that was advertising their program and so we got in there and and we did quite well it the first because really you buy the stock he's still the option immediately on your computer you're given credit and to your account\nAnd that was great and\nBut we were asked to buy stock the stock every month for ten months until we were called out of the stock well and that was fine and good we were cost averaging you know on our stock and um\nIt was good until the recession hit because then the stock prices on some of our holding started going down and they went down so loud that we got to wear on some of them we couldn't sell the options anymore so actually our equity was going down\nAnd we were losing our principal and then our income on our stock option income was going down so we knew that we we had to make a change you know we were just looking for something more where um our equity would increase in value and that we'd have a steady income so we decided that we needed to make a change\nAnd how is that from your perspective [noise]\nWell I just thought you know we've got we've gotten ourselves into a bar or a ... year and I thought you know what I kept I did it a couple of times or\nI Would try to get hold of real estate broker and try to watch something his call triple ... at least and and maybe on a small office warehouse every time I Do that I ended up getting um somebody was bought out and walk and you get to it\nAnd I was really frustrated that show up\nAnd um so I kept her of the program on the radio about this you know stock option than it was good like Peggy mentioned\nAnd for a while and then uh it got to realize that you know we're supposed to hold our some of the stocks and we have now tariffs on um a China and I thought jeeze you know is that there are some flaws on this program and um\nI told her I said you know what I keep hearing about lifestyle them limited on the radio and I said you know we got to go check this program around you see what it's all about it's been on for a number of years and so that's what\nI'm I thought you know that's where it kind of let let us go to a lifestyle a tutor in a ... you know I go on to it a couple of arms and um it was and then you know that it was a whole nother process will pay you getting hurt\nYou know to join in a boat and they do it together 'cause we're obtain and I'm sure smarter than I Am and um she makes better ...\nBetter of the time\nAnd um it was so all you can you know that it was a new lifestyles where we need to be a ... today and because they talk about everything and really in a way I guess my background in the past wasn't wasted um\nBecause what happened is it all came back to me with love from the family for a lot from um\nUh just going to school and learning about real estate but I you know but there are certain things that they all family you know with ... and all and ... all this kind of disenchanted because of after the passion of my parents and the market at all\nYou know people there what they are needed to be a plan in greater be control on things and it's all kind of disenchanted with that and the real estate um aspect and so until I came across lifestyle when they saw those\nSolve those problems\nOne other thing that caught my attention is\nI just remember my father and uncle born under a deal down in Houston and\nIt was a deal or it was an apartment complex and I just got a card a I like I said you know what why don't you go to the closing down in Houston and so they gave me the closing statement unless they want you to\nWhen you get this call the accounting on what you want you to tell them that number and everything it's like any of this closing
