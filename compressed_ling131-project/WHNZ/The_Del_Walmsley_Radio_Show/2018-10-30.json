{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Well the first big news maker and it's something else so we're watching today in addition to to read some shame between us and Canada trade officials about getting a master replacement in inform big tech big\nTech is going to Congress Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg ... CEO Jack Dorsey are going to testify before the Senate intelligence committee about how the big technology companies are preparing for the midterm elections\nOr Google executives were invited to appear but declined the offer that vicious hearing is a follow up to the one that convened in November on the Russian election interference\nBe very interesting to see the Capitol Hill for the next month month and a half is going to be very busy or before the midterm elections are and with that being said this will certainly be a very interesting day because you've had several officials from the government\nWhether the president himself or leaders from the from the majority are meant a minority\nParties come out with some pretty strong statements specifically in this issue of how technology companies are monitoring\nThe disinformation a issues that are starting to play a\nWhat a lot of people believe are are are a balanced politics\nSure ... here's something that you know the media is picking up quite a bit you know Nike took a hit yesterday I'm On social media especially and much less I guess the\nAnd I don't know what to stock prices doing today over this Kaepernick deal and you know the backlash started just almost immediately\nAnd what what would you think they're sinking was\nWhen they decided to come up with that advertising or believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything and all that business what's your take on that\nUh well you know it it my my thought is largely muted uh in regards to business in particular stock prices Nike's up today but it's it's not\nMuch there are like point seven percent or that pales in comparison is selling pressure that they saw yesterday or they were down more than three percent for most of the trading day\nUh it talks about how businesses and then if they do get\nA political in nature whether they believe maybe they weren't uh they they are and so when you make decisions like that there is the possibility you're going to suffer the consequences Nike is not the only company a that gets involved in these types of of situations\nRemember there was a very big merger that\nJust while it was ruled in favor of a teen teen time Warner and their merger gets apartment a justice but a lot of people believe that merger was very politicized ...\nDid not like CNN and he did not want to see the merger goes through\nThe judge ruled in favor of Eighteen teen time Warner said there is no case law that's preventing or or preventing this merger from happening and really slapped down the department of justice a in a very very one sided ruling and itch fearful among a lot of people that\nThe damage that happened in the ruling against the department of justice even though they're appealing right now or the damage is done against the department of justice will uh restrict its ability to go after other mergers that maybe would be seen as\nMore of a a more of a risk to overall anti trust business matters\nSure no I saw or several analysts said that that might Nike did that it sent a strong signal to their current roster of athletes and and positions Nike that's kind of a savvy risk taker is there's not a move that any company can make the NYC for for a Nike it was definitely a\nA smart business move 'em you know the you know namely who buys your shoes this to me you know I guess just about every minority kid in the country whereas Nike shoes\nVacillates and and uh it was obviously a risk but it was also by doing that and we they were making a pronounced political a political statement to themselves so that'd be said as anyone else out there\nRight well in addition to the situation of forty with Nike and in addition\nTo what we're seeing right now uh with the uh the big tech companies coming to the hill\nSaudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants oil ... between Seventy and eighty dollars a barrel for now according to eight OPEC a release that came out over the weekend\nAs the world's largest or as the world's biggest crude exporter or they're looking to find a balance between maxim fighting revenue and keeping a lid on prices until the congressional elections and this is very interesting obviously it's one thing to see in a release it they like to keep all between Seventy and eighty dollars a barrel\nThat's another thing for sources to say well they're going to wait until the congressional\nLecture and see how this is going to take place very interesting situation obviously big ramifications here in the United states is we've seen a lot of uptick in energy related to a a a spending\nVery good stuff as always we appreciate your sage advice and we'll be talking tomorrow thanks now or ... or ... thanks guys well\nLet me ask you are you going to an advisor or local banker brokerage house for retirement advice if you are just remember they work for the bank or the ... first they don't work for you\nAnd they're usually more concerned about their retirement than yours a true for do shortly always push your interest ahead of their own much much less having some company telling them what to recommend to you so if you need honest retirement advice\nWhy don't you send an appointment with the number one retirement planning company on the west coast of Florida to Graham capital advisors\nWe're attorneys that specialize announcer preservation elder care law\nFinancial advisors that focus exclusively on retirement investing certified to stay planners that will develop a real retirement planning for you all in the same office\nOfficers on main street in Sarasota Kennedy boulevard in Tampa Washington DC on K Street go to our website schedule appointment its gram capital advisors dot com [noise]\n\nAnd I'm not going to let these guys get rich off of losing my money for me I can at least lose my own\nBut what I found out when I got out there in the real estate investment world was is it these returns that these people are offering guys are ridiculous\nYou've got to understand is when someone tells you they can give you one to two percent of the savings account three percent on a bond\nIf someone tells you in a real estate solicitation hired a guy on the Internet the other bragging that his deals can earn three to four percent now by the way he wasn't indicating that was going on three to four percent is a deal he didn't even talk about how much of that he was going to take out and by the time he took his\nOut his fees and his overrides you may only be earning two to three percent but he was bragging about that why would anybody invested that you can go on a by single family houses and earn ten to twenty five percent cash flow from day one\nOr within a month if you have to rehab to house ten to twenty five percent not only that you are lab reached the point where you put twenty percent down you can increase the value of the house by twenty percent easily and make a hundred percent gain on your money within one year\nNow interestingly enough I found out you can do the same thing with small deals go out and buy yourself a small apartment complex [noise]\nYou put ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand dollars down you operate that correctly for one year using the tools that we teach ... lifestyles unlimited and you're going to be able to double\nOr I'm Sorry we call the ten twenty five one hundred percent rule you can increase the rat by ten percent or income by ten percent\nBy either increasing the cover lowering the expenses which will raise the value the property by twenty five percent\nSet your only invested it twenty five percent that twenty five percent increases a hundred percent return on your investment we called up the ten twenty five one hundred percent rule very simple to accomplish\nNow why would you want to go into a syndication for some guy so often you three to four percent and then bragging that well if you stay with this deal for ten years you know it's got to go up in value\nHell maybe it does maybe it doesn't act I should say maybe\nIt does maybe a dozen but the reality is is that you don't know you don't know what's gonna happen ten Twenty years from now\nAll you really knows you're earning three or four percent modest whatever the guys these are\nThis is nowhere near\nAs good as what you could get by owning your own real estate deal not even close right so you want to understand at first I was teaching people how to do their own real estate deals\nAnd get massive massive benefits another massive benefit is the depreciation done correctly\nYou can earn enough depreciation to one cover all the income you're earning from your real estate investment and too many times have access depreciation law says that you can carry over to your earned income if you are an investor\nBut if you're not an investor if you're a passive person putting money in syndication you cannot carry those losses over to your own earn income so you're losing that whole part\nOf the investment world not even close so these guys are taking your money from you\nWhether it be the stock market the financial planner this indicators they're putting it into deals that they're getting paid fees and commissions right up front\nMost of the indicators out there that I run into the people I see on the Internet the once if you go look up what they're really doing and read the prospect this was in ...\nAnd see what their offers are you will find out there taking fees up front fees during the middle and fees on the back in some of them take acquisition the some of them take a construction field rehab the some of 'em are taking an Asset Management the uh property management be\nAt a liquidation the by the time they're done with the fees you're ready to return is sub par to say the least sub par compared to what you should be able to earn it a real estate transaction\nRight so I was teaching people how to own their own deals and or partner\nAnd when we partner were equal partners\nWe both get to ask a syndicator to be equal partner with you asked them to put in as much money into the deal is you do and they will laugh at you they don't put it in their own me money\nThey use everybody else's money\nThey keep their money make profits put the money in the bank live like a king and use everybody else's money to get rich the same as stockbrokers famous financial planners and the same as these agree just indicators and quite frankly irritated to ... out to be\nHit irritated me so much I started lifestyles unlimited to be

[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell come back you know here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One\nMom's love them back to\nBelong to a radio show today I'm Talking about how to do syndication the correct way not the way you seen advertised out there and the Internet on marketing and so and so forth\nNot the type of agree just um types of investments where they take your money they make massive millions of dollars for themselves and very little small returns for you\nThis is not the way these things should be done I see it out there all over the place and I see it on the Internet I see everybody out there right now they're looking for and doing everything they can contact wise to get your attention so that you will follow them so that they can get you as a customer to invest into their deals\nAnd the reality is is just not the right thing to do and I'm going to I'm just going through I've already done this for twenty eight years I'll guide\nAnd I've I've done been doing this before any and all these guys ever existed out there in the real estate world I guarantee you bring me anybody that's claiming to have been around longer than I have\nAnd that will show you that it's not true\nSo the bottom line is is that when we came through this educational program life doesn't limit is a mentor you educational program\nWe're teaching people to do what I did which was buy real estate but again like I said in the last segment people started wanting to partner together\nBut partnership and very quickly turned into syndication so the difference between a partnership with a syndication as\nA partnership is everybody's equal partners everybody puts up money everybody gets their share everybody has some say in what goes on a syndication is where one or more groups of people get together and they raise capital to do deals they take money up front they take money in the middle that money at the end many times\nUh and they just take agree just be out of the deal and almost every case\nSo we started running into these problems on the list of some of the things that we started seeing happening here lifestyles when people started doing this number one ah people were getting hurt\nThey're getting into deals that were dying because people didn't know how to operate the deals the people that were doing the deals where either number one just completely unsophisticated an educator and how to manage the property once they closed it's very simple to raise capital and close the deal they'll let any of these guys tell you that they are the smartest thing\nIn the world that they are like the sharpest played in the drawer they're not\nRaising money in a syndication it's so simple you take one or two classes on syndication you go to the bank or get yourself pre qualified you do it's a simple stopped do guys it really is we teach it we'd been teaching it for twenty eight years now\nIt's not hard to do what is hard to do is to do it correctly to where you are preventing\nThe problems that these people are running into where you are giving your investors the safest possible investment out there so we ran into the people who are uneducated unsafe escape didn't know what they're doing and it we ran into the bad actors the greedy people that want to take advantage of everybody\nSo let's talk about this we started seeing people doing bad deals we started seeing unfair splits to where the lead was just taking more and more and more forget I call lead the guy putting their deal together truly that the masters in Decatur unfair splits where the the syndicate it was just feeling all the money out of the deal\nBad operations the the syndicator could not operate the property and they were going down people were losing their money\nI'm\nFinancing I saw people with that didn't have the ability to get good financing they were going out there and getting bad financial because they had bad credit or bad equity bad network so on and so forth so they got bad financing\nThe wrong kind of financing they didn't understand the financing and the financing at all kinds of problems attached to it\nAh it example that would be the financing was too much overlap bridge the ... not enough there was not enough leverage the financing\nA term limitation other words you had to get out of it very short a balloon note that you couldn't figure out a way to get out of a turnaround finance and get to higher interest rates\nAre the financing get no way to get out of it there was no way to to exit strategy the property all these things were about stuff that these guys didn't know right then you go on\nAnd you have bad promoted or people that were illegally promoting deals you know these indications\nAre actually controlled by or they're\nLegally supposed to be watched by the FCC there are specific rules and regulations for doing this for raising capital and one of those\nIs not advertising one of those is making sure you have only accredited and or a sophisticated investors\nAnd many of these people are just taking anybody they were throwing people the deal to knew nothing about real estate which you can't do\nTaking people that were not accredited didn't have enough money to be ... credited and value in bold enough to get into these deals they're letting people in brothers mothers sons front hey tell your buddies about it\nAnd people were getting into shouldn't get in\nThe didn't understand what they were doing and these people were at risk of losing their entire life savings",
