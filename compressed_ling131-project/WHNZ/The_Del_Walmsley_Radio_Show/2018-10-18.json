I don't know what to stock prices doing today over this Kaepernick deal and you know the backlash started just almost immediately\nAnd one what would you think they're thinking was\nWhen they decided to come up with that advertising or believe in something you'd been it means sacrificing everything and all that business what's your take on that\nUh well you know ... my my thought is largely muted uh in regards to business in particular stock prices Nike's up today but it's it's not much there are like point seven\nPercent a that pales in comparison is selling pressure that they saw yesterday uh they were down more than three percent for most of the trading day\nUh it it talks about how businesses and then if they do get\nA political in nature whether they believe maybe they weren't uh they they are and so when you make decisions like that\nThere is the possibility you're going to suffer the consequences Nike is not the only company or that gets involved in these types of of situations remember there was a very big merger that\nJust while it was ruled in favor of Eighteen teen time Warner and their merger gets apartment a justice but a lot of people believe that mergers very politicized ...\nDid not like CNN and he did not want to see the merger goes through\nThe judge ruled in favor of Eighteen teen time Warner said there's no case law that's preventing or or preventing this merger from happening and really slapped down the department of justice a in a very very one sided ruling and itch fearful among a lot of people that\nThe damage that happened in the ruling against the department of justice even though they're appealing to right now or the damage is done against the department of justice will ah restrict its ability to go after other mergers that maybe would be seen as\nMore of a a more of a risk to overall anti trust business matters\nSure you know I saw or several analysts said that that when my Nike did that it sent a strong signal to the current roster of athletes and and positions Nike as kind of a savvy risk taker is there's not a move that any company can make\nThe NYC for for a Nike it was definitely a a smart business move\n'em you know ... you know namely who buys your shoes this to me you know I guess just about every minority kid in the country whereas Nike shoes vacillates and and uh it was obviously a risk but it was also by doing that and we were making a pronounced political a political statement to themselves so\nThat'd be said as anyone else out there\nRight well in addition to the situations of forty with Nike\nAnd in addition to what we're seeing right now uh with the uh the big tech companies coming to the hill Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia wants oil ... between Seventy and eighty dollars a barrel for now according to a OPEC of release that came out over the weekend\nAs the world's largest or as the world's biggest crude exporter or they're looking to find a balance between maxim fighting revenue and keeping a lid on prices until the congressional elections and this is very interesting obviously it's one thing to see and release it they like to keep all between seven and eight dollars a barrel\nThat's another thing for sources to say well they're going to wait until the congressional\nLecture and see how this is going to take place very interesting situation obviously big ramifications here in the United states is we've seen a lot of uptick in energy related to\nA a a spending\nVery good stuff as always we appreciate you said you advice and we'll be talking to tomorrow thanks now they're ... or ... thanks guys well let me ask you are you going to an advisor at our local banker brokerage house for retirement advice if you are just remember they work for the bank or the ... first they don't work for you\nAnd they're usually more concerned about their retirement than yours\nAre true for do short always push your interest ahead of their own ... much less having some company telling them what to recommend to you so if you need honest retirement advice why don't you send an appointment with the number one retirement planning company on the west coast of Florida to Graham capital advisors\nWherever attorneys especially as an asset preservation elder care law\nFinancial advisors that focus exclusively on retirement investing certify the state planners that will develop a real retirement plan for you all in the same office\nOfficers on main street in Sarasota Kennedy boulevard and Tampa Washington DC on K Street go to our website schedule appointment its gram capital advisors dot com [noise]\n\nThe proceeding was a commercial program paid for by Graham capital the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceedings program are not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated in\nWest ... hell\nOn our ...\n[noise] and um what kinds of questions that they come up with it's just you know as you age you do is let me ask you to rephrase the question is are a pattern to it I Know what I was consulting there were always patterns you know there was maybe five or ten different things people want to do\nAnd they pick one or two of those patterns do you find that\n... yeah I Would say so and I've seen several different things so my first person I met with actually had five single family houses that he had purchased on his own before finding lifestyles and he heard a better way on the rate from the radio show on how he could be doing what he's doing and decided to come and joined up and and get a little deeper and things\nHe had a pathway he thought when he came to me actually came to me for multi family counseling but as I look at what he was doing and what is Gulf War I realized that he knew what he was doing a single family and we certainly have plenty of members who have gone from one to I don't know what our\nIs I think I heard somebody has fifty or maybe even a hundred\nA single families out there and they've got an unbelievable system for how to run those things\nAnd I realized that this guy for what he wanted to achieve he was already halfway there and I said I could I don't know single family but I can tell that you could be where you want to be in a year just by doubling down on what you've already done and with a what he told me that the money had to invest was I said I think it'll take you longer to get there\nGoing the multi family route but I'll be happy to take it or if that's really what you want to do and are made him rethink what he wanted to do and and so that was one thing that happened the common thing I think is passive investors\nWho are trying to figure out how to juggle getting involved with lifestyle while working in the job that they enjoy and as you know paying for it to themselves and their lifestyle as it is and these are always conservative people they're like minded as we are they're just looking for a better way to do a kind of what they're already doing and\nI really find myself emphasizing to them that I call this a contact sport and that is you got to get involved you've got to get to our parents and meet other people doing it because they will accelerate your ability to get involved and deals to do your own deal whatever it is that they're trying to do\nAnd the three people that I can reference uh that are already up and running as passes and are are going to be closing on their first deal within maybe by the end of this month I think\nUm those are people that took advice and they started showing up at the road trips the case studies I started shaking hands meeting people that were doing deals and uh got caught up in a very quickly\nNow one of the themes I ran into and I don't know if we run into this as much anymore you've only been here six days so maybe you haven't been through a large enough cycle yet to see this happening but one of the things I used to run into all the times got somebody come to me and say\nYou know I Want to do single family but then they went on a road trip and we next week to come back you know just change my mind after seeing what is on the road trip I Want to be multi family\nAnd you know the a week later this hour we'll start out as the past have been in a week after that to come back to you know you know one after seeing this I think I could do this to I Want to be and I wrote a you know and then come back and say you know what I'm looking for these smaller deals that they just couldn't go ahead and go up to you know\nI'm a lead investor you have written in ...\nAh yeah the one that I'm working on they actually came in to be passes but there are retired and may have seen enough now where they're going you know what we could do and we have the money to do a forty in a deal on her up maybe we should start doing that\nBecause they're uh they're kind of being picky which uh don't blame him for probably not a bad idea on who they invested with and and that cycle takes time to understand what makes a good partner for your specific situation\nAnd finding somebody that has the same goals are is on the same track that you are and uh yeah so they're swinging back around now and we started talking about them just doing their own deal and part of that actually was me telling them look I've already got two people that are by twenty minutes and this was just happened in the last you know forty five days\nSo uh they realized that that could happen a little faster and uh and I think you know sometimes you just got to push people off cliff Lopez once I get to the edge\nAnd ah so I I think those that couple will go that way but all the other cycle she I don't think I've been around quite long enough to see the transition that you have a twenty seven years or however long you been doing this\nWell the next one is um a more difficult question I'm you've done some due diligence so far\n[noise] yeah we actually did a deal a Monday ten days ago now um for a guy he's actually out of central Texas or what the deal is in a camp which actually falls in Houston a territory so it came to me\nUh we went on site didn't know I'd never stopped it they'll capital I've driven through it on my way to fishing trips down on the coast but I've never stopped there so I got to go down there for a day they had done a nice job of pre shopping the market we walked all the units are had some contractors they're looking at everything to decide how much work\nNeeded to be done on it before going in so they knew how to properly budget for any deferred maintenance and things like that gets thing often it's dark\nAnd I'm actually I just got a text from two minutes before we got on air here and he wants to talk this afternoon he's read on his business analysis and he wants me to take a look at it and\nKind of play devil's advocate on what he's missed and whether I take the deal still work or not\n[noise] well I think that's probably a good place to take a break we'll pick that up on the other side also when we come back\nWe'll discuss this guy has to do just disgusted saying yes or no to deal with this will be right back with Scott been offering

multifamily mentor and sky to where we left I left you a question here that was a basically have six months a year ago you're taking your foot off the gas\nAnd starting to pump the brakes and now all of a sudden you got it shifted into high gear hear what's going on does what has changed\nYou know the uh I I think I've heard you use this phrase it and it's very true the uh thing that can keep a lot of people away from a great life as having a really good one\nHand I think ah when you and I had that conversation I was having a a very good life I um [noise]\nYou know I was always pretty financially conservative and getting out of college at Twenty one twenty twenty three years old I Would get money magazine and read it cover to cover the day it showed up I Do all the little worksheets that they put in there on how much money you need to retire and all that sort of stuff and [noise]\nAnd my first job out of college I immediately went after Eighteen percent I was donating to the four oh one K. to really get ahead of that thing I didn't believe Social Security was going to be around and I wouldn't count non at forty five years later [noise]\nUm and I one of those worksheets ... number how much I needed to retire and a couple of years ago we refinanced my first two deals and I had to sit down I only redo my personal financial statement or really look at\nAll that stuff when they make me\nTo get a loan done and I did my a deal in a way you know what\nI'm over my number now or do I do [laughter] do I quit or I'm too young really to to totally quit but you know these things will keep throwing off cash flow for as long as I keep him and I thought\nNow's the time to start focusing on the lifestyle issues and stop worrying about money uh so I really didn't have a need for more deals I didn't need them to feed my ego I didn't need them to feed my family\nOr anything like that and I also at that same time two years ago I had my first two I have twins and a there'll be a junior in college and a couple of weeks here uh but they got into college and I realized it didn't hurt me as bad as I expected it to um\nHaving that extra money going out ah so ah so I really I I was wondering what I Do next what what I Do for an encore and uh [noise] at some point and this really a leads into why Mitt lifestyles now back\nAround New Year's I'm not a big New Year's resolution guy um but I had said you know what I Need to re combat and\nIt just so happened about that time a a deal kind of fell into my lap that's the one I did back in April and about the same time John Ridgway came to me and said hey I'm moving up to support this national effort that lifestyle just got to have your taking my job [laughter] and\nI don't know if you know this but I turned him down twice a week it came to me no I didn't know that event yeah and then eventually sick Curtis on me and and you do know that Curtis when I started in the gallery of pretty much together about the same time so we used to have lunch once a week and compare notes and help each other out and\nUh we haven't been doing that he's got busy doing his thing and and doing the lifestyle mentor thing as a I don't know too much for two years ago when he took the shop\nAnd uh I got to do on my deal and Curtis called me and said come on man will be like old times of need your help [laughter] so uh he's the one that really convinced me to to take the position\nAnd uh yeah it's it's just been a real commitment and um and at the same time I'm doing more of the things that I Know that I used to enjoy helping people\nTending road trips things like that I kind of falling off the bat ah for the lifestyles are things for a while there and it's got to be reinvigorated re involved and uh and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for him it's just that being more active again\nThings kind of pop up and I just had my eyes open you know decide which ones you want to do\nAbsolutely now I Want to throw in other ... long those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which are knows when sanitary but look at it from the point of view about the time that all this came about you've found this deal out eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to us for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not going to guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all the taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money\nAnd sophistication and the experience that we're humiliated in this group and taken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or without being insulted elites they have less experience than we do\nAnd to be able to throw that these properties in these markets outside of the Texas market area and ah you nailed one we've had four or five others have gotten nailed in the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas and San Antonio is going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going", "show_name":
