D stocks will be the first to be sold off\nIn any type of market correction now certainly\nA ten percent corruption the NASDAQ is not necessarily a a full fledged correction as we noted to pull back certainly a corrections generally started Fifteen to twenty percent we are not there are even though we have had a fair amount of companies\nOr be lower or be she may be more than down twenty percent this month which is very very a different way of thinking about markets one thing to say that the SP ... down ... percent\nNASDAQ down nine or ten percent but when you have forty percent\nOf the companies that are publicly traded on those on the New York stock exchange a trade down more than twenty percent it is very very eye opening and again has been a very very difficult month for equity investors\nBut without a doubt think about it if you didn't have the thing stocks going through the roof this past year where would the markets be all in all took out and took out science dogs a Facebook apple Amazon Google Netflix um you know we don't have a whole new different totally different market out there not to say the least\nExactly I mean it's just it's just crazy I think that you know like you say guaranteed investments I think are really a wise decision for retirement money right now and look we can show you investments that do exactly that\nAre at such as anything else out there\nYeah in in in his speech or in Washington DC uh Janet Yellen the former fed chair a agave respect his speech about where she thought interest rates were going to go over the next couple of years and what the Federal Reserve is going to do what she said quote\nAt this point a couple of more interest rate hikes are interest rate increases are necessary to stabilize growth that is sustainable pace and stabilize the labor markets so it doesn't overheat\nIf I had a magic wand I Would raise taxes and cut retirement spending she described the U.S debt path as unsustainable right it's very interesting this especially in a lot of parts of the remarks if I had a magic wand right I Would raise taxes and cut retirement spending\nI think personally one of the biggest narratives that we're going to see in the year of twenty Nineteen is weakness in the U.S dollar because the dollar is done very well against the rest of the world and that has been one of the biggest uh uh a divergence is all the United states and the rest of the world is that\nThe dollar and equity markets by and large\nHave done very well compared to equity markets around the world and that it's something that again I think a lot of people should keep in mind in or keep an eye on and twenty Nineteen is that\nThe deficit continues to grow if Democrats take house then you're going to see a government that's not going to be able to increase fiscal spending and that could be a risk and equity markets\nThat would be that will be definitely a trigger ... as always we appreciate your sage advice and we'll be talking to next week they care now than it used a show on\nOn Thursday November ... schemes we will be having a workshop in titled how to survive the coming stock market wreck and

Gregory the veterinarian the algae then twenty two years on science I was just about\nWhat we can turned her up for best and you can you get closer to the bone your little sloppy the good close but a lot better control ... yeah that that like you go ahead start over\nA lot first thank you for allowing us on the show were really about 'em but Gregory was the veterinarian\nAt your own practice for twenty two years during that time I was his bookkeeper and also keep her for another ... and we were big believers in Dave Ramsey and Scott burn that don't know if people know Scott aren't but he was a colleague that especially here in Dallas who talked about diversifying but within\nVery safe low cost fun\nAnd you'd be set for life that we followed both of those very strongly saving as much as we get every month\nSo that's where we were when Gregor realize that we were getting wherever we want it to ... that he could retire at a fairly young age\nSo Gregor what was it that boom there\nGums this idea out of nowhere this isn't working the way I thought it was when and where did that happen put me as a fly on the wall listening to what you were thinking and what you had to say to Bethany about that\nWell we you know been saving quite a bit more you know\nMore than you know the average average American and a searing all the financial planner saying you could you know live on three to four percent of it without outliving it and you know I've\nMade more is a veterinarian first second you're out of um within five years out of that school I was making more money than that and our our cost of living was higher and I didn't want to retire and have to you know skip and save and\nYou know not just ah you live live a good lifestyle uh now the\nAverage tired um I Would say our lifestyles actually improved are\nUh you know making more money in real estate now than I was able to and is that an array medicine and not having to worry about an alarm clock\nWhile that's great to be able to go back to you now tell us again I loved the fly in the wall concept was Gregory said to you when he first heard about lifestyles 'cause he wasn't that impressed a quarter of your resume here he just wasn't here rented\nWere was yet how did he finally change\nBecause I don't want him to tell the story because I Want to hear from the outside to see what you saw going on truly in his mind\nUm I was truly the skeptic about it more than he was on he actually heard about it for the boy scout friend\nOne of them is super involved in lifestyle and wanting to is that positive comes when he has money doing that otherwise it's not very active and both of them just talk to them actually probably ten minutes you know how you need to look into that you know the what's going on we love it\nThat Gregory was like great didn't follow it didn't get any\nThen he went to buy our TV died and he found three searches he found the perfect TV he wanted and it was like an hour away so it gets in the car turned on the radio like a Saturday morning\nAnd there is a radio show about lifestyle and he listens to it and then all of a sudden every time he's been the car he is trying to find lifestyles on the radio\nBut he's not really pushing it yeah so he's not really trying to convince me to do anything just gathering information which of the big cracker your research figure out what he's doing\nA guy and we really had sat down with a financial planner who said okay great I have to pay for money and you'll be fine and Congress like ah\nAn adult he pretty much tracked me almost kicking and screaming for that for that matter I Would what\nWere your thoughts are okay I get that we were all skeptical what did you think when you came there because you come in I Know how it is being skeptical I'm the same way you come in with your shield up\nYou're looking for cracks in the armor the enemy you want to end okay where is the scam and all this right what did you come away with after that free workshop which is really not really an educational thing is more of an overview what did you come away from that free workshop\nWell I was in ... ... if you went back I was in the idea

Dallas area who have are currently thirty eight apartment committed to invest it then they have actually purchased forty six so they are the three thousand southerners twenty nine units\nAnd they started out as skeptics out this is a great story because these are barely coming from highly compensated self employed business individuals\nHigh skill sets accounting background business background and they work their way into this thing and took off but not after some consternation trying to figure out if it was real or not so as we get back with him here as we went to break I asked them they went through the first road trip\nA together and multiple road trips that said they've been to every road trip since they've been there except for days when they had some other come up and like travel or the question I have to share with us as best you can how on\nUm how the the way\nOur members share how you feel about the way our members share their personal information their business information to business practices et cetera et cetera to the open public within our private group can you share that with us and tell us how you really feel about that\nWell\nPersonally I mean I honestly think that one at the very best thing about life on I've actually been on a\nTrip with league where they're looking at a property trying to decide if they're going to ... ... they're cognitively active and Barry [laughter] question so that if only looking at a different property and have a number in their hand or and I yeah in your hand or that are in their hand\nAnd most of the time I get a response to it and then here's the number you need money for what it costs me to have our parking lot because I Know the parking lots are about the same time\nUm I don't know where else you can get that kind of help from someone who is probably not even going to invest in this property they're just trying to help\nGregory what do you think of all that what do you think about the the openness financially and you know she used to talk to your business practice was well she just really talked about information how 'bout business practices and financial information that shared\nIt it it's pretty much an open book uh within the lifestyles family\nOr you can pretty much go up to anybody and ask them their experience um I've had that thing I've ever sit downs with other uh you know people highly compensated for saying what\nWe've done our did it why we did it\nUm and you know\nThere's really I can talk\nTalk more and ask more questions of the lifestyle members you know then I can with my next door neighbor and you know even more so well almost more probably more so than even I did with my parents when they were alive you know knowing their back or you know\nWhere they had their money invested in such and you know no no question Israeli taboo you know within the lifestyles are and ... it's great and the veterinary business or\nWe don't you know we don't share information as far as you know what are you paying on rent and how much you paying for this\nTest or the space of equipment\nAnd all that fair game and and within lifestyles in a is I actually encourage a you know people helped me out when I first started and now I'm you know passing it back and helping you know all the people that take their uh\nYou know very similar to to best and I and I'm now were you glad to help you know all those lifestyle members that we can\nAs members from looking inside out and remembering back when you were looking outside in\nWhat do you think creates the abundance mentality that the members of lifestyles have that there's enough for all of us where do you think that comes from\nBy the title is number of exactly what you fat and they're always deals going on there I always opportunity to ask if they fit in your lifestyle go\nSo there's no need for me to not tell you something because it may end up helping me again later gotcha\nSo let's talk now many changes topic oh go ahead Greg good morning ahead go ahead\nWell I think it it goes along well with the case studies you know you're not a member you come in and you see these families up talking numbers in and you know spilling their guts they're they're doing it just\nYou know because they're grateful that they were able to make this money on this deal um and I think it's just it sets the tone um you know that sort of what we do here and and you know and what's expected and\nAh I just I just know that\nI don't know how you say it you know I guess that's what I expected as a little harsh but uh it's just a friendly caring type
