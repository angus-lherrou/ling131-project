I don't know what to stock prices doing today over this Kaepernick deal and you know the backlash started just almost immediately\nAnd one what would you think they're sinking was\nWhen they decided to come up with that advertising or believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything and all that business what's your take on that\nUh well you know it it my my thought is largely muted uh in regards to business in particular stock prices Nike's up today but it's it's not much there are like point seven percent or that pales in comparison to selling pressure that they saw yesterday ah they were down more than three percent for most of the trading day\nUh it talks about how businesses and then if they do get\nA political in nature whether they believe maybe they weren't uh they they are and so when you make decisions like that there is a possibility you're going to suffer the consequences Nike is not the only company a that gets involved in these types of of situations\nRemember there was a very big merger that just while it was ruled in favor of Eighteen teen time Warner and their merger gets set apartment a justice but a lot of people believe that merger was very politicized ...\nDid not like CNN and he did not want to see the merger goes through\nThe judge ruled in favor of Eighteen teen time Warner said there's no case law that's preventing or or preventing this merger from happening and really slapped down the department of justice a in a very very one sided ruling and itch fearful among a lot of people that\nThe damage that happened in the ruling against the department of justice even though they're appealing to right now or the damage is done against the department of justice will ah restrict its ability to go after other mergers that maybe would be seen as\nMore of a a more of a risk to overall anti trust business matters\nSure you know I saw or several analysts said that that might Nike did that it sent a strong signal to their current roster of athletes and and positions Nike that's kind of a savvy risk taker is there's not a move that any company can make\nThe NYC for for a Nike it was definitely a a smart business move 'em you know you know namely who buys your shoes this to me you know I guess just about every minority kid in the country whereas Nike shoes missile vacillates and and he was obviously a risk but it was also by doing that I mean they were making a pronounced\nPolitical a political statement to themselves so\nThat'd be said as anyone else out there\nRight well in addition to the situations of forty with Nike and in addition to what we're seeing right\nNow uh with the uh the big tech companies coming to the hill Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia wants oil ... between Seventy and eighty dollars a

[noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back you know here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version bumps and for the fact\nThat there was a radio show today we're talking about what are you doing with your life right now I mean I'm\nYou know that the whole thing that should be here the last couple of days is that um about three weeks ago I stopped drinking or what the hospital for procedure came back out and now it's like man\nIf I don't drink or do I do I'll tell you what to do I get back on the horse and start thinking about life again because I was numbing myself out so I've been talking a first two segments about what are you doing to numb yourself out to come home at night and stopped caring about life\nPick those segments up if you just turn again go to the to\nThe website and get the podcast so I'm going to get off that talk and talk about another topic\nTo talk about what rich people do compared to poor and middle class people which are like I said the other day as well as his podcast it's guy said anybody who's middle class is really poor because all they think about is just basically getting by what can I earn what could I have what can I drive well can I live in\nYou know what kind of close kind of work what kind of watch do I have kind of this is just me me me me me and I which is basically starvation mode you know what what do I have and talk about the the poor middle class and the poor would just forget about I mean they're just completely lost\nBut the middle class people think that there somewhere\nAnd their idea is save a little pile of money\nThat rich people don't think about save a little pile of money rich people think completely differently than than poor and middle class people\nMiddle class people think about saving they think about structuring their consumption to be below what their income is\nWealthy people don't necessarily ways don't get me wrong many of them are frugal also but they don't focus on structuring\nTheir life to live below their means they focus their life on creating more income in rich or poor dad cows Psaki said it pretty interested in the well you said by poor dad\nOh see how did he say to go see if I get this correct quote here or at least close enough that resemble his statement but ... says his um his his for dad would say we can't afford that\nAnd his rich dad would say what do we need to do so that we can afford that that's a pretty clear explanation of the two different types of thinking and so wealthy people we go you know what I'd like to take our life up another notch let's go by another income producing asset\nLet's buy some more income\nPoor people instead say let's go buy some more debt let's go buy a car that we have the payment solved by house we have to pay payments on let's buy stuff on the credit cards we up he was so they're buying their debt is buying them payments\nAnd reducing the standard and quality of their life\nWhereas wealthy people are using their credit to go buy assets that are producing income and increasing the standard and the quality of their life no this is so blatantly different that if you're on the radio right now and you're listening to this or if you pick this up on a pop jazz later on guys\nYou've got to think to yourself which one of these ... by\n... by that guy that just thinks oh my God\nHow can I save enough money to maybe put some money aside how can I get by how can I create a pile recall Billy's college but we'll call it an emergency fund and we'll call it a retirement fund\nRich people do do that rich people don't have pockets buckets of money I have cash\nThirty right thirty million in cash that can be sped where I Need\nYou invest it to make the money I Need I don't have it in buckets it may be in\nProbably about thirty or forty different accounts because I've got it spread out so that there's insurance FDIC insurance on but the bottom line is it's there and it's waiting for the next big deal\nI don't want it there I wanted a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look I can take I'm going out by an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money\nAnd that money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually only two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest you go that's incredible I could live off that dress well go oh\nThat's terrible the rate of return on that investment is terrible now I go out and buy an apartment complex I met in the process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself cost me nine or ten million dollars\nWhich I'm not expecting you to understand who's just take the generals off of all this discussion\nAnd it will make me between nine hundred million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me it tax free income\nIn addition to that I mean it's about fifty thousand dollars a month in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Del Walmsley Radio Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "25"}
