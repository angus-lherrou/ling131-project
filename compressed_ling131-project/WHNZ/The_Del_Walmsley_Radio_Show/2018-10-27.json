topic I was okay who could do this topic and we put these classes together and in the classes you have to realize that most of the material they got into the classes because I decided that I wanted it there\nBut what was interesting is as I take these clashes man I really recommend you get off the couch get signed up get to these classes and take these classes\nIsn't that great man this is really really really good stuff even though I Know Ninety nine point nine percent of it and every once in a while I think I missed one question so far because it was kind of a trick question um\n[noise] is

didn't need to know type of question but I knew all five of 'em so I thought you needed all five of my mistake but the bottom line is is that\nJust materials are very very good now\nIf you're not going to take this material you should be taking some other kind of material I'm sitting up the nights before I decided to take this with my fiance I decided to set up and listen to motivational speakers\nAnd I sat there for hours just listening to motivational speaker what you realize that you're listening this podcast right now I haven't listened anybody for years because I've had

multimillionaire and I don't really see the number the number is the money as something I have to have\nI see it as a score card as what I'm doing what am I doing with my life and how much do I have to give back to society what do I have that I can go out there in place into the world and make it operate do something with it she I don't hoard my money if I go out to invest my money\nThen I'm going out there and making something happen in the world for other people and I think that's an important point\nHowever that's not the point that I'm trying to get to today for them trying to get to today is you're wasting your life away there's no way that there isn't only enough hours in the day to go to work\nCome home to eat\nAnd then to watch TV any amount of TV you're watching is almost guaranteed to be a complete waste of time\nNews is a complete waste of time you can go away from the news for two three four or five weeks at a time come back and you've missed nothing\nIt's absolutely the way it was when you went away\nEven if there is a disaster you come back they've solved the disaster was over there is nothing there what a waste of your time to consume hours and hours and hours of nonsense especially when it's politically minded like you have the right wing and the left wing type CNN and Fox News type stuff is just mind boggling stupid\nUm sitcoms about the dumbest thing in the world right now there's just there's nothing you can learn from them you know what I was a kid there was cartoons in cartoons actually taught you something you know\nNowadays you should

bed until one or two o'clock usually but\nI'm I'm ... found that I'm not capable of learning past about nine nine thirty ten o'clock I started getting tired\nAnd the stuff doesn't going as simply as it should [noise]\nBut think about how much learning you can accomplish and not only learning how much doing you could get done you see I don't have enough time to be successful I I'm busy no I don't even believe that a ... I just don't you're sitting on the couch a quiet desperation living in this life\nOf quiet desperation because you if he's elected to do that\nYou have decided it's no longer enough time to grow no

mission to retire America One for each other moms and for the fact\nThat there was a radio show today we're talking about what are you doing with your life right now I mean I'm\nYou know that the whole thing that should be here the last couple of days is that um about three weeks ago I stopped drinking or what the hospital for procedure came back out and now it's like man\nIf I don't drink or do I do I'll tell you what to do I get back on the horse and start thinking about life again because I was numbing myself out so I've been talking on the first two segments about what are you doing to dumb yourself out to come home at night and stopped caring about life\nPick those segments up if you just turn again go to the to\nThe website and get the podcast so I'm going to get off that topic to talk about another topic\nTo talk about what rich people do compared to poor middle class people which uh like I said the other day I was was his podcast it's guy said anybody who's middle class is really poor because all they think about is just basically getting by what can I earn what could I have what can I drive well can I live in\nYou know what kind of close kind of work what kind of watch do I have all kinds of this is just me me me me me and I which is basically starvation mode you know what what do I have and talk about the the poor middle class the poor would just forget about I mean they're just completely lost\nBut the middle class people think that there somewhere\nAnd their idea is save a little pile of money\nNow rich people don't think about save a little pile of money rich people think completely differently than than poor and middle class people\nMiddle class people think about saving they think about structuring their consumption to be below what their income is\nWealthy people don't necessarily waste don't get me wrong many of them were frugal also but they don't focus on structuring\nTheir life to live below their means they focus their life on creating more income in rich and poor dad cows Psaki said it pretty interested in the well you said my poor dad\nLet's see how did he say to go see if I get this correct quote here or at least close enough that resemble his statement but says his um his his poor dad would say we can't afford that\nAnd his rich dad would say what do we need to do so that we can afford that that's a pretty clear explanation of the two different types of thinking and so wealthy people we go you know what I'd like to take our life up another notch let's go by another income producing asset\nLet's buy some more income\nPoor people instead say let's go buy some more debt let's go buy a car that we have the payment solved by house we have to pay payments on looks by stuff on a credit card payments so they're buying their debt is buying them payments\nAnd reducing the standard and quality of their life whereas wealthy people are using their credit\nGo buy assets that are producing income and increasing the standard and the quality of their life no this is so blatantly different that if you're on the radio right now and you're listening to this or if you pick this up on a podcast later on guys you've got to think to yourself which one of these and my\nMind that guy that you think oh my God\nHow can I save enough money to maybe put some money aside how can I get by how can I create a pile recall Billy's college fund will call it an emergency fund and we'll call it a retirement fund\nRich people do do that rich people don't have pockets buckets of money I have cash\nThirty right thirty million in cash that can be spent where I Need to invest it to make the money I Need I don't have it in buckets it may be in\nProbably about thirty or forty different accounts because I've got it spread out so that there's insurance FDIC insurance on but the bottom line is it's there and it's waiting for the next\nBig deal I don't want it there I wanted a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look I can take I'm going out and buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money\nAnd that money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually only two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest you could tell that's incredible I could live off that the rest of all I go oh\nThat's terrible the rate of return on that investment is terrible now I go out by an apartment complex I met in the process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself costs me nine or ten million dollars\nWhich I'm not expecting you to understand is just take zeroes off of all this discussion\nAnd it will make me between nine hundred and a million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me it tax free income in addition to that I mean it's about fifty thousand dollars a month\nIn income if you look at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary er and celebrity type incomes and it makes up up up at about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around the fifty times
