Michael at this point in the program we are joined by our special guest Alfredo Ortiz and uh he is a gentleman of extraordinary accomplishments we are delighted to have been with us and ah Alfredo welcome to the Florida roundtable\nReagan thank you very much for having me appreciate it\nWhere uh I'll tell you what instead of me sitting here on rambling off your credentials and whatnot you ahead in and take a little time here on the front end of the show and and share your biographical notes with our audience\nSure sure absolutely happy to do so when Mike uh also I think it's got me on the show are afraid or teams I Am the president and CEO an organization called job creators network\nIt was an organization founded about seven years ago actually by a gentleman who we are no true has a very accomplished store it's called the Home Depot and the founder of his name as Bernie markets\nAnd uh he actually no small business ... well because he started the Home Depot in Atlanta with just two stores and now it's the major success that it is the day was about a hundred and twenty billion dollars in revenue whine about four hundred thousand hardworking Americans across the country\nAnd job creators network was really warm to be able to give small business owners the voice in the megaphone did they desperately need it over the past several years\nTo be able to really uh you know hit hit it hard in terms of the fight that they needed for years and able to support their business grow and unfortunately in the Obama administration small business owners were dying\nAnd Reagan and Mike I'm you know that small business owners are extremely important small businesses across the country but also in Florida in fact about there are about two point five million small businesses in Florida that employ Ninety nine point eight percent\nUm you know it's going to represent Nineteen Ninety eight percent of all Florida businesses\nAnd represents a over forty percent of the four to work for so uh we're fighting for a for the small business owners and their workforce across the country a and a really just real being able to you know hit that hit that ground with a message of how important small businesses are thirty million of small businesses across the country and points sixty million people\n[noise] so what was it during the Obama administration that you feel was really hurting small business\nYou know that's a great question we actually you know I was out on the road a you know ... small business owners just trying to get a sense of what was going on because I could sense that there was just such a low level\nOf optimism and we did a national survey of small business owners um and what we found three main things are really hurting small businesses are kicking them from succeeding\nAnd it was overregulation just way too much red tape\nOver taxation in fact in some cases fifty cents of every dollar was was was basically being paid back to the government um and then also the lack of access to capital a and and lines of credit primarily driven by Dodd Frank\nAdopt Frank as you may also know drove out about two thousand and community bank had closed because of it\nUm and mostly in rural areas and so our small business can eat it was really hurt by that and so those were the three main things and so three years ago\nWe started will call the brain small business back to where I'm going across the country talking about the importance of small businesses the thirty million I'm On small businesses Twain almost fifty six million hardworking Americans\nAnd really talking about that because nobody was really driving that point nobody has really talked about that important\nAnd so um so we did that three years ago uh last year we actually embark on what was called the ... now a tour which was really did try a the importance of a tax cuts for all businesses across the country and individual and then this year we have our tax cuts work dot com tor which\nIs really to try to be able to talk about the the successes of the better jobs back and really what it's doing for our economy for ... for all businesses whether you're small medium or large\nInto this country into the businesses here and so what we really have done now is we have level set\nAnd frankly made us an extremely competitive market for people to compete and operate in and I could tell you the people who are really bemoaning this tax cut in Ireland for example I'm telling you you look at some of the newspapers are they're very concerned\nWith what happened now with the U. S. because the benefits they use exist for them for for our U.S companies\nTo go overseas is no longer there so the jobs are staying here and ... that's why we're seeing this kind of optimism\nYeah I was going to ask you um well how would you specifically respond to the Democrats when they say you know all this does is benefit the core big corporations and the rich how would you respond specifically on how small business benefits from is\nWell you know what what what Mike I think what that shows really is just\nSo many of these folks so many things Democrats just have never actually run a business I used to own a small business myself I'm actually to small businesses one which had contractors in which has a direct employees and but they all had large\n... all my my biggest customers were large companies right and one thing I knew for sure when large companies said well\nI did well when they didn't do well I didn't do well\nUm if you remember there was that one of the lowest points really in our economy when things were really dragging all the Christmas parties were always canceled right\nAnd what would happen because there was no money to spend Christmas parties right every single dollar mattered and so the savings you know ... ... companies were cutting talk left and right well guess what gets impacted\nYou know the local deli down the street which used to supply that right which is a hater those those are different party and guess what the and the guys who were climbed the deli meats and the bread tried I mean now that ripples through the economy is so clear\nThe the only people really I've never run business make those kinds of statements because they know that when large companies do well\nMedium small does the well because those are their suppliers and in fact some of these companies have direct uh eat X basically within the within the companies to say we want to look for small business we want to look to minority on business as women do businesses right we want to do business with them so when they do well small business well\nHow do we have reached that point in time where we have to take a little bit of a pause along our network line\nWe want to remind folks that they are listening to the float around table a service motives talking entertainment networks I'm Regan Smith and Michael you have any harm or a special guest this days Alfredo Ortiz he's the president and CEO of the job creators network\nAnd we'll continue our conversation following these messages\nTo fly somewhere looking for cheap flights or cheap tickets and then call that tried to call\nThe low cost airline travel hotline now for places solo we can't publish them anywhere low cost airlines has all kinds of travel deals applied domestically and save up to

Florida and that's not to be taken lightly and oh freedom oh I Want to ask you would seems as though things are getting turned around and we've we've seen the uh low unemployment and business creations and record employment uh amongst them\nUh are minorities are among Latino is in the black population doing better than um possibly because they've ever seen and and these numbers have no lasted a while but I Want to talk about longevity you we seem to be on the right track here\nHow do you prove alone now how do we keep it going\nReagan I think that's a great question again I Want to hit again just one more time the importance small business because that's you know it's it's what I Do the right twenty four hours a day seven days a week and getting in Florida in Ninety nine point eight percent of off or to businesses are small business which is an amazing number thing but you mentioned is that\nOver forty percent of the state workforce\nAre ... are are are employed by small businesses are almost ... million small businesses that are minority oh\nI'm so against the importance of small business across the country again a block of thirty million hardworking Americans and about fifty six million employees are these small businesses are dependent\nOn the success of small business and so one of the things we want to make sure that we do we continue the ... small business that means that the type of cuts for example the twenty percent\nOf deduction right off the top for small businesses that was included in the accident jobs that we want to see more of that right we would love to see 'em a some of the definitions and we saw some recent definition come out that added some clarity to um the exclusions and inclusions of\nOf of what is is part of the twenty percent adoption we want to see more of that right you want to see more service industry has picked up they want to see a deeper cut we'd love to see a little bit of a bigger deduction on that\nUm to close that parity gap between a Sikh corps and that's of course you know the the larger companies small companies so we want to see more done for a small business because they are the backbone of our economy but outside of that we want to continue to promote the tax cut themselves that happened because we know that tax\nCuts work just like our tour is doing today in fact the kickoff yesterday the the second leg of that we're going to be going to about twenty six different states\nFifty two different stops between now and November excuse me between now and November talking about the importance of these tax cuts right because that is what's missing Reagan is these kinds of conversations the wheel kind of conversation\nThe real news in terms of what is happening is just completely missing in mainstream media news so we have to get the message out first and foremost that's one of the things that can help the longevity um but in terms of keeping a new these tax cuts permanent\nThat is something that we know that the house ways and Means Committee and other folks in Congress are working on right now as we speak to try to make sure that these tax cuts for main street small businesses and for individuals remain permanent unfortunately they couldn't do that last year because it was some of these budget rules arcane budget rules that they had a\nKind of you know stay true to 'em that limited some of that but this was always their plan right fate base one with laughter you're faced with this year and that's a tax cut jobs back\nKind of a to point out excuse me and so we want to make sure that we keep on pushing for that um and Reagan if I could take a couple of minutes of talk about the terrorists 'cause I Know there's been a lot of conversation of that\nI'm In a lot of people saying we're very concerned about the terrorists but you know we wrote actually an opinion editorial in the hill up in Washington DC to talk about\nTrump being actually indicated on terrorists because what he understands all too well he understands leverage\nAnd he understands that it's the biggest trading partner across the globe with every other country we actually as the United states of America has the leverage\nTo make sure that these trade deals are done correctly enter done for our best interests because that's what it's about right it is about America First and then this particular case ... a lot of these trade deals were on the books for for decades by democratic presidents Republican presidents\nUm it didn't they just weren't paying six and so what Trump has done business ration is they've taken a little bit of this great is a four point one percent GDP Growth\nRecord low unemployment rate waging a rising wages\nAnd they're taking a little bit of that just like any good business person or a president and CEO owner of a company is going to do they're going to take those good time and they're going to take the opportunity to reinvest back in their business and that what is President Trump is saying he's reinvest in back in this country by resetting these trade deals\nI mentioned a little bit of a an analogy here like breaking your uh you know breaking your arm for example right I think we've all been there have to reset it and sometimes when that reset you almost have to break it again so that stronger even going forward\nAnd I think that's what President Trump is done on these terrorists we're seeing how the ... came to the table with fixes 'em ... basically terrorists have been dropping both sides with the ... and in fact I Love highly negotiate the buying of soybeans were farmers are you know in in in you know hard working farmers to patriots who are standing behind President Trump on these terrorists\nHe had you buy with the Chinese were basically hitting us with terrorists so he he's really a fantastic business person is treated like a business and and I applaud them for for the types of effort that he's doing a try to reset these types of trade deals and that is going to keep us\nA growing in the long term\nSo what do you feel like maybe who's the number one bird and still on small businesses and if that's preventing them from growing in a more\nNow that's a great great question Mike one of the things and this is currently being picks as well as health care cost\nUm the Affordable CARE Act as as we all well known now that anything but that uh it remains unaffordable\nUm and it continues to actually have you know rising healthcare costs it was doomed to fail from day one because uh it it it was set up so that frankly more dollars are going to be paid off and we're going to be taken it and it's kinda like Vegas everybody probably has been to Vegas at least once I understand I have always happy when\nRight for stay in business insurance always has to bring in actually one dollar more than the pay that\nAnd the way the Obamacare was set up that wasn't the case it was the river so was it was destined to fail actually and so we have to control health care costs the president has taken two major initiatives uh one is to help", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Florida Roundtable", "city":
