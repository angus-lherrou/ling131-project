although the argument could be made that we we have done that you know uh the nuclear umbrella and all those kinds of things but\nIn tang alliances and and mishandled negotiations or the end of World War one was an absolute disaster right um\nYeah most historians or green I'm sure your water as well that it was a World War two absolutely\nA Woodrow Wilson was on his high horse I his head in the clouds a and his eat planted firmly ten feet above the earth ah he had his fourteen points he wanted his league of nations\nAnd I think the one of the greatest lines that came out of the Versailles negotiations at the end of World War one\nI'm David Lloyd George was there and Victoria Orlando Lloyd George was not a fan of Woodrow Wilson they did not particularly get along even though we were supposed to be the best of allies right and of course Woodrow Wilson to fourteen points most of them pretty ...\nDo you think about arms limitations and things of that nature but they the league of nations was his big deal and Lloyd George looked at Wilson's\nFourteen points the allies were not his optimistic all or\nWhat's the word I'm looking for they didn't have their head in the clouds like ... did they want in reparations and looking for the money Lloyd George\nSaid Woodrow Wilson has fourteen points by which we should run the world\nGod only had ten [laughter]\nYeah I remember that month is we'll see you know um\nAnd so you can look around today and the boots of everything we see going on in the these spell it didn't even know when they were redrawing the maps of the middle east

world which is tremendous honor and I'm just getting a lot of great reviews for the book really exciting\nWell and they are very well deserved and that is always a pleasure to have you with us Patrick I'm I how many years has it been I was I was having difficulty remembering since since you got started here\nMy first book was in I Believe two thousand and one or two thousand and you were\nLeave Ron I was on your show for valor yeah that was my first book which is an oral history of the rangers that airborne and are many ways it just kinda got my start by interviewing World War two veterans I interviewed over forty thousand and then you add in the Korean War veterans with what's called giving tomorrow\nOr the Pacific war there's the oh assess area hundreds of embedded within skies and opera despise us at the tourism and other great book the prayer assignment and they dared return [noise] so it's been a\nLifelong passion is to preserve American history and and these stories and infighting going to cover it kind of a toll history is the my specialty if you will or for today\nAnd the unknowns it's no different in that long line it's it's as I like to say the story found me and and that and that's that's the story found me um when I was in in France and I was giving a chore to the wounded warrior regiment of the marine corps\nAs we were touring Omaha Beach\nAnd in the other landing sites enormity is worth it at the airport drops elves and part of that too are also involved the great World War one battlefield at bell award where the marine corps stopped\nA major German drive and Paris so it was it was potentially or winning drive for for Germany but the marine corps and the second division along with some other Americans us all to that drive\nAnd it was there that are guide\nWho was my fellow guide sort of said oh by the way are estate dance and was the first medal of honor recipient for the marine corps and was also a body bearer for the two of the unknown soldier and I was immediately waitresses pick them what is a body bear and then secondly\nWhy did pushing select the individual who was the other men that were selected to be part of the unknown soldier and then as a dug into this thing\nTo the infantry um and then the navy this stories they're they're just intimate an incredible\nIsn't it true as well that you know that you're talking about the ATF there were some on the British and French side who wanted to split up the American troops and make them a part of their own divisions and met\nThe American AS and now we want to be a unified fighting forest and there was a little bit of a struggle there her first one when they're\nNot a little bit it was a constant struggled throughout the war and you know the unknowns is sort of a book within many books this book provides you with the really the underlying history of the American expeditionary force in France and the struggles that it had\nWhen when the um American expeditionary force was first stood up\nIt was the United states had the sixteen or Seventeen largest army in the world it was about two hundred and twenty thousand men that were in the regular armed forces [noise] we had to grow that over four million and that's an extraordinary story\nIn of itself and he had a modern fighting force\nI tell you what bad wreck we're I'm caught by the clock here we're gonna have to pause and along our line but hold that thought we'll let you come back and tell that story because it's a very important one\nBut at this point in time we must remind folks that they are listening

find bookstores Ramon in places like Amazon dot com and Patrick is always a great pleasure to have you with us\nOr as we came to the end of that last segment you were talking about uh the importance of the fight over keeping the American forces together the\nFrench one do you just catch them in a company level or or a little bit larger where they were needed in in general purging took the stance that\nNo no no no the Americans fight to gather and remain as an army and I want you to\nPick up that story and then continue with that [noise]\nGeneral Pershing was was given essentially two orders 'em by the secretary of war at the time and through the president itself the first order was to keep the American army together an independent and always fight independently [noise]\nUm and the other order was to come home\nAlive and uh you know healthy and um the the main the main order though was was to fight independently and create the army or the British and French\nWanted to take the um the American do boys [noise]\nAnd and basically put them into the depleted French and British Army and let them fight is is but in ... they would have been effectively cannon fodder and fought um you know with the same tactics is French\nEnglish ... casualties would have been absolutely enormous we wouldn't have really had any kind of political sway at the end of the war um have we done that and it's you know there's also question whether or not the war [noise] would have even been one\nIf if we're at that tactic was employed to ... great credit he um he navigate it's a very tricky um\nPolitical waters and diplomatic waters and was able to keep the the army largely intact in by the end of the war in the Meuse Argonne offensive for instance that the army was over a million strong in that sector alone it's really quite an achievement and you mentioned earlier about your grandfather\nWho was um\nWe went over and and you had his diary and you know he was from the New England area one of the stories in this book is is from the twenty sixth debate and\nAnd it involves a a a terrier dog named sergeant study [laughter] and he's one of the the supporting characters in this book which is I think quite an interesting story the mascot for\nFor one of the for one of the units and um you know fights in and around the trenches there's there's a little movie out on an animated movie now which I think it's quite good but\nThat that's there is a true story behind it and um you know the dog was quite a remarkable safes and people's lives was able to warn people look out gas attacks that were pending and are just quite one of the little one of the interesting stories within the doubts\nThat just really puts a a human face or not in this case but it it it it humanizes the war in a in a sense and it gives people an understanding of of what it was like\nAnother point that I think is very important and that is a new technology the early part of the twentieth century and but this is the war a that brings us ... gas and tanks and long range artillery\nAnd changed the face of the way wars fought [noise]\nUm it's this is the civil war on steroids it's a it's the changing face of battle from\nYou know if the tree of tactics where people marched in line in in large columns information and it's changed suddenly by the technology that's on the battlefield the machine gun friends it'll to\nAnnihilate you know small machine gun team to tick out hundreds thousands of individuals [noise] if it's properly places and there's a high explosive artillery shells in the gas which is just so deadly um [noise] I you know I\nIt's hard to imagine fighting in the trenches but then fighting wearing a gas mask for hours sleeping in this stuff was persistent it was constant and you had to be vigilant because if you\nDidn't have it on even for a couple of seconds you could you take your your life or a you know severely scar your lungs [noise] the um\nThere's different types of gas which I get into in the book there's mustard gas for instance which is Reece oily droplets that are [noise] it just gets under the skin and irritates\nUm everything uh and even you know forces you intend to take your mask off and he could get hit with another type of gas [noise] I'm extremely brutal and difficult\nTo fight in and I think that's one of the great stories in the book too is just how our that generation of do boys largely untrained um\nInnovated and and overcame and became defeated one of the greatest armies of the world at the time the German army and they did it with bad training at our improper training but they were able to figure it out on their own and uh\nWere incredible army by the time the war ended [noise]\nLoving you talk about a little bit in the book are some figures who would become major figures in play major roles in World War two including the likes of Marshall and hadn't talk a little bit about their roles in World War one which isn't as well known [noise]\nUh George Marshall an initially is just the lowly major but he has a brilliant mind and purchasing it relies upon George Marshall's we use primary planner for all the major battles during World War one and some of these things are just\nExtraordinary feats of logistics just moving a massive army over all these tiny tiny French roads that are not very well developed and they have to do
