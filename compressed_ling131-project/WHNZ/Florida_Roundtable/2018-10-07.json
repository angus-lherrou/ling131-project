nine six seven or even Texas a two three six eight oh\nHere's a good one here [laughter]\nIt says a time I'll pay anyone to come and pull up all my Florida Bethany and take it away for lunch [laughter]\nUh this is a noxious weed in my book and the you know it is it can be very heavily of spreading throughout the various areas and landscapes especially guns filtered son type areas but as bill said you're bringing home he tried to grow and you can\nUh so that's the case with a lot of these wild flower type plants\nOr not or text message here or they didn't leave their address or anything so I had no idea where they are so don't write me for that one\nUh but uh see I have unusually heavy free drop on my mature naval citrus trees of course a lot of orange or yellow in early and dropping\nThis time they're going to drop if you're going to do it and the other thing is if the tree has greening you know we all know about greening we haven't heard that much about it lately I guess maybe we haven't made any new finder discoveries or whatever\nOr my guess is some resistance varieties will be coming shortly or what are some time to save the industry I don't know but anyway uh if the tree has greening\nEarly fruit drop is you know part of the symptoms of the disease\nBut otherwise needles are known for dropping or fruit so if the if the fruit are dropping just make sure you keep the moisture if we go through a little dry time we we went through a whole week without adequate moisture\nProbably for a lot of these I Know uh the flowers up front the water had been turned off in our community there ...\nOr so make sure that your ... of a fruit trees have adequate moisture which means ordering once or twice a week but neighbors will do this it's an old record enables that they will go ahead and start dropping some of their fruit I thought the\nYou go through and I could do a couple of things but let me do this year a new one yeah let me give you some of the things that we can plan at this time of year I don't often do that or have time to go through the list but if you're interested in vegetables for instance\nNow is the time we're in October ... temperatures are moderating a little bit like Brian said they're they're they're cool down a little bit Seventy one in our house this morning I'm sure as you go further up the state probably even gotten cooler\nUh but anyway uh some of the crops that we can start least sowing seeds from getting transplants will be things like broccoli and cabbage\nCauliflower and collards all those can be seated and produce a transplant you know transplant for weeks ready for the garden\nBut other crops that people will start now gardeners will start now will be things like beats and carrots or if you want to grow salary I I think it's a waste of time but if you want the experience growing so or you can do that\nA lettuce can be planted now a it may be a little warm for it but it might make it a mustard of course I Will be starting my onion seeds very soon are just so we can have a uh the transplants which I Need and about November to the end of November\nAnd also peace can be put in if you have potatoes this brand new could do that radishes a rutabagas are spinning age\nOf ... time to get the strawberry planting ready I'm sure it will talk about that next week fact I'll ask him to talk about strawberry planting\nA Swiss chard and turnips those to be some of the uh vegetables that we can mean growing actually when you start looking at this list of vegetables they're more vegetables to plan at this time of the year than any other time the cool season is a time for your great vegetable crops\nYeah tomatoes and peppers or be finishing up a but if you got them in when we asked you to starting in mid August going through\nA early September and you'll be getting a crop of those the same time you'll be harvesting some of the cool season crops that you can have both\nOkay how about the flowers at this time a lots of flowers can be grown I'm angel owner you can still be put in ... you can start with\nA black eyed Susan's a ... a lot of people don't know ... which is the uh a pot marigolds are the reason I called that is because in in England I guess they use to pile up uh uh the plants and bring them in the ... the kind of looks like marigolds a little bit\nUm ... could still be put out giant this will go into the cool season planning now Diane says dusty Miller\nA geraniums will be starting to appear so you could start planting some of those are so you're highly hawk seeds if you have a variety that will do well in Florida\nA pen to still be planted that will go into the fall to gets real cold and you'll start seeing some of the two news out there and maybe a few snap dragons towards the end of the month\nWe can still plant sunflowers and I'm just going through my list dear sweet peas if you'd like to grow some of them do you can do that\nAnd uh also was in use can go in a ... at that time okay let's see uh what we'll do is whole gym over uh maybe I'll take a during the break a because we're not going to have time to do the deal with his question at this time um and the one\nThing you'll find missing from my flower list\nHappens to be ... I have a suggestion wait till the very end of the month or even November thank you for joining us for this hour better lawns and gardens we appreciate you being with us [noise]\nOur number two last fall behind joins us to be talking about we control I was wondering if he considers heating the weeds as a way of controlling them that could be possible I guess I mean if you start eating we started eating all the men make it sound like Bill saying they're going to disappear from the landscape\nUh also dollar we'd only when the animal if you want [laughter]\nI Know some of the things I Want to be you know have a pretty good just clean them off or they don't clean your seat was saying\nWe'll be right back for our number two this has been ... comment extension agent Amir is with the University of Florida Florida's talk and entertainment that were\nOn Capitol Hill\nOn our ... our radio [noise] download it now [noise]\nOr they surveyed people late term to be\nPolitical insiders on our coming election and you and I have shared some thoughts on this but it's an interesting article and uh they may they may be right they may come away with egg on their face but I thought I Would share or some of the thoughts of these\nInsiders quote unquote we'll talk more about that in the minute or the Tampa Bay times did a survey of Florida political insiders and they are predicting November victories\nOr Andrew Gillum and Rick Scott\nThat really is a interesting ticket splitting yeah man or a combination there that them too I I mean almost find that hard to believe\nHim while I Do I Do I agree with you or as I say it's the Tampa Bay times and they say that they talk to more than one hundred\nPolitical operatives money race series activists political scientists and that they were deliberate including Republicans Democrats and independents now all these people that they surveyed two thirds of them\nThink that Andrew Gillum will defeat Ron descent as governor and I I find that interesting in the light of last Mason Dixon poll came out that showed Gillum only one point a head of this and there's a virtual tie well within the differences you know\nSome people think that is because of what is being called ... Kavanaugh effect ... about the whole business with Kavanaugh on the Democrats attacking him so forth is actually energize the Republicans you know to go out and vote not the Democrats\nAnd I wonder I keep looking for this far left socialist kind of thing and I don't know I I'm not sure that I've seen heavy emphasis on that yet there's no\nThere's been a couple of ads put out there now by Republicans but Rhonda scientists himself hasn't been out there\nYeah as much as kind of thing yeah you would think there'd be more or less well All right so that's that's the insiders as saying that now more than half of those same insiders believe the Governor Scott is going to unseat US Senator Bill Nelson\nInteresting they think that these advertising a business and I guess parents working for\nThem I Will say this the last debate between Nelson and Scott they both were terrible and I are all adults I Iranians God is not a good debater\nNot well neither one of ... yeah you know ration they don't [noise]\nWell the same insiders are also making some other forecast they forecast the election of Republican actually moody for attorney general okay I can see that they think the Democrat Nikki Fried is going to become the agriculture commissioner I don't know who she is running against the goods to a strong successor to Adam ... them\nAnd they also predicted Republican Jimmy patrolling this will become the chief financial officer of\nThe state of Florida right now and go wow All right well we'll meet back here in a month and see how they the that\nOf course our guest today Andy gosh a financial wizard and we we love this guy um but I have a story here um you know banks and he's going to talk about them banks are starting to offer services real virtual\nAssistance like Amazon an echo Amazon\nYou know those well it backfires when you ask Alexa or your account balance and she just dodge laughing [laughter]\n... will have to ask Andy ... meal or science I'm Reagan's man I'm Michael you happy to float around table continues following these messages\nHere's a special message for those who already IRS at least ten thousand or more in back taxes the IRS has special programs in place it good eliminate or reduce your tax dead by thousands of dollars\nCalled a federal tax management help line that has been set up for you eight hundred two six seven Thirteen forty four stop the wage garnishment celebrities and tax liens now\nOnce you've qualified and enroll the IRS will stop all the collection activities against you these unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce or eliminate your tax burden the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable programs\nYou may qualify for substantial savings so get the help you need if you owe more than ten thousand in taxes call for free information and\nTo see if you qualify take down the number now where the federal tax management hotline eight hundred and two six seven Thirteen forty four that's eight hundred two six seven Thirteen forty four eight hundred two six seven Thirteen fourteen fold euro inspections\n[noise] we are back you're listening to the voter round table a service to load is talking entertainment which\nI'm Regan Smith now Michael ... Michael as promised at this\nTime of the program we are joined by Andrew cause he's a gentleman who has been here several times before\nAndy is one of the most respected monetary historians and contemporary experts on the American and international banking system if you heard him before you know\nHe has a tremendous understanding about monetary and our economic systems and Andy welcome back against a delight to have you back on the float around tables there\nOh thank you so much for having me\nFor those of you who may not have heard you on our show before or maybe just take a moment and ensure a little bit of your background and and how you arrived where you're at today for those who aren't familiar with your work\nOkay so I'm basically a coin collector started when I was eight years old and I looked at the differences between American coins\nAnd found some pretty startling difference is quite frankly I I grew up in that time when we took the silver out of our coins we closed the gold window eliminated silver certificate for the United states notes\nSo it was a very interesting time in monetary history and I pulled on that string and actually I'm spent a lifetime really studying our monetary system in various monetary systems around the world uh I've written a couple of books the secret world of money in Nineteen Ninety six\nAnd then I'll go Sam cooks the books in two thousand two ah I'm working on another one right now I'm titled the monetary history of the United states\nAnd uh I I'm the president of STO movements Maddox we buy and sell American gold coins in silver coin so if you have any old coin Jim I was so I'm certainly your guy because they don't make 'em any more [laughter]\nWell we're we're so pleased to have you with they send you your observations are always well thought out in well expressed and\nI guess I Want to start with um any it is hard to believe that we're approaching a halfway point of Mr Trump's more years of office here and the first war level with some people say yeah there's going to be eight and we don't know that for sure [noise]\nUm but it's hard to believe it's been almost two years already and a two\nYears of fighting are\nSaying well I I Would be interested in your assessment of course a big chunk of his campaign and getting in there was the economy and straightening out so from your standpoint how are we doing\nAbout just what we were supposed to do you know as I've said many times longer for Mr Trump was elected you know for the first hundred and fifty hundred Seventy years of the nation we've financed our entire federal governments operations without an income tax\nIn income tax started a curiously or this week\nIn Nineteen Thirteen president Woodrow Wilson signed the income tax bill and we were charged one percent\nQuickly you see what happens in very short order or we've driven the tax rate up toward a third to half for most folks paycheck goes just for taxes\nSo the miracle worker as been forced to bear the cost of the enormous government that we have um and this terror is finally a turn back to what our for our founders intended\nIn stead of America's spending hours upon hours drive\nAlong the lines of the infrastructure that actually expands do more than just highway but I ... in general public works programs would would you advocate that kind of an involvement again\nI Would indeed yeah and I think most Americans understand or ... that there is no free lunch you know somebody has to pay and so who pays I think is the question or a great many folks expect that you know this magic money tree just drops money and then we build roads and and so forth\nFicre you're more a businessman type of a look at rebuilding water systems and the delivery of infrastructure in rural areas we did that with telephones and I'll do it with high speed Internet and things of that nature\nSo it's not just roads and bridges for sure uh every structure includes\nThe new five G network or the high speed as I mentioned trains that would really uh eliminates them congestion on the highways so there are plans that aren't just bridges bridges and roads and I and I think many of those will be looked at as well\nAnywhere rapidly approaching our a mandatory first break here but I Know you have various Web sites in ways that folks can get a hold of you to find out more information of the things they're hearing on this show\nSure well we haven't really talked about those yet the the organic money and such but I I Do have a great body of work available just to read

networks I'm Reagan Smith on Michael ...\nAgainst this day is Andrew ... is the onset he is one of the nation's most respected monetary historians and expert on our economy in international banking and\nAndy is always a pleasure to be with us as we went in to that last break we were talking about locations that people can go to to read your printed material you've got books out there you've got some CDs\nAnd so go ahead and tell folks how these things can be found\nShort a ... a U. S. C. dot com if you want to read economic stuff\nUm most of my readers and listeners suggests that hearing is better and easier so uh the three CDs that I mentioned are are different ways of\nThe Federal Reserve which we didn't we haven't talked about yet but he is a very critical component of this economy uh the definition of money what the heck is a dollar if we don't know that it's hard to just can't do anything else and then the third protecting your wealth\nThese are three most popular CDs that part of the package of books that I felt but I'll give them free to Florida roundtable listeners if you already mentioned that you heard it either\nA Reagan Smith or my ... my ... just four to round table that'll work mentioned that\nAnd we'll send them to get absolutely free but you just call or eight hundred number eight hundred four six eight to fix for six or go on line if that's your thing to a Andy Garcia Ga us the dot com\nAnd in in what's talking about the Federal Reserve than the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates very slowly um to kind of make sure we don't have inflation even though we really haven't had a problem with inflation so far what do you think about the Federal Reserve doing this now\nWell there are three components to inflation right and the first one is an increase in the broad money supply now that is one thing President Obama gave us our I think we had some\nTwenty trillion dollars in various forms to the economy when a President Obama was in office so rather than fix any problems that exist let's just create more money\nAnd throw it at the problem and and do you have to think of that in terms of you ordered a pizza and there's more people than there are slices so you make the slices smaller\nPeople aren't as full perhaps but at least everybody gets a slice and that and that's the way that they've handled the economic crisis up until now so we increase the broad money's\nGet we didn't have enough jobs for the folks that were working so that's really the second part of the equation what they call resource slack a we were getting killed and trade department people were foreign companies and countries were dumping they're good they're\nAmerican manufacturers in American labor and making it virtually impossible to have wages rising and keeping American manufacturers American business on the hedge all the time\nThat this of course is being take it up as we've all heard or should have hurt unemployment is at a record low and factories are humming along and and companies are building new factories so this I mean seven hundred billion dollars just in the steel industry alone on the back of his um\nTariffs on foreign imported steel so these policies have taken out the resource slack\nSo factories running at full speed and people are fully employed so that means eight on to get a higher wage time to build another factory right that resource lack of it in the third and I think one that\nI Can't even believe the statistics I look at monetary velocity Americans have been so frightened by the crisis of two thousand eight\nBut they have not kept their moving it's just when President Obama was in office for example as fast as Americans would earn a dollar they would take it out of circulation and put it away they would not spend\nAnd so monetary velocity fell to eight fifty year low like one point two five times a dollar would turn over\nAnd it's all based on consumer confidence if you don't think the future too bright and you're going to squirrels your money away and that's what folks dead in\nFact during the period that President Obama was president in our national savings in total or you measure that and money with a zero maturity this is a Federal Reserve measurement money that we put in the bank and have no plans to invest no plans to spend went from seven trillion dollars in two thousand seven\nTo nearly Fifteen trillion dollars when President Trump took office so doubled and that money not being working and moving of course there's no inflation when that happens this of course all is turned on its head\nOr when you fix the three components of inflation venue you're going to see in place and so I think the Federal Reserve is moving in the correct direction or by raising rates so to try to\nFend off some of the speculative activity companies buying their own stock with borrowed money speculators buying their own or buying stocks and bonds with borrowed money this of course is slowly coming to an end as the Federal Reserve drives these folks out of the market with higher interest rates\nAnd additionally America's savers which is a bunch of you in Florida who are retired and have a fixed amount of money it's very hard to live on a two percent or one percent return\nWe need to get back to where what we call a the lean in terms of interest rates if you look at it over forty years or fifty years\nYou should be hurting four or five maybe six percent on your on your savings so these two factors combined I think I'm the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and the economy coming back to full swing will be good not only for America's earners but America's savers as well\nI Want to go back to the Federal Reserve is well always been one of my favorite topics and then the newest one of yours but President Trump provided that as a change in leadership I had the Federal Reserve because one of the big towns of ... talked about over the years\nIs this a lot to the ... the Federal Reserve has do any money but I mean just you know and when we come back to that but I'm interested in your assessment of the new chairman of of this and then I think that's going in and he will not work out well for us in the long run", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Florida
