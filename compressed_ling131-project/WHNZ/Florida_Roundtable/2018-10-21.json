know I've never heard of any problem of doing that uh uh the uh the red tide is actually a plant itself and so once it's in the soil it's going to break down just like the fish is going to break down you know the old story about squat\nThough don't you get your [laughter] every year as\nDoes the first extension agent by the way is Native American\nAnd he talks with that on a yes or a chord me the

Simpsons stopped there that might work also again good take some ... some guidance on them that's not good enough for them there thanks for joining us for this hour about the lawns and gardens and\nCome back just as another edition of the Ford\nAlone civil service for to toss\nAn entertainment networks Michael yeah see filling in for re Smith was fixed this week but he will be back next week we have a really\nInteresting show for you today I'm going to be interviewing Jim challenger who is with the save my constitution coalition said my constitution coalition is an organization at the grassroots organization\nThat was founded specifically to be against to speak out against the CRC\nOrdered the CRC the CRC is the constitution or vision commission and yes the debt commission that meet every Twenty years what they do is they propose amendments to the for the constitution every Twenty years and those amendments\nProposals will be on the ballot next month for during the mid term elections and he is going to make the case that the process that the CRC goes through to come up with these amendment is corrupt and he's actually going strong we make the case because he has in the past\nThat the CRC should be abolished and that all four to voters should vote no on all of those amendments proposed by the CRC this year vote no on uh even if you like some of what they're saying some of those amendments he suggesting that what you should do is vote no on all of them\nAnd I had to say personally this is something that I can agree with that I can definitely tune into because I've been against all these amendments on the for the constitution every year usually I vote no on all of them\nNow most of them are not proposed by this commission and he's calling to abolish their proposed to by other means every year\nBut so many times when I read through these ... amendments on the for the constitution\nI think to myself aren't the things that should be left up to the legislature we're not a direct democracy in my opinion it is not the job before the voters to vote on specific things\nLike what we see in these amendments this year that's why we are representative for public even Florida is\nWhere we vote representatives to take care of these things I mean a lot of these amendments in general do get voted for him passed\nOn the ballot and then it'll show up on the ballot next time to get rid of the previous amendment because the for the legislature realizes they can't do it\nIt's just kind of mess that just really doesn't belong on the Ford about in my opinion but this year it's especially bad because of what the CRC is doing I mean just look at one of the amendment to the CRC is proposing and that will show up on your ballot this year\nThis is amendment nine it says the water's mostly the water's most immediately adjacent to Florida's coastline are in state control then become federal jurisdiction further offshore\nJust a member pertains justice state controlled water prohibiting oil and gas drilling for exploration or extraction in offshore areas so basically amendment mind the first part of a member of mine has a banning on drilling for oil or natural gas or other things off of Florida's coast\nOkay a lot of you might support that but there's a second part to this amendment that you probably should know about the second part of the amendment prohibits the indoor use of e cigarettes and vaping devices\nHow those two related how can you have in the same amendment a ban on offshore drilling and then a ban on each cigarette smoking them inside the obviously not related at all\nBut this is just one example of what the CRC put on a Ford about this year proposed amendments\nIt's ridiculous obviously there is something wrong with the process of the CRC at how all of this work if these are the kind of a man that you're going to be voting on that's just one example there are other examples of these amendments be bundled up together and they said the reason they did this would make it easier\nSeems like it's going to make it even more confusing and I have a feeling I'm going to be waiting in line for a while while I'm voting\nBecause frankly everyone's going to be confused going through all these amendments the winds are going to be pretty long in Florida\nIt seems like so we're going to be talking with the gym calendar from ... to save my constitution coalition he's very passionate about this subject as well he has a lot of interesting things to say on that matters or we're going to get to that next year we're listening to\nThe Fort around tables services for to talk of an entertainment network the interview coming up in a moment\nFears important new information from the diabetes solutions Center for

for Reagan Smith who was out sick this week but he should be back next week I appreciate you all joining us today and today I Am talking with a very special deaths\nWho is with the steam my constitution coalition\nHe he's a member of that coalition his name is Jim\nCalendar and he's going to tell us a little bit about the saved my constitution coalition which is against the constitution were vision commission which proposes amendment on the ballot every Twenty years so Jemma welcome\nTo the show today banks like once a day or so before we get into the details of the amendment to end the details of the constitution revision commission I wanted to give you an opportunity to ah see a little bit about yourself and also how you got involved personally with the save my constitution coalition\nSure ah like I Am a former legislator from the shock of Florida area [noise] um I was a member of the four house representatives and um\nHe'll be in a former member of always interested in what's going on politically around the state and uh we'll see our she or engage a last year early last year you know as kind of watching\nA process or with a lot of interest and a lot of things that uh we're very concerning um but kinda figured while the end of the day they're probably going to go ahead and put or some some proposals that are are meaningful\nUm but in that process you know I've been engaging in talking with my fellow former legislative friends and\nAsked level I have you know if you've been watching this process and I may as well I've been watching and a half of the St faucet I did and uh again just very disappointed with the performance of Shearer see\nA and the way they were I guess I Would say the ... and uh so we just kind of started talking and spreading the word of mouth for her amongst formed a legislators and uh we came to that a decision to go ahead and form a coalition and a two to speak up against the work of the CRC\nUm yeah we kind of feel is former legislators you know we still have a we feel duty and obligation to get engaged and uh we feel it's only fair we try to inform a Ford is voters of what's going on and encourage\nThem to vote no on on these are proposed amendments talk a little bit about\nHum the constitution revision commission as you mentioned it to ... proposes ballots are amendments on the floor in about two would be for the for the constitution\nTalk a little bit about what the exact we do the history behind that and then why your organization or coalition has a problem with it\n[noise] okay um well it and just to you know keep keep from twisting our tongues ... I guess we'll just call it the CRC the constitution rubbish commission\nUm you know so they need every Twenty years um we had a a new I guess I feel quote new constitution was an act and back in Nineteen sixty eight\nA and in that new constitution they created a the CRC which meets every Twenty years or to basically review our constitution\nAnd I propose any changes but you know to to be clear on that you know the language in the for the constitution\n... you know like as we are again as we observe this process you know as as former legislators\nYou know we've been intimately involved and the legislative process um we we see politics or for what it is or were quite aware of the methods used for men to our constitution um\nYou know as so as we ... we saw all the machinations going on with the C R C um you know we we saw some serious problems we saw\nA lot and I think most lawyers are quite aware of the bundling that has gone on um there there's a lot of uh tactics are deployed within these environments that are just saving 'em\nAnd the ... put there to try to entice voters to vote or something that may be more controversial but there's other issues that they look out and go wow this this may be a good idea\nUm so so yeah we're we're saying vote no on all of them um the the process was flawed as a result of proposed amendments are are flawed\nAh they're politically charged and motivated I'm as and the voters are are merely ponds are in this political game of the CRC\nAnd a as a result you know we don't think that's fair for voters to be you know kind of pulled into that and so we're encouraging hauled voters to reject all those amendments are six or ... you know the\nThe sarin and don't mean to cut you off but we are just short on time we're going to get more than ... insects hold that thought were talking to Jim challenger who is with the state constitution coalition says Michael you happy with the Ford around the table and we will be right back

of the word around people here on foreign policy and human network I Am Michael yeah the filling in for Reagan\nSmith who was out sick this week he should be back next week and this week I'm Talking with Jim Cameron jerk who is with the save my constitution coalition and see my constitution coalition\nIs an organization that is specifically against the CRC which is for this constitution reveals ...\nCommission and actually advocating to vote no on all the amendments propose to buy the CRC and Jim challenger a joins me right now so Jim ... before the break I was talking with you and I asked you specifically\nWhat should voters do when they see these amendments on the ballot specifically by the CRC\nAnd you were pointing out that you actually think they should just vote no on all of those amendments and the purpose\nOf why do you think\nWhy are you calling for them to vote no on all of them\nSure like you know especially the CRC\nIs and I'm just going to say this I'm On on on the body of lobbyists ... with no accountability no checks and balances are in this group is attempting to amend the constitution was politically charged proposals\nThat for most part don't even belong in our constitution and really ought to be handled through the legislative process or the screwed a conductor services under the heavy influence a special interest groups um and as a result but put forth a multitude of confusing\nOr we say intentionally misleading as really a suspiciously bundled them that much uh in an attempt to gain our support our votes or for their hidden agenda\nSo really because of this\nWhat we call list chef of the city or see again is former legislators to you know feel a sense of duty and obligation to get involved and you know try to you know if we can educate the people Florida\nAh of what's going on you know surely warn them about you know with the ... up to encourage them to vote no on all share seeing them as a sixth or Thirteen\nYou know we cannot one cannot really reasonably nor respectfully look at the ... proposal simply because of the\nUh I'll say deceitful way that it was conceived I'm so really matter how good some of these may sound there's a hidden objective behind them and uh we shouldn't be subject to these political games and as a result we're we're saying voting on all\nYeah it sounds like what you're saying there is that you're basically telling people even if you agree with some of the wording in these amendments the process is so ... that they should vote no anyway\nYeah because we really don't know what I mean we we reached shopping yeah lady it sounds good\nBut you know what's the real intention of that I'm at and you know it's hard to you know fear that all wow if it was through the legislative process you know trust me you know through that through that those the base of deliberation the stuff comes out but in this\nProcess or their Shearer see you know basically they have the dog and pony show when people got to [noise] you know stand before the group and\nYou know make their the phrase the Haitian but you know after that meeting everybody was behind closed doors and came up with all these proposals that we see are seriously flawed 'em and you know like if you\n... and most voters won't do this you know you you go to get your ... if you look at the summary and they go off as a good idea which is a bad idea but you know if you looked at all the real language behind all the stuff you'd be\nProbably not only ... percent but he'll be surprised to find that you know there is a one or two sentence summary but they're going to be you know ten Fifteen twenty pages\nOf legally behind each one of these I'm not sure who yeah if you go to the port in part to stay on their website you know they have the proposed constitutional amendments\nAnd you can see the full tux and ah it's just not one or two\nYou're such as long as there's many many pages long\nUm but again you know most voters will take time to look at all that stuff and because of that and you know the Shearer see they they know that they feel they can kind of pull ... over the voters and uh and so we should we should not be caught\nYou know in this game so we're encouraging a no vote on all their proposed amendments\nWow I just I mean looking at the amendment some of the wording in the summaries that are going to be on the ballot are confusing in into the cell that can only imagine how confusing\nThey will be to look at the whole twenty page and it's like you said behind the amendment on all the legal ease on my arm already thinking that people are going to be standing in line for a long time because there may wing for people reading through all these amendments\nYou know what's really interesting is uh\nYou know one of the ... members was asked you know about the bumbling water they bundled all these ideas and really unrelated ideas and ...\nAnd the answer was well to make it easy for voters to save time um I I don't think that makes it easy for voted I think it may so extremely hard I'm not saying that but yeah what these multiple issues um\nAnd so we're kind of saying well let's make it real easy\nUnless honestly make really easy and so what we're saying our group is go to all of them as six through thirteenth voting on all of them and that's easy\nYou know you talked about bundling so many amendments I'm just looking over some of the amendments right now amendments fix the first part of that says expand the scope of victims rights under before the constitution\nAnd then the second part of it says raised the mandatory retirement age for the judges including Supreme Court justices from Seventy Seventy five and I can imagine the average voter will read that anyone will read that and will say well what does one have to do with the other they're totally not related to how can I vote for this\n[laughter] yeah and I'm like I'll give you an example a limited number of town\nWhich has very and and I are in that particular environment at her country controversial issue that deals with colleagues um but you know they put in there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Florida Roundtable", "city": "Tampa",
