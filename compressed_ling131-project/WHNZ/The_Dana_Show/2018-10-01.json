to get through on the phone it's usually a ... week than it is on Saturday is here\nAnd today what we're going to be covering it will be discussing the thyroid and we'll get into some of the issues that are really important in women's health including menopause PMS\nAnd breast and uterine health and some of the options that are available to you things that are being done around the world so first of all\nWhen we talk about the ... what is the job of the road well it's to regulate oxygen uptake of every cell in your body so it's a really important player\nAnd it desperately needs iodine and Tigris scene and we'll talk a little bit about each of these the iodine is a big deal we have many sections of our country where there's very little iodine\nAnd some people joke that it's called the ... belt because the thyroid may in large when it doesn't have adequate iodine or I don't find anything funny in that and uh when we see what's been done worldwide we realized that\nThat that rate is very very important and many many women as they get older and some men find that they're low inside rocks and an actually take some sort of a drug to support\nThe rocks in production and this issue we particularly uh doing a lot of testing feel that there's more to know their than\nThan we're currently using to help people first of all I Would recommend that all of you or if you're not eating any see vegetables\nThat you begin to take some CSI no ax is is a guy is a concentrated received vegetables\nThat delivers a three hundred micrograms is so per capsule\nAnd maybe taking three of those uh day she get about ... milligram\nThis is very consistent with the discoveries in Japan about the overall health of the body are both for the thyroid and then for the rest of the uterus so you ladies you may want to do a little homework on this because\nUh having a food source I had done which we find\nFar superior to ... solution or I overall the synthetic forms of iodine which will meet\nThe needs of the SAT read but uh in our testing is concerned that they may not meet the needs of the rats in the uterus and so you may be setting the stage for trouble later on\nSo I think one of the great discoveries of quantum reflex analysis Q. R A has been the fact that energetically the parents that road controls the thyroid so many times when we just had I had to hunt it's not enough or they still don't see\nA wonderful healthy structure and function for the thyroid gland and what we have found is supporting the parents that red and many times then\nThe steroid can use the iodine\nAnd achieve an ideal structure and function so what would we do to support that maybe one or two medical around ... per day early in the day like breakfast and lunch\nThat may be just the ticket so that you can use iodine effectively and solve that issue now there's one more pesky problems that\nTo the road and that is when you ladies become iron anemic and are now you may have compromise and the ability to produce\nTerrorist scene which is made from iron and ... and if this happens then this may be a problem for the thyroid cause it needs the terrorists in just like your adrenal glands\nSo you're going to feel kind of beat what I Would recommend in a circumstance like that is to take two grams of show or a day of the terrorist scene and use it until you and your doctor have resolved any kind of iron anemia that you may be dealing with\nAnd now the SAT read support this guy is designed to help the body\nAllow you to target other agents at\nThe at the reading of course you know ... the workhorse the guy that make sure that from childhood through to your elder years you have adequate iodine in the food source so\nDefinitely want to jump on that so today I Will have on special or as you know X and our ... support\nThe green tea PG ... just give a bus driver would align eight hundred three Seventy\nFor forty seven it's eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven and we're going to talk more about this a little bit but let's go to the phones first let's go to\nMary in Long Beach California and her daughter had her gall bladder out a couple of years ago and now is struggling with weight especially at her abdomen and got of course that's quite normal\n... are you there Mary I am and how You're welcome how old is your daughter\nIs twenty eight when she had an allergy ... ten thirty one year and a half ago and started showing up five eleven hundred and fifty pounds and as always had a flat stomach and suddenly she's\nFolding el ... and ... of course\nThe reason is that the gall bladder its job is to hold bio and then when you eat fat is fat in the mail it'll squirt the bio from the gall bladder\nInto the small intestine to him most if I the fat so they can be absorbed in the small intestine\nFor energy and he repairs throughout the body now the ... also used to precipitate access cholesterol and of course to get rid of all the toxins that deliver has removed from your food and they're getting to be legion these days\nSo now what happens when they take the gall bladder is they reconnect the ...\nTo the common bond out and those veins then we'll just dump the bio into the small intestine whenever the Bible is produced which is usually early in the day and normally we don't call upon [laughter] the letter that give us vile\nAll right let's go right back to the phones let's go to Mike in San Francisco here and he's got a question about waking up to a urine and are you there Mike yes\nAl ...
