get this on the line [laughter]\nYou know the thing is with Jimmy about this story is insane I Wish I really could have been there to see him beat up on all the starters with end of the bench guys with with the with the last guys on the the they're probably going to even make the team and playing the G League and move on but this is what Jimmy Butler\nAnd Antonio Brown and levy on bell all need to realize is that other to your destiny lies elsewhere\nInevitably leaving on bell will be someplace else Jimmy Butler will be someplace else eventually Antonio Brown will be someplace else because the guy's crazy or you saw stuff today that he thought that the other police story about a toenail brown but in this whole thing throw in\nFurniture off a balcony that he thought his Rolls Royce was stolen when the police showed up at his condo to ask about it he slammed the door and their faces he's nuts I he's got problems\nAnd all of these guys are going to wind up someplace else\nThey don't realize the damage they do to their images and how less desirable that makes them because other teams want to be able to say okay hey you it was a problem for you here that's okay\nYou're one man's trash another man's treasure I get that but all the teams in the NBA and the NFL or going\nBoy if we give leaving on bell that contract is he really going to show up for us I mean look how bad this is and if he doesn't like how things are going is this what it's going to be like for us they're saying the same thing about Antonio Brown when things go bad and he doesn't catch a pass in a game is he going to go nuts and yelled are off as a coordinator and cause all kinds of problems we want to get out of his contract\nAnd the same thing for Jimmy Butler people you want to trade for Jimmy Butler this is what happens when things go bad Jimmy Butler as decided to take this as a crusade and put himself at the top and I'm away from the team and now I'm here and I'm yelling at the gym and I'm causing all this controversy\nThis is what players failed to realize is that when things are bad other teams look at you and say All right how are you dealing with this\nAnd none of these guys Julie butler at the forefront because we're talking about in right now none of these guys have shown other teams will go oh yeah yeah we want to go get Jimmy ... how many teams you've seen in the mix for Jimmy Butler just one just the heat that say\nHow many teachers you want to trade levy on bell no body nobody wants them all of this because you don't want when things get bad you get crazy\nAnd you can't get crazy there's such a thing as grace under pressure that team still care about I Know it's all about what goes on on the field we've had that conversation for Fifteen or Twenty years now but when it comes to a point where we can get you are not get you well this is not going to push me to saying hey I think if you come to my team everything's going to be great it's not\nWhat a couple of things when it comes down to Jimmy Butler I mean you you love the\nThe honesty or as much as he's going to be honest in these discussions why he's going in front of Rachel Nichols do cats\nAre to talk about it uh doesn't make a lot a lot of sense to me yeah you know this is still one just like the others keep it in the house and and try to take care of business but at some point I guess you decided you taking it as far as you can wear this gets typical does that you're talking about the distressed property effect\nLike whoa I sat there certainly are operating yeah there's only so many teams that can take on\nJimmy Butler salary and have the ability to just say okay we're going to break neck the other way 'cause he is is he a transcendental figure no he's a great basketball but he is he the guy that we can say he was going to be the third or fourth or whatever or an also ran in the in the west there were nine teams that were basically the same last year\nAnd just a slight variations could they have been more exciting maybe pulled an extra around in the plaza sure but is he the guy lead them to the title\nOf any that I watched them in Chicago you watch them last year\nAnd and what are you going to do all the players and you give a hundred percent every practice every time all the way through and GM's are licking their chops if they do want and they're not going to waste it so I'm not surprised when I got thrown oh I'm On him you know so you hear about the heat okay that's fine\nThey're waiting for rock bottom prices when it comes to a trade\nI knew what did you guys got up

waiting on it so you're waiting to see exactly what you're going to take\nTo cut bait with with Jimmy Butler and how cheaply you're going to be able to get it right into the house where something bad happened\nThe murder see we go back to our horror film ... or you know people fell out of a job unfortunately and have to get rid of it quickly I mean there's all sorts of the same thing would you be

[laughter] the act Prescott a couple of weeks ago\nA last week Dallas lost to Houston and Alan ... had to defend the comment he made about a play called that led to attack Prescott interception\nAlan herd said the decision to run deep curls against two man coverage on a third may play from the Dallas thirty two worst play called that you could make Prescott pass this test and it's picked up by Justin read\nAlan Horn says I didn't question it everybody knows that's not a good player versus two men today you wanted to clarify that by saying hey\nOutside of here people are talking about it no one's talking about an inside I didn't have any discussion with the coaching staff\nOn his comments or anything else\nSo now here you have Allen her earns a jag wide receiver both literally and figuratively just a guy who was sitting here saying what are we doing calling plays like this\nWhat's going on here it's the worst play call you and make All right now let's I Want to look forward an attack Prescott gets a lot of criticism and we said that first got just a guy\nHe's we've said it for months he's just a guy he's not special he peaked he's he's a guy who picked as a freshman in college argues greatest freshman year and then everybody adjusts he didn't have another year another level see I'm not ready to\nTo bury him fully with what's been built by the Joneses in that organization\nThat all day on buddy you you don't build the hall of fame often supplying again and maybe it'll be good well\nPut pushed that aside I mean how about a functional offensive line which they really haven't been it's been a lot of his ... during the ... work himself yeah Travis Frederick on ... and again\nEllen hers is your number one wide receiver now they have no weapon three we say we're going to say so it was that guy yeah this is like Jared golf a couple of years ago with Jeff Fisher was at the hell no I Can't kill the guy for what's in front of them by the way they also want a couple of games now\nBut but nothing in the east has yellow ... leaves that you're alive but they could go six intended Wendy's and I asked for that may and their families and how many ... pointed out that a lot of it in five game gets left out but look\nThis is a bad team Prescott is not in the quarterback you why look if he's an elite next level quarterback\nGreat quarterbacks like that can get around sub par often supply play they still find a way to make place but this is not ... I I Want to take the whole jak Prescott 'cause everybody's jumping up and down on a lesser let's go\nThis is where I Need that Prescott to lead I Need jak Prescott to do an interview and to say you know what don't bring any of his BS crap\nBecause it's all a bunch of crap we got the guys that can win I don't care about and heard this question a play called we believe in the coaching staff we believe in each other and everybody should shut up and go do their jobs\nThis is where jak Prescott needs to be more than just the quarterback of the team if that Prescott really is but he can take a jump and a leap\nNot even having anything to do on the field he needs to be the guy to quiet this down 'cause right now the Dallas Cowboys have no leadership\nNone jak Prescott to use the quarterback but he's not a leader which is why you are hearing all these wide receivers who you don't even know there is still in the legal what really is guys up federal dollars the Jason Garrett's not going to say anything because he's just happen to be working in Dallas 'cause he doesn't know if the next thing I say it's going to piss Jerry Jones off enough\nTo fire him as head coach 'cause Dallas starts two and three every single season\nAnd somehow Jason guard still has a job nobody wants to say anything\nBecause Jerry Jones is a de facto leader of the cowboys but this is where the quarterback steps up and says you know what I Will feel this way because the quarterback\nIs very visible when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys and their position on the NFL Matt\nYes if Jerry Jones is team and Jerry Jones will always get the headlines people gravitate towards him but that Prescott steps up for his team suddenly it becomes jak press Scott's team there in one fell swoop and suddenly that togetherness that feeling that we're all in Fort instead of sniping about the play calling all of this\nThat stuff gets solved I Need that Prescott to be a leader now\nAnd I know that when quarterbacks lead they like to lead with their own personality and you can wait and have that come out in time\nAnd and that's fine I get that you could be the rough and tumble leader right away like Baker may feel you could be the the quieter guy like Sam Darnell you can be Tom Brady you can be ... you can be anything you want but in times of turmoil\nAnd the cowboys are in turmoil someone's got to step up and say something and grab the team by the throat and dad Prescott needs to be the guy to do that 'cause nobody else and that didn't get as he can only uh can't do it he's not a quarterback he's got to be the guy on the problem is you're getting if you're getting\nOn twelve fifty W. H. N. Z.\nWelcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time bombs\nLoves it back to the last segment Adele wants to radio show today we've been talking about why people fail to become financially free fail to become financially successful live lives quite desperation um you know mediocre lives\nAnd one of the reasons you know we we talked about two reasons in this last segments of one of them was the lack mentality or the other one was the belief that the job is the only way to earn money those are two strong beliefs in our society\nUm but there's one other one and this is the ability to to to all your life away\nUm I don't have a name for it I got to come up with a name for structurally so that I can use it more more commonly but it's the ability to get up every day and go do life and ended up with nothing to just piddle life away one beer at a time sort of as his next article will cover\nUm but it's just like you know why is it that you wake up today and you know better off than you were a year ago you ever come in the end of the year two thousand sixteen\nWhat's different your life or you've heard people on tell del say well I bought it six houses this year next Germany by two apartment complex\nAnd you see people change their lives radically year after year after year when their members lifestyle but there's something different about what they're doing and everybody else because everybody else is out there working and everybody else is out there believing that they're investing because they believe that savings and saving is investing\nBut putting money in a four one K. are putting money and I are re or putting in a savings account\nIs not investing in your future is not building income stream it is not building businesses it's not helping society at all it's not helping you at All right and when you get done and it's like shove your money in your pocket the end of the day the only amount of money of let your box what you don't spend\nBut not spending money doesn't make you more money you have to invest so I'm going to sugars rather comical little spiel with you\nOr somebody said to me because I think it actually identified that situation [noise]\nThis is a conversation between a husband and her wife and her husband and wife and the wife has been do you drink beer and the husband said yes women says how many beers a day man says usually about three ... says how much do you pay per beer man says about five bucks which includes a tip\nWoman says and how long have you been drinking man says about Twenty years I suppose woman says so a beer costs five bucks and you have three a day which put your spending each month that four hundred and fifty dollars in one year would be approximately five thousand four hundred dollars correct and the ... the man does some math and says okay correct\nAnd the woman says if a one year you spent fifty four hundred dollars not accounting for inflation the past Twenty years would put your spending it one hundred eighty thousand dollars correct answers after some calculations correct\nThe woman who says do you know that if you didn't drink so much beer that money could have been put in a stepped up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the Twenty years you would have a ... you could have had a new\nAirplane and the man looks at the woman and says do you drink beer and the woman goes no and it looks or their face and says where's your airplane [laughter]\nYou're gonna have to think about that when that when they were going to go in so easy because it's not about a husband or wife arguing it's about the logic that living without actually makes your life better\nBut it doesn't\nAnd if you really look at it shows you could ever airplane that's even dumber cause airplane would cause even more money so the entire conversation which has put together I Believe originally be considered a husband and wife type joke about a men's the money and how women see money\nIt really defined society you believe out there in your world that if you say five bucks\nIf you save a hundred bucks a thousand bucks a month it's going to add up to something and then you're going to be able to buy crap with it what is crap anything in life you don't need but what you really need is not the ability to buy a piece of crap all a plane car jet ski boat\nYou need to have a regular reoccurring stream of income that you can retire on\nThat you can grow into the future so you can afford to buy is ms which is many toys or as much crap use my vernacular as many toys as you want to buy and still not have to get up and go to work but nowhere did the lady she if you had all that money you could take a month off\nOr you might be able to have an investment in an apartment where did you could retire for the rest of your life you see the jokes can't even get that close to the reality of what it takes to become successful here's a wife ditching or husband out\nAbout being wasteful and not having financial success because he drinks beer and that was the nails hey America all you guys out there talking about how great it is to save money and your four one K. and your IRA and your savings ... and ... billion college fund\nAll that money out there and all those accounts is it making you financially free\nIs making you happy\nAre you being able to retire in answer to all the above questions is no no no no you my friends have nothing just like the lady who doesn't drink beer\nWhere's your plane my friends or in other words where's your investments that will retire you wear has your wealth gone that you should have had because of all the working and sacrificing you've done your entire life my proposition is it was never there in the first place\nBecause working for a living is not the secret to becoming financially free it's not the secret to becoming wealthy and it's not going to be the secrets is going to allow you to retire in any year in the near future my friends I beg you\nPlease change the way you see the world\nTo goes as how you see the world is you a real problem as Einstein said if you keep doing the same crazy stuff you're doing you're going to keep getting the same results and if you think you're not\nThen you're in say
