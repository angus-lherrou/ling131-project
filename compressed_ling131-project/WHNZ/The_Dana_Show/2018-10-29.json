retire America One person at a month he\nWill go back to do on the radio show today we're talking about how you've been educated\nOr out of success you would have been brainwashed into mediocrity and that you no longer have any ability to do critical thinking to think outside of the box you figure out things for yourself in a manner that would allow you to become financially successful financially free\nSo third article and they're bringing up and says almost Seventy percent of millennials regret buying their homes here's why\nAnd it goes on and talks about the fact of millennials are really upset about owning a home but first of all it talks about the number of millennials that on there\nBut it says right now it looks like forty six percent of millennials on their home one percent stay with their friends and get a little more light on that of a ... percent stay with their parents I'm Sorry forty two percent on their own home forty six percent read\nA and illiterate protects their with their parents were present stations spread\nAnd these ... decided that they made some really bad mistakes in buying a home Seventy percent of them be like they've made a very bad mistake in purchasing their home so let's talk about the mistakes that belt that they made\nAnd this talk about why they made them the number one mistake that feel like they made is they feel like they put too much doubt on their personal residents now that's a very logical thing to figure out after you do it\nBut in the beginning every pundit you run into\nYour mother your father your cousin your attorney or a CPA your doctor your financial planner all going to tell you put as much down as you possibly can to get your payments as low as you can add to get the state paid off as quickly as you\nCan what they do end up creating a cash poor environment\nAnd secondly they create an environment where they had no income and they can never get back that money that they save their life savings to put down around our house\nWhat should they have done two things completely differently\nAnd only someone to actually understands why money finance which is none of the people I just mentioned I guarantee you know financial planner out there is smart enough to understand\nWhat they should have dealt with taking all of that money they put down and bought rental income so now they have more income to pay the mortgage should know whip\nAnd they have three or four times the assets working for them number two and owner occupant can get into a home for zero down so they can still have a home so you've now got the asset of your personal residence accumulating\nA appreciation mortgage pay down all the benefits tax benefits which have been taken away by the way uh to some extent a un you also had these rental properties and for you know six hundred thing about six hundred thousand dollar house\nThat these guys are talking about if they put twenty percent down which would be the typical down payment\nYou know God I Can't even do that math is showing saying\nWords were mine will see six hundred and eighty thousand dollar house\nTemper shutdown will be sixty eight thousand dollars you could have gone out and bought for red houses with that ... percent that would be\nA hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty thousand dollars you could have bought you know eight rent houses with that big of if they put twenty percent down they could have bought it red houses made five hundred dollars a house\nAnd be making four thousand dollars a month more casual towards that mortgage payment towards just through life for that matter he wouldn't need to drive ... if he made forty eight thousand dollars a year tax free\nBy his rental properties remember tax free forty thousand is equivalent to that sixty nine thousand they both earned by having jobs\nSo they're insane to put that money down on the house is just insanity no guy sent me emails to all you do is yellow people are yell at you because you're not listening you're not paying attention as the successful\nPeople will get wealthier wealthier wealthier and you're seeing that the smart people in our society are educated people educated in finance are getting wealthier every single day year month whatever\nAnd the middle class has gone that's what they're saying the middle class is gone now\nSecond thing about owning a home is they buy to larger home we've all been taught our entire lives by the largest home you could possibly afford right because then over Thirty years you'll pay it off and it would be your largest asset\nWow dumb as Iraq your dollhouse poor you can't afford the payments and the second largest thing that they're complaining about is not the payments they knew the paper's going to be it's the upkeep and maintenance the reason forty six percent of millennials live\nOr read in an apartment is because when they call\nThe apartment for ... there's a maintenance guy to come pick stuff\nNow I just got off the phone with another person in my neighborhood and we're sitting here fighting with the landscape crews that have been doing our neighborhood per year they just crippled\nThe cost of landscaping the cost of my landscaping on my house is more than most people pay for the personal home residents mortgage payment an automobile payments each month that's my landscaping\nAnd yet what happened was and that's because they just tripled decay wasn't that much report but they're just tripled or that and so a couple of the names\nAll of which you will to live in this neighborhood you have to be smart enough to be wealthy enough to Libya right\nGot together and said this was saying these people don't know what they're doing\nAnd so we all go out look for some way to solve the problem but really the real problem is what my dad taught me a long time ago when I was a kid and that is is is not what it costs to buy it what it costs to maintain it and if you go out there by yourself a whole before you're financially able and capable to take care of it\nThen you are do mean yourself to a financial disaster the rest of your life\nYes my friends we have been educated into poverty had a great day

Bannon has left\nAnd I know Steve Bannon I've known them longer than anyone talking about him on television so I about to no one on that uh people come back to my expertise on that but so that was that's ridiculous to make that comparison a ...\nD and I've written articles critical ... because I don't like the things that he supports and I don't like the things that he says the idea that you're

you're a sexist pig\nMaybe it's because you don't like what I Believe and the fact that I'm a woman is irrelevant but by going up following your logic you hate me because I'm a woman to sit down because you have no ground on which just stand here\nThat's what they're trying to do they want to silence to people who disagree with them by trying to make a claim on their character using identity politics which is disingenuous and it shows that they can't win this argument so that's why they defaulted is tired cliched happy to attack\nI'm so tired of it\nAnd this is this has been something that I've seen repeated over and over again on countless countless countless countless\nA\n... all over I've seen it all over um cable news all over cable news\nAnd it's just [noise] you know we could

Adam Schiff\nOh that was the ... the thing is I don't even want to hear so I'm so tired of here I don't believe all the only point I wanted to make was that it's coordinated when these type of talking points go out there goes oh of course it is this is a recording and it's it's not a coincidence that you have Max Boot Adam Schiff\nAnd several others on the Democratic side trying to equate\nWhat we don't like about sources actions with some sort of hatred of\nSpeaking of ... this was a guy who was lamenting the Trump talking about again and miss quoting the enemy of the people and I've even seen some conservatives do this he was specifically saying fake news [noise] ah but\nAt the same time he called the uh essentially a\nConservative media terrorists so he is guilty of the very thing that he\nYeah I'm\nJust I don't know it's just it's just crazy to me [noise]\nOh so this and some of the media responses to this and the way that I think 'cause I think it has been a largely irresponsible just what I have seen also what I think is highly irresponsible and this goes along with some of the media bias\nThat we have discussed is why in the world at NBC sit on the evidence that completely discredited\nAh Michael ... and Julie sweat neck for weeks why did they do that\nAnd you guys remember all that ... remember when he came out and fortune was bragging about saying that while we were we're tracking him\n[noise] but apparently\nThey had gotten this as early that they had this information\nAs early as September thirtieth which is quite a long time when you consider\nThey knew that he they had information showcasing\nTo them that he was engaging in a conspiracy to fame a Washington Examiner freebie again everybody reported on this\nAnd they said nothing even as\nPeople who are attacking ...

behavior described by sweat nicotine cetera that was a woman who said I didn't even know this one and what\nAn NBC knew that that's how that they talk to her they talk to this woman in September and she said I never even heard of this one I didn't even know her\nWhat are they knew that that was on that ... they there was in September they knew that in September\nAnd\nWhat comes after September October now keep in mind it's September thirtieth NBC knew\nThat they that this whole thing was entirely discredited but yet October second which is after September thirtieth that's what happened I published this declaration talking about this witnesses named saying that she had first hand knowledge et cetera et cetera all of this stuff\nAnd then NBC aired a one on one interview were sweating it and sweat neck\nMade all these statements that were incredibly inconsistent with the affidavit she gave him September twenty six uh examiner notes NBC's Kate Snow processed and concluded interview by noting that couldn't verify anything in the story\nThat should have killed it but they are did anyway stared at anyway even after they knew behind the scenes that had already been discredited by one of the people sided as a way to uh as as proof that the woman story was true\n[noise]\n\nNBC reported that quote in an apparent effort to force the reporting process he added in a phone call a ... about this on background it's not the same woman what are you going to do with that I have an audio allegedly set in separate conversation with a network that he had confirmed with her yet again and everything and the declaration of Trump correction must have been confused by your question\n\nNBC reported five minutes later the woman sent a formally worded taxed\nBack in ... saying understand everything in the declaration of tree should not contact me anymore regarding this issue according to the tax but when reached by phone minutes later the woman insisted that she never stop having us
