Drew Brees this looks like a short fat kid he was he's like a kid the oh I was at this event\nAnd my dad know somebody who knows somebody\nThat introduced me to paint and I got a picture with them 'cause Drew Brees look scared out of his mind when you get that in that hair cat right across the top and yeah I Would they would say what position is he playing football I Would go\nAh backers\nI undersized like bad undersized ... is that what do you like that would have played in the Big Ten when they're right or in you didn't need to be six more [laughter] but this is where Drew Brees sits right now the third quarter just under way\nIn New Orleans the same fleet at twenty six to Thirteen or Drew Brees a heck of a first half in addition to breaking the yard is record Seventeen out of twenty for two fifty and two touchdowns oh by the way he could get his five hundred career touchdown pass in the second half in this game is it for Ninety eight right now\nAre they actually got back a manager for another for another message to him are they going to give them another certificate of authenticity like they did for that football I'm Glad that that uh half assed asinine stoppage at the game or even for the jury was looking around going we're doing this now\nYeah okay that's the thing they stopped the game after a brief throws the touch and I look to throw it on ... on a sixty yard touchdown pass it kind of looked like he was fix\nWhether you know I'm like that and they just put a graphic up on the broadcast saying it was almost ten yards and separation yeah I mean we miss the defender nobody\nWas there it's like we're gonna let you catch it and go all the way for a time I mean it looked like you know if I let them do it in a game show anti will play from here I let let them go it's like when when you're playing softball game and some of his little brother wants it was like okay\nLet them it let 'em and you let it run around the bases he feels like I I I started to get back to the game I'll let you have this because if there was no coverage and know tackle you but you know both all the way to the end zone\nThis wasn't going to be on a you know a certain seven here's a slant for twelve yard that breaks the record\nCompany there that was a lot of by the Washington D. pension first apt to but the first thing that happens for a brief and ask for Ninety nine thirty nine\nNinety nine for Drew Brees touchdown I'm so glad I'm not going against him and fantasy\nA touchdown pass Drew Brees looked to be about forty yards or so uh thirty two Thirteen states with a lead over Washington were getting closer to the over under a Smith again last second touchdown pass the night and\nA pretty much just as wide open if he was not the first one I'd easy it's been easy for Drew Brees the saints so far tonight extra point bending again now Drew Brees up over three hundred yards\nThree touchdowns wow and the all time you're on his record but when they did stop the game\nThey stopped the game and he goes over to the to kiss his kids and his wife and the two hottest things I saw\nOn this when they stopped there just because you know I I I Wish you the the crazy stuff is that he comes over with the ball yeah obviously this policy to his ball hall of whatever it is I mean this is this is the ball that broke the record it's been used in the game ... it's been caught people using handling it but they had a guy in a suit with white glove\nClose David Baker like a lot of problems like David Baker you could just you could just hold it with your hand it's OK okay to be held by like ... you don't want his DNA and and what happens with his ... what are we going to do that football the point being that he wasn't a player in the game right you don't want his fingerprints you don't want him\nMuddying up what was how's it going a minority of all the while I've got a buddy Bennett has his fingerprints all yeah he had nothing to do with the gate about how you wear gloves and you show at the probably not going to take on\nAssigned to not get it doesn't go here's a fingerprint of Drew Brees here's a fingerprint Smith here the ...

my career a former vice president of officiating and the NFL rules analyst at Fox Sports than coming to us live from New York City Mike are you in a meeting where officials may take away Drew Brees as you already records and I hope that's not going to happen\nNot ... not going to happen I I I went by the offices\nIn New York I don't do anything to take any new record is clear you got him you\nKnow the funny thing is coming off yesterday it's now not just the roughing the pastor penalties that have come under fire we probably had the most\nComplaints from from teams coming off the games yesterday Mike Tomlin we had a the browns are upset over colon overtime the giants were upset over recall that felt that that forced their loss\nAt the hands of the Carolina Panthers or ... is is this something to expect is this going to be the norm where are you after you see with everything went on yesterday\nWhile I I mean look at I I get most concerned about uh my um because with you you have a coach Rick I'm quite warm as easily as they did it still is watching the complaint is a member of the competition committee um if I was sitting in the river on see\nThat would be the one that concerns me the most um I think if you're going through a struggle right now and I I'm not exactly sure why I mean I Know there's a lot of it's a trend that I'm seeing\nThat seemed to be having the problem especially adjust to what is rocking the passer and what is a pastor\nSo there's issues or not I'm actually going to Seattle river on this week when I'm here in New York and I kind of want to let them put it on my shoulder and say you know I've been through this two were just kind of whether the ups and downs and try to get these things but\nYou know I think the issue of corruption in the past with there were weapons more all this\nThis week I'm going in tonight and I'm not sure if there was any call tonight\nBut zero of the eleven had to do with landed on the quarterback with most or all of your body weight so it's like\nMay be carried over at this point of emphasis is carried over into the other areas hitting the quarterback low like in Philadelphia where you know I'm a it was called a hit a ball hit\nWhen it really wasn't a low hit I mean there was no forced to it and I I kind of like you're all may be overreacting a little bit so\nThey got to find a level I think they will\nUm they're just going through a tough time right now and I and I like to see us get beyond that so we can talk more about the great game I mean that the number of points to the point differential record levels so close great things to talk about but\nAt the moment at least we're stuck on broken the pastor\nWhile do a rare thing Mike and I'll talk about a kicker for a moment with sixty three art or a but should there um had been a a review of the spot on the Christian McCaffrey third down call before grand you know got the show is excellent\nWell you know it's interesting because I mean I don't see any came as I used to because I'm On the road from Troy in joke crew and it didn't strike me um when I was kind of watching it in the mood I'm In New York came out that that they did not stop it because they felt there was not a map\nTo overturn it and I think you're going to see that by the way because you know what happens when you have\n... and ... you get longer games and I know that the commissioner that that's a big concern of Roger Goodell is the link the game\nSo I you know I I even saw once a year where they ruled a field that cuts down in the end zone didn't review it because and they said they didn't you like it was there was an up there to overturn it so they didn't take the time to stop it\nI'm I'm not sure they learned their lesson a little bit I think in the Cleveland ... game when they all spot when they shouldn't do\nSo you know I Am inclined to think that you know what you get to that point of the game I grabbed her stop it\nJust to see if there's another angle that might or something or conclusive but at least in their eyes there didn't they didn't think there was Fox\nSports radio the Jason Smith show with my comment live from the guy goes studios my career a\nFormer VP of officiating and the national football league Fox Sports rules analyst with us here now when you take a look overall Mike and see obviously we spent a lot of time this year on the receiving the pastor and that's been a big topic overarching for the first five weeks\nAnything else stick out to you what you've seen so far this season I don't either positive or negative uh hey officials are doing this or they should be doing this that and maybe we're not paying as much attention to\nWell I mean I wouldn't say going you know in the first the first three weeks I was concerned about the number of fouls on the old\nAnd ... and because they really were calling to more power game doesn't seem like much but it is um when you start looking at the normal average number of penalties on but that seemed to have it as found this level of bit\nI think the thing that concerns me maybe a little bit is the emphasis on illegal contact and holding 'em because that when you look at the numbers the numbers of calls for illegal contact I mean that is a blow to I mean there's three times more which\nDo you have a great idea for radiate out of work now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version at a bunch\nOf them back to last segment the do on the radio show earlier today\nI was discussing the fact that real estate investing is like watching a trained come down the tracks you can see it coming but you can get out of the way well here's an article that tells you that it's time to start paying attention to the train coming down the tracks and it's an article says that adds\nA duly more than four interest rate hikes unlikely this year a dual use one is the New York representative of the Federal Reserve\nAnd he says hey we've had one rate increase quarter of a point\nBut we're into speeding three to four more this year\nSo that means interest rates when we were blocking our apartment to the three point eight five a couple of years ago now we're up in the four point five interest rate we could end up at five point five now why do I tell you this\nBecause a bum you know because you need to start thinking about OK any interest rate changes I'm going to make in the future if I'm going to refinance or anything I'm going to have to\nFactor into the act in interest rates are going to be higher now they're telling me a year in advance that they're going to do this right\nSo should I not be smart enough to understand that they're telling us this in advance so we can prepare for it so that we don't make bad investment decisions based on the lower interest rates we have the day the higher interest rates were going to happen next year I mean I'm watching the interest rate every single day\nFor many reasons one also to be able to consult people or what is it\nA realistic interest rate to look at for underwriting their project but also for all the funds that I have sitting around everywhere you know probably twenty or thirty accounts I own um different bank accounts and I'm looking at what those interest rates are doing and where they're at and it it really makes a major difference I mean you think about\nYou know if you've got ten million dollars or twenty million dollars or you're talking\nAbout a five percent interest rate if it gets back up to that is a million bucks a year when we repeat that if you get twenty million bucks five percent interest rate is a million dollars a year\nThat's a lot of money so you know you're looking at the positive side of the interest rates go up all of us with money are making more money as her interest rates go up\nA ... the people that are buying real estate only need to factor that those interest rates are going to be higher and at some point the sellers of real estate are going to have to be realistic remember what I said earlier\nThe only reason you can't ... real estate overnight is because you're not selling it for the appraised price you're tried to sell for more than it appraises for and then hope that they can squeak the appraisal in and get it done bottom line is\nWhen interest rates get up higher and higher and higher the sellers you're going to have to come off those aggressive sales prices is that could hurt us no we're going to be buying it a little bit lower price paying a little bit higher interest rate ... it's got to be the same thing it's a business we've got to make money we don't make money we don't get into the business\nRight now the only people that have to watch out or people that went into these deals are this year\nAnd thinking they're going to refinance next year but not anticipating an interest rate changed for next year guys if you're buying a property right now and you're in a bridge loan or your hard money you need to think about how quickly can I get out of these loans so that I don't\nFeel the effects of three more interest rate hikes this was a time issue the train is coming down the tracks guys there it is we see it or telling you it's there there's no reason to panic\nBe logical thinking through what changes do I need to make my portfolio in the next six months to avoid any type of interest rate risk that's what you need to be thinking about that will make it all happen All right\nLast article of the day I dug this without that just to prove a point that has nothing to do with the article but it was a good segue into my thought process and that was this was from the greater Houston partnership but they're talking about what are the fastest growing employment markets now\nThe reason that's important to real estate investing as wherever there's more important for every five jobs there's another rental unit rented\nFor every five jobs there's another rental unit rented this the ratio they go by sober more\nNew employment coming into your town\nRight the higher your rents are going to be and the higher your occupancy is going to be so get this right here right out of the blocks Dallas Fort Worth a hundred and forty six thousand\nNew people hundred and forty six thousand coming in Houston Ninety four thousand four hundred and Seventeen net grilled\nAtlanta ... nine thousand Phoenix eighty eight thousand and it goes down the list but here's where it gets interesting guys the liberal states are starting to lose people\nWhy well because those governments are failing they're going broke and their taxes are getting higher and higher and higher the cost of living is getting higher and higher and people are fed up with it and they had net negative\nEmployment growth people are moving away\nNot to play the growth but net negative\nPopulation growth so picky about somebody like Chicago Chicago is losing Thirteen thousand people this year that's tax base property tax base that sales tax base that they're losing that personal income state income tax base they're losing now\nFor the rest of you out there haven't figured this out yet I took a bunch of just got your head in the sand if you live in one of these liberal states like California\nWhat's gonna happen to you this years your taxes are going to go up by twenty five to thirty percent because you have a twelve percent state income tax rate\nThat and you have high property taxes because you're properties are so expensive the rates low but these properties are expensive so you have taxes you used to be All right all that off the gift your federal income tax returns you no longer can folks\nThat means you're actually for the first time going to pay the taxes that you have been taxed by the government in other words the giant money steal\nThat the state governments have been stealing from the federal government making all of us people in the rest of the country paper you guys live it's over\nYou're going to pay to live like liberal whacked petunias and you're going to can throwing out money to all these welfare programs all these stupor super duper giveaways and you're going to go broke\nBut they're smart people to liberate Iraq they will they're going to come live with us they're going to come live in a rational society where people no longer try to live off of other people\nThink that went through but remember it's not the money is alive to see them off [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThank you for your mom's ...

thinking and I went on nutrition on the Web that tradition not come back from the brain electric joined Michael's are kind of\nTo let some nutrition Andrew her check from New chapter is my guess to be talking about elder Barry ...\nWay there you go a ... natural pretty natural oil to bury it is and how they can confer a\nHealth benefits during ... cold and flu season and so that led and Andrew was explaining where they\nGet the raw from where they get the raw material\n[noise] and they get it from Austria it turns out\nSomething about the elder Barry there that makes it very special ... and then with that than to the point where I talking about well how do you make\nIt [noise] and then he\nStarted to explain that okay Andrew welcome back so how you handle that raw material becomes an important issue doesn't it\nYeah absolutely yeah the most important thing is obviously that\nYou know if you're you're tracking and you're concentrating the product to produce you know really a potent supplement potentially you know to help support immune system\nDo you want to make sure that your extraction method is collecting all those valuable flab annoy you know the ... and things that you want to boost your immune system so what new chapter does is\nWe use a a pressing method where we've pressed the elder very much like you would press grades to create you know the Jews to to to produce wine or grape juice it's first ... and then from there it goes through a series of member a\nHe's membranes are like scream\nAnd as the uh the elder very material right that the press juice with all the the skin and the fibers and stuff\nOut is passing through the membrane what's happening is it's collecting on the membrane material the fibers material and the process is removing also the sugars now two things happen here [noise]\nNumber one is you're collecting all the most nutritious parts of the elder very like I said skins the fibers material and you're moving out the sugar\nAt the same time you're also preserving all the vitamins and minerals and other nutrients 'em the benefit of that in particular is that sugar if you look at most of The Elders dairy products on the market\nThey don't go through this type of a membrane processes they might be alcohol extracted or just pressed and then dry kneecap slated there loaded with sugar up to eight grams of sugar per dose and the problem is is that on one hand you're getting you know some some perhaps some immune benefits from the from the elder buried\nBut on the other hand you're getting all the sugar which we know from lots of the studies out there and and your information that's available is that sugar counteract the immune system's activities to protect the body you know there was a fabulous diets which ... which destroy microbes and viruses they're headed like sugar\nSo it's kind of a a conflict there that you have you know you know if you're eating you know the elder varies you know raw that's fine you know you're not getting a lot of sugar unless you're eating a massive amounts but then when you're concentrating the product\nMhm when you're making a supplement that in the sugar levels go up a lot so with the new chapter process the true to fruit membrane extraction we get that sugar out of there so all you're getting all that that fibers material the skins where you have all of that really good flab annoyed material that people are seeking you know when they've taken out of the very process\nTurns out that elder berries as you heard Andrew say are I'm\nA rich in ... and a particular type of flab annoyed uh anthrax sigh Annan's or the answers sigh Annan's as what gives the elder Barry plant that very deep purple color almost black coloring\nA and these are scientists anthrax I Annan's are a powerful a very effective antioxidants and they keep the immune system a very resilient and responsive or turns out that\nAnthrax Tsai Annan's an elder berries boost the production of what are called cytokines\nThat are part of your immune system there proteins and they're like messengers for the immune system and they take an enhanced the system now turns out they\nThey play a crucial wall these cytokines it can be um\nBoth inflammatory an anti inflammatory depending on what is going on I don't want to get into the weeds about that but just to understand that uh and as Andrew said eating too much sugar sometimes will inhibit some of the um ... molecules that work\nIn cells at work or as part of the immune system like the macro fires is\nOr whatever and you don't want to you don't want to impair their performance so but the berries are rich and after a sigh Annan's and of course they are a class of flab annoyed so the I mean this is not hocus pocus this is this is real it is the science of nutrition right\nYeah that's right yeah I mean there's a lot of studies out there on elder very I think the national library of medicine has over a thousand studies just\nConfirming the potential immune enhancing benefits of elder Barry ... do it it's just really important especially when I when people are making a choice about their immune health especially their stress over you know a cold and flu season coming and how bad it was last year you know you want to make sure that the", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day":
