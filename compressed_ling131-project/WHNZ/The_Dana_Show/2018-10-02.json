here in this and I don't mean like Colin Kaepernick illusion I mean things like all games are fixed and all these uh\nBut when I see the ending of the browns raiders game yesterday\nAnd watch the browns first down get overturned on replay giving the ball back to the raiders their cars there was a touchdown pass the game goes over time and the raiders winning over time\nIt's a place like that that make me fake yeah something's not right somebody's got something on the outcome here something is is trying to be pre determined because\nThe browns had a chance to solve this game away on a third downplay the give the ball the Carlos Hyde who gets a first down\nUpon further review it is ruled that his risk and Elmo bowl was down before the ball cross the Eighteen yard line which is where the first down a marker was for the browns so the browns have to ... and this is the raiders got the ball back\nThere's so many things about this play that I Can't believe first of all irrefutable evidence that this that this the Web where the ball was down I mean seriously irrefutable evidence there was no irrefutable evidence on that Carlos I got a friend he got to the point forget about the yellow line he got to the point on the field he needed to get two for the first out he got there\nAnd then the NFL's explanation today as to why they overturned the first down\nThey say quote one replay angle shows hides rest and the elbow hit the ground simultaneously\nThen you go back to the line feed you see the wrist hit the ground you know the elbow was down at that point you see the ball a shorter the wind to a game\nThat is incorrect because the first time Carlos Hyde puts his risk now it's just as rest\nThen it's his wrist and his elbow he puts his wrists down that could give them a push and you're allowed to do that you're allowed to put your your hand to hand in around ... you can do that and he does that show was risque hits the ground first that gives them the push then it's the arm and the album that as the rest of the album\nSo I don't see how they say it's the first time he puts his wrists down it's not over the line\nI ... it and then the second time it's down then it's over the line\nI I don't I don't get that at all but mainly I don't get how that that gets back in ... what what what makes you go back to you know what no\nThat is in in ... where they try to say hey let's get another fantastic finished here at the end you've had fantastic finishes all day let's try to make it happen like is there is there an executive in Manhattan saying All right I Want to make sure people keep watching the NFL and watching red zone and watching the late game let's try to get this game down as exciting as it could be 'cause the game's over\nSo hey yeah we're overturning that for a first down\nBut with these pinball numbers or nobody nobody's turning away at this point because it's really just bringing up points I mean what or hundred yards passing is now on nothing what twelve already\nAnd we're looking perhaps for one more tonight but the Broncos defense up to the task at my home so far but to overturn this\nWhen you're talking about an imaginary yellow line is absurd right now on the line to gain and what's your at least it didn't happen on the infield dirt because then it would have been even worse for all of this going well you know if you had an actual field\nWe'd be able to tell but here\nIn at least happened on the field of play but to to reverse it\nI watched the replay a hundred times I mean I don't have the ability to blow it up and bring it has a burger it'll frame by frame where where everything's going but\nWe've seen so many times over the years it's the this is the call on the field there wasn't enough to overturn it to suddenly arbitrarily overturn this one in the face of all that it is curious to me unless there's a camera angle that somebody has that we've never seen\nYeah I ... and they say oh you see the feet yeah it's right the second time the first thing to keep himself up was this was I I\nDozens of people just like you who chose invent helped to pursue their idea we're experience we are working for you we are in bad health costs for\nFree information at one eight hundred and five or to sixty seven fifty one that's one eight hundred and five four to six seven five one again one eight hundred five four to sixty seven fifty one\nConventional wisdom says you bring the man on a mission to retire America One for each other moms and he will go\nBack to last segment do on the radio show today the concept is Ben that most of us that are not where we want to be in life in any specific very or various a part of our lives um or not there because we started with the wrong base assumption in life and that\nHow you see the problem that you're challenged with is really the problem itself and if you see the problem incorrectly or if you approach the problem with the wrong base assumption then you're not going to be able to fix or beat the problem\nAnd so we've got all over the place today we talked about fitness and finances and family and help that you know it it's it's an every aspect of your life this is true\nSo what is the take away from this what should be done I think the first thing you need to do is you need to sit down today with yourself maybe with a family member of friends\nAnd ask yourself this basic question how do I approach life\nDo I approach everything I Do from the I Want it now type a instantaneously gratification diseased idea column and just strike out radically fast and hard on everything\nAnd not think through what the long term results or if I'm Taipei I probably don't have a life plan you probably can't find written down anywhere what my goals are in life\nI'd probably just going to change them by tomorrow in any way I'm if I'm that type of person that I wanted to realize that upfront and then I've got to think about ideas with that limitation your mind in figure out ways to keep yourself\nOn topic\nTo make yourself accountable for finishing the project\nMaybe even just cut down the number of projects that you take on in life whatever they beat whether it's fitness finance family health whatever um\nBut you definitely have to see that that is your challenge now for your type B personality you got to realize that you have no motivation at all in life\nYou want to take the easiest route through life that there is you want everything to stay the same and you don't want any challenges now in my personal life I'm a super type B person financially I'm a super type B personality and so it was very important for me\nTo find a spouse or that would be a Taipei\nThis keeps me you know centered in other words I Would never go out do anything I live in a box under a bridge never go anywhere do anything but my fiance she likes to go everywhere she wants to go out with people she likes Bruce\nThe people and I'm not a group of people kind of guy just hang out with my girl kind of guy but she likes to go out get dressed up and go out with people and have fun and go out to eat different places and do different things she's always looking for something different to do\nAnd I'm always wanting to do the same things you know it's it's something that I had to just worried about myself that that's the way I was um\nYou know I've worked in health club\nFor twelve years the only job corporate job I really ever had did that my whole adult career\nI was in health clubs since I was a kid since I was fourteen years old at the workout new body building until I was competitive until I was thirty five or six do you want to do work out a stick with it you know whatever it is I think's important in life I Do it do it do it do it again\n[noise] so what is it about type B it's challenging just won't add anything new to their life they're afraid of taking risks they're very risque I'm\nAdverse or they don't like new projects where it takes a whole lot of effort to get that rock roll and\nUh and so you get like I said if you're being you need to find somebody can help you or to get over your views\nAnd if you're in a need to get somebody to help you get over ... and if you got that person in your life you need to let them help you one of those things and not get better because what you think they're doing is they're ... they're attacking your basic personality\nIs what they're doing in your mind that's what it is you're attacking my basic personality which means I don't like you know I Do like I liked you enough to want to help you and that's why when I can sit on the outside node everything you're telling me is wrong\nI if I like you have the responsibility to tell that to you and say look you're not seeing this quite right\nYou had the wrong base assumption about X Y Z and let's start with the base of something about yourself who do you think you are how are you approaching life and where have your failures come from\n[noise] have you had eight different husbands eight different wives why maybe that part of your personality is to type age just go close your eyes run bank find somebody close rise run bang find somebody else falls apart\nYou know or you the kind of guy that met his girlfriend in high school and you've been with her and you're sixty years old been married for forty five years or
