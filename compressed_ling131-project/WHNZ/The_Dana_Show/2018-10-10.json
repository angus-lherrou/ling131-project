go to ... what I in Portland, Oregon the\nSite of this takeover of downtown Portland and what do you tell us factually what's going on in Portland, Oregon\nAnd it's nothing short of anarchy [noise] um we can go back to the uh are taking the access fed even married let that go on for months\nThen when they disbanded that finally got the best of the police chief um some of them moved to city hall\nAnd you may recall a story where a a protester stabbed his civilian yeah yeah right I encounter that individual about two days prior\nAnd he was holding out a fly on a guide on and said I'm a bass I said I was just shaking my head and she turned the red cross the street suggest loud enough for me to hear it's always the white ones because they are shaking my head [noise] um\nWhat what do you talk about to take it over city streets I see this video and there's a cop standing by watching individuals to beat up on cars stopping city streets of butter explain what's going on\nIs that the

have a non biased news network\nSo you don't have television condemning this kind of misbehavior they cover it is if they have a valid point\nOr other of our local conservative talk show radio host up here in in Portland no we don't have a voice saying otherwise\nWell it does is Portland to conceal carry steak can you have your own weapon yes isn't it so\nMuch riskier be pulling people out of cars and stopping them and beating their vehicles with sticks and baseball bats another bit dangerous\nOr you may recall a story about two years ago were a one Mr Strickland poll has a firearm out for four and a half seconds to push back a group of people though are approaching them an intimidating him he is\nUnder various federal charges right now trying to fight all that back because the city has come down on him rather than the people that were intimidating him\nTo the guy defending himself as the one arrested yes this is crazy money this is crazy Ted Wheeler the mayor gets her ... is he\nMaking

should have been caught that went for a double don't know if he thought he was running into the wall or what but you haven't put anything together often simply so every extra out that you need to get

Sharma flew out and presented their multi family homes to us we also had Brian I'm Michelle Wolf presenting on single family investing\nAnd really I think my job as an ambassador is is helping 'em Steve set up a lot of those events but just helping to facilitate helping to be there to welcome new members to be somebody that can answer questions for them um\nTry to help them feel comfortable um in they're investing journey and and just encouraging them along the way\nUm so that's really what I see is my main job\nYou know Mark I'm as I mentioned the last segment as a mathematician math teacher which you could be a very technical sided thinker a you seem to be made most ... based on the more emotional\nAnd people oriented side of the decision curve my question you was when you first came to lifestyles physically getting to touch the people were you surprised how open they were\n[noise] oh definitely I mean you know has a [noise]\nWhat do we talk about businesses a lot of businesses are very competitive and they don't want to share with each other you know what their numbers are and you know that's that's the beauty of a case study um investors upfront sharing their actual experiences with the rest of the members I'm getting to see their [noise] their\nNumbers you know what they invested into a deal what kinds of things they did to improve a property what their returns are um and so you know the transparency and and even just talking to other members and having them share you know how many deals are you in and you know which deals are good which deals\nHave worked out so well I'm you know everything is very transparent and open and honest and and it's just a a great environment to be a part of\nWhat is a truly your wife think about this\nWell you know it's interesting she I wanted her to count as I mentioned before back to the two days seminar in Palm Springs and so she came with me\nAnd I'm you know she met um some of the people that I mentioned before and she got to hear Bryan deferred to the the two days seminar and she understands now you know\nHow this whole process works for the most part you know she doesn't really go to all the events that I go to um she went up ... pm comes in and we're discussing you know whether we should get into a new deal I make sure that I Walk her up and and I'll explain to her all the different parts of this deal and why I think it might be good or not\nAnd then well actually sitting and pray about it last you know got to give us some guidance on our investing and you know that's sort of per involvement in it I keep her um apprised about what we're doing and and make sure that she's a part of all the decisions [noise]\nUm but she's not his hands on as I Am I I just really love and enjoy the opportunity to get out with like minded investors and discuss things and talk with them and just be a part of all the events\n... contrary to that thought you work in a pension based environment what are the\nPeople around you know of what you're doing and or think about what you're doing if they know\n[noise] that's interesting because I've I've tried to share a few times with people and um you know some of the people that I teach with um are very interested in investing and\nUm you know they're open to listening to some of the ideas that you know I've shared with them\nI think other times I'll talk to people and they'll look at me for like a deer in headlights they don't really you know to think about putting down a large sum of money on an apartment complex can be sort of beyond you know what they normally think about doing um so\n... there's mixed reactions I mean some people really started to talk to him and I realized very quickly that it's it's not going to be to fruitful and and I just sort of don't go too far with that and other people all share a lot of details with them because they're very interested in an open to learning\nHow about the family ... family\nAnd external at a rally brothers just yeah my father in law is actually came with us the Palm Springs and he is a pig member as well and he's invested in twelve or Thirteen deals now himself\nAlthough he's gotten very involved and um my father who lives in Florida or I've shared some of this with him he's more invested in the stock market and\nNot so much in real estate and so you know we've we've talked about that and ah you know family is very supportive on what we're doing I think that um\nYou know it's it's out of the realm of comfort sometimes for people my sister who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio is also\nA big number joined after we went and she's in one deal I'm with us so we're both in a deal with Brian button in Atlanta and so I'm so people are very open in my family and very you know interested in what we're doing\nWell that's great really as you know say something Mark I'm through this whole interview\nI've not heard anything any type of skepticism in any way so you're you're definitely a going towards kind of person I just keep looking ahead moving forward guy so\nThat is completely different than me which I'm a skeptic I'm moving away from pain away from trouble away from problems so it's interesting to see the dichotomy of personalities are but you've done well and just continue to do well seven deals and seven months is excellent I Want to thank you for a couple
