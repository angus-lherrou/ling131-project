going to get enough attention but when we look at this team as it was constructed we looked at the running back by committee approach that they take in the last few years which was clearly\nAn awful failure and so when you're looking at it\nAs a complete disaster in many respects but then you look at All right we spent money on the offensive line we got back we resigned him he'll be happy shepherds year anger and here\nWe bring in the running back not that the running backs are transcendent figures right that's that's the big thing at all it is is that it has to go hand in hand with a lot of other parts and gentlemen and the front office thought that they don't that moving made those parts stop moving at the office of wine was fixed all of those things they put enough back on

I mean I could have played Jeffrey and my flex by but I got more shoveling chicken playing my flex bought I got Lamar Miller coming back but I like the ... so I'm like you know\nOur son Jeffrey you know seven catches sixty six yards and two touchdowns yeah Bertie one to six the eagles lead the giants and I left him\nOn my mentioned fantasy so there's that it happens buddy I'm Sorry\nWe ate but on the broadcast questioning the efforts of the giants defensive players last eagles Dr ... knife through butter down the touchdown pass a Jeffrey and the giants I guarantee you\nGiants a giants fans looking at this clock right now I'm just saying just have a running clock we just want this to be over let's just get this over and I don't have to worry about football for the next ten days let's just let's just get this over an hour because this is just absolutely awful but it is good\nThat the broadcast booth sees what we were just talking about here you got a bunch of guys that just look like they're going through the motions to professional football it's\nWeeks six it's weak sick and you've quit\nYeah and what have you ever go back and junior is you still have to do your own jab jobs and here's the other thing I Do I guarantee you the majority of the players don't know about they have no idea they don't know that because what they did not looking wears out the L like we are 'cause we're watching the game it's on TV\nYou know I guarantee you most of the players don't know that oh no when it beforehand because look he went in before half time it's the big headline of the game right now take one but we've had a good first but oh back I'm leaving the field before half time when the giants office was on the field is what's gaining a lot of attention right now\nAnd wait till they start to answer questions in the in the uh in in the post game when it's going to be okay what do you think about oh they'll even if you're\nA what what what ... what what ... ... uh um\nOh boy hey where is there any are just way way way where somebody\nJust bailed out Eli Manning uh badly throw a ball on third down their first get this first third down converse they'd been over there prior Fifteen and now sake on Barclay ... bridge the daylight touchdown giant\nMore fantasy point for me said gone bars with this is his best game by far as a pro in the end zone is now eighty two yards rushing and he's up well over a hundred yards on the ground and that touchdown he's got along the fifty yards he kept Jaycee ...\nIt's a good game he's having a good game he came to the link twelfth and rushing\nTwelve and Lincoln rushing he's having a lot of game time adjusts how to game like this ah last week\nOh Adams up a hell of a game and run into that well but as far as you go too often rushing I Want to know total your to your among running back where it was total you ought to run run or I Will look up totally you're going to get out of\nWide eyed celebrate the the virtues of that run and again in the first half they had their opportunities and that that's the other part of it is you got to be the frustrating part for giants fans and for the giants players themselves that they\nThey had a couple of point blank range tries you you picked up a big burst out at first and goal from the poor and you end up settling for yoga and then you have another you'll go try you got roses who has an injury right he's playing through a quad\nBought two out at three in the field goals that that is that going to be enough it's up even yes you get suckered in the over under was forty four and a half for whatever said as it's been raining it's going to be bogged down no we're seeing big white and with the defense laying down for the giants you're not gonna when\nYou're not going to win with a bunch of a field goal intense just not going to work\nAnd look and look this is where the giants are at look at this and this is where we're at with with both back I'll just go back and forth over ... sake when it ... is that despite the fact that ... that cycle and Barkley got over two hundred yards a scrimmage tonight the giants at Thirteen points right\nI mean he's got to a New Yorker scrimmage Thirteen points Thirteen points you should you have a running back with two hundred yards discrimination thirty points\nBut this is the issue say corn Barkley is a nice player and he's having a phenomenal night tonight phenomenal night but the giants are getting dropped and they've been getting dropped all season long if you have a quarterback\nDoesn't matter you can have it you can have a jacket running back\nAnd it doesn't matter 'cause you're still going to win games 'cause that's the most important position in the NFL that's what the giants are going to rule drafting him an auto back I'm now it's going to be a case of\n... what do you do what do you do do you use to spend what do you do he actually came back out now he's played he left the veil just on and he just made a cat so the giants allowed him to come back out and play in the second half\nSo and trying to predict what the giants are going to say after the game with ... they're going to say not a lot and it's been taken care of and meanwhile all is is just you wait for the next to rupture in front of you wait for the next and he'll couch this under I don't like losing I don't like that\nHe's not getting wasn't getting past the throwing his way in the first half and he decides I'm going to become the story I told her back I mean he knows what his actions do you can't stand up and say oh he's just passionate he's this and that\nYou you you think he's going to love the fact people talking so well but fake one Barclay not talking about\n\nCome back more pressure on the moon missions to remember one bumps and\nWelcome back to the Dell wants a radio show this is Len marrow was successful real estate investor and lifestyles unlimited mentor Jillian Garland and today we'd been working on your financial freedom with a conversation about harnessing your fear to drive change and future success\nWe've talked about some some tips to harness that fear so so we talked today about all of the things that cause and generate that fear the things that are working\nFor you when you look toward your retirement and it is that stress that inability to sleep you know your head hits the pillow at night and that's when all the worries come\nAnd that's bubbling up from\nSubconscious telling you it's time to change because you're not going to get where you want to go things are not working it's that got level feeling that something has to change or life is not going to be what you want it to be\nAnd we talked about the first tool to harness your fear is education you know we're not asking you to suspend all reason and logic\nEducation is a powerful tool to overcome fear and that's why ... founded lifestyles unlimited we're an education and mentoring company we don't put deals together we don't ask people to give us their money we teach you you had to go out and do what we have successfully done\nAnd I think that's the the biggest tip you gaze Chilean is that when you're trying to harness fear instead of letting in each you alive get educated and you're already educated and all kinds of things you're incredibly successful but get educated in this area\nSo that you can create the wealth and passes income you want for retirement that you want to jump what are some other things that we can do to harness beer and drive change and future success with it instead of letting fear to swallow his whole\nSo I think that fear essentially stems from the unknown and the easiest way to conduct the unknown is through education as we've talked about so the more educated that you get\nThe more education has the ability to make the unknown the new normal it makes it something that you become comfortable with and then it like riding a bike and then you have the fear again because you have to get out of your comfort zone and do something else\nBut you already have the foundation for with the education that you've taken to that point so it can propose to the next up\nAnd you know I think that the biggest misconception that I hear is people think that we're telling\nIndividuals to scrap everything you know liquidated everything cash out of all of the things that you've been saving for and you've been taught at the Safeway and investing your entire life and that's just not true real estate is not one size fits all you can move as quickly or is slowly as you want to\nIronically I Am one of those individuals that want it to move very slowly\nI Am a I'm going to put my ... and the water to check out the temperature I Am not the I'm going to Kennan ball into the deep end right off the bat\nBut as a result I put my it'd be telling the water temperature was good\nTook the first ... seconds before you knew it was swimming in the deep end and I didn't even realize how I got there so I made that fear of change are being uncomfortable\nA success pattern so that's kind of where it goes from there the other thing that I Can't stress enough it's never be afraid to ask questions\nSo I'm One of the church or with lifestyles unlimited and I will not lie to you and tell you that I Know every single thing there is to know about the economy and real estate and everything that you could ever possibly know and anybody that tells you they can is full of it do you want somebody that is just as nervous\nAbout the situation that they don't know the answer to helping you because the person that's nervous or the person that is a little afraid of change or a little has a little bit of fear of the unknown as well that's the person that you want on your side because that's the person that's going to research it and go down that rabbit hole of gloom and doom and find the answer that you need\nSo I get after a number of all the time because\nThey don't want to disclose to me when something is going wrong and I'm saying no tell me you're not going to change anything\nIn your situation if you don't take the option of asking for help we're here to throw life best and gets you out of situations that help you were given advice and tell you hey you need to take a left you need to take a write in a way going back to your point about driving home and the road being blocked because it's overcome with water\nLifestyles unlimited if your GPS system we are the ones that say hey whoa whoa whoa turn around don't drown we need you to take a left right now we're going to get your home safely um it's going to be a different route but it's\nGoing to be much better so that helped people need to start looking at it um\nI also encourage people to take their time and make sure that this is what they want to do you know there's nothing worse than an impulsive individual that just changes everything in their life and\nThen is to encourage that later on so you have to know yourself and know what you're capable of taking on and like I said the biggest tool that we offer is a strong education a tried and true part but it's been tested time and time again\nOver the course of the twenty eight years of this company has been in existence\nI always recommend emulating people that are successful that you want to be like you don't want to be like the person but you know lost all their money when they were doing flips or that guy's neighbors friends brother that we had talked about earlier that how 'bout rental one time Twenty years ago and had a bad experience with it\nHave cancer of I thought I was going to give you all the wrong advice\nAsk people that are successful and what they do ask people that are confident in their abilities to know the answer is and if they don't know the answer is they will find the answers so it's a it's a\nContinuing education process and\nThat's where it's fantastic because I always want to grow I Want to expand my thought process says I Want to be able to know what it is going to happen in the future and be prepared for it\nSo it's a continuing education is a lifelong education and that the exciting part about real estate because things do change and\nWe're prepared for them based on our experiences and our ability to have dealt with change initially\nAnd I think that goes for way as\nIt goes for anything that we do in life right uh you you know being able to\nUm to get educated surround yourself with success ask questions and be transparent find a mentor who successfully done what you want to do the way you want to do it and then take action walk through that fear Jillian today shows coming to an end\nBut fortunately everyone can find us any day of the week morning or night on
