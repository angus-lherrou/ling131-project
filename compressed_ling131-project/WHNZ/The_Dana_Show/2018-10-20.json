Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if if that were true\nWhy would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation lawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect the fact that the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy\nIt's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is prove that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded and you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense a well funded investigation into you\nIf you truly are an agent of the Russian government why would you do that\nWould you do that and I again I\nI he could be an agent of the Russian government Carter Page and James Comey and Peter Struck and Andrew McCabe will read a lunch and and the whole team over there during the Obama administration\nWho ordered this investigation this unprecedented spying on an American citizen who was connected with the presidential campaign during a presidential election and then only so much of it got leaked to the press shocking how much of it got leaked to the press\nThey could all be true in there with the angels\nRight now and how pure they acted in behaved and they they were just defending our nation against a foreign attack a former of foreign cyber attack from Russia with their with their agent Carter page that that could all be trip I don't know\nBut I'm using my brain I'm thinking it through logically and I'm thinking if it were true\nI'm thinking the last thing that I Do if I were Carter Page is what he did this week\nRight\nThat one last thing\nIf it were true think about it for a minute the last person who wants this to be discovered is not even Carter Page it's ...\nSo that so since you're still using that brain I Want you to think about something what has happened to people historically who have gone against the wishes of Vladimir ...\n... do you think if if he is a spy for blood them or do you think who wants to out there\nSo either Carter Page is a spy and he's going to end up with a bullet in his head or he could very well be assisting in exposing the biggest political scandal in American history just\nFood for thought I'm Larry O'Connor it's the market and show\nAfter my living it's neat Dana last on twelve fifty W H ...\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth Hillsdale students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate unrelated things they good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution ... for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

man Christ\nTheir goal is literally my best friend in the world he was the best man at my wedding love your morning show or what do you say Joe Somebody who your friends are up to your your Larry\n[laughter] all of them that you know I I may be oversimplifying this but I equate this was something as simple as [noise] what do you think some like Cory Booker\nOr a I'm Chuck Schumer would do if they were sitting in a supermarket checkout line and people kept button in front of them you don't think they've created thing um and that's\nThe way I look at the racial thing if you're in line Joe as a great point if logical it resonates it should be an ad playing in every district and I doubt the Republicans are smart enough to do it I'm Larry O'Connor don't forget life liberty and within this Sunday a brand new episode it's the mark Levin show [noise]\n\nWe're we're trying to get I mean we're trying to get some answers although it looks like they're probably killed him it looks like they probably killed him but in looking at that there is a lot more here than just\nThis K but no ... we just want to use it just took credit so Trump is in the seventies it gives you believe murders okay\nI've you know I I don't know for ... and when she says that Saudi Arabia was somehow inspired by what Trump said is the dumbest thing ever because\nTrump never said that the media the price was the enemy of the people he never said that ever just like Sarah Palin never said I can see Russia from my house Tina Fey set up but all these more ons out their thought well just in the\nTrunk never said that the press was the enemy of the people what he said was fake news was the enemy of the people\nBut the the media that shrieks and his is whenever it's criticize this is this the the media that literally made up more fake news he never said that the price as the enemy of the people he said fake news with the enemy of the people\nAnd I hardly think that that is\nSomething that ... that's just dumb it's a dumb hot take from ... who is that what you get when you get when you talk with her [noise] so turkey says\nHey believe us if you've got all this stuff on record we got all these recordings we've got I mean we totally had the recording of him getting murdered and all this stuff and but then they they say yeah but we're not going to share it with anybody my ... told press yesterday\nWell I haven't heard a tape I haven't seen a transcript [noise] they they released some surveillance photos identifying an intelligence officer in the Saudi crown princes entourage as being involved but they didn't release any like audio anything like that\n... to [noise]\nI just the whole thing coming back to whether or not the principals involved the whole thing priests opposes that\nHis entourage people within his entourage decided to go rogue and I just don't I just I just find that doubtful I really do\nBut the way that we have to obviously we were things require an investigation but we are talking with people who think that just mere accusations can condemn someone wife too you know at the destruction\nJim Acosta who got mad until somebody to go up off last night on Twitter had this to say it's audio somebody for\nRecord of an angry mob lawyer John\nRoberts and ... with the crowd journalist\nWas wrestling with body\nAnd sorrow edging\nTowards this doesn't have anything to do with Saudi Arabia so I really don't give a flying rat's ass about this ... of autism but\n[noise] yeah so we'll get to it later yeah he said I just I don't want to feel like listening to him that much\nYou know what I mean it's just I guess he just he aggravates me I hit friday it's rainy I'm tired he aggravates me I and and and but he says the same thing that you hear me to\nResent scanned everybody else say oh well you know Trump is he is the reason Saudi Arabia kill people because of Donald Trump because you guys know that\nNo one in any Middle Eastern country ever handle anything political like this ever until Donald Trump came into office and ... and that that fake news is the enemy of the people here's the thing since he didn't say that and the prices insisting that he did just by their own logic they're the ones who are inspiring violence not him\nBecause they're the ones who were insisting that he called them the enemy of the people when he called the news the enemy of the people so the prices are responsible and if you really want to go that far and have that argument which all argument should be based in truth\nThat's the reality of the situation this\nNew defense and this is how the media is reacting to if you want to search for answers as to why this happened\nBecause it does seem weird doesn't it\nLike seriously the crown prince is going to go after some dude who wrote for the Washington Post to was a legal American resident he wasn't a citizen who is a legal American resident who lived in Turkey or who lived in London and assemble\nWhy in the world is the crown prince going to go after that guy so he was critical of the crown prince of seems weird because there are other people who have been dissidents but they you know I mean are walking around a live\nSo in searching for questions as to why this happened\nAnytime you ask a question anytime you try to get into maybe the back story like was there some sort of did he was there something between these two in the past like what's up\nUh well this is how the media handles that quote headline conservatives mount a whisper campaign to marry in ... in defense of Trump\n... so that's how they treat it if you are if you ask questions and you try to get into his background that's how they treat it because again nuances dead and these people are ethic moron\nNo I'm not using any nicer words because these people don't merit the energy of a more creative way to stay more on their moron it's it's insane\nPeople what I mean in order to figure out what happened you kinda have to go back into someone's pass to figure out if there's something else other than him just writing hurt feelings words in Washington Post that triggered the crown prince\nSo that's a big question and so that's what a lot of people have been doing a lot of people have been looking back into his previous political uh associations et cetera\n... there is the story of him being associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and apparently he was associated and this is according to a couple of other he was associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and he was and it was through that perspective that he was apparently critical of uh the crown prince\nAnd a Patrick pool who is a terrorism correspondent for PJ Media said that ... was a friendly and associated with\nFighters in Afghanistan that oppose the Soviet Union in Nineteen eighty eight he was one of notes pool a number of a journalist who had interviewed bin Laden in the eighties and nineties and he himself had had had apparently treated staff previously or had written stuff about uh the Muslim Brotherhood prior\nAnd the federalist have noted that as well [noise] um the\nShawn Davis over the federalist to tweeted it's almost like reality is quite different than the evidence free narratives pedal by the media with a long history of cooperating with or getting duped by Iran echo chamber architects\n[noise] and ...\nFor the media to say that this was a whisper campaign to try to whatever Trump I don't think people get that much of a crap about his reputation in this as opposed to well how is it that this is again you're a columnist for the Washington Post\nSo I Can't go to ... dot com that's load max fast dot com and use promote Dana for free shipping load max fast dot com\nIs

in love [noise]\nRadio dot com [noise] I Know that there's a lot of discussion about this will be more destruction on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me go to the point that I think is most disturbing right now\nThe reporting the jury for sure may have with U.S intelligence delivered a shit with an enemies with the crown prince envious of Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that one of the people that he took it actually\nGoes on in the circus soldier didn't just come out and we don't have I just want to be there for our viewers we do not have that reporting I'm not sure\nWhere you're getting from my backside I mean [laughter] [noise]\nThat's walking Castro the male version of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nHis twin brother who Leon Castro he and his twin brother did a switch through several years ago at the San Antonio river walk parade\nThe walking was mayor and ... on was something else and now one of the U.S rather than the others in HUD or ... or do something I look like they're not very political parents ... yeah it is they did they totally Lindy low hand that river barge\nAnd they didn't tell anybody and then afterwards when they were like well why ... ... you know the the guy they said well we can help it that we look alike mhm that\nWas their whole that's literally what they said I'm just I'm fascinated by this whole thing I'm absolutely fascinated by it so I don't he there's they're kooky already\nI'm and I'm not I'm not surprised at that ... says that he wants to run for president twenty twenty\nWhich is slightly terrifying but you know there it is\nBut yeah walking Castro says his twin brother says yeah you know I mean you know because Jared Kushner's a Jew and us Jews\nTotally can tell Middle Eastern arid to kill people because that's how it works wow does that sound lightly anti Semitic anybody else\nAre we the\nLike maybe one one thousand twenty fourth anti Semitic you think golly [noise] I Can't believe he did that with a straight face that hum wow and the the\nWay a puppy Harlow which job it was probably Harlow who was talking to him and she said well we we don't have that reporting we ... we we don't know what your we don't know where you've got that we don't we don't have that reporting you're always sort of feel like everything was may have in a baby in there\nWhich is so stupid\nYeah I mean I'm Glad that she just you know shot it down immediately I don't know what he is I don't I have no idea\nI mean it's just crazy it's just it's just crazy you want to talk about\nBut yet you know it's conservative that are doing whisper conspiracy theories it's conservative that are doing a whisper campaign meanwhile walking cats are that well because Joe ... Gerald\nHe got the people killed that's really what he's saying a little one man ... thought out their golly\nJoaquin I mean that's pretty that's like some like beyond the frogs are gay you know what I mean like if you like really far out there\nThat's really far out there [noise] [noise]\nBut to her credit probably ... says yeah we we don't that's we don't have we don't have that she she says she was unfamiliar we haven't decided to make that up you sir [laughter] [noise] yeah we haven't decided to know his bro is not the dictator that's a different\nCastro Steve there are more than one pastor's more than one cat or a family from my reporting I Know Ira I've inside reporting\nOh do do do you get inside versus the same one is walking cash right [noise] well then ... afterwards when Daily Beast Daily Beast published a story well then Joaquin Castro issued a statement saying that he did not intend to use your cushion of orchestrating the killing of democracy ... I mean but I did\nHow do you not intend when you say well Jared Kushner gave them the Hitler killing these people I didn't mean to imply that he gave him the Hitler did kill these people but you said it but I didn't apply it no you you literally that it\nYeah it does the exact word but I didn't apply it was an implied literally it was more than that he's dead it [laughter] that's harder than an occasion\n[noise] oh my God he went and him can you imagine him and his brother their mom founded ... she was a co founder of La Raza they're crazy oh my gosh I don't even know if they do we know if it was never fully on I don't even know maybe that's why they got", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
