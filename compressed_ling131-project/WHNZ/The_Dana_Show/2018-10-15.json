I don't want you\nThe bill for me\nBut I'd like to have your ex petite expertise helping me so I explained to him how we met toward people got lifestyles or limit how we take them and help them every inch of the way through the planning process through the action process and help them become rich was hands on help\nAnd explain to him I Would like to have that kind of a contract with you a consulting contract like my customers pay me to consult them I Want to you consult me and I set up an agreement with him and he goes out to a great idea I've never thought about doing that for his whole life\nHe had all those dollars you'd never shared with anybody 'cause you just used it to build things\nAnd uh so she thought it was a great idea we set up this contract and I'm ... first consult the right\nThen I decided what when you do what it was really important is I have to know who I Want to be so the thing that became interesting to me was as I was reading a couple of other books on how to sign a lay offs and one of those ... guys who was talking about what a train laid out really is\nIt can't be the entire railroad is tracks\nAnd then there are what they called dire robbers in other words the dye rama is a little scene and the scene works by itself\nYou know you might have a campfire scene you might have a city scene you might have a a river Seine or mountain scene but they're little scenes that if somebody's standing in front of that little scene will be and go with that I started thinking wow\nThat's what really needs to be done before I get out my track software to start laying tracks all over the place I Need to know where those tracks going to go where are they going just like where are you going to live where are you going to live\nRight we're all distracts going to go to\nAssert realizing it's these dire rabbits so I started thinking up scenes and I went in my garage up all my buildings and houses and equipment and things that I was going to stick on this you know platform here on the river lay out\nAnd started looking into like do I really want that on there or is that just so pledged picked up I don't know what I started designing seasons\nIt came to me that there were like three or four or five really big ... like\nThe majority of your way out ... reason for being just like it says what do you do to make a living how much living do want to make what comes down to the same thing how big do I want this lay out 'cause how many of these big scenes do I want\nAnd the larger than the more big seems I Need my life the more lay out I Need well that's the same thing you how many big things do you want in your life\nYou know I wanted to be a power lifter I wanted to be a ... glitter and I wanted to be a body builder that's a big thing that is taken up sixty one years of my life you took up the first thirty intensely\nUm but it has hung around as a hobby for the second third but that's a big thing in my life I wanted to be rich\nThat took up all sixty years of my life but it's a big thing it's a picture I see myself as rich it's a direct ... look here I Am this is who I Am look here I'm a body builder look at me here's who I Am these are pictures of yourself\nWhen you look in the mirror who are you seeing what do you want to be what you want to have\nSo I started coming up with these directors and I started driving around looking for things and looking at videos for places and things that I wanted to model and I realized that exactly what you have to do when you come to lifestyles I went to this party last night fifty people all the millionaires\nBut they all model being a millionaire from lifestyles and they all know each other and we're all best friends because they're all living the same model and I ask you I haven't seen you forever what are you doing it's always fishing and traveling and this and that they spend their life living life\nBecause they're millionaires\nThey will spend their like not had one guy told me oh I'm working working working working and I just looked at it would cross eyed like why\n... ... ... good good people do that we work I go\nOh look at everybody else in the road here\nThis guy's a camper guy he just got a motor home he goes everywhere he wants to go this guy over here's a traveler flies every world wants to go you know everybody has a hobby everybody is talking about where they went this year what they've done well said well hey we got a copy each other where we go and you've been there I Want to go there I Want to go there ever\nCatch what it's all about\nSo now I'm Out looking for these diet Ramos of my life\nWhat little pictures I Want to do I did cobble I've done ... three times in my life ... seen do understand that and man every time I go come around the train wreck back to Kabul and I live that direction I had the greatest time I really love going to Kabul\nIs incredible I Love skiing Everytime I go up to one of these ... credible ski resorts and spend a week there in the snow the beauty the smell the cleanliness the fund the athleticism the partying the drinking\nThat die rama man I ... in my brain right now I can see it in

Trump is should do to ... ... ... he should take uh he should seriously do like a twenty three me thing\nI Do think it was interesting that uh\nThis morning he tore in Florida and he's like not even paying attention to her and she went on for hours this Twitter rampage talking about this and then the Boston Globe had to come up to oh no sorry we screwed up\nWe I'm Sorry we messed up a she's actually a one one thousand something of a Peruvian and whatever which they they use that to stand in for Native Americans but but point out she's now she's saying well it proves my native ancestry which it doesn't\n[noise] she said Cherokee where tobacco she specifically said she wished Cherokee she\nLiterally signed her name and the ... cookbook is Elizabeth Warren hyphen Cherokee\nShe used to that\nTo identify on documents when she applied for jobs in the late eighties when she was at the University of Pennsylvania law school in eighty seven is when she changed her ethnicity and Harvard said she was a Native American and they called her quote their first woman of color in ...\nThat is a really inconvenient fat that a lot of people are missing she very very subtly moved to the goalpost and of course everyone wants to circle the wagons so to speak\nThat's what they're doing media to the defense so I have to tell you to you guys know my [noise] you guys know my I'm a\nTemperament when it concerns biased right I got to let me share something with you I got to share this with you because I thought this is funny sites we did a bunch of stuff earlier and I even said you know most Americans have like some form of you know Native American ancestry\nSo that hill decided they were going to look into my tweets and everything I say it's always an array spokes person even though they act like one part of what I Do\nI Do radio program id television commentary an author I write I Do all kinds of stuff but anytime I like blink at dinner a spokesperson so that they can try to denigrate or a group that I work with which is separate from everything else\nAnd they so this reporter from the hill I got this has this report from the hills doing a story about dental ashes tweet on all of this war and uh where did she come up with the and I guess they're quoting him or the most Americans of Native American ancestry where did she come up with that data information\nOh really so I decided that's go ahead and respond to this because it's just you know how I Do it's just how I Do right so I put it out there and like hey guys by the way the hills getting ready to run a um how do they put it I mean I mean make sure I Want to read myself correctly [noise]\nShe uh uh\nOn all is it an honor to listen to foreign um her comments nobody nobody is writing about the video no one's written about any that I just found out that the hell is preparing a reaction story and tweets about Elizabeth Warren is a way to fight back for her they're going to look at everyone sweets as opposed to warns false claims why don't people trust media again\nSo it's interesting because the question that I was quoted ended up being vastly different from the article that they literally just ran and of course they ran in our a spokesperson\nThat's what they ran you know because I'm not I apparently media people think that women can't be anything else like it's never been to lash radio show host Dana lash best selling author ads and our a spokesperson\nHadn't said anything about any of that\nI'm Talking about it now I realize that's so troubling for me you know people it's so hard for you\nBut yeah that's how the hell ran but they did walk it back\n[noise] ah because of that they quoted question that I got was very very aggressive and I'm like you this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen but they I mean it's fascinating and I even asked I said you know or any of these journalists going to talk about this video here where she says her family's racist because her mom was Joel I'm Native American\nThat they didn't want her dad Mary and her\nMom [laughter]\nSo that this is to make up a story like that\nSo the media began spinning TNN quote Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of the DNA Analysis showing she has just didn't Native American ancestry which could preempt further questions in attack should she run for president in twenty twenty now that's the whole point of this by the way\nJust to you know ... ... all of this was only ever countering Trump's attack this\nWas hurting her and it ended up making it worse it ended up making it worse\nThere are so many good pieces and tomorrow we're going to talk to twyla Barnes the Cherokee genealogist that Elizabeth Warren would have nothing to do with\nAnd I think a lizard with Warren a insult to her when she came out that famous geneticist trying to instill twyla Barnes I think with her wording\nElizabeth Warren is still a fraud she also wants claim to be the first nursing mother to take the New Jersey bar exam and the the New Jersey bar the New Jersey judiciary said that\nWhat she she's a ... that's what she did\nShe actually was considered a minority hire at Harvard she lifted literally lifted herself as a minority and you have to fill that out you have\nTo identify yourself they don't just like do it for you don't listen to the people who were like oh I Know that that didn't\nStop she listed herself that way [noise] and she they actually she and then\nAnd there is proof of all of this they have you guys really they a PDF of all the stuff like her applications how she was listed in the academic journals it all is out there so stupid and pointless to try to argue this otherwise\nI mean she that this was back during the time when everybody was under under\nPressure to diversify their hiring so Harvard was like well if we can say we have we diversified are hiring and she was able to get a job I\nHow many actual Native American she disenfranchised by taking these spots\nI mean she I mean\nGoodness there was a a really good piece about her and the Atlantic um let me ... that is really gets into I mean she has pretty much faith almost everything\nAnd make an ... I wrote this skating takedown peace are saying that\nThere is so many problems and she went after a her book the two income trap\nMaking ... an academic takedown of her book of Warren's book you have to go read the whole thing because I mean she gets into the weeds very much so [noise] but um for instance um my friend David French wrote about her signature work of academic scholarship same warm made a name for herself in the pre Obama\nCarriers with a pair of studies claiming that medical bills were responsible for an extraordinary share of American bankruptcies this research presented the left with an ideal talking point that the ... the medical system wasn't broken it was a pressing\nBut they said that I'm warning her coauthors classified of medical bankruptcies any bankruptcy that included a thousand dollars in medical debt a cetera et cetera\nBut I mean basically they it was\nThey they it was ridiculous making them a guard all events that her work it so much attention because it comes from a Harvard professor professor and this isn't Harvard caliber material not even Harvard undergraduate and she all accomplished by leveraging a fake Native American ethnic ethnic claim\nWe
