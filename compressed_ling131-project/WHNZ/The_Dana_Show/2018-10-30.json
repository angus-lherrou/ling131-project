see that in a blue check how\nAll of these people getting verified this guy was a very good night\nSo I just\nI'm ... and he said some really awful really horrible nasty things and\nThis is a I mean I'm just looking at some of the country I mean I don't know how people can think like us the guy was consumed with hatred that's the one thing I think to take away from that he was just absolutely consumed with hatred\nAnd this uh I mean it was just it it it led him his the fact that he was so consumed with it has led led to this so\nUm [noise] I I Know there's we got another with other developments is while they're going to too but this uh\nHas also sparked a huge discussion on security at synagogues and churches and it further added\nFuel to the fire that we've had it on going in this nation about discussions with tone and et cetera et cetera let me let me let me say this I've been thinking about how to put this because I don't believe that words themselves are violent\nI Am a free speech purist I Do not believe that words themselves are violent I don't believe that speech is going to harm someone I don't believe\nThat uh you know I I don't just like I didn't I didn't say this when when the who is that I'm not going to say his name the guy who went up and shot the ball field the congressional ball field I don't blame that on\nBernie Sanders like I was a staffer for Bernie Sanders he worked for Bernie Sanders he was ... like a lifelong Democrat I don't believe that Democrats are responsible for that in order I Believe Bernie Sanders was responsible for that and that\nGuy was in that job I think this\nHate was responsible for what he did and he hated the president by the way for people who are saying that the president of some sort of big anti Semite well it really didn't work out I mean he must be a horrible anti Semite for having a\nYou know a Jewish advisor and a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren I mean what a horrible anti Semite this guy is can we just stop trying to blame every I cannot stand when people seize upon horrible tragedies and they use it like ... petty Little Women little mean girls and they use it as ways to get political jabs at people\nI don't buy I don't buy your protest Asian I don't buy that you care about what happened if you seize upon it\nAnd you're immediately using that as a weapon ... completely out of place to go after someone simply because you hate that person politically this dude was consumed with hate and there are a lot of people in politics that are absolutely consumed with hate and that is the problem [noise]\nThese are people who are so consumed with hate they just hate the fact that there exists someone who thinks differently from them and the fact that someone exist to think differently that to them as a personal effect it do they believe that the existence of different thought is the same thing as the middle finger extended\nThey think that's how they look at it he was consumed with hate and I don't know I've always felt that big it should be absolutely Sean\nI don't like big it's I don't like anti Semite I don't like people who use people's beliefs and ethnicities as a mark against them I think it is the cheapest trashy asked most back way of thinking\nIt really is it is the laziest a form of thought it is the laziest form of thought\n\nAnd that I have a always felt this way and this dude was consumed with hate absolutely consumed with hate\n\nThat's what that's the problem with this this is the fault of this now I saw and I'm going to get into some of the media stuff because the people out there who immediately went and were screaming at the president and talking about tell which I have no idea how to help people came to that conclusion quite frankly [noise]\nThey they were mad because they didn't like the the his expression of sympathy they were mad at you know something I mean it is it it it's it's awful every everybody is walking you to comment section essentially and that's what Twitter and I think some social media has become\nPeople didn't like they don't like they didn't they didn't like the trumps tone on the caravan and they're trying to when he was saying that people just can't enter the country illegally and somehow they're saying that that was\nWorth that kind of fuel this which again the guy who did this didn't like the president at all and even said so and his verified social media accounts which apparently still exist on Twitter all of these people who were concerned about tone where the hell where these people when you have folks like Andrew\nCuomo who made the declaration that people who who were Second Amendment or who were pro life for people who you know that they had no place in New York or where\nI'm a ... you had a bill de Blasio saying similar or or wrong Emanuel's saying that these people who believe in in in a Christian faith or cetera et cetera that they have no place in New York or no place in Chicago or\nYou know they they don't belong here they where where where where people when when they were expressing\nThat sort of that sort of rhetoric\nAnd let me ask you this where the ever\nLoving Haiti's where these people if they were so concerned about tone and they were so concerned and there are so upset at the administration if you're mad at the administration then wouldn't you also it's just going down that same line wouldn't you also be infuriated over somebody like Louis Farrakhan calling people who are Jewish calling them termites\nA ...\nI think that there are again there are people who very much would love for the country to be divided would very much love and I'll have more stories on that ... kind of Republican Party office in South Daytona as we get them let's take another quick flash\nFlood producers five [noise] Mm [noise]\nUh so let's start with let's say I I Want to kind of also lighten it up a little bit because this has been a very long weekend and\nI'm just is also horrible it's just a horrible\nTime for headlines so construction for workers found a bunch of teeth inside of wall\nAnd Valdosta involves do stood Georgia construction workers found a thousand about a thousand teeth human teeth inside a wall they buildings first tenant was a dentist named Dr Clarence weddings Dan [noise]\nOkay so that explains the fact that there are key there but OK I'm not a dentist do you guys put them in walls like I don't know how that\nWorks is that what the Daily Times also said that they've founded teeth in the walls of two and two other Georgia cities as well in both in buildings that previously had dental office as tenants\nSo they throw them away there that's all I Know about the story is their seriously like do you do tend to put teeth like is that a thing I\nHave no idea how that would be in there but there that's OK anyway moving on I just I find that fascinating [noise] had a Kanye West has debuted the the black that\nClothing line is what it's called for a it's a door seem to campaign for black voters as if the Democrat Party a it was unveiled at the young black leadership stomach in D.C on this Saturday at features a selection of

I'm ... I'm a capitalist and I think it's smart if you're going to try to brand something and people like Randy and and by the way if you will pay attention to fashion big branding and big logos from the early nineties or back again so that like\nThis is very much a cultural a pop culture thing moving on down the line Starbucks is releasing which is brew frappuccino that looks disgusting and has eleven ... thousand calories two hundred and Seventy calories this one thing it's purple\nAnd it has a bunch of weird stuff in it it's a webpage with it which is proof frappuccino and it's filled with outwards toads breath and lizards scale that's what it says if you want to know more about Google it has a disgusting that find that ... are also\nThere is no Cal cuddling anew wellness trend and across three hundred dollars for a for Ninety minutes session if you're feeling stressed out by the world and the stupid people that are arguing politics well you need to check out cow cuddling\nI've maybe it'll come to a city near you it's like goat yoga with cuddling cows interacting with animals it's uh the horse and how experience is three hundred for Ninety minutes session three hundred dollars to go and have a cow I mean how many of us know farmers out there [noise]\nEverybody raises their hand stay with us [noise]\nThe Purple Heart foundation\nHas been one of the longest running supporting sponsors of this program the dedicated men and women of the Purple Heart foundation work tirelessly to provide for veterans and their families nationwide and I'm proud to partner with them because of your general support the Purple Heart foundation has been able to provide one on one support our honored soldiers after\nThey return home and the Purple Heart foundation doesn't just serve those combat wounded they serve all veterans and their families\nIf you have a vehicle you no longer need running or not donated today to the Purple Heart foundation and rest assured knowing your donation is providing invaluable services for veterans in need\nThey'll pick up your vehicle free of charge they also take cash donations which do have the most immediate impact\nThe Purple Heart foundations programs only exist because of donations from patriots like you for more information go to give to Purple Heart dot org that to give to Purple Heart dot org or you can call a date for one for forty four eighty three that eight eight for one for forty four eighty three gift to Purple Heart dot org\n... job get drawn to send us representative Ron decide to say gubernatorial nominee who recently was accused of using racially tens language nobody was it was attacked by the Democrat Party in Florida regurgitate it by the broader media\nWhen he talked about the socialism monkeying up the the Florida economy that wasn't racially tinge but let's go on ... four times a conference was organized by conservative activists activists who said that African\nDana radio dot com [noise]\nStart incorporating holiday music can although this\nOf a song it's an everyday song [noise] that's where we are\nWe are I'm watching for the latest developments about not only the the bomber who is in court today but also this\nUm the a huge huge shooting that was that the a synagogue over the weekend and then of course\nThere is also reports of a Lucia ... county Republican office people fired shots in their\n...

also about to some of the stuff that uh some of the the victims of the synagogue attack as well\nAnd now there's an effort to really go after speech on social media and just some of the the the media reaction which I think has not helped\nAt all I mean it's just really weird to me that anybody would would while you are while you\nWere condemning and criticizing what you feel is hateful speech that you would engage into like for instance has to say adios somebody twenty to this is exactly what I'm Talking about here um it's really it seems very weird for me to hear someone attempt to try to criticize\nTone when you do this listen\nOur lives as much as I may have criticisms allow law enforcement operate in this country they are still our line of defense against maniac some terrorists out there but I I have to say nickel and this has always been a problem with this president is always shown they supposed to be dismissive this towards terrorism\nAll it is a ... a terrorist sympathizers given the way that he responded what happened in Charlottesville\nGiven how he responds go she'll be given the fact that she if she puts what's happened today in service winning and the concept of how it affects the midterm elections we don't have a leadership in this country when it comes with domestic terrorism this president fool with it as much as he is occasionally for speech against it\nMm okay that is just really ignorant and this is why I think it's incredibly ignorant a\nFirst off to say that the ... this administration for them to suggest that he's responsible do realize that this is the president who didn't just talk about recognizing Jerusalem as the capital he actually move\nThe embassy there he moved to the embassy to Jerusalem he made it a top priority to find an arrest the last\nNazi war criminal in the United states and deport him back to Germany I mean you you you he as far as the guy had in the education department civil rights office tennis markets is leading that I mean he\nRuns the ah the center for human rights under law the nonprofit\nIt's all about a advancing Jewish people's civil rights or what about the case that his administration reopened that it's a seven year old seven or eight year old turn eight or nine year old case uh I'd have to go back and looked at was brought against um Rutgers\n\nBy a group that said the Obama administration who closed the case ignored evident that showed the school was allowed and encouraged a hostile environment to Jewish students what about defending Israel at the United nations\nOr\nDestroying the Iran deal how about working with Saudi Arabia which recognizes Israel's right to exist over countries like Iran which does not well what about cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Palestinians\n\nI mean I can sit here and go on and on and on and on\nThere was I'm a huge uh Jerusalem Post had a huge piece on just Nikki Haley they wrote quote Haley didn't simply defend Israel she let a game changer on her watch it with the blessing of US President Donald Trump support for Israel became a with us or against us proposition\nOr how about the administration force the PLO to shut down its office in Washington DC\nYeah because they said they stalled out peace talks and uninterested impeach piece shut it down\n\nI mean this this is is insane to this to Jess Jen that suggestion is really insane and I\n[noise] looking back now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring up a man on a mission to retire America One hell bumps and he's looking back to\nDo on the radio show today I'm Talking about um syndication 's real estate's indications and now the world is now saturated with people out there on the Internet just doing anything they can do as far as content to get you to connect with them so they can get you to invest in syndication blindly\nAnd that's what's happening is that you're investing blindly to people that are blindly investing into deals because why\nWhy does syndicator ... want to tell you to get into deals because they're making fees they don't care if the property profits or not that's not to their biggest advantage when they tell you you're earning three or four percent five percent return\nThat's not what they're earning earning millions of dollars now here's the thing is crazier when you listen to these guys they will tell you that you were a pansy\nFor buying small deals I'm telling you the small deals are the ones we made the absolute most massive profits on two hundred three hundred four hundred percent returns I've made on small apartment complexes anywhere from twenty to a couple of hundred units\nThese guys who want to use a glut of by thirty forty fifty a hundred million two hundred million dollar deals\nBecause they're getting a fee based on the price of the property the larger the property the larger the be the faster they get rich the more these big deals they can push through the more fees they make the rich or they get they don't care if the deal makes any money or not\nYour money's locked away for Ken maybe even Twenty years at three to four percent return\nDo you really want that when you could have it investing yourself\nOr if you're not that I Do that at least if you invest with the members of lifestyles remember lifestyles doesn't do deals were in education and metro but one of our members out there you could get with one of those\nAnd by the way one of the benefits of coming to lifestyles is you don't have to go with the blowhard guy on the Internet\nWe have hundreds of indicators that you get to meet and no personally before you ever in touch with them really nice smart educated successful syndicator\nYou get to go look at their properties tour of them get to know them look at their financial statements\nYou get to know everything about the ... the once you once you have two hundred plus to pick from [noise] you don't have to go with the blowhard that irritates the crap out of you because you know he's just a blow heart\nYou can go with the people that are all about success in profit you could look at the profitability\nIn fact I thought it was interesting I saw on the Internet an interview between as solicitor\nAnd another solicitor from lifestyles are what are the losers from lesser said I Want to show you that I'm very proud that I Want all these national park association award for best product best price\nI Won the award for best place to work and I won\nBest citizen civic citizen of the city for putting out a product that really changed the neighborhood and really gave back\nI've also got charities and so on and stuff I work and the other syndicated goes I don't give a crap about any of that it means nothing all I care about is how much you can syndicate the more you can syndicate them more money you can make and that's all I care about there's no need to worry about quality it's all quantity\nDo you really want to invest with that kind of a personality\nThat's what you're running into out there they're all over the Internet you just buy one after another after just go look up people on the Internet talking\nOut there speaking about the stuff I'm the loan guy who tells you I don't want you to put your money in my deal I'm not soliciting you I'm teaching you to be the solicitor I'm teaching you to\nBe the educated passive investor right I'm not out for your money they are\nI'm here to protect you I've made my life goal to protect you why do I not do it because I don't need other people's money to buy real estate I can buy giant deals with my own money why well because I've been very successful\nFor twenty eight years actually Thirty years of investing it because every time I make a major giant large gain that throws up a ton of money I invested back and again\nI like owning my own deals no I've done syndication don't get me wrong I'd done it for multiple reasons one because when the market crash in two thousand eight I wanted to buy everything we can get her hands on where\nWe kicked butt every one of the people in those deals are posed a hundred percent returns that just a couple of years unbelievable deals because the market was down\nNow when I can offer those kinds of hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred percent return to people that all the ... my own money because I don't want to say I'm going to give you a deal\nThat earn six and by the way most of our deals are in between six to ten percent return on the cash flow at this time right now which is a two thousand Eighteen in October two thousand Eighteen marketplace is high prices are high so were earning six to ten percent\nBut the differences wording six to ten percent after the syndicator takes his bite these indicators out there on the Internet or tell you the ring three to four percent and then they're taking a bite\nSo guys you're getting much red but the differences were setting it up where you can also get some of the tax benefits they're taking all the tax benefits that almost all these deals you're getting almost no tax benefits at all\nWe're able to refinance our to give you cash back a hundred percent tax free they're not refinance you got the cash and give it back to you\nThere cross collateralized their deals their equity in that deals giving them the way to go to another deal they are re leveraging your own deal that you're in you not understand that they are taking advantage of you they're ripping you off there over leveraging the deal you ran\nTo do the next deal these people are crooks guys\nCome a wake up\nNow we START I went out and spent millions of dollars to buy a training program that's college level I hired his doctorate of educational science to put the thing together we bought the software called bridge and we have educational models [noise]\nFor every single thing you need to do whether it be a lead for a pass that's what you need to do and remember this until you do that you're not doing the right have a wonderful day we'll see them all [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou know radio show every can obtain their you know we can't get enough\nTo go on the radio not God was you know we really enjoy the conversation [noise]\n\nWhich I'm going to come back to him just a moment 'cause that's why we're talking and simple jak basically he did Sean Penn when Sean Penn played I Am Sam it was like that but worse [noise]\nOkay [noise] so well you can't say that you can't say that any more so\nHis ... his acting was so bad and simple jacket got all these negative reviews and ready to kill this isn't a movie Tropic Thunder\nSo then you have comedian Jeff ... who is you know a FARC comedian basically\nAnd he's also a huge drug user and then you have Kirk Lazarus played by Robert Downey junior he's a five time off go when a he's a British Shakespearean trained act a method actor and he completely goes full method for every role right every role\nAnd so or no he's not British she's Australian and so they decide\nFor Tropic Thunder yeah just the Vietnam War veteran who writes this book um what's his name for at least ... back he writes this book and it's about memoirs of his rescue during the Vietnam War\nAnd it was it he lost both hands in it and it's like they're going to make it into this big war movie and so they cast all these actors and ah you know Ben Stiller's looking at it like as big comeback role\nAnd they and they go through basically they go through this big budget war movie and they're supposed they're told that there's it's a new way of directing and they're told by the director who subsequently is killed accidently later on in the movie or that\nThere's hidden cameras all over and they're supposed to recite their lines and do all of this and so they're doing this but they actually come across them like ooh guerrilla fighters and who are real and they think that those are actors and so that's how the movie goes it's insane and they don't know any of this\nSo Kirk Lazarus the whole movie is about making fun of stereotype and making fun of people who are so sensitive to political correctness that's literally the crux of the movie [noise] people who don't get it these are the people who get ticked off over South Park for crying out loud and The Simpsons Kirk Lazarus in the movie Robert Downey junior do show\nThat in this movie he died his skin black black face for the entire movie he becomes a full fledged black man he gets rid of his Australian blond hair and he has said as short afro\nHe he didn't say he dies skin permanently black okay he changes the way he talk so that he can convincingly\nPortray a black man right that's how this is going [noise] so are we talking about this right now well let's bring you up to speed up its Halloween right\nHalloween everybody dresses up but everybody's super sensitive about the way that people are dressing up right\nEverybody know Shaun White the a snowboarder was it like a brilliant time gold medalist or something I don't even know so he was that a Halloween party over the weekend\nAnd he posted a photo of himself dressed as Ben Stiller's character simple jak from the film Tropic Thunder now simple jak\nThe character that Ben Stiller played in Tropic Thunder ... was a he was mentally or develop he was mentally developmentally challenged pay and there was one line from the film\nAnd this is what Kirk Lazarus told him in the film\nSo don't get mad at me he says you never he goes quote you never go full retired in ... is what he says to Ben Stiller and he's like that's why you're rolling simple jak were so bad\nSo anyway Shaun White decides to dress up as simple jak from the movie and guess what happens to everybody\nThought oh you dressed up as Ben Stiller's character from Tropic Thunder right\nI mean Ben Stiller never got any and nothing about it neither by the way to Robert Downey junior who went on to play Iron Man a and is like a ... millionaire and had a complete resurgence of his career and he was literally in blackface run entire film nobody said anything because everybody got the point right or wrong\nEverybody lost their mind\nI'll burn which\nIs [laughter] George's in pitchforks and torches and pitchforks\nAnd everyone lost their mind and they all went after Shaun White they went after Sean right the Special Olympics went after Shaun White people have never even seen that movie when after Shaun White\nAnd they said disability isn't a joke and or is it a punchline were so mad that he went and the character from a movie that Ben Stiller play but we're not that have\nBeen still are for playing a character who played this character in a movie he was a dude who played another dude who is planning to do it in the movie\nLiterally also another line for Tropic Thunder authored by Kirk Lazarus who completely appropriated and entire ethnicity and accent and style speaking that he perceived as a white Australian in order to method act for this role\nSo everyone called him a real P. O. S. they went after him they just murdered him on line [noise]\nAnd so now he issued a statement saying quote I owe everyone in the Special Olympics community an apology for my poor choice of Halloween costumes the other night it was a last minute decision it was the wrong one the Special Olympics were right to call me out on it they do great work supporting so many tremendous athletes and I'm Sorry for being insensitive lessons learned\n[noise] do you have thoughts Kane you have some thoughts lesson learned [noise]\nSo that nobody would matter Ben Stiller oh of course motives man he literally played simple jak he was he was Shaun White dress up as Ben Stiller who was plain simple jak\nRight he was dressing up as a character who played a character a which is exactly what Halloween is about actually um so now are we supposed to I mean honestly are we supposed to police\nEvery thing that we do in spite of the fun that's intended like Halloween is supposed to be fun Halloween is supposed to be dress up as something else as not you right that's really what it's about\nWhy are we even worried on the one day of the year that people dress up\nWater we worried about where we throwing the through the PC filter why are we doing the ...\nEither way I somebody just brought it to my attention that Robert Downey junior when he was in black face with the voice asked I patient\nAnd the short fro when he was dressed up as at white Australian actor who was playing a black character and he went full method indicted scan he received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor\nOr for that role\nIn the same movie that everybody's mad about Shaun White for\n[noise] I just I Need to put that I Need to put that out there a Steve you're ... you saw Tropic Thunder did you see did you see Shaun White dress up as the character who is playing a character in Tropic Thunder\nI Would understand so I have an awful soon as I Would understand if I'm there was insensitive us towards

nothing to do well and you can definitely do it was an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a

over at PJ Media joins us on this topic and we're so glad to have his expertise today Christian always so good to talk with you\nHey they're high\n[laughter] so so I guess the first question is can\nPresident do this because a lot of a lot of the discussion that I had seen and I feel like the right kind of divided on that\nPeople say well the president was you know President Trump was upset when former President Obama was using executive orders on DACA so wouldn't this kind of be that same formula but where it concerns birthright citizenship and then that's it you know obviously fourteenth amendment discussion but I guess the first part can he do that\nYeah I mean I'm not sure the tit for tat logic really works as a matter of constitutional law in other words well Obama issued a lot of executive order so we ought to get through to I I mean look it doesn't work that way what what matters is what the constitution\nSays and how the constitution has been interpreted and\nThere's a real serious question whether birthright citizenship is in the constitution and if it is\nNo executive order to change that and that's right probably some of the resistance on the right to your hearing\nYeah that that that would take on a congressional action and and Senator Lindsey Graham said today that he's already proposed legislation to support what the president's suggest in all of this seems to come down\nTo how the fourteenth amendment is actually worried it and I don't want to get to in the weeds with that because I mean I Know it would be very easy to do so but it's so for those listening it basically says and this is kind of the the crux of the concern all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states end of the state where and they reside isn't kind of the big fight\nReally focused on the fact that that whole subject to a jurisdiction\nA clause no one's ever ruled on that that there's a lot of ambiguity there and that's kind of why there's this debate\nRight and and listen subject to the jurisdiction there of give you a counter example if there is a diplomat in the United states\nUh who has a trial like it's a British diplomat or they're not subject to the ... the United states or the British ambassador and his new born baby or if there was an invading army uh and some people consider this to be an invading army\nUh then they're not subject to the ... the surfers are foreigners and so the real question is what the subject to address that you not have said to me and that has never really been fully flushed out\nYeah and that's that's the that's the big thing that's did in fact because some people think that that allows for birthright citizenship some people think that it doesn't\nI mean what do you what are what do you think about the idea that the reference to jurisdiction that doesn't mean it would it mean I mean your thoughts on this if you because obviously this is something that could go before I end up before the Supreme Court and who knows\nBut does it or would they need at least would would at least one parent need to be a citizen otherwise jurisdiction goes to the country of the parent that's a foreign national I mean and that's what ... what are your thoughts if if you had to look in a crystal ball and you could\nMaybe sort of bad on how this is going to kind of unfold where what where when you're standing be\nLook I think I think a great place to start as a fork in the road whether you're here legally or illegally\nAnd so if you're here legally even if you're seeking asylum right even if you're here and you've crossed the Rio Grande and you declare the journal asylum seeker at least you're within the system you're within
