Robert was great journalist [noise]\nAds\nAbraham Lincoln developed a phobia\nIt could be Robert ... who was going crazy I don't know if you notice or Robert Bentley was wondering about survival of the bottle and they don't really get jam all reason I did see Robert Daly or they are all of these generals\nThey look like they were the top of the class West Point there were the greatest people\nThere's only one problem\nThey didn't know how to held a when they didn't know how to find [noise] they didn't know how\nThe way he explains history is a riot it is hysterical so he was in Ohio right he's an Ohio and he was talking about a realist is as grand was from Ohio and he was going to you know talking about somebody notable from the state is cetera so\nHe in this story because everyone's like the proof that he's racist he's each of you saying nice things about Ravi proof that he's races [noise] he was actually talking about how he said yeah he was saying Robert ... he was a\nGood general but Ulysses Grant was greater and that's how we ended up losing\nHere's the thing I don't think that people here said that him saying this is racist and this might be it stretches like pat and\nBeing called a racist because\nHe believed that Ronald was a decent general or a good general you can hate Nazi ism but recognize someone at least understand strategy so you got to make sure that you you beat the crap out of them\nAnd here's the thing with Robert de leite Roberts Lee was a West Point grad he was a well respected for his understanding of\nBattle and I guess maybe they don't teach history and I don't know I saw a bunch of verified check marks everybody was freaking out all these media people they were saying that he was praising Robert Daly what he was saying was that Ulysses Grant was better and it was just Ohio and that was better and that's you know what happened\nBut the fact that they tried to make in like a racist I guess underscores the fact that these people either don't understand history because they weren't taught it or they're trying to be purposely ignorant\nBecause Robert he when he was asked he was given um a role of of a a general over the forces the unions forces before the civil war\nAnd they tried to recruit him and he was actually Robert he wrote a bunch of stuff against slavery he was not for secession he was not for he was a\nVery much I very reluctant he took ... days to think about this the reason ultimately that he ended up working with the confederacy is because he did not want to bear arms against his home state of Virginia\nAnd you know a divided his family it was but they are and then afterwards even he wrote a lot of stuff about unity and restoring the union et cetera et cetera he was very very reluctant\nAnd people I guess don't understand that portion of its history that no one wants to believe the secondary storyline or any nuance because it's\nAll a bunch of gotcha BS is what it is it's so stupid I'm this is I'm telling you what this is another example of all of this tribalism dumbing everybody down\nHow dumber you that you are wrong with that spin on that it was ... and it was everywhere oh my gosh you guys who was absolutely everywhere\nI've never seen such a thing I mean let me let me read this ... this was a reporter was us oh this is one of the guys at CNN here a trunk comments tonight calling the leader of the Confederate Army quote a great general multiple times\nWow wow [noise]\nThis is so ridiculous I'm\nThe first off he was praising grant he was talking about\nHow ah the point\nOf the whole story was how Abraham Lincoln chose a guy from Ohio to beat Robert really that was the whole point of his story\nThis is purposeful deception and it wasn't just the CNN\nDude a lot I got more and more examples is so many more examples frail it wasn't just this guy was there was a ton of um NBC News set a to watch President Trump says Robert he leaves a great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible what\nBell here's some more conventional wisdom says you know I'm a man on a mission to retire America One version at a mom's back in\nThe last segment do on the radio show earlier today\nI was discussing the fact that real estate investing is like watching a trained come down the tracks you can see it coming but you can get out of the way well here's an article that tells you that it's time to start paying attention to the train coming down the tracks it's an article says that adds\nA duly more than four interest rate hikes unlikely this year a dual use one is the New York representative of the Federal Reserve\nAnd he says hey we've had one rate increase quarter of a point\nBut we're into screening three to four more this year so that means interest rates when we were blocking our apartment to the three point eight five a couple of years ago now we're up into four point five interest rate we could end up at five point five now why do I tell you this\nBecause I bum you know because you need to start thinking about OK any interest rate changes I'm going to make in the future if I'm going to refinance or anything I'm going to have to\nFactor in fact in interest rates are going to be higher now they're telling me a year in advance that they're going to do this right\nSo should not be smart enough to understand that they're telling us this in advance so we can prepare for it so that we don't make bad investments decisions based on the lower interest rates we have today to higher interest rates were going to happen next year I mean I'm watching the interest rate every single day\nFor many reasons one also to be able to consult people's or what is it\nA realistic interest rate to look out for underwriting their project but also for all the funds that I Am sitting around everywhere you know probably twenty or thirty accounts I own um different bank accounts and I'm looking at what those interest rates are doing and where the rat and it it really makes a major difference I mean do you think about\nYou know if you've got ten million dollars or twenty million dollars or you're talking about a five percent interest rate if it gets back up to that is a million bucks a year when we repeat that if you get twenty million bucks five percent interest rate is a million dollars a year\nThat's a lot of money so you know you're looking at the positive side of the interest rates go up all of us with money are making more money as interest rates go up\nA ... the people that are buying real estate only need to factor that those interest rates are going to be higher and at some point the sellers of real estate are going to have to be realistic remember what I said earlier\nThe only reason you can't sell piece of real estate overnight is because you're not selling it for the appraised price you're tried to sell for more than it appraises for and then hope that they can squeak the appraisal in and get it done bottom line is\nWhen interest rates get up higher and higher and higher the sellers you're going to have to come off those aggressive sales prices is that going to hurt us no we're going to be buying it a little bit lower price paying a little bit higher interest rate net net net it's got to be the same thing it's a business we've got to make money we don't make money we don't get into the business\nRight now the only people that have to watch out or people that went into these deals are this year\nAnd they're going to refinance next year but not anticipating an interest rate changed for next year guys if you're buying a property right now and you're in a bridge loan or your hard money you need to think about how quickly can I get\nOut of these loans so that I don't feel the effects of three more interest rate hikes this was a time issue the train is coming down the tracks guys there it is we see it or telling you it's there there's no reason to panic\nThe logical thinking through what changes do I need to make my portfolio in the next six months to avoid any type of interest rate risk that's what you need to\nBe thinking about that will make it all happen All right [noise]\nLast article of the day I dug this without that just to prove a point that has nothing to do with the article but it was a good segue into my thought process and that was this is from the greater Houston partnership but they're talking about what are the fastest growing employment markets now\nThe reason that's important to real estate investing is wherever there's more important for every five jobs there's another rental unit rented\nFor every five jobs there's another rental unit rented this the ratio they go by sober more\nNew employment coming into your town right the higher your rents are going to be and the higher your occupancy is going to be so get this right here right out of the blocks Dallas Fort Worth a hundred and forty six thousand\nNew people hundred and forty six thousand coming in Houston Ninety four thousand four hundred and Seventeen net grilled\nAtlanta ... nine thousand Phoenix eighty eight thousand and it goes down the list but here's where it gets interesting guys the liberal states are starting to lose people why\nWell because those governments are failing they're going broke and their taxes are getting higher and higher and higher their cost of living is getting higher and higher and people are fed up with it and they had net negative employment growth\nPeople are moving away not employment growth but net negative\nPopulation growth okay so picky about somebody like Chicago Chicago is losing Thirteen thousand people this year\nThat's tax base property tax base that sales tax base that they're losing that personal income state income tax base they're losing now for the rest of you out there they haven't figured this out yet I think a bunch of just got your head in the sand if you live in one of these liberal states like California\nWhat's gonna happen to you this years your taxes are going to go up by twenty five to thirty percent because you have a twelve percent state income tax rate\nThat and you have high property taxes because you're properties are so expensive the rates low but these properties are expensive so you have taxes you used to be All right all that off against your federal income tax returns you no longer can folks\nThat means you're actually for the first time going to pay the taxes that you have been taxed by the government and in other words the giant money steal\nThat the state governments have been stealing from the federal government making all of us people in the rest of the country paper you guys to live it's over\nYou're going to pay to live like liberal whacked petunias and you're going to can throwing out money to all these welfare programs all these stupor super duper giveaways and you're going to go broke\nBut they're smart people that live where you're at they will they're going to come live with us they're going to come live in a rational society where people no longer try to live off of other people\nThink that went through a remember not the money is alive to see them off [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou know mom's ... radio show memory\nCan obtain the seven days and we can't get enough to go on the dot com bust you don't show up on and join the conversation [noise]\nThis white woman is going to appropriate your ethnicity and if you have a problem with that you're a racist\nHoly cow anyway I\nI just I don't I mean we're right yeah where they're so\nComing up and by the way speaking on this trial Barnes who is a genealogist for she's Cherokee genealogist entitled Barnes will join us because she has really follow this closely and I just don't know again like I said I just don't know why Warren didn't\nJust day from the get go that I thought\nI Believe in something that was incorrect down you know and just and then let it go from there\nShe'd be going from strength the strength right now instead of those\nThat's what's so frustrating about it I Can't stand when people make stupid decisions you know I just can't I cannot stand when people make stupid decisions when you clearly have better ones by the way I guess somebody Fifteen Swalwell clearly doesn't understand this is representative Eric Swalwell he clearly does not understand what any of this is about\nAre the different forces shoved or you know there's no evidence but she was not Native American a book you know I'm Glad that she stood up\nFor her so she's not going to fall in a bar the president of the president doesn't share facts don't matter what it said on Monday but if there were a million dollars if she proved it doesn't affect me as to what you do on a Tuesday I did want to see that throughout this campaign\n[noise] uh what\nYou said there was no proof that she was a I mean we now have it [noise] you know have the proof\nBecause you can't prove a negative than through that's not how fact work I think you are a rapist and because you can't prove you're not it's true\nHold my gosh these people these people are just not working\nAt it I don't know I'm almost at a loss for words here so I Want to because we have a couple of other things to touch on a we've talked about some of the crazy media um the way that the media has has handled all of this as well we are twenty two days out from the terms\nRight and\nI was looking at Emerson polling has new data out where they have a\nDean Heller at forty eight and Democrat challenger Jacky Rosen at a forty one any of a percent undecided or you have in the governor's race Adam lack salt is a forty six percent the Democrats teams just the lack is at forty one percent eleven percent are undecided\nShow Heller is pulling away a little bit\nBut I still think it's a tight race because this is this is just the latest from um\nThat's just the latest from from Emerson I still think it's a a a a pretty a tight race and I'm not the only person because there are there have been a bunch that have been um I moved from like likely tend to lean them you know et cetera et cetera\nBut that's actually that's kinda good that's good news though and looking at because the Nevada race Heller is one that I think\nIf they if they lost Taylor and they uh ended up end up losing a it well it's just let me put it this way it's making it more difficult for them to even have a chance at flipping the Senate if that makes sense because they would need a couple of senators to lose their beds\nIn order for that to happen so and looking at some of the um and looking at some of the the top Senate races a look at Missouri really quickly because we talked to James O'Keefe last hour or so the ... the average I mean it is I mean it's close\nTo our CPA average only has Holly up by Josh Hawley who the AG and a Republican challenger to ah income Claire McCaskill they have him it's it's forty six forty five a Holly and he's the I mean it's literally point for I mean it's very very very close\nUm and this is going to be the really this is a very interesting race for me um because Claire McCaskill has been a juggernaut in Missouri since two thousand and six when she first defeated Republican Jim Talent in two thousand and two\nAnd a this she I mean she looked like she might have lost and twenty twelve but then you had the ... situation and then a now Trump took the state by double digits\nAnd Brock Obama narrowly lost it uh in two thousand and eight Trump won by twenty points and it is a\nA lot of the voters that had that have always kinda been reliably Democrats have been really really disillusioned and so as a result this has been um\nHer luck maybe maybe out\nAs so that this is going to be very interesting state to wash in Nevada is an interesting state to watch just because the um the ideological demographic politically speaking has changed uh you have Dean Heller who's the incumbent jak euros and the Democrat challenger ... up by one point seven as to spread for our CPA average\nUm but I think it's a lot I think it's a little closer than that Emmerson has them a closer and cook has it a little bit closer or as well but will be will be checking that out Texas was one where everybody I think um\n[noise] a beta Rourke Robert or work the guy who again you want to talk about appropriation he kind of wants to suggest that he's Hispanic until you call them out on it and then he acts like your bad for assuming that he or white Irishman using a Hispanic nickname is in trying to suggest something [noise]\nUm and in Texas a Hispanic voters weren't going for the Democrat they're not as enthused about the Democratic as a Democrat Party needs him to be so his shtick is not working\nHis whole identity politics appeal which some might argue might be kind of racist or is not working but Cruz's up by seven in the our CPA spread which I think it's too close\nFor me by the way in Texas and if you notice if you go back and you look at the Wendy Davis situation you know go back and look more I I feel like they're working right now progressive in Texas\nBecause I've always said of Texas flips and becomes Democrat will never have another Republican in the White House again\nBecause Texas is what has been making sure that Republicans have the electoral votes to get in the White House or even be competitive and you've had Democrats have been trying to do the blueprint in Texas just like they've done in Colorado they'd Colorado you had like sixty three years of a Republican or administration\nAnd into election cycle with an influx from California and a progressive ideological switch they were able to change the state legislature and really change Colorado into a blue state even wrote a book on it literally called the blueprint and they were trying to do the same in Texas but it's proven to be a lot tougher not just because he expanse but because you were talking about generation after generation\nAnd just a very animating spirit of native Texans\nIt's very limited government minded\nUm I mean they teach Texas history in schools and you're taught about the Alamo and you're taught him and it is very much the reliance on the republic of Texas and so there is just a little different here a little different in Texas and so but they've been working at closing\nThat gap that is what they want these are all test runs and I think that Beto O'Rourke is still also a test run their whole goal is to just keep closing that gap every single election every single election which is why\nFor them winning isn't really the victory the goal is to close that gap and that's a victory if they're able to to make that spreads smaller than previous election that's a victory for them and that's what a lot of people have to realize you can't just sit back and be like oh you know you still like this many ...\nBugs be CNBC
