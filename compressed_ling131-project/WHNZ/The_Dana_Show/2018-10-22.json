One person at a time\nBack there last segment ... radio show if you like\nCall and ask a question in this last segment our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven [noise] um just sat next segment here I Want to share something with you I thought was rather interesting I founded article a that was stating\nThat it costs more to rent that it costs more to own that it does to read in every state in the union every city in the union everywhere and the reason why I thought that the article made sense to bring the brave you is because people always ask me what do you think the market to speak\nAnd you know the answer\nYou can look at dating and making predictions it might be picked or might not be ... but I can tell you this as long as it's cheaper to read that in his own investors are going to continue to buy\nAnd as they continue to buy rentals they're going to drive the price up and they're going to make lots and lots of money doing it they're also good to have lots of positive casual so I was looking at this if somebody has to buy living you know by housing\nWhat would they be willing to pay\nTo go from\nRenting a place to owning a comparable piece of housing and it really blew my mind when I look these numbers\nSo the ... is the key takeaways according to the article and then I'll come back and I speak more specifically about the markets rent\nIs just owning is more expensive everywhere access to all fifty ... days including Washington DC it costs more each month to own a home than to rent the median cost people pay nationwide to own a home is fifty four percent more than the median cost to rent one\nThe smallest differences still third is still a third more to all the state where the premium to own a home is the lowest is Florida\nWhere it costs a meeting of thirty three percent more to own the direct the states with the next lowest premiums are Colorado forty percent in Arizona forty one percent so you can see why you know it wouldn't make sense\nFor people even in these areas where you would think they can get housing\nYou know cheaper\nRight then they can't other places it still costs you at least thirty to forty percent more to own a house\nIt goes on and says in some states it costs voting is far eclipses across reading in New Jersey state with the highest ownership premium the median monthly cost of owning is nearly double that of renting Ninety three percent\nMore to own that it is to read this is just an unbelievable situation Ninety three percent more so it looks to me that there's no time soon that people are going to stop renting when you can go live for half the price\nOr fifty percent less than why would you want to take the risk of buying a house looks like we have a caller on the line Tom is this the Tom Ziegler\nHello anybody out there ... okay\nThought to have somebody on the line just got so let's go back to this was looking theories local areas you're a first local area a is Texas it cost fifty six percent more to own in Texas than direct\nFlowed is the lowest only thirty three percent premium in Arizona is forty one the second lowest Georgia is the third lowest\nMichigan is fifty two per se and a California sixty two percent\nSixty two percent there so it looks like a people are going to be renting for some time in the future appears at this point uh looks like there's phone lines lit up here is there anybody on the phone\n...\nSome odd lost connection with my engineer it looks like All right so moving on\nLast thing I Want to cover here today's this when you're looking at retiring what you're thinking most of the times how can I saved up enough money to be able to retire that's the concept right\nBut the reality is that what you really should be looking at is how can I learned
