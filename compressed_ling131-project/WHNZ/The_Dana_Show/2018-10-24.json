back with Adele wants a radio show this is Len Merlin today we'd been working on your financial freedom during our conversation with Peggy in Leo\nAnd how they've distinguish some of the timeless life lessons that will help us succeed\nUh from the ideas that we need to transform it into order to make our dreams and our desires of reality and so they grew up in entrepreneurial families I take it grew up with some some belief systems about I'm being debt free very common in in in some entrepreneurial families\nI'm Leo grew up with commercial real estate seeing the power of real estate but never really being taught the power of real estate\nAnd they both ended up in corporate jobs um and doing a variety of things Peggy made her way to the top and and retired pretty much when her her salary cap to Leo had his own business\nAt but didn't want to grow it any further it has to end at some point unless you just want to work in the business until the day you die unless you're going to create a huge team and then manage that team and it wasn't something Li I wanted to do\nAnd so now with all this life experience they found themselves and you know looking out on on she's of horizon in uncharted territory and cast about a little bit and we're really looking for something in during something where they can find their place in the world\nWhere they could use the things they that they had learned and transform\nAll of that and to a great retirement living the life they wanted which didn't include managing people\nWell ... working in a business right Leo I'm so tell us a little bit out\nAbout the results you've had you know you you joined lifestyles unlimited you've been members for a couple of years now and talk to us about how your life is now and what you're doing on a day to day basis as a result\nWhen I I Love it I mean we don't have to worry about fighting the traffic [laughter] um we uh you know we office out of our homes um\nWe just have kind of a piece about is um the thing about it we have learned a skill set on how to invest in apartment complexes and I never dreamed I always thought if you are going to be a passive investor in an apartment that you had to bathe or an institutional investors\nAre from the very wealthy family and we're not on a more small guys and actually we're in an apartment complex that uh you know almost like eight hundred unit I mean we're tiny Crispin attraction in the jail but we've been able to get into that deal and and really I mean\nI think about if one of us got sick couldn't work or maybe both of us\nThat the money that we're making the passive income keeps coming in so we don't have to worry about that because there's somebody leading the projects\nThe late investor which I think in the industry most firms column sponsor investors they're taking care of everything there they're finding the apartment complex they're managing it are finding somebody to manager for them so we just have a certain case about us than we know we're we're going and and really\nAs we get into details and we re fi\nUm that deal then that means that like let's say I'm just doing an arbitrary figure let's say we put a hundred thousand and we\nMight on a race I get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that deal but we're able to use the money from the re fi to get into more gills so our first year we were able to get into an\nApartment complex as well now we've had as many as like Seventeen complex is that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the ...\nAre are selling and so we right now we own sixteen because we've sold one and that was a situation where we did what they call it ten thirty one exchange and that's where\nYou had we had a complex and we tried it up\nAnd in this case we traded up to two more complex as well okay so let's say we put a hundred thousand in that first um\nApartment complex there's an investment well we had an equity gang of Seventy one percent so when we do that first complex and tried it up into two\nMore complex as we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest in we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there and we went from a complex to close to two hundred thousand too too complex which total about um\nA five hundred unit I think I did two hundred thousand we went from the complex with two hundred units too too complex that equal five hundred unit and so what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like\nIt it was on one of them they occupancy was eighty three percent\nAnd the late investors gotten that up to Ninety three percent and then on the other conflicts that we traded into we found out that oracle was moving within a half mile of our investment and they were bringing in five thousand employs so it's\nIt's just been great were so excited about it [noise]\nLeo and what is it done for you know how is it has it changed your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing that for\nAll and you know funny or ... just the other day\nI remember about it and it was oh west or their order and it was maybe about ... park after I'd gotten up at eight thirty instead of getting up but you know six o'clock Walmart\nAnd I'm a ... and um I thought you know what I Need to do your thoughts are are you know go get gas\nBut here I Am at nine thirty ten o'clock or ... such a beautiful ... gasoline I can do what I Want I Want a little more ... and I thought you know all about\nMy former certain town I go swimming swimming half a mile a I'm\nA ... a comeback and then you know and then there's a really\nThey offer coverage or ... or ... at least on the Internet you can look up the markets and stuff and um and then also what you'd walk then I'll watch going back and talk and call and we'll leave investor and finding out\nMore about ... ... and we are right you can do all the things that you love that you're not responsible for making those deals go down and that is wonderful thank you so much for joining me today\nToday she has come to an end fortunately you can find that do on the radio show on the air every day of the week and enjoy our podcasts at Dell on the

and\nBring his name was spelled wrong and it was sent to CNN and he's not he's a contributor to MSNBC so why were their stance on it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I'm just curious that doesn't ...\nWas he what was I Am I don't I just assumed that the bomber was here I don't know was\nThat\nThey tried to mail it and they couldn't do it so they got a career\nI don't know ...\nThat's what I'm really I'd just insane that's just you know the same so as soon as the president comes out we're going to go live with that he's going to remark on these packages um that had been sent\nBut I Am just I'm just\nMystified as I mean why would it have I don't know\nThe the the stance on it and then sent by a courier et cetera et cetera so the one that was sent to the Clintons apparently went to the I guess that one went through the United States Postal service I'm assuming [noise]\nUm I don't know how many were hand that's what I'm actually actively looking for right now I'm trying to see if that can I can find and we our own news department I'm trying to see if we can find out how many were actually were deliver hand courier and how many were or how many were delivered by courier and then how many were actually sent then but it is weird I'm\nWhat I said that the one that was sent to waters that was intercepted at the processing facility in Capitol heights\nThat\nGoes that was that was intercepted at the at the process at Capitol heights that handles mail going to the capital according to three congressional leadership sources that package was addressed to her office but never made it that far so that did\nGo through [noise] uh that did go through the United States Postal service but it was intercepted and so we'll see huh but uh\nThis very yeah and the congressional mall sorting facility has been cleared by the bomb squad there but the facility was locked down for hours as I understand that they moved the devices and then they\nTake it somewhere else they take it somewhere else or and then see if it can be I guess detonated or however you know they can they can they can do it there but just\nJust a very um this is just insane just as a stolen sane and apparently now yeah because we had there was one there was the first one I guess the first one was store us I think\nUh and that was hand delivered Thor is is that I I don't know if that I guess that might have been a career I don't think anybody has ever said whether or not it was a courier but it was still roses I'm ... I'm Still like why would you put dams on it\nIf I don't know why would you put stamps on it if it was sent by a career I don't know I thought it was ... I mean that what came here over there I can hear it on your\nWay around I just this is look again we've been doing this a long long time and I know you're not in the business speculating because that's not what the shows about but at least I can express that speculation on my part\nOkay you go ahead and you 'cause you're speculating over there\nAnd that's exactly what it is because obviously I don't have any proof and that's kind of how it's designed a up to this point because if you noticed this will take a while before we really get all the answers on how this all happened and whatever my guess is it'll take longer than a fix for midterms to get here\nAnd this is an effort on the left with the coordination of the media to do this and this this is how I Believe no\nI'm only basing this on my experience on how the left acts are politically okay so your idea\nSo this is this is basically my speculation but it's going to say yours but yes you're now you're supposed to be clear but I Can't help but think that not only was this coordinated which is what you believe but it was coordinated\nIn an effort to help the left as we enter into mid to less than two weeks out and they don't mind making a big hubbub about stuff like this they don't mind ruining the guy's life\nAre being appointed to the Supreme Court they don't mind doing any of that stuff that's how I feel about it and that's how I think this is\n... ...\nWell and so you have all these questions about Jews ... Jews was wider wider some book and she was everything looks dumb and ... because of exactly how what I'm Talking about\nI definitely understand that there is that\nThere is that sentiment out there\nI still think it's too just like I think it's too early to be able to say yes that is absolutely the ISIS flag on this\n... at least ... you know what I'm saying is I'm speculating and I'm being honest about the fact that I'm speculating though don't really have any tangible proof to back\nIt just tobacco what I'm saying but it's just too coincidental for me to just sit back and believe all of a sudden less than two weeks after midterms this is what happens like all of a sudden ... like they've been way more violent before if someone truly was going to retaliate against the Democrats would have been way before now\nOr in regards to how they've acted some twenties exchanges from Trump won the electric so to me this is\nToo convenient of time and I'm not swallowing the idea that it's anybody from the right\nDoing the students and I'm not I don't buy it well done well this ah\nYeah I [noise]\nSomeone else made the observation it was ... all of it seems like it was not meant to go
