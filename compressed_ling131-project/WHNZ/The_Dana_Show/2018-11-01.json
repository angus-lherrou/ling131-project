people can't just simply agree to disagree\n\nAnd and when he talks about a Muslim ban that's a priest that position it's entirely false argument there was never a Muslim ban\nThey all they did was say hey we're gonna have to take extra time to make sure people who are coming from these countries and it wasn't just if they wanted to ban Muslims they would have gone after and banned travel from Indonesia and et cetera and they didn't\nIt just amazes me that people out there can be so ridiculously stupid and so petty and so politically partisan that they will say that taking extra time to vet\nPeople who are coming over and\nFrom certain countries with which we do not have relationships to that or that do not have an infrastructure or a system in place where we can check data uh to say that it takes more time to do that so we're going it's going to take an extra three months longer\nThat's not a Muslim ban at the different because we have to double check things it's not a ban where
