R. V. now down near Brownsville what border patrol was saying there is that they control that whole area of the crossings the cartels do no one crosses in that area unless cartels know about it\nBecause they've got to get their feet it got to get their feet\nSo everybody that they they go through and they pay to see\nSo I Can't imagine\nHow this is going to work because it's like that and many other places at the southern border and I can't imagine how that's going to work he notes that they have to go through about twelve hundred miles of a through Mexico\nAnd a lot of that because they're on the western side geographically speaking you know a lot of that goes right through some of the heart most hardcore controlled\nA drug cartel the\n... or\nSend a lower cartel and some of the other cartels down there that um they're on the eastern side or sorry the western side that some really seriously cartel controlled places that they're going to be going through I Can't imagine them not\nBeing exploited I just can't imagine and by the way although\nThe less than that it's all women and children there are some women who looks suspiciously like I'm In\nA lot of them they look just like that in many many many many many men\nIt's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings are not mine last night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com at lifestyles unlimited workshop duck\nDo you have a great idea for a radio show\nBack now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire American one person at a month and he\nTo their homes and British show today we're talking about the seasons of your life and I'm Talking about how I was wrong I Believe that's probably only lived at age sixty five and here I Am sixty two um I've been thrown every kind of physical ailment fitness problem and\nInjuries that can be thrown at you and I'm Still kicking that feels better never felt before my life uh stop drinking alcohol about three weeks ago or just to prove that I could to everybody around me and\nDefinitely clarified my mind so now I'm back and I'm sitting here in this situation where I've gone through the seasons of my life to where each and every season I succeeded in becoming successful to the point where it seemed like it's time to stop\nRight okay I've done it I Can't see any further because you can't see all the way down the line guys you can only see as far as you can see when you get there you change your mind people come in here they are afraid to buy their first read house\nThen they buy three or four red house and all of a sudden they finally decided to want to buy small apartment complex then they want to buy a larger part because then they want to be a syndicator uh it just you grow and grow because you get you can't see yourself being all that being that wealthy being successful you just don't see it in yourself\nA but when you get there you can see further\nAnd that is each season as you re address who you believe yourself to be when you re address that that's when you grow while you were in the process of doing stuff\nAnd and mastering something I don't know really if that growth other than just that's starting to [noise] uh what would be the right word for it um\n[noise] your your your prospecting a skill set now somebody would call that growth um and I couldn't argue that point but it's in my mind is something slightly different and said okay we're going through the grind again we're doing it and get we're learning it were mastering it\nBut it's not really growth growth happens the day you get to the end of that and yeah we did it now what now you look outside of your circle of influence you look outside of your circle control in your life and you say what can I Do now where should I go now\nSo it's sixty five sixty two years of age I'm asking myself what should I Do now where should I go now by the way we went to a break I told you I Would tell you about these apartment complexes John and I bought these numbers are\nOr what does on my resume this is what John gave me um I assume they're accurate but they're not thoroughly off by a little bit whatever but we bought an apartment complex which is two hundred and fifty six units\nWe bought it for four million eight hundred thousand we sold it for seven million six hundred thousand and by the way there's more dollars that around and I'm up just to make it easy so you're talking about three million dollar again there are the next one we bought was two hundred and Seventy units we bought it for three million five we sold it for nine million or\nSo that's a five million nine hundred thousand dollar gain\nOn that apartment complex I realize these properties we're paying as cash flow for eight years also it wasn't like that's all we may that was what we made at the end after we had cash flow for eight years or we bought a three hundred and twenty unit apartment complex and you got to listen to this\nYou need to pay attention\nTo this one we bought it for two million five hundred thousand dollars we\nSold it for Thirteen million four hundred thousand dollars\nI think about that\nThat's a twelve million dollar game on one apartment complex plus the cash flow for eight years can you even imagine can you imagine the change in your life if you would have done this one property just one\nI look back now and I think to myself you know it's it's a shame that I did it with other people I let other people and and the reason I let other people and it was because it was a point in Iraq what it was hard to get loans nobody long so I said I can get loans I'm strong enough financially get them so I let other people getting a deal\n[noise] uh but can you imagine if I Would have done that deal just by myself made twelve million on one deal I mean if if you look at these deals here\nThe last one we did by the way we bought it for two point one million for a five point five million\nThat's three point four million dollar game so that's Fifteen sixteen\nMillion and\nA that one right there three to nine will be six that's twenty two million and a that were right there was four Seventy three\nThat's twenty five million dollars\nOf gains in eight years twenty five million in eight years and\nYou just got to see that for what it is and that was that's just for deals we did there were hundreds if not thousands of deals being done during that time and all these lifestyles members made all this money and\nYou're sitting here on the couch right now going well I don't know if I even got the guts to buy a house\nYou need to get the guts to buy a house\nNow here's the interesting point about all that season was over ... made a massive return it made me wealthier in eight years that I had been the previous ... years before that\nAnd there I was with nothing to do I didn't operate those properties John did all the operations island three other for the properties that Melissa ran I did nothing\nOr did radio shows four days a week on the radio that was it had nothing to do and so that's when I started drinking because my mind was idle it had nothing to do I had to comment down\nBut now stop drinking so it's not comedy more\nSo in the last six months I purchased for properties for apartment complexes that add up to be about eight hundred units\nAnd in addition to that I'm In right now trying to buy the property um and this one is going to be all by myself it's just a classy apartment complex and what's interesting on this deal is if it goes through is it I'll be making fifty thousand dollars a month or one property\nNow I don't tell you that to impress you but just to impress upon you that you can make that much of a change in your life it's something to get excited about wrap your arms around let's go make another fifty grand a month or we need that we don't really need [noise]\nAnd then you can think back and say well it's not really the money that is no it's washed out have a wonderful day we'll see you tomorrow [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThank you for your radio show every get

plan\nFor the bouncers shut up you can't see what I really want to say Cain with yell at me in hover over a dump button that you get the idea but I liked I liked that Pocahontas quote because that was pretty funny\nNow a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll out\nShowing that Trump is going to have some coat tails you remember the ... well maybe you don't uh this was just twenty ten bronco bomb had zero hotel\nI have and in fact I remember there were even some of the friendlier to him cable news talking heads that we're saying wow I mean there were other Democrat presidents previously at this point in their turn that had to wait longer or that had a greater ability\nTo affect down ticket races more so than Obama that a bomb that he had no hotels at all not at all\nAnd now in looking at it voter enthusiasm were concerns Republicans has been increasing which is exactly what Democrats needed to not happen\nMeasurable let me tell you something I Want to go early vote try to I had to leave on not to go back because the line was out the door I have never seen\nFor a midterm election a line that law\nOut the door guys\nAnd I was talking to a friend of mine who voted yesterday\nAnd she went maybe three or four hours after I tried going and she waited in line for like forty minutes language it was still really long line so this wasn't just you know one part when everyone is going to work this was all throughout the day\nRepublican enthusiasm is out of the park right now and it's increasing water dynamics coming into play the cabin all factors various tablet ...\nIt was an absolute catalyst for voter enthusiasm where it concerns Republican voters and and it\nHas not subsided it has not subsided\nA one poll showed ... well this this uh this Wall Street journal NBC poll showed Republicans a with a Fifteen point advantage where it concerns the economy [noise] never before have Republicans have had had they had such an advantage number wise or in any poll in the economy at this point\n[noise] that's pretty good\nNow this is where Democrats are struggling because what if they've been making this election on a Trump I think has accurately framed it insane it's jobs not mobbed plus Fifteen and that's just\nAn NBC Wall Street Journal poll when you go when you look at others that have been taken recently and when you look at night you know long ago and when you look at the president's job approval or economics or plain heavily into it heavily into it and I want to look a generic ballot because I think that's the closest a with a lot of stuff\nThe um so for generic ballot Democrats at one point had a certain point lead and it has dwindled down to single digits they are screwing themselves\n\n\nSo this is where we are at this moment and that's a pretty huge deal or is the Washington Post ABC poll\nHuge huge huge GOP enthusiasm\nA ton Bevan ... where he said where he was looking at the national generic ballot and if you want to follow one that is going to more accurate ... well and I there's a caviar to this if you want it to more accurate accurately reflect aware of the nation is heading look at the generic ballot\nBut he says he says there's four points here this is Tom ... who's a proprietor real clear politics in terms of mid term Democrats are plus nine actually today plus seven\nSo he had said there plus nine is actually plus seven in generic ballot now remember what I said that should be there used to be plus Thirteen this is all the cabin album\nIt's like a ripple effect me just to throw a stone go after those ripples to hit he also notes and house battle ground now listen to this the generic ballot is tied in battleground districts for house\nNow here's the third point the Trump approval rating is the highest of his presidency and it is one of the highest of presidents right now\nIn a couple that with is they're all of us in a pot and mix it together so what we're doing we're we're bacon were were were baking a cake number four as they just told you Republicans have the largest lead on the economy in the history of polling\nHe says these do not those do not sound like the component of a blue wave and he is correct now we're still what a couple of weeks out\nWait till that caravan started and wait until people start polling about that and people start looking at immigration what is\nActually I don't I don't need to ask you want me to tell you what the number one issue was for moderate Democrats voting for Trump on election night let me just latest on an election night when I sat and I because I was at Fox election night November twenty sixteen and I got to look at all the raw data polls taken across the country\nThey do they do three sweets and I was looking at the raw data and it breaks it down to a number of\nPeople this is none of this is it's all raw data and in places like I'm trying to remember the top three um I Know a Pennsylvania a Pennsylvania Missouri\nI'm In Pennsylvania Missouri I think Indiana Wisconsin and there were a couple of other states that normally Republicans Missouri Republicans haven't struggled in that you get the idea but for a moderate Democrat and I made note of this I'm On air at the time\nTrump was not converting Republicans he was attracting people who describe themselves as moderate Democrat\nWith the one issue would you like to know what that is immigration the second issue job flash economy\nHow do you think these people are going to poll when the Caribbean heads\nDemocrats think they're going to get this optics of this mob of people standing at the fence and a militarized border and Trump's going to look bad\nBut you know what really is gonna how that's going to look Trump is going to turn around and tell Democrats what should we do do you believe in open borders\nThey're playing a very dangerous game but it is not going to work out well for them [noise] and it's not going to and this was organized I Believe it was after everything up and saying I don't know how you cannot [noise]\nSo as we move on here we have Florida Man later on in this hour additionally more B L E W wave even Bernie Sanders is saying is not going
